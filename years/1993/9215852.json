This is                                             true, for example, with one of the                                              simplest compounds, GaAs, where a                                               hierarchy of relaxation times                                                   exists.  At this time there is                                                  remarkably little known about the                                               interplay of dynamics associated                                                with carrier heating effects and                                                transverse effects together.                                                    Having targeting those systems with                                             a quasi-independent subsystem of                                                energy levels we shall continue our                                             studies of fast processes taking                                                into account electron, hole and                                                 lattice temperatures, in less                                                   restrictive regimes of the plane-                                               wave model.                                                                     We have dynamical equations of                                                  motions that describe the evolution                                             of the semiconductor laser output                                               beam and its characteristics                                                    transverse profile; however, the                                                numerical development is, to date,                                              incomplete and is included as a                                                 first phase of this program.                                                    Experience and sensitivity to the                                               difficulties in modeling transverse                                             effects in dynamical systems is                                                 established in our group and can be                                             used effectively to develop                                                     appropriate numerical integration                                               schemes for this problem. Computer                                              methods are on line to analyze                                                  various nonlinear phenomena                                                     associated with spatio-temporal                                                 aperiodic or periodic fields.                                                   We will conduct a comprehensive                                                 research program on the stability                                               and dynamics of semiconductor                                                   lasers distinguished by their                                                   quasi-independent subsystem of                                                  energy levels.  The role that new                                               degrees of freedom play in the                                                  generation of complex waveforms                                                 including, for example, hysteresis                                              or bistable operation and linewidth                                             of the laser will be addressed.                                                 The investigations will lead to the                                             development of novel, compact laser                                             sources with wide applicability in                                              optical devices and systems.                                                    Experimental programs designed to                                               accommodate this timescale have                                                 only recently become possible                                                   through the development of                                                      femtosecond lasers.  We are                                                     exploring possibilities of                                                      demonstrating these effects with an                                             external group.",
