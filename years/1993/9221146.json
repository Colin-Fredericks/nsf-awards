 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical investigations will be done on relaxation of polymer                chains and liquid crystals in random environments, and on the time              evolution of morphologies in polymer blends and solutions with                  liquid crystals.  The full mathematical expressions will be derived             to describe the nonuniversal features of (a) dynamics of polymer                chains trapped in gels and controlled pore glasses; (b) phase                   separation kinetics leading to controlled pattern formation in                  polymer blends; and, (c) formation of polymer-dispersed-liquid-                 crystal morphologies by phase separation kinetics and the                       relaxation of liquid crystalline domains in these morphologies.                 The theoretical work complements many experimental investigations               which are being actively pursued in many laboratories worldwide.                The results of the proposed work are also relevant to the                       technologically important areas of separation techniques such as                chromatography, preparation and processing of molecular composites,             and switchable windows and light shutters for optical processing.               %%%                                                                             This theoretical work in polymer science will use analytical and                computational techniques to address a number of problems of current             fundamental and applied interest.  Primary focus will be on the                 behavior of polymer chains and liquid crystals in disordered                    environments and on the patterns formed when polymer mixtures are               combined with liquid crystals.",
