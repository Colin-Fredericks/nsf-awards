 "awd_abstract_narration": "To date, science educators have not studied what students believe               about the world, beliefs rooted and nurtured in students' socio-                cultural environments.  If one were speaking of a non-Western,                  developing nation, one would speak of students' traditional culture             in contrast to the culture of science.  Americans, on the other                 hand, assume that science is a natural part of American students'               culture.  However, there is widespread disinterest in science.                  Also, American society is increasingly pluralistc, and there are                several cultural subgroups traditionally under represented in                   science.  A new approach is for American science educators to                   consider the possibility that science is a second culture                       experience for many students.  Traditionally, the study of culture              is left to the cultural anthropologists.  However, in recent years              scholars in several disciplines have undertaken cultural studies in             which they investigate the validity of cultural assumptions in                  their fields.  Similarly, cultural studies in science education can             contribute significantly to our understanding of the barriers to                effective science education.  We suggest that it is important for               science educators to understand the fundamental, culturally based               beliefs about the world that students bring to class, and how these             beliefs are supported by students' cultures; because, science                   education is successful only to the extent that science can find a              niche in the cognitive and socio-cultural milieu of students.                   Thus, the  purpose of the proposed research is to gain an                       understanding of high school students' fundamental beliefs about                the world, and how their personal, cultural environments foster and             support those beliefs.  The methodology is ethnographic, involving              the extensive interviewing of students.",
