 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304844  Henry    The enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), which catalyses the  reversible hydration/dehydration of CO2 has been known for many  years to function in the systemic transport and excretion of CO2.  Recent work, however, has shown that the limiting step in   CO2  transport occurs at the cellular level (i.e., diffusion across  individual membranes).  CA, localized on the \"upstream\" side of  the membrane, facilitates CO2 transport via the catalyzed  dehydration of HCO3-, maintaining a high PCO2 in the boundary  layer and thus driving CO2 diffusion across the membrane.  Therefore, Ca within metabolically active tissue (i.e., muscle)  is important for the initial step of CO2 transport form the  intracellular compartment to the blood.  While this process has  been studied in mammalian systems, there is a complete void of  information for evolutionarily more primitive organisms.  This is  a major gap in our understanding of both the evolution of CO2  transport and the evolution of CA function, because metabolically  active, contractile tissue (muscle) evolved long before the  development of complex respiratory systems.  It is quite  plausible, therefore, for Ca to have had its evolutionary origins  in metabolically active tissue for the purpose of cellular CO2  elimination.  This hypothesis will be tested in a number of  invertebrate species using a combination of biochemical,  physiological, pharmacological, and histochemical techniques.  If  widespread support for this idea is found among the  invertebrates, it will form the basis for a potentially unifying  hypothesis for the origin of cellular CA function and the near  universal distribution of the enzyme in metabolically active  tissues.  These experiments will also form the database upon  which future experiments on even more primitive organisms will be  designed and performed.  ***",
