 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307549  Larter  Raima Larter and Alexander Scheeline are supported by a grant  from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to  study the detailed chemical kinetics of the peroxidase-oxidase  chemical oscillator.  Free-radical behavior, photochemical  effects, the role of co-factors, degradation of peroxidase  during reaction, reactivity of NAD dimer produced as a reaction  intermediate, and the consequences of acid-catalyzed  anomerization of NADH will be studied.  Two goals to be  addressed are: 1) to sufficiently characterize the chemical  dynamics so that realistic models for the reaction can be  devised; and 2) to better understand the chemistry of the  constiuent species.  Measurement tools to be employed include  oxidimetry, potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry,  spectrophotometry, and electron paramagnetic resonance.  %%%  It has been suggested that chemical oscillations may provide  the underlying rhythm for all types of biological oscillaitons  which have been observed to occur at all levels of the  metabolic process.  Many of these oscillations have been  explained in chemical terms.  The peroxidase-oxidase reaction  which is being studied by Larter and Scheeline is a very useful  model reaction of the biochemical processes which might  underlie rhythmic phenomena in living systems.  One of the  objectives of their research is to resolve the question whether  it is the natural enzyme kinetics or the unnatural features of  the in laboratory experiments which lead to the observed  nonlinear dynamic behavior which are the source of the  oscillations in this system.  ***",
