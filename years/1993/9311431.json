 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for the partial support of the 11th International                 Symposium on the Unification of Analytic, Computational and                     Experimental Solution Methodologies (UACEM) to be held during                   August 18-20, 1993 at the Sheraton-Tara Conference Center in                    Danvers, MA.  The Symposium will provide a forum for the                        presentation of state-of-the-art research findings in                           micromechanics of materials to an audience of leading active                    workers in that field.  This Symposium is the eleventh in a series              of such Symposia that started in 1972.  They are held once every                two years at different locations, and are attended by eminent                   researchers from all over the world.  The gathering of these                    individuals at the Symposium will allow for personal interactions               that will provide exchange of information and ideas, and the                    possible formation of new research groups, in a variety of areas in             micromechanics of materials.  Proceedings of the Symposium will be              published and will thus be available as an archival resource for                future use by the engineering, science and technology communities.",
