 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the              camp facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of                 Greenland as part of the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order              to investigate how atmospheric trace elements are deposited on the              ice and what kind of changes they undergo as they are being                     incorporated into the ice.  An understanding of such processes is               necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data                 that can be recovered from ice cores.  While significant progress               has been made recently in extracting and analyzing ice cores,                   progress in understanding the air to snow transfer process for                  reactive chemical species has lagged behind.                                                                                                                    The goal of this project is to determine the vertical fluxes of                 reactive nitrogen oxides, water vapor, sensible heat, and momentum.             through a field measurement program in 1994 and 1995.  A specific               objective is to define the transfer function between reactive                   nitrogen oxide concentrations in the atmosphere and in the snow,                thus allowing the interpretation of the nitrate record in ice cores             in terms of changes in atmospheric photochemistry and in the                    biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen.  Other objectives are to                    determine the environmental variables regulating the exchange of                reactive nitrogen oxides between air and snow, to assess the                    relative importance of dr and wet deposition and reevaporation in               controlling the nitrate accumulation, and to analyze the                        meteorological conditions controlling the supply of nitrates to the             ice sheet.",
