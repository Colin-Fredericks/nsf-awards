Ubiquitinated  proteins can then be targeted for proteolysis, or ubiquitination  can result in a stable post-translational modification.  Therefore  the ubiquitin pathway represents an important pathway regulating  protein levels and their activities in eukaryotes.  The isolation  and identification of substrates for ubiquitin modification are  essential for an understanding of the regulation and specificity of  this pathway.  While the number of ubiquitinated proteins appears  to be large based on immunoblot studies, the number of identified  in vivo substrates is small.  In higher plants, only one endogenous  plant protein has been identified as a substrate of the ubiquitin  pathway.  Two different approaches towards identifying and  isolating higher plant in vivo substrates using Arabidopsis  thaliana as the model system are outlined in detail and will be  performed.  Identification of additional in vivo substrates will  further our knowledge of the roles of the ub pathway in higher  plants and contribute toward an understanding of the regulation of  ubiquitination.  Two components of the ubiquitin pathway that are  relatively uncharacterized in higher plants and are important for  an understanding of the regulation of the pathway will be cloned.   Their isoation will also contribute toward a long term goal of  producing an in vitro conjugation system with specificity identical  to that found in vivo.    Ubiquitin is encoded by a multi-gene family in higher plants.  All  members of the ubiquitin gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana have  been isolated.  The roles of multiple ubiquitin genes will be  addressed through studies of the environmental and developmental  changes in ubiquitin gene expression.  In addition, the expression  of ubiquitin genes in other ecotypes will be determined to assist  in the identification of functionally important genes.  A   combination of these two approaches will increase our understanding  of the ubiquitin pathway in higher plant metabolism, development,  and physiology, and define its role in mediating plant responses to  environmental stresses.  ***",
