 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the property rights                  system and land use on the Brazilian frontier.  The Brazilian                   frontier, especially the Amazon region, has been the focus of                   world-wide attention owing to concerns about the rapid                          destruction of the rainforest and the loss of soil nutrients when               these lands are converted to agriculture.  The Amazon represents                the largest remaining tropical rainforest stand in the world, and               its loss or severe depletion could have serious effects on global               warming and biodiversity.  Further, Brazil is one of the largest                and most influential developing countries and it faces many of                  the problems endemic in development--rapid population growth and                corresponding pressures to raise standards of living, for land                  reform, and at the same time for protection of the environment.                                                                                                 This project will entail the assembly and analysis of land tenure               policies in Brazil beginning the 1940's.  These policies will                   then be compared to land tenure and the expansion of the U.S.                   frontier during the 1800's.  The project will construct measures                of land tenure uncertainty and analyze these tenure conditions in               four Brazilian states from 1940-1980, and six Amazon states from                1960-1985 using the Brazilian Agricultural census.  Particular                  attention will be paid to the effects of land tenure uncertainty                on agricultural investment, the use of fertilizers, the value of                permanent structures, and the extent to which permanent crops                   were grown.",
