 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collingwood will investigate the relationship between the                  singularity theory of Harish-Chandra modules and the matrix                     coefficient asymptotics of Harish-Chandra modules.  He will also                study several problems related to qualitative features such as                  the weight filtration of any degenerate series or generalized                   principal series representation.  This builds upon recent work of               Collingwood which carries over the highest weight module work of                Enright and Shelton to a more general Harish-Chandra module                     setting.                                                                             The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                    theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                        mechanics and elementary particle physics.",
