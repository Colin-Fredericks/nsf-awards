 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new Ph.D. graduate program in Atmospheric Chemistry is in                the process of being developed in the Department of Chemistry and               Biochemistry at the University of Colorado and will be implemented              beginning in the Fall Semester, 1992.  The department is already                strong in the field of atmospheric chemistry, and with recent new               faculty hires and enhanced collaboration with the National Center               for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory and               the world center for the training of atmospheric chemists.                      Problems in the atmosphere arising from human influences include                stratospheric ozone depletion, acid precipitation, photochemical                smog, and a possible global warming.  Solutions to these problems               will require a new generation of scientists trained in the newly                emerging, interdisciplinary field of atmospheric chemistry.  The                traditional disciplinary approach is inadequate for training these              scientists needed for critical input to decision and policy making              for the future.  A graduate program, which includes new graduate                courses, has been designed by the department faculty with the help              of six leading atmospheric chemists as external advisors.  This                 program will provide course work and research opportunities in such             areas as biogeochemical cycles, biosphere-atmosphere interactions,              laboratory kinetics and photochemistry, atmospheric modeling, and               the development of new remote sensing and field analytical                      techniques.",
