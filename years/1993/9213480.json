Synthesis of Marine Natural Products and Reaction                               Development.                                                                                                                                                6.  Chromium (VI) Interactions With DNA and Thoils.                                                                                                             %%%                                                                             Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to th chemists for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interations between                     molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.  The results from these NMR studies are                      useful in areas such as polymers and catlysis, and in biology.",
