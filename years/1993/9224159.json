 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project will develop and test one interactive                        multimedia courseware module on social, ethical, and professional               issues that arise from computing technology, and develop detailed               plans for two other modules.  The first module will highlight the               history of computer ethics, consider how the meaning of the term                has changed over the last two decades and compare this field with               other branches of applied ethics, explore important concepts such               as privacy and responsibility, and include scenarios that add                   interest and reality to the concepts.  The two planned stacks                   will focus on issues of professional responsibility, and issues                 of access and equity for persons with disabilities.  Multimedia                 \"HyperCard stacks\" combine video clips, sound bites, graphics and               text.  The first stack will be tested by classroom teachers and                 by students in interactive independent study.  It will be                       disseminated at cost to universities and scholars that request                  it; and demonstrations will be presented at national conferences                and workshops.  The stack will serve as a prototype for high                    quality, cost effective, state-of-the-art curriculum materials on               computing and human values.",
