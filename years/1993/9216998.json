 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Gordon Research Conference entitled: \"Enzyme Organization and                 Cell Function\" will be held from January 18-22, 1993, in Oxnard,                California.  This will be the fourth such conference, the first one             being held in 1987 under the old title: \"Organization of Metabolic              Sequences.\"  There will be 23 invited speakers, all of whom are at              the cutting edge of some aspect of studies on cellular organization             and metabolism.  Interactions between enzymes in metabolic                      pathways, and structural aspects of macromolecular protein systems              will be discussed, which provide us with a better understanding                 about functional organization inside the cell cytoplasm.  Composite             understanding about this aspect of cellular organization depends                upon research from an array of different areas.  The conference                 brings together scientists specializing in disciplines such as                  enzymology, cell biology, molecular biology, physical chemistry,                protein chemistry, and genetics, as well as researchers from all                areas of metabolism including carbohydrate, amino acid, lipid and               nucleic acid metabolism, protein synthesis and processing,                      organelle biogenesis, cell motility, and protein folding.  The                  conference will provide a unique forum in which research scientists             can interact professionally, exchange ideas, and gain information,              which will benefit their individual research programs.                          %%%                                                                             The interaction between cytoplasmic enzymes free in the cell                    cytoplasm or those in structured protein complexes will be                      discussed to gain a better understanding of how the living cell                 coordinates between catabolic and biosynthetic activities.  Such                organizational control is essential for the survival of every cell.",
