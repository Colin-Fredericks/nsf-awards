 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, supported by the Physical Chemistry Program of                 the Chemistry Division, Profs. M. Alexander of the University                   of Maryland and P. Dagdigian of Johns Hopkins University will                   pursue a joint theoretical-experimental effort to determine how                 molecular collisions and photodissociations are affected by                     molecular energy states.  In particular, since molecular energy                 states are rarely the idealized, independent states used in the                 initial stages of theoretical formulations, the interactions                    between them play a signifant role in determining the details                   of the collision and photodissociation processes.  Several                      prototypical free radical molecules, including di-and triatomic                 monohydride species, will be investigated.  The theoretical                     portion of this project (M. Alexander) involves the development                 of new methods to elucidate the mechanism of molecular                          collisions and photodissociation.  The experimental portion (P.                 Dagdigian) involves the determination of cross sections for                     inelastic collisions in which molecules undergo energy changes.                  Also to be determined are the distributions over the internal                  energy states of a molecular fragment that results from the                     photodissociation of the parent molecule.                                       %%%                                                                             Molecular energies are considered in the main to be the result                  of translational, rotational, vibrational  and electronic                       motions, with the latter being made up of orbital and spin                      contributions.  This separation of the total energy into                        independent contributions is, however, only an idealized first                  step in the conceptual model of molecular structure and                         dynamics, and allowing for interactions between these motions                   is necessary in order to account for the observed molecular                     properties.  Photodissociations and collisions between                          molecules are also affected by these interactions, which are                    particularly evident in open shell (free radical) molecules.                    The investigations to be carried out in this research will                      contribute to the understanding of these processes and will                     assist in establishing the limits of validity of the                            fundamental Born-Oppenheimer approximation to open shell                        molecules.",
