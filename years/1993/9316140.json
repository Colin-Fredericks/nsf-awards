 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316140  Maylie-Pfenninger    This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research.  The developing  acrosome of mouse and guinea pig spermatids contains glycoproteins  phosphorylated on complex N-linked oligosaccharides.  Preliminary  results have ruled out mannose-6-phosphate, as well as several  other possible 6-phospho- monosaccharides, as the phosphorylated  residue.  The nature of the phosphorylated substituent is thus  unknown.  The phosphorylation itself has been shown to be  transient during the transit of the acrosomal proteins to the  acrosome, with a half-time of approximately one hour.  These and  other preliminary results suggest that the phosphorylation is  involved in a function important for the biosynthetic pathway of  acrosomal glycoproteins, and may be involved in targetting of the  proteins to the acrosome.  The goal of this project is to identify  the specific site on the oligosaccharide which is phosphorylated.   This will be done by 1H-NMR analysis of purified phosphorylated  oligosaccharides, followed by permethylation analysis.  The results  will provide novel insights into oligosaccharide biochemistry, and  will set the stage for determining the function of this novel  phosphorylated sugar.  %%%  This laboratory has made a novel preliminary finding, that there is  an unusual and as-yet unidentified biochemical alteration of  proteins destined for incorporation into the acrosomes of mammalian  developing sperm.  The goal of the project is to use state-of-the-  art techniques to identify this biochemical alteration. Such  identification is a necessary prerequisite to studying the  significance of the alteration with respect to sperm development.   This is a \"high risk, high reward\" pilot study, well suited to the  Small Grants for Exploratory Research program.  ***",
