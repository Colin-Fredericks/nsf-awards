 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to determine how                 much nitrogen is fixed per unit land per year by two species of                 subterranean termites in coastal Virginia.  Field and laboratory                studies will be conducted over a three-year period to examine                   rates of nitrogen fixation as a function of temperature and wood                nitrogen content and acidity.  Seasonal changes in the relative                 proportions of workers, soldiers and immatures in termite nests                 will be examined along with nest density in order to determine                  the annual nitrogen contributions by termites to coastal forests.               %%%                                                                             Nitrogen fixation by termite bacteria may be an important                       source of nutrients in forests that are deficient in available                  nitrogen.  The bacteria resident in the hindguts of termites can                fix atmospheric molecular nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that                 are incorporated into termite tissues.  When termites die or                    excrete nitrogenous wastes, free-living bacteria metabolize the                 organic nitrogen into ammonia and nitrates which are then                       available as nutrients for plants.  However, the quantity of                    nitrogen fixed by termite bacteria is unknown, because many                     factors influence rates of nitrogen fixation.  These factors                    include temperature and the nitrogen content and acidity of the                 wood eaten by termites.  Also, different species of termites and                different termites castes such as workers, soldiers and immatures               vary in the amount of nitrogen they fix.",
