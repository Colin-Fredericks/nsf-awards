It is  used in the introductory-level courses of Introductory Geology,  Introductory Oceanography, and Environmental Science; in the  upper level courses of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy,  Invertebrate Paleontology, Glacial and Quaternary Geology,  Hydrogeology, Seminar in Environmental Geology, and Seminar on  Tropical Carbonate Geology; for approximately two undergraduate  research projects each year; and for the Lawrence Summerscience  Program, a two-week intensive program for high-school juniors.  Currently, most of the hands-on activities already incorporated  into courses are also the subjects of independent undergraduate  research.  The program is an example of how field and  laboratory-based instruction and undergraduate research can be  integrated, focused on the study of local Quaternary geology,  and implemented using relatively inexpensive and versatile  equipment.           ***",
