 "awd_abstract_narration": "An ultracentrifuge will be acquired to allow new laboratory                     experiences for undergraduates in molecular biology using                       isolated DNA, viral and plasmid vectors, and isolated                           organelles. The hands-on experience in molecular biology will                   be integrated into introductory and advanced courses in the                     biology program and will enhance laboratory experiences in new                  interdisciplinary courses. Students will benefit from the                       introduction of this technology into numerous courses and                       student research programs that develop critical thinking                        skills. The major use of this instrument will be to introduce                   students to the ultracentrifuge as a tool for the isolation of                  macromolecules or organelles. The students will become familiar                 with the exploitation of the physical characteristics of                        macromolecules that are used to isolate those molecules.                        Students will also acquire the skills to manipulate                             macromolecules genetically. By combining chemical and genetic                   techniques students will appreciate the usefulness of multiple                  approaches to the dissection of biological processes.",
