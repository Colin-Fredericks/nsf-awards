The  study is prompted by the observation that the party systems of  several of these countries have experienced substantial partisan  dealignment since the mid 1960's.  Such dealignments, together with  important social-structural and cultural changes and the emergence  of new issue agendas, seemingly create conditions propitious for  the development of new parties and associated party system  realignments.  To date, however, there have been only very limited  changes in the basic contours of existing party systems, and new  parties that have emerged have enjoyed only very limited and often,  short-lived success.  The project in study factors which facilitate  and inhibit the emergence of new parties and party system  realignment through a coordinated combination of cross-sectional  and panel surveys of the Canadian electorate and members, through  a coordinated combination of cross-sectional and panel surveys of  the Canadian electorate and members, activists and local officials  in Canada's new Reform Party.  The surveys will be conducted over  the 1993-1995 period, and a book-length manuscript on the research  is expected to be completed in 1996.  ***",
