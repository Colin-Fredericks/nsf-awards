 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Hungary Joint Fund research project on \"Pollutant                     Photodegradation Mediated by Clay-Organocomplex-Incorporated                    Semiconductors\" will be conducted by Dr. Imre Dekany of Attila                  Jozsef University and Dr. Janos H. Fendler of Syracuse University.              Semiconductors mediate the efficient photodegradation of                        pollutants.  Well-characterized alkylammonium and alkylpyridinium               surfactant-modified clays (clay organocomplexes), developed by the              Hungarian investigators, will be used as hosts for the                          semiconductors.  Judicious selection of experimental conditions will            allow the adjustment of interspace distances between the surfactant             molecules and the preparation of size-quantized colloidal                       semiconductor particles therein.  In this project, size-quantized               semiconductor particles will be in situ generated and used to                   mediate the photodegradation of pollutants.  Size- and                          dimensionality-controlled semiconductor particles will be generated             in the interlamellar spaces of the clay organocomplex particles.                Absorption spectroscopy, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction,                and electrochemical measurements will be used to characterize the               structures of the systems constructed.  Fundamental information on              photoelectron transfer will be obtained by steady-state and                     picosecond time-resolved spectroscopy.  The obtained knowledge                  will, in turn, be used to optimize pollutant photodestruction.  The             project could point the way to an economically tractable approach               to useful methods of environmental cleanup.                                                                                                                     This research in materials theory fulfills the US-Hungary Joint                 Fund's objective of advancing science by enabling leading experts               in the United States and Hungary to combine complementary talents               and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              competence.",
