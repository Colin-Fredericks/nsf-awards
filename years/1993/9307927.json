 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is concerned with the study of the noncommutative               differential geometry of deformations of commutative rings.  The                principal investigator has proved the algebraic index theorem for               any deformation of the ring of functions on a symplectic                        manifold.  The main technical tool was the theory of operations                 in cyclic homology.  He plans to develop this construction                      further, which would yield the algebraic index theorem for                      families and foliations, the algebraic analogue of the                          Connes-Moscovici index theorem for an equivariant quantization of               a ring of functions, and index and character formula                            representations of quantizations of commutative rings.  These                   methods are also expected to yield various generalizations of the               Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem.                                                   This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                 makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
