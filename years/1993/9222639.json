 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of social threat and social control, examining             the effects of threats such as crime and economic problems on the               growth or decline of bureaucracies whose public mission is to deal              with them.  The investigator will assemble a data set with city as              the unit of analysis, drawing upon official statistics over the                 span 1960-1990, to allow him to test theoretical propositions drawn             from conflict theory.  Three kinds of threat will be studied                    (criminal, racial, economic), along with several measures of the                activity of control bureaucracies (police size, imprisonment rates,             mental hospital admissions, welfare payments).                                                                                                                       This project will integrate several fields and contribute to               criminology, race relations, economics of social problems, and                  policy studies.  It will increase our understanding of the                      processes of social conflict that shape public institutions and                 their response to perceived threats.",
