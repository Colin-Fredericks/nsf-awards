 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304369  Green    This proposal addresses the mechanisms for expression of pattern in  the plant shoot. The aim is to explain a) the origin of pattern, b)  its propagation, i.e. phyllotaxis, and c) change of pattern as in  flower mutants. Organ pattern is first seen in the arrangement of  folds or bumps in the surface layer of the apical dome, the tunica.  Current theory usually postulates that a chemical pre-pattern is  first generated by diffusing inhibitors or morphogens and then  converted, congruently, to solid tissue configuration. It is  proposed here to further pursue an alternate hypothesis where  pattern is directly generated in the tissue itself by physical laws  of the solid state, i.e. buckling theory based on the von Karman  equations. The research plan is as follows: Selected developmental  progressions will be characterized by a non-destructive SEM replica  technique to determine the precise course of tissue folding and  cell growth in vivo. Parallel computer simulations will determine  the extent to which buckling theory can account for the observed  progressions. Dr. Green will study vegetative shoots and  morphological floral mutants (concentric and blind in Petunia).  Further testing involves responses to physical constraint and the  local application of morphogenetically active compounds. This  research will clarify the biophysics of morphogenesis and its  modulation by diffusing agents.  ***",
