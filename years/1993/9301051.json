 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301051  Lyon  Global MHD simulations of the interaction of the solar wind with  the magnetosphere and ionosphere will be performed as an aid to  interpreting and analyzing low altitude and ground-based  observations done in conjunction with the GEM program.  The  calculations will use solar wind data for the actual period of the  GEM observing campaigns to produce as accurate a representation of  mangetospheric conditions as possible for those times.  The results  from the simulations will be mapped from the mangetopause and cusp  regions to near earth space and to the ionosphere where they may be  compared with observations.  The primary quanities to be mapped  will be magnetic field topology, field-aligned currents and  particle distributions.  Experience and theoretical considerations  show that these mappings can provide useful information on the  scales seen in the ground-based radar observations, for example,  even though the calculation grid is relatively more coarse.  The  magnetic field model used for this mapping is determined self-  consistently from the MHD solution for the magnetosphere.  This  model will also be used to map the ionospheric observations back  out to the region of the magnetopause, and the field models will be  provided to GEM participants.  These comparison will lead to a  better appreciation for the strengths and weaknesses of the global  MHD model and what additional physics must be included.    Studies will also be conducted with varying solar wind input data  to cover a wide range of possible conditions.  These simulations  will then be used to provide a parametric representation of the  normal field and the tangential velocity at the magnetopause.  This  representation is an important input to a modular magnetospheric  circulation model.  The time varying solar wind cases used for the  observational campaigns will also be analyzed in this fashion to  find how much of the actual magnetopause tangential eletric field  can be prescribed by a static model.   ***",
