 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310892  Edwards  A central focus for research about the interactions of science,  technology and social institutions concerns the roles of science  and social movements in shaping the conceptual construction, public  debate, and political resolution of social problems.  This  Professional Development Fellowship will provide an investigator  who specializes in this research area with a year of training and  research in atmospheric science, particularly climatology and  climate modeling.  It is designed to help him answer two questions:   how atmospheric scientists are shaping social response and  responsiveness to global environmental problems, and how,  reciprocally, the political debates around these problems are  shaping atmospheric science. The training program includes  coursework, tutorial instruction and literature review under the  guidance of host scientists.  Research plans include attending  conferences, undertaking laboratory visits and interviews,  observation of the appearances of atmospheric scientists before  public agencies and NGOs, and interviews with representatives of  these groups.  The investigator will also research and analyze  three important cases of scientific models influencing global  environmental policy debates:  (a) the 1972 Limits to Growth study  of the Club of Rome, (b) the 1987 Montreal Protocol and its several  successor agreements, and (c) the 1992 UNCED Rio global  environmental summit.  The training and research provide the basis  for future comparative studies of other similar social phenomena.   Since this is a training grant, publications are not the primary  goal.  Nonetheless, the investigator plans to complete a number of  articles and possibly develop some joint publications with his  hosts.  ***",
