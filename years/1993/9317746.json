This funding is being provided by the Advanced Research  Projects Agency (ARPA) to support a research activity to design,  build, and test a prototype high-speed Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN)  grinding machine for the rolling element bearing industry.    This project will establish a teaming arrangement with a bearing  manufacturing company, a machine tool builder, and Center's  researchers to conduct the following tasks:  1) modelling of the  high-speed CBN grinding process; 2) development of high-speed wheel  and dressing capability; 3) development of sensors and adaptive  control techniques; and 4) design, build, and test the new  developed CBN grinding machine.    This research project builds on the research results in CBN  grinding technology which the Center developed in the past three  years.  The P.I. and his colleagues have demonstrated competency in  their research performance in this area and have the knowledge and  facilities to conduct this research project.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Connecticut be  awarded $3,325,000 for three years with funds provided by the ARPA.",
