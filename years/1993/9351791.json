 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fuzzy logic is a very rapidly growing technical domain. In an                   effort to keep our undergraduate students current in this                       application field, Milwaukee School of Engineering is                           developing a laboratory for the study of fuzzy logic and its                    applications. This laboratory will be used primarily for the                    course Fuzzy Sets and Applications and in senior projects for                   electrical, computer, and biomedical engineering. To a lesser                   extent this laboratory will also support courses in virtually                   every other major at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. The                   equipment and software required should be capable of supporting                 a broad range of fuzzy logic applications such as control,                      information retrieval, semantic analysis, robotics, decision                    systems, and image recognition. The major equipment requested                   consists of a graphical shell for fuzzy computations, expert                    systems shell, computation acceleration boards, and                             developmental cross-compilers as well as the platform on which                  to run the applications. Through appropriate use of these tools                 students should be capable of studying the semantic nature of                   fuzzy sets, the use of expert and decision-making systems, the                  development of control systems using common sense knowledge,                    and the application of fuzzy logic to image recognition,                        robotics, and information retrieval. Significant impact from                    this laboratory is expected curriculum-wide as fuzzy logic and                  its applications continue to pervade industry.",
