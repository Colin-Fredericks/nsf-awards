 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351652  Tuchman  The Department of Biology has a diverse undergraduate  curriculum with the majority of the resources directed towards  courses and undergraduate research in health-related subjects  (e.g. Histology, Vertebrate Physiology, Microbiology, and  Neurobiology). We will enhance laboratories in limnology and  plant physiology using a configuration of microscopes and video  systems that will allow students to study plant cellular  process and the aquatic environment. The new laboratories will  use a compound microscope that magnifies within the range of  40X to 1670X, including feature for bright field, phase  contrast, Nomarski and fluorescence, and a stereoscope that  magnifies from 3.8X to 128X including fiber optics. Attached to  the microscope stages are video cameras.  Each unit also has  photographic capabilities. In addition, a video cassette  recorder with time-lapse capabilities will be used to record  responses to stimuli, behavior, and development. Thus, this  equipment will enhance the Department of Biology's ability to  provide a current state-of-the-art hands-on education to  undergraduate majors interested in pursuing non-health related  disciplines.  ***",
