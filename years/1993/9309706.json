 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CE design approach requires the interaction of all                     engineering, production, and manufacturing groups simultaneously                so as to reduce cost and bring higher quality products to market                faster.  One dilemma that makes CE difficult to practically                     implement in an industrial setting is the excessive computational               requirements due to the inordinate number of participating groups.              The number of 'communication paths' amongst these groups (which can             be considered as 'couplings') is so large that formal optimization              methods are impossible to apply.  Sensitivity-based strategies that             reduce the number of required communication paths amongst                       participating design groups, without sacrificing solution accuracy,             are researched.  These strategies are augmented by AI techniques                to allow for human interface capabilities.  A redesign of the                   design process itself is so as to facilitate concurrent engineering             implementation.  Some of the research issues addressed  include:                quantification of coupling strengths between subsystems,                        identification of candidate couplings for suspension or                         elimination, and optimal convergence schemes. United States                     automotive, aerospace, computer and electronics industries, among               others, have been forced to respond to competitive pressures that               have resulted in crippling losses of market share due to extensive              product development times and inordinate costs.  These industries               have recognized the necessity of adopting the Concurrent                        Engineering (CE) design approach in order to create higher quality              products that can be brought to market for significantly lower cost             and time.                                                                            The objective of this research is to develop AI-augmented                  strategies for increasing the efficiency of the design process for              large scale, complex engineering systems, such as are encountered               in Concurrent Engineering (CE) applications.  Complex engineering               systems are characterized by inherent couplings amongst the                     participating design groups, which makes traditional design and                 optimization approaches impractical.",
