 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal submitted under Small Grants for                        Exploratory Research (SGER), employing laboratory methods to                    explore the feasibility of experimentally testing theoretical                   propositions developed through computer simulations.  It will                   investigate the behavior of human subjects in a social dilemma in               which they must choose between contributing to or withdrawing                   from a common fund, testing hypotheses concerning the classic                   problems of the free rider and the evolution of cooperation.                    Three hypotheses are to be tested: (1) Serial consistency in                    observed contribution will be smaller when the associated                       outcomes are negative and larger when they are positive.  (2) The               observed contribution rate increases with the rate of                           contribution by the simulated group.  (3) The second hypothesis                 holds only in a public-goods condition and not in a private-goods               condition.                                                                                                                                                           This is preliminary work that develops novel ideas, applies                a new approach, and opens a new research area.  Whatever the                    outcome of the three hypotheses, it will make a significant                     contribution in two ways.  First, it will link the two                          methodologies of computer simulation and laboratory                             experimentation with human subjects, which can then be adopted by               other researchers.  Second, it will demonstrate that a promising                set of new theoretical developments can be assessed empirically,                thus opening the door to a number of valuable studies by other                  investigators.",
