 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports continuing research on the stability of                travelling waves.  Several application areas such as fluid                      mechanics (a modified Burgers equation), reaction-diffusion                     systems, the Murray-Oster mechanochemical theory of pattern                     bifurcation and competing population models.  Much work has been                done on wave solutions of most of these equations.  This project                is concerned with the stability of such wave solutions, a topic                 which has received very little attention.  The project gives a                  very important framework of stability analysis for travelling                   waves by using topological invariants.  It is a conceptually new                idea; very robust to perturbations because of its topological                   character.  The basic idea of 'stability index' has been                        developed recently.  It shows great potential as a new tool which               can be used to explore many examples of wave phenomena occurring                in both theoretical mathematics and the physical world.                              The travelling wave is the most basic object used                          to understand dynamic pattern formation such as shock                           waves, crystal growth, and flame propagation, since the phase                   change occurs only through the motion of interfacial boundaries                 and such a motion takes the form of travelling waves.  The                      important issue is knowing whether such waves are observable or                 not, which is the same thing as asking whether they are stable.                 It is, in general, quite difficult to determine their stability                 properties, since travelling waves are large amplitude solutions                connecting two different stable states and usually contain sharp                transition layers.  The new topological machinery used in                       this project to detect stability is not a perturbative one, and                 hence has the potential for broad applicability.",
