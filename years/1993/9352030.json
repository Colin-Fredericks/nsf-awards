In Step 1 of the program, students in all  introductory courses (including those without laboratories) use  Macintosh microcomputers running the Voyager planetarium  program to control 10\" telescopes to observe objects  independently of the instructor. Although they are asked to  observe a common core of objects that are central to the course  they are taking, they also study objects that they select  themselves and so are introduced to both the excitement and  frustration of the contact sport of astronomy. In Step 2,  students taking the laboratory Cosmology course build on this  experience by using CCD cameras attached to the telescopes and  interfaced to the microcomputers to do imaging and photometry.  By the end of the course, they can be experienced enough to  carry out two-week self-designed research projects such as  monitoring variable stars and looking for supernovae and so are  active participants in the contact sport of astronomy. In Step  3, students taking Observational Astronomy carry out extensive  self-designed research projects such as determining light  curves of supernovae, doing photometry of fast-moving  asteroidal objects, monitoring active galaxies, and observing  variable stars. In Step 4, students in upper-level courses  continue with these projects, some of which will be  publishable. In Step 5, Astronomy majors and minors doing  Individual Research are able to do much more sophisticated  theses than was previously possible. Equipment tests and a  successful pilot program have been carried out to demonstrate  the feasibility of much of this project.  This is the first  project to use Voyager to control a computerized telescope, a  technology that has s ignificant potential for astronomy  education nationally.  ***",
