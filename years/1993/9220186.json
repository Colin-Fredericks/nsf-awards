 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range goal of this project is to define the interactions               in the transcription complex that cause arrest and termination by               RNA polymerase II in higher eukaryotes.  Transcriptional arrest or              termination contributes to gene regulation in eukaryotes, but the               underlying mechanisms are unknown.  To understand these mechanisms,             a much better appreciation of the structure of RNA polymerase II                transcription elongation complexes, both at arrest sites where                  elongation normally is efficient, will be required.  Methods will               be developed to produce defined elongation complexes that contain               either pure RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase II that carries the             modifications and auxiliary factors it acquires during initiation               at a promoter.  Both types of defined elongation complexes will be              isolated and their structures probed using a variety of agents that             can reveal the configuration of RNA and DNA strands within them.                Experiments will be performed to test two models for                            transcriptional arrest; 1) that altered configuration of the                    transcript produces arrest and 2) that arrest is caused by bent, or             conformationally altered, DNA molecules.                                        %%%                                                                             This study will produce new insight into how RNA polymerase                     transcribes the information in genes (DNA) to an RNA product which              is required to express genetic information.",
