The  workshop is intended to bring together institutions of higher  education, business, and industry throughout Arizona and the  surrounding region.  The intent of the workshop will be to promote  awareness and understanding and to discuss planning and practical  courses of action for companies in relation to environmental  issues, laws and regulations which affect the manufacturing world.        This workshop will be organized around three tracks:   Waste  management issues; air pollution and the impact of the Clean Air  Act Amendments on business and industry; and issues of water  pollution and the impact of the Safe Drinking Water Act on business  and industry.  Given the concern for environment and the impact of  the design, production, use and recycle lifecycle on the  environment, this workshop will address important and relevant  topics for industry and the university.",
