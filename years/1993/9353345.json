The planning grant brings                     together representatives from the schools, universities,                        Educational Service Centers, and others who have experience                     or interest in local school change.  This team makes on-site                    visits to successful schools and uses consultants in school                     change and science education to help formulate a plan for a                     broader project.  A one-week summer symposium is used to                        design strategies to support improvements in science                            education.  The report generated by the symposium is                            intended to be used as a basis of a full proposal and for                       local systems to develop system change plans for their                          schools.                                                                                                                                                        The planning grant begins the examination and compilation of                    strategies that will lead to a Teacher Enhancement proposal.                    The cost sharing is estimated at 17%",
