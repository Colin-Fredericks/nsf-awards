 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award provides Avila College with funds to continue an                      exciting summer program providing 9 undergraduates with                         research experiences in tropical studies. Participants will                     learn and develop skills by interacting with faculty as they                    work on projects dealing with herpetological communities on                     Hispaniola. To foster student development, a 3-phase program                    is planned: orientation--introducing students to research                       methodology and ecological studies in the West Indies;                          apprenticeship--developing skills; and individual research--                    resulting in publication-quality reports. Seminars on                           research and graduate studies are included to facilitate                        applications of acquired knowledge and skills to                                participants' future academic pursuits. Presentations will                      be made by scientists in both the United States and                             Dominican Republic. Evaluation will be by participants,                         their academic advisors, and one outside faculty.                                                                                                               This program is designed to induce participants to consider                     graduate studies favorably and to increase the likelihood of                    their choosing careers in science. The faculty will \"coach\"                     students, instilling a vision of research by explaining the                     rules and delivering a feeling of the excitement that                           comes with addressing questions with conceptual                                 orientations.                                                                                                                                                   A focus on frog and lizard communities provides                                 opportunities to apply theories and methods used in                             ecological research while working with organisms that are                       abundant, accessible, and remarkably well and visibly                           adapted to their environment. Investigations may address                        aspects of niche dimensions or parasite infections. Students                    may choose projects within these topics or develop                              investigations of their own, including, but not limited to,                     physiological or ethological studies of selected taxa.",
