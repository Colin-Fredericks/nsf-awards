 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Solomon of Stanford University will conduct                      studies designed to elucidate the spectroscopy of certain                       metalloproteins under support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic                  and Organometallic Program.  The proteins of interest are those                 that contain Blue Copper and Iron Sulfur sites, and the                         information to be obtained is a more detailed description of                    their electronic structures and the contributions of electronic                 structure to the electron-transfer reactivity of these active                   sites.  Spectral methods to be used include polarized                           absorption, variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism,                   single crystal multifrequency EPR, resonance Raman, variable                    energy PES, and X-ray absorption.  These experimental methods                   will be combined with ligand field and SCF-Xalpha-SW                            calculations. These techniques will be applied in studies of                    simple coordination complexes of Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(I) and                     Cu(II). The information obtained from these studies will then                   allow evaluation of the influence of electronic structure on                    the unusual reduction potentials and rapid rates of electron                    transfer of the real proteins.  In addition, an analogous set                   of experiments will be conducted on a variety of mutant and                     modified blue copper proteins in order to test the deductions                   derived from the model studies.                                                 %%%                                                                             A diverse array of sophisticated spectroscopic techniques will                  be used in order to learn about the bonding at the active sites                 of two classes of metal-containing proteins.  These proteins                    contain either copper-sulfur or iron-sulfur centers, are found                  in most organisms, and function in the physiological electron                   transport chains.  The approach to be taken will entail                         detailed experimental and theoretical study of simple models of                 the active sites, as well as experimental study of a series of                  modified copper proteins.  The information obtained will lead                   to an understanding of how the bonding at the metal sites                       controls the rates and energetics of reactions of these                         proteins.",
