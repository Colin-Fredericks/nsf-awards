 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surfactant adsorption is an important phenomenon in many                        processes such as enhanced oil recovery, detergency,                            flotation, and molecular electronics and microstructure of the                                                                                                  adsorbed layers a governing role in determining the efficiency                                                                                                  of these processes.  An approach combining advanced                             spectroscopic techniques such as luminescence, electron spin,                                                                                                   resonance, Raman and NMR with conventional techniques of                        adsorption, electrokinetic, calorimetric and wettability has                    been used in recent studies to determine important                              microstructural properties such as micropolarity,                               microfluidity, aggregation number and surfactant and polymer                    orientation for several alumina-dodecyl sulfonate/polyacrylic                                                                                                   acid systems for the first time.  It is now possible to                         determine such properties in mixed surfactant systems that are                                                                                                  invariably involved in practical systems.  Mixed systems offer                                                                                                  significant advantages in terms of high surface activity, salt                                                                                                  tolerance, reduced precipitation loss etc.  On the other hand,                                                                                                  preferential adsorption from surfactant mixtures will cause                     chromatographic separation of the surfactant components                         resulting not only in loss of surfactants, but also in                          significant changes in the efficiency of the processes                          involved.  Important questions to be answered include the                       effect of mixing, for example, anionics with nonionics, effect                                                                                                  of relevant variables such as pH, ionic strength, multivalent                                                                                                   ions concentration, temperature and order of addition of the                    components.  It is most interesting to determine arrangement                    and rearrangement of the adsorbate species as the system is                     subjected to perturbations of composition, pH, etc. and to                      determine the resultant changes in the interfacial behavior of                                                                                                  the systems.  It is the aim of this work to investigate                         molecular level behavior of the species in mixed adsorbed                       films as a function of surfactant structure, PH, salinity,                      hardness, temperature using the comprehensive approach                          involving above spectroscopic and adsorption techniques.  It                    will also be a major aim to model these systems with the help                                                                                                   of additional information to be obtained from                                   microcalorimetric investigation.  Also, new techniques will be                                                                                                  explored as in the past to determine additional micro and nano                                                                                                  level properties of the adsorbed layers.  With this                             multipronged approach, it should be possible to develop an                      accurate understanding of the adsorption mechanisms of real                     surfactant systems and to develop capability to control                         adsorption and to manipulate the configurational properties of                                                                                                  the adsorbed species and their aggregates.",
