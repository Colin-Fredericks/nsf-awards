 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides one-half the funding necessary to develop              instrumentation that is needed to focus hard X-rays at the Advanced             Photon Source (APS). The remaining necessary funds are to be                    committed by the University of Chicago on behalf of the Consortium              for Advanced Radiation Sources (CARS). The capabilities of existing             X-ray focusing monochromators and mirrors are inadequate to take                full advantage of the extraordinarily brilliant radiation at APS.               They use either large focusing lengths, thus limiting their source              demagnification, or focus only a small fraction of the transmitted              radiation into the required small cross-section. Furthermore, they              cannot withstand the high heat load imposed by the APS X-ray beam.                   The purpose of this instrumentation development is to enable               new classes of experiments by providing significant improvement in              the linear spatial resolution and stability of X-ray optical                    instrumentation to be used at the APS. Techniques which are                     affected include: X-ray absorption spectroscopy from small or                   dilute samples ranging from geological samples to metallo-proteins;             microtomography and X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis of                   samples as diverse as plant roots and meteorites; micro-crystal                 diffraction from zeolites and metal cluster compounds; in-plane                 surface diffraction from liquid samples at grazing incidence;                   reflectivity measurements from liquid surfaces; small angle                     scattering from polymers and macromolecular assemblies including                muscle; and time-resolved energy-dispersive spectroscopy from                   catalysts. All of these techniques require focusing of the incident             X-rays to a very small cross-section and can tolerate only a minor              increase in angular convergence of the beam. The improvements in                spatial resolution and brilliance allows use of smaller volumes of              materials, will permit time-resolved studies, and in general                    improve the sensitivity of all techniques. The resulting                        instrumentation will be used by scientists and research groups that             are members of CARS, including  workers in the areas of earth                   sciences, chemistry, materials research and the biosciences. All                instrument design developments will be made available to the entire             science community with science applications at APS.",
