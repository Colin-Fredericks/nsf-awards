One of the major obstacles to this approach is that bacteria often adhere strongly to solid surfaces and plug porous materials rather than pass through them.  Our Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of isolating non adhesive variants of several different bacterial strains that are capable of degrading a suite of chlorinated organic chemicals commonly found as contaminants in groundwater and aquifers.  The strains that were developed in Phase I have the potential to travel at least an order of magnitude further into aquifer solids than their adhesive parental strains.  By using trichloroethylene as a model chlorinated organic, we also demonstrated that the degradative competence of these non adhesive variants had not been altered.  Phase II research will bring this technology to commercialization by establishing a number of operating parameters for the use of these non adhesive degradative strains    in       situ   .  In addition to establishing the stability of the adhesion deficient phenot ype, we will measure the penetration and degradative efficiency of these strains in different types of aquifer material.  A pilot scale model aquifer will be constructed and used to demonstrate an    in       situ    bioremediation system based on the use of these highly specialized microorganisms. %%% Ground water pollution is a growing problem worldwide and the development of methods to control it are extremely important.  One method to confront this problem is to continue to pump water and purify it on the surface.  Since this is very expensive, new methods are being sought to destroy water contaminating chemicals by using microorganisms in the well, or in the aquifer, itself.  These cells can consume contaminating chemicals and purify the water.  However, during the process, the cells that degrade the polluting compounds stick to soil particles, and, as they metabolize pollutants, they grow and eventually plug the well.  In an attempt to circumvent this problem, we developed certain strains of pollutant degrading, non sticking, or non adhering, bacteria.  In the present research program, we will determine if these non adhering cells work equally well in ground water purification, but without growing into a barrier and plugging the flow of water into the well. ***                  0*0*0*",
