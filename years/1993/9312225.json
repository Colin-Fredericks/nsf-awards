 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312225  Kukuk    Ecological, behavioral, and genetic approaches will be used to explore the origin  and maintenance of cooperation among non-relatives in the group-living halictine  bee species Lasioglossum hemichalceum.  Field studies of nest parasitism, ant  predation, and nest availability will address the question of why living in groups  is advantageous.  Field studies of individual survival and reproductive success will  provide data to test a mathematical model of how this form of cooperation works.   This model uses state-of-the-art methods to predict the number of individuals  that will perform risky tasks (such as foraging) for any given group size.  Genetic  studies, using DNA fingerprinting, will allow Dr. Kukuk to establish genealogies  for groups to precisely assess the reproductive success of group members.  This  multifaceted research project represents a significant advance in the study of  cooperation among non-relatives.    The importance of sociality as an evolutionary innovation cannot be  overemphasized.  Cooperation among groups of individuals led to the success of  Homo sapiens, and is paramount in nature.  Social insects are ecologically  dominant in most terrestrial habitats in terms of both energy consumption and  biomass.  Social innovation and diversity have evolved in many insect lineages.   The halictine bees are of central importance in the study of social evolution  because of the enormous diversity of social organization found in this subfamily.   In addition, the form of cooperation found in the halictine species L. hemichalceum  is not well studied, even though it is common.  Answering the how and why  questions about the evolution of cooperation among non-relatives will challenge  currently held theories that emphasize the importance of genealogical  relationships among group members, and will provide insights into alternative  forms of social organization.",
