All of the research is to be                       conducted in the Carver Research Foundation Laboratory building                 by a team of fourteen researchers from several areas of the                     Tuskegee University campus.  The single autoclave that served the               researchers in the CRFL was 25 years old and had been repaired                  numerous times; it finally became inoperable.  There is a small                 autoclave nest door in a science building, but it was too small                 for some projects, its major use was for classes, and it was                    often non-functioning.  Therefore, a new autoclave was                          desperately needed to carry out research efficiently in CRFL.",
