 "awd_abstract_narration": "A VLSI laboratory and design courses are being developed for                    the electrical and computer engineering curriculum. These                       courses provide students with experience in the development of                  VLSI-chip products. In this setting, students form teams and                    undertake the whole design process: logic design, gate-level,                   layout-level, simulation/verification, test generation, and                     testing of the returned prototype chips. The proposed courses                   emphasize the importance of quality in the IC products,                         particularly testing. Students adopt the concept of concurrent                  engineering early in their studies of the design and testing                    techniques, and problems that  arise in the manufacturing and                   mass production of the ICs are considered and solved. Design-                   for-test techniques are studied and their actual                                implementation, which makes the IC-chip products easy to test,                  are carried out by the design teams.The items requested                         comprise a benchtop ASIC tester and  logic verification and                     test generation CAD software, which are essential for the                       implementation of Design-for-Test laboratory courses.",
