Recent work in  our, as well as several other, laboratories strongly suggests that  salicylic acid (SA) plays an important signaling role in plant  disease defense responses including the induction of PR genes.  We  propose to continue several lines of study to help further define  SA's signaling role and identify components of this signal  transduction pathway.  In addition to free SA, a glucosidated form  (SAG) is found in resistant cultivate of tobacco after infection  with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).  The roles of these two forms of  SA in the development and manifestation of systemic acquired  resistance (SAR) will be addressed.  The second line of study  involves characterization of the cis element (s) and trans-acting  factors which mediate SA-induced transcriptional activation of the  acidic PR-2 (glucanase) gene of tobacco.  In the third line of  study SA-insensitive (SAIN) mutants of Arabidopsis will be isolated  and characterized.  Positive selection of SAIN mutants will utilize  the tms2 gene of Agrobacterium tumefaciens fused to the SA-  inducible tobacco PR-1 or PR-2 promoters.  %%%  These studies should lead to a better understanding of how the SA  signal is generated, modified, perceived and transduced during  defense responses.  They may also provide insights into the  mechanisms (s) of action of other SA-mediated physiological changes  and should provide an opportunity to compare signal transduction in  plants with that in microbes and animals.  ***",
