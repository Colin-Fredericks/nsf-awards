 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ion channels are large proteins that allow current in the                  form of ions to pass across cell membranes.  The inter-                         relationships of a large variety of ion channels shape the                      electrical signals of the neuro-muscular system.  Single channels               patch clamp recordings provide important information about these                channels.  The apparently random character of the recorded                      currents has led to the widespread use of stochastic models.  We                propose to investigate a number of problems that arise in                       modeling the stochastic behavior of ion channels and in the                     analysis of patch clamp recordings.                                                  The flow of electrical charge is fundamental to the                        operation of the nervous system and its interaction with the                    muscular system.  At a microscopic level, charge is conducted                   through channels in the cell membrane called ion channels.  The                 pioneering work of Sakmann and Neger, for which they received the               Nobel Prize, allows direct measurement of the current flow                      through a single ion channel.  The resulting recordings reveal                  that the channels open and close in a random fashion and                        consequently methods of probability and statistics have played an               important role in the analysis of the recordings.  We propose to                investigate a number of problems that arise in such analyses.",
