 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                   in high energy particle physics between Gerard M. Crawley of                    the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan                   State University and S. Gales of the Nuclear Physics Institute,                 Orsay, France.  Both research groups will conduct joint,                        complementary experiments on decay studies of high lying single                 particle states and giant resonances.  The understanding of the                 structure of high lying states in the nucleus will be enhanced                  significantly through studies on particle decay.  The investigators             will conduct experiments at Michigan State University and at                    GANIL facility in France on the following topics: (1) structure                 of high lying states observed in heavy ion transfer reactions; (2)              proton decay of Gamow-Teller and other states in heavy nuclei;                  and (3) the existence and properties of the giant isovector                     monopole resonance.                                                                                                                                             This cooperation takes advantage of unique U.S. and French                      expertise and facilities. High beam energies, which are necessary               for all of the experiments, are available at Michigan State's                   National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory. The GANIL                        facilities in Caen, France, composed of three connected                         cyclotrons, a unique spectrometer, and neutron detector array,                  are available together with French expertise, to carry out the                  complex experiment on giant resonances.",
