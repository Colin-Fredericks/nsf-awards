 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prediction from ungauged basins (PUB) is a classic unsolved problem             in river basin hydrology which has increasingly important                       implications for making regional hydrologic predictions due to                  global climate change. The basic approach towards a solution of                 this problem requires a deep understanding of empirical and                     theoretical issues surrounding scaling in hydrologic fluxes, the                network geometry and their interretionships, and constitutes the                main focus of the research proposed here.  The three broad but                  specific objectives of the proposed research are to develop and                 test scaling theories of spatial variability, (i) in hydrologic                 fluxes in river basins, (ii) in link based descriptions of three-               dimensional channel network geometry, and (iii)  to establish and               employ appropriate data bases for a few select basins for testing               theoretical hypotheses and predictions.  A portion of this total                project was funded in part for three years by NASA beginning July               1991.  This is shown in Appendix IV.  The budget for NSF                        complements the fund provided by NASA.",
