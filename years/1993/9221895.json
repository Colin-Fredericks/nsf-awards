 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Intertropical Convergence Zones (ITCZs) are climatological             features in the earth's atmosphere that are intimately tied to both             the tropical large-scale meridional (Hadley) circulation and the                low-latitude surface circulation.  The ITCZ drives the meridional               circulation cells which transport momentum and excess heat from the             tropics to midlatitudes, thereby affecting the baroclinity of the               midlatitudes and hence climate. In addition, the eastern Pacific                ITCZ appears to play a role in the large El Nino/Southern                       Oscillation climate fluctuations.  Yet the dynamics and energetics              of the processes maintaining the Intertropical Convergence Zones                are poorly understood.  This study examines the maintenance of the              ITCZ phenomenon and the associated large-scale circulation, using               a General Circulation Model and a simplified 3-layer model of the               tropical atmosphere.  The PI is completing a series of carefully                designed GCM experiments with increasingly complicated forcing that             explores how the surface boundary heating (sea surface temperature)             and orography affect the location, strength, energetics and                     dynamics of the ITCZ.  A 3-layer model of the tropical atmosphere               has been constructed and employed to facilitate the interpretation              of the GCM experiments (this model explicitly resolves the boundary             layer and the free baroclinic tropical tropospheric circulations).                   These results are helping to better define the relationship                between the ITCZ and large-scale meridional and surface                         circulations, and hence are contributing to our knowledge of the                global climate.",
