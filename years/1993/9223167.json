The                      conference will address issues related to the improvement of                    productivity in cold and warm forming and in the adaptation of low              temperature forging processes to the forming of parts that are                  conventionally formed by hot forging.  The funds will be applied                to defraying part of the travel costs of seven invited speakers                 from universities in Europe and Japan, where the subject                        technologies are much further advanced than in the United States.               This will allow United States attendees to be exposed to cutting                edge technologies from abroad and will encourage the diffusion                  knowledge concerning the best available manufacturing technologies,             worldwide, into the manufacturing research community, in industry               and at universities.",
