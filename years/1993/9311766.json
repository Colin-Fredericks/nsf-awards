Eberly, University of Rochester, amd Dr. I.                                Bialynicki-Birula, Institute of Physics, Polish                                 Academy of Sciences.  The researchers are                                       investigating the properties of electrons,                                      atoms, and molecules in radiation fields.  Over                                 the past year, they have performed theoretical                                  studies of coherent optical pulse propagation,                                  cooperative emission and superradiance, X-ray                                   bremstrahlung and inner shell ionization                                        processes, the effects of laser fluctuations and                                noise on photo-absorption and emission, the                                     theory of atom-field interactions in the context                                of cavity QED and phase representations for                                     radiation fields.  They have also worked on                                     short-pulse studies of diatomic molecules,                                      quantum fluctuations in stimulated Raman                                        scattering, and ionization of atoms and                                         molecules by ultra-strong electromagnetic                                       radiation (optical and microwave).
