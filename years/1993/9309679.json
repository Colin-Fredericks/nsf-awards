 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves experimental research to develop   problem solving environment for mechanical system simulation.  Specifically, the research develops software tools that  facilitate rapid, high-level creation of mechanical system  simulators.  These tools are used to generate simulators  for a variety of applications, including real-time vehicle  simulation, legged locomotion and robotics, and investigation  of collision and contact problems.  There is a great interest in the development of problem  solving environments (PSEs) for engineering and science  problems.  One of the key challenges lies in developing  computer science techniques that enable integration of  supporting technologies such as computer algebra systems,  numerical analysis libraries, geometric modeling systems, and  object-oriented programming systems.  This research attacks the problem by concentrating on one  well-defined but rich domain, rigid-body dynamics simulation.  The project has two specific goals: (1) advance the state of  the art in mechanical system simulation by making it easier   create and modify dynamics simulators, and (2) develop a  software architecture and software tools that extend from  this domain to more general problem solving environments.    of the software tools to generate dynamics simulators for a  number of different applications demonstrate the power of  the approach.",
