 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300966  Jensen       This project will examine mathematical problems arising from  both the calculus of variations and control theory.  A common  feature of the problems is their affinity for the framework of  viscosity solutions.   The development of new techniques and  methods necessary to resolve these problems will both advance the  theory of viscosity solutions and provide new examples of their  applicability.  Viscosity solutions of differential equations  were introduced in 1981 to characterize uniquely  the value  functions of optimal control and differential games.  Part of  the project will continue the study of such applications.  Two  other problem areas come from the calculus of variations.  The  first is based on the strategy of finding functions with  prescribed boundary values on a domain which has minimal L-1  norm.  These problems have been successfully studied using  viscosity solutions.  The current work will use viscosity  solutions to analyze specific solutions of problems of motion by  mean curvature to help understand the level sets of these  functions.  The second line of investigation is to study the same  sets of functions as before with the goal of minimizing the  maximal norm.  This gives rise to fourth order homogeneous  partial differential equations.  Some work has already been done  on the analysis of such questions but much more remains.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is  to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
