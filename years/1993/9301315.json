 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations in the theory of Markov processes are to be                 done with concentration on branching measure-valued processes and               related processes in spaces of functions.  The general form of                  branching, the relationship between path properties of                          superdiffusions and positive solutions of nonlinear differential                equations and modeling of \"a random cloud\" with interacting parts               are among the principal objectives of the investigation.                             Measure-valued branching processes have been studied since                 the late 1960s and have attracted a great deal of attention                     during the last five years.  This is a remarkable class of                      processes, which provide a tool for the investigation of                        spatially distributed populations.  They also make it possible to               extend important connections between probability theory and the                 theory of partial differential equations.",
