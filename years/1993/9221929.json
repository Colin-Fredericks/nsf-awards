Aquatic habitats are                                 threatened by urban and industrial inputs of                                    toxicants such as heavy metals. Lead is one of                                  the most toxic, and is concentrated in sediments                                of lakes and estuaries.  Little is understood                                   about the cycling of such heavy metals in lakes.                                Using facilities in China and in the US, the                                    investigators will study the mobility of lead                                   across the sediment-water interface in some                                     Chinese lakes.                                                                                                                                                  This study should contribute to the assessment of                               radioactive dating techniques used for                                          paleolimnological studies and of anthropogenic                                  effects of the toxicant lead.",
