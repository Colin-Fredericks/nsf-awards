The                        introductory laboratory course, which provides the first                        psychology laboratory experience for undergraduate majors at                    IUPUI, is the primary target for development. With the addition                 of this new laboratory they are computerizing experimental                      protocols and data analyses, introducing students to research                   as it is conducted in the modern psychology laboratory.                         Numerous improvements and developments are afforded by the                      equipment, including increased precision of controlling stimuli                 and recording responses, and standardization across different                   lab sections.  In addition, students in upper division                          laboratories and those enrolled in independent research courses                 are benefiting from the new equipment.  Having learned the                      fundamentals of the experiment generating software in                           Introductory Laboratory, advanced students are designing and                    carrying out independent research projects.",
