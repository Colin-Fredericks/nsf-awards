 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phenotypic plasticity permits individuals to express                       different, functionally adaptive phenotypes in response to                      different environmental circumstances.  It has long been speculated             that such plasticity increases the range of habitats that a species             may occupy.  I propose to determine whether phenotypic plasticity               enhances ecological breadth by comparing two weedy, ecologically                broad species with two ecologically restricted species in the genus             Polygonum.  The comparative study will consist primarily of                     greenhouse experiments with field-collected material, supplemented              with field work to quantify the habitat differences among the                   species and their populations.  The major experiment will be a                  growth study of several populations of each species in a                        multifactorial set of light, moisture, and nutrient treatments,                 designed to determine whether the four species differ in the range              of environments in which they can successfully survive and                      reproduce.  By evaluating the mechanisms of morphological and                   physiological response to the treatments, I can determine whether               differences in environmental tolerance among the species are                    associated with differences in the amounts or patterns of                       functionally adaptive phenotypic plasticity.  Finally, I will                   compare the environmental tolerance of populations within species               to determine whether the degree of plasticity influences the degree             to which conspecific populations in different habitats                          differentiate genetically.  A second, smaller greenhouse experiment             will examine in detail the specific aspects of root system                      plasticity that contribute to species tolerance or intolerance of               variation in soil nutrients and moisture.//",
