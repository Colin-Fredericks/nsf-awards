Zimmerman at the University              of Wisconsin. Molecules will be excited with light to produce                   excited states where the resulting reactions will be studied in                 detail. Included in this study will be: (1) experiments to uncover              new photochemical reactions, (2) new ways to control excited state              reactivity, (3) the development of new techniques in                            photochemistry. Some of the projects will envolve the use of                    crystal and polymer cavities to tailor photochemical reactions, the             use of specially designed molecules to time excited state                       processes, and the theoretical treatment of reactions of organic                molecules.",
