 "awd_abstract_narration": "A nation's official statistics are directly affected by the                quality of the data derived from its business,  economic and                    agricultural surveys.  Yet there are few commonly accepted and                  practiced methodologies for these surveys-- unlike the situation                for social and demographic surveys.  The reasons for this situation             are diverse,  the most important ones being that establishment                  surveys face much more difficult design and execution problems and              that far less is published on strategies to solve these problems.                    The International Conference on Establishment Surveys (ICES)               is being planned  (1) to provide a forum to describe current                    methods being used for surveys of businesses,  farms,  and                      institutions;  (2)  to present new or improved technologies for                 solving the unique problems associated with establishment surveys;              and (3)  to promote international exchange of ideas by providing                an opportunity for business,  economic,  agricultural and                       statistical researchers to exchange ideas for future                            interdisciplinary and even cross-country research.                                   This conference is being jointly supported by the American                 Statistical Association (ASA,  Survey Methods Section and Business              and Economic Statistics Section),  the International Association                of Survey Statisticians (IASS),  the National Association of                    Business Economists  (NABE),  Statistics Canada,  and the                       Statistical Society of Canada (SSC).  The meeting is currently                  scheduled to be held at Buffalo,  New York,  June 27-30,  1993.                      This Conference could be an important beginning in an effort               to focus more attention on critical methodological issues in the                area of surveys of business establishments.  The people and the                 government agencies involved are representative both of those that              have work going on in the field and those who should begin such                 work.  The interaction among those responsible for the design and               implementation of establishment surveys across agencies and across              countries is likely to contribute to an improvement in the quality              of U.S. statistics.",
