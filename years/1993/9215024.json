 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central focus of Loring's work will be relations on                    operators and the associated universal C*-algebras.  These will be              studied in connection with K-theory, perturbation problems, lifting             problems and representation theory.  Gilfeather will work on                    extending recent results on Hochshild cohomology of an algebra                  taking values in that algebra.  In particular, he will investigate              completely bounded cohomology for non-selfadjoint algebras.  A                  related area involves automorphisms motivated by various                        constructions from algebraic topology.                                               The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
