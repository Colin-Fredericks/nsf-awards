 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to address the question of how intuitive and                concise linear model concepts and techniques can be extended to                 nonparametric settings and it is also proposed to develop                       nonparametric techniques for model diagnostics that can be used                 for dimensionality reduction and to address the question of                     adequacy of particular models.  More precisely, it is proposed to               focus on procedures that are counterparts to such commonly used                 linear model ideas as regression coefficients, correlation                      coefficients, ANOVA decompositions, and principal components.  In               addition, it is proposed to consider nonparametric tools for                    model building, identification, and diagnostics including tests                 for linearity, partial linearity, additivity, etc. All estimators               to be considered depend on smoothing parameters needed in                       estimation of curves and surfaces.  A large part of the research                will address the problem of developing reliable data-based                      methods for smoothing parameter selection.                                           With the advent of computer data bases of unprecedented size               and complexity and with dramatic increase in computer power, it                 has become increasingly more desirable and possible to develop                  general models, concepts, and procedures that can be used to                    study relationships between variables and to construct models                   less dependent on specific assumptions. It is proposed to extend                commonly used linear model ideas and techniques to this more                    general setting  and to  assess the adequacy of models with                     simpler structure.",
