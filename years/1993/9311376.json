Species are distributed worldwide in a circumsubtropical band, achieving their greatest diversity in the tropics.  With few exceptions, all are restricted to depositing eggs in plant held waters (bromeliads, pitcher plants, seed pods, etc.).  The taxon exhibits a diversity of behaviors atypical for mosquitoes, such as nectar stealing from ants and egg brooding by females.  In addition, three of the twelve genera have the capacity to vector arboviruses.  Lack of explicit phylogenetic hypotheses has prevented the examination of these phenomena from an evolutionary standpoint.  Our preliminary data indicate that Sabethini is a monophyletic group, however, two of the larger genera are polyphyletic.  The dissertation will include study of phylogenetic relationships on a worldwide basis.  Morphological character systems from three life stages will be used to produce a robust hypothesis of relationships.  Here we request funds for museum and field studies to increase coverage of critical Old World taxa and groups found to be problematic in preliminary analyses.  We expect our results to have an immediate impact on mosquito classification and other fields in evolutionary biology. %%% This PhD dissertation improvement award provides travel money and supplies for  a graduate student to do field work in Brazil and study mosquito material in major collections.  The project will produce a needed major worldwide revision of the mosquito tribe Sabethini.  Some species in this tribe transmit diseases caused by arboviruses, so establishing their relationships will have medical importance.  In addition, such an understanding of relationships will provide a valuable framework for addressing interesting behavioral phenomena exhibited by these mosquitoes such as female egg brooding and nectar stealing from ants. ***",
