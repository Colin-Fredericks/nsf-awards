 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357274  Dawson  Forests cover 37% of all terrestrial surfaces.  The trees that  compose these forests are a primary route by which water re-enters  the hydrologic cycle.  The objectives of this NSF Young  Investigator (NYI) Award are to understand and evaluate the  importance that trees and forests play in local and regional  hydroglogic processes.  This will be accomplished through an  investigation that has four specific goals: (1) describe the water  balance of isolated trees and of forests stands using O and H  stable isotope methods, eddy correlation and aerodynamic-energy  balance techniques, and the Bowen-ratio method, (2) characterize  the degree to which trees control movement and loss of water from  forest stands with leaf-, canopy- and stand-level transpiration  estimates and isotope techniques, (3) investigate how water uptake,  movement and loss respond (adjust) to experimental manipulation  mimicking climate change (e.g. irrigating trees, preventing  transpiration), and (4) integrate the information gathered from the  observational/descriptive studies (objectives 1 and 2), the  experimental studies (objective 3), and from both individuals and  entire stands into a comprehensive picture of the role that trees  and forests play in global water movement.  Because the overall  objective is to refine our understanding of the importance and role  that trees and forests play in the hydrologic cycle, it is  necessary to use a variety of research methods.  The combination of  methods chosen will provide a means to validate information,  integrate different levels, and calibrate predictions.  The stable  isotope and eddy correlation methods are the most powerful.  An  analysis of the stable isotopic composition of water samples  obtained from source water, plant xylem-sap, and atmospheric water  vapor has been successfully used to evaluate water flux through the  soil-plant-atmospheric continuum.  The eddy correlation technique  is a powerful way to quantify water movement through pla nt canopies  and stands.  Aerodynamic-energy balance methods of water flux based  on the Penman-Monteith equation, and the Bowen-ratio method  (sensible/latent heat flux) can provide ways to independently check  the isotope and eddy correlation results.  The information obtained  from these studies will help us understand the impacts that climate  and climate change may have on the functional and structural  characteristics of forested regions of the world, refine our  empirical understanding of the role that vegetated surfaces play in  the hydrologic cycle and local and regional water balance, and to  forge a much-needed link between atmospheric and plant biological  research.  ***",
