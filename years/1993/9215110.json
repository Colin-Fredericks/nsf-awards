 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will investigate experimentally and theoretically              the effects of mold surface morphology, physical and thermal                    properties of casting and mold, wettability of molten aluminum over             the mold surface, and temperature and pressure at the mold casting              interface on the heat transfer rate, interface conductance, and                 physical and chemical structure of the casting surface.  The                    surface quality of castings is closely related to the cooling rate              during solidification, but no quantitative results are readily                  available on how surface structure of the casting is affected by                mold surface morphology and heat transfer rate across the metal-                mold interface.  Thus, this interdisciplinary project encompasses               the areas of heat transfer, tribology, metallurgy, and stress                   analysis and combines the theoretical predictions with experimental             verifications.  Semi-empirical relations will be developed for the              effects of the various factors stated above on interface                        conductance and heat transfer rate across the casting mold                      interface.                                                                           Since the ultimate goal of this research with heat                         transfer/mechanics and mold surface design, is to positively                    influence the surface quality of the casting ingot, the                         investigators will evaluate the metallurgical structure of the cast             ingots and attempt to correlate it to the heat transfer model as                well as to mold surface properties.  The success of the project may             allow the production of higher quality, lower cost casting.",
