 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in                climate dynamics and paleoclimatology and involves Douglas                      Martinson and William Howard of Columbia University's Lamont-                   Doherty Geological Observatory and Laurent Labeyrie of the Centre               des Faibles Radioactivites, the French National Center for                      Scientific Research.  The investigators will study problems of                  Quaternary climate dynamics and geochronology in Antarctic deep-                sea cores.  The objectives of their research are to integrate and               synthesize data sets and to advance knowledge of the temporal and               spatial patterns of physical climate and the geochemical changes.                                                                                               Researchers in the U.S. and France have made significant progress               in understanding the role of the Southern Ocean in Quaternary                   climate change and in modulating atmospheric chemistry. Deep-sea                cores in the French and U.S. collections are well suited for                    complementary studies.  The French group has extensive experience               with cores which cover the last 160,000 years at resolutions of                 1000 years and less.  Whereas, the U.S. researchers have analyzed               and studied paleoclimate records which cover the past 400,000 to                500,000 years at resolutions of 3000-5000 years.  Through the                   proposed program, the investigators will have access to new                     French cores with a range of age intervals and resolutions.                     Their efforts will place both the French and U.S. records on                    common time scales, and provide a synthesis of the                              paleoecological and geochemical records.",
