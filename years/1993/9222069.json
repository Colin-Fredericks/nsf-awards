This research will test a model of responsive                       parenting that emphasizes the emotions and emotional                            communication occurring during parent-child communication.  The                 model details how maternal responsiveness is influenced by                      mothers' experience of particular emotions and their ability to                 understand the emotional communications of children. Mothers will               play, feed and wait with their young children. From videotapes of               these interactions, mothers' behavior will be coded for three                   aspects of responsiveness: sensitivity, intrusiveness and                       contingency. The data will be used to understand how responsive                 behavior is influenced by mothers' immediate emotions, the child                behavior that elicits them, and the emotions mothers think their                children are experiencing. The data will also be used to                        understand whether emotions are a principal reason why                          responsiveness is influenced by other, non-immediate variables,                 specifically by mothers' personalities, mothers' social                         relationships, and the temperaments of children. Do mothers'                    levels of empathy, depression, or marital conflict, for example,                undermine mothers' responsiveness because these influence the                   emotions mothers feel when interacting with their children? This                research will enable us to understand how emotions control the                  responsiveness of mothers' behavior, and how emotions determine                 the impact that life experiences and personality dispositions                   have on parenting behavior. This knowledge is critical to                       understanding human development in the first years of life and,                 in fact, to understanding ways that emotions promote and                        undermine interpersonal behavior generally.",
