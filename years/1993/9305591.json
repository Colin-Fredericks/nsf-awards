 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a multi-stage study of university-firm linkages for                     industrial innovation.  A survey instrument designed and sent to                the target population of 1600 units within the top 100 research                 universities.  Surveys will be sent to directors of offices of                  patents and technology licensing as well as department chairs and               selected researchers within disciplines of importance to industry               and commanding sizable R&D resources (Biology, Chemistry, Computer              Science, Electrical Engineering, and Physics).  The survey data and             information permit an empirical analysis of the extent and nature               of university-industry interactions.  Using these findings, a                   subset of approximately 12 selected participating university-firm               groups for detailed case studies.  The case studies consist of site             visits to these units.  Structured interviews conducted with firm               managers, industrial researchers and technicians, university                    officials, faculty and research assistants, and staff personnel.                Additionally, several non-participating like-firms identified and               visited to determine why they do not involve themselves with the                university.  This stage of the study will have several primary                  foci:  to define what participating firms and universities mean by              \"success\", to assess the perspective of firm and university                     participants, to understand why like-firms decide not to create                 linkages with universities, to isolate specific factors identified              as contributing to success or lack of success of university-                    industry interactions, and to increase our depth of understanding               concerning how universities contribute to industrial innovation.                A final report will be written which profiles university-firm                   interactions and presents students and decision makers with a                   systematic and generalizable analysis of success factors.",
