 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is improving the existing laboratory for the                       \"Computer Systems\" and \"Computer Communication & Networks\"                      courses at San Francisco State University by equipping the                      laboratory with new design and analysis tools. To reinforce the                 material learned in the classroom, undergraduates are using                     software and design tools based on advanced queueing models and                 digital circuit models to simulate the networks and computer                    systems that they design for their homework assignments and                     laboratory projects. Students are first learning the                            theoretical basis of computer systems, then designing various                   aspects of these components and systems, and finally testing                    their designs using computer simulations. In the newly                          structured courses, students are conducting actual simulations                  of their designs and are able to discover errors that are very                  difficult, if not impossible, to detect in a paper-and-pencil                   design. Students are uncovering their own mistakes in logic as                  they systematically check their own circuit designs and are                     increasing their understanding of the theoretical concepts used                 in their designs.",
