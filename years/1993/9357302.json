This may lead to increases in the mean global  temperature as well as in yearly, and even daily, variations in  temperature.  One consequence of increasing variation in temperatures is  that plants may be exposed to sudden and severe increases of temperature  (i.e., heat shocks) at a greater frequency than they are now.  The  ability of plants to withstand these hyperthermic episodes is most likely  related, at least in part, to their capacity for elevating levels of  certain heat shock proteins (hsps).  A great deal of information  regarding the molecular biology of these proteins in plants exists.  Yet,  little is known regarding how the physiological state of the cell or  whole-plant prior to the imposition of heat stress affects the synthesis  and accumulation of hsps or the ability of plants to survive heat stress.       This NSF Young Investigator Award supports research using several  genotypes of eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) in environments with  different availabilities of carbon, light and nitrogen resulting in  plants with different physiological states.  These plants will then be  exposed to acute increases in temperature, to chronic sub-lethal  temperature stress, or to control conditions to answer the following  questions.  (1) How does the physiological state of the plant affects the  kinetics and extent of accumulation of specific stress proteins in  response to a single acute heat shock, as well as a prolonged high-  temperature event and the recovery rate of normal protein synthesis?  (2)  How are patterns of heat shock protein synthesis and accumulation in  leaves correlated to the functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus  during and after acute and chronic heat stress?  (3) Does the synthesis  of stress proteins occur in lieu of the production or activation of  photosynthetic enzymes?  (4) Are any tradeoffs exacerbated when nitrogen  is limiting?  (5) Is  there a correlation between the dynamics of stress  protein production at the cellular level and whole-plant performance?   (6) How are these relationships affected by plant development stage or  plant genotype?    The results of this work are important for a number of reasons.  First,  global climate models predict that the future atmosphere will have  extremely high concentrations of carbon dioxide, and that the  accumulation of carbon dioxide, as well as other factors, may result in  temperature patterns that are subject to extreme fluctuations.   Furthermore, increasing levels of carbon dioxide, in and of itself, will  have substantial effects on the physiological status of plants.   Understanding how the stress response of plants might be altered in a  high-carbon dioxide world would therefore be an important step towards  understanding how plants in both agricultural and natural settings will  respond to the predicted changes in the global climate.  Second, the role  of stress proteins in the acquisition of stress tolerance is in the midst  of an intense debate.  Understanding the role that plant physiological  status plays in governing the heat shock response may provide essential  links to understanding when and if stress proteins function in promoting  stress tolerance in plant tissues.     ***",
