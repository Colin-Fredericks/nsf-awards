Over 300 species of haplochromine cichlids and other fishes were affected, with many species going extinct.  Attempts to ameliorate extinction processes in this aquatic community center upon restoration of the environment, accurate survey of surviving taxa, and capture and captive maintenance of a sample of the community.  To develop general strategies for preservation of endangered fish, we propose a study of genetic variability in several species of Lake Victoria cichlids.  The work will be conducted with the cooperation of fisheries biologists of the Uganda Freshwater Fisheries Research Organization.  Genetic variability in several species of Lake Victoria haplochromine cichlids will be characterized, and observed levels of genetic variation will be compared in species that: (a) have successfully adapted to environmental changes, (b) are endangered but for which adaptation is questionable.  A small set of molecular markers, including  randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and markers from the ribosomal RNA gene region, will be used in this study to estimate levels of genetic variability within populations.  %%% Results can potentially guide management strategies for preserving fish genetic variation, inform species conservation decisions, and contribute to assess ing the likelihood of successfully reintroducing captively managed endangered fish populations into nature. ***",
