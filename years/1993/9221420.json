During an eighteen                     month fieldwork period the researcher will investigate two                      Hawaiian grassroots organizations.  One is currently                            involved in a land dispute over geothermal development,                         while the other is engaged in representing the past at an                       archaeological site.  The research will examine how                             activists groups define and construct group identity on                         three levels public, group, and private) through                                demonstrations, rituals, ceremonies, and performances.  This                    research will contribute to ongoing debates in anthropology                     concerned with cultural constructions and objectification,                      representation, and the invention of tradition.",
