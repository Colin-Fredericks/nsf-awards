 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311368  Phillips    With National Science Foundation support Drs. James Phillips and  Bruce Gladfelter will conduct one season of archaeological  fieldwork in the Sinai Desert of Egypt. They will carry out small  scale excavations at sites which belong to the Ahmarian tradition  and date to approximately 30,000 to 35,000 years ago. They will  also focus on associated sediments from this period which are  likely to contain pollen and other remains permitting fine scale  environmental reconstruction. This work constitutes the first  step in a larger scale project in which the team hopes to  excavate entire sites to  reconstruct specific activities and to  integrate site specific data into a broader environmental  context. The research should reveal the underlying subsistence  strategies employed by Ahmarian groups.    The Amharian dates to the early Upper Paleolithic period in the  Near East and represents one of the earliest cultures uniquely  associated with anatomically modern humans. What makes it of  particular interest is its limited areal distribution. Dr.  Phillips believes that Amharian peoples developed subsistence  strategies which facilitated adaptation to what was a patchy  mosaic environment and that group size and movement maximized use  of a wide range of areal limited resources. The data he wishes to  collect will allow him to examine this hypothesis.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase  our understanding of how humans at a simple level of technology  adapted to a marginal semi-arid environment.",
