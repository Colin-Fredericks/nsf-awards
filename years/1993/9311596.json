 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1991 airlift of 15,000 Ethiopian Jews to Tel Aviv                           presents a remarkable opportunity to study the impact of                        social change on women's reproductive careers.  In Ethiopia                     Jewish women married young, bore children early, and had                        high fertility, trends opposite of Israeli Jewish women.                        This project has two major goals.  The first is to quantify                     the effect of changes in economy, education, and opportunity                    structure on fertility decisions.  And the second is to                         provide a qualitative ethnographic context for understanding                    those decisions based on an analysis of women's life                            histories.  A restructuring of the life course, as reflected                    in marriage and childbearing patters, pursuit of education,                     and employment experience, is proposed to account for                           differences in fertility regimes between older women who                        began their child bearing careers in Ethiopia and younger                       women who have begun their child bearing careers in Israel.                     The data collected in this study will be generated from a                       series of directed and open-ended interviews that will                          provide a complete life history of immigrations, residence,                     education, employment, and fertility.  The details of the                       immigration history of the Ethiopian Jewish population,                         including an abrupt rather than a gradual social, economic,                     and technical change, provide a unique opportunity to test                      hypotheses regarding the factors that influence the                             demographic transition.  Thus, this study will provide                          critical linkages between social transformation, cultural                       values, and individual behaviors pertaining to reproduction                     and fertility.",
