 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to purchase a photon-counting video imager                           capable of recording digital images of low level biological                     luminescence.  This  instrument will be used primarily by a                     group of faculty in experimental plant biology, most of whom                    are already collaborating in a research and training program                    sponsored by the McKnight Foundation.  A common theme among                     major users is the need for a non-destructive gene                              expression assay.  Our experiments require repeated analysis                    of the same material during various physiological and                           developmental transitions, and we wish to develop mutant                        isolation procedures for which a non-destructive assay is                       absolutely required.                                                                                                                                            We propose to meet these needs by using by using photon                         counting video imaging techniques to visualize and quantify                     gene expression in transgenic plants containing chimaeric                       genes with firefly or bacterial luciferases as reporters.                       Individual projects will seek to identify mutations                             affecting trans-acting regulators of plant gene expression                      or viral DNA replication, to identify developmentally                           regulated enhancers in plants by \"enhancer trapping\", to                        follow virus movement during the infection process, to                          monitor transgene expression in vivo in the early stages of                     plant transformation, and to study genes involved in                            heterocyst development in cyanobacteria.",
