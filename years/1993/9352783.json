 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States Military Academy has implemented a daring and                 innovative core mathematics program that addresses the 7-into-4                 problem and the concerns of the calculus reform movement. A                     vital element of this program is progressive student                            development in certain threads of continuity - one of these                     threads being scientific computing. This project is equipping                   a computer laboratory/classroom for use in teaching students                    exciting and innovative uses of technology through structured                   laboratory instruction. This laboratory is also being used by                   the Center for Faculty Development to train instructors on how                  to effectively use technology in teaching mathematics. A third                  use of this laboratory is in a series of outreach workshops,                    where the laboratory is being used to \"spread the word\" both                    regionally and nationally on the use of technology in teaching                  mathematics.By implementing this laboratory within their highly                 structured curriculum, each of the 2250 students enrolled in                    core mathematics is attending a laboratory session at least 5                   times over each of their first four semesters.  Thus every                      graduate of this institution will have at least 20 attendances                  in this laboratory. Each cadet also has his or her own personal                 computer. The synergism generated between periodic laboratory                   attendances and assignments and projects on personal machines                   is assuring that students use technology in learning                            mathematics.",
