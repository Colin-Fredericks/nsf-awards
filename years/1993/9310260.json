 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310260  Goodkind    This combined experimental and theoretical project will study  quantum tunneling in a one-d model system and a three-d model  system.  The one-d system consists of electrons tunneling out of  the shallow potential well associated with their image potential at  the surface of helium.  The three-d system is solid He-4.   Electrons on helium represent a model system where tunneling rates  can be measured as a function of applied electric field and  electron density.  This system is appropriate to study using the  one-d time-dependent Schrodinger equation.  Solid He-4 is the  simplest possible solid in nature so that its properties provide  fundamental understanding applicable to all solids.  In He-4,  lattice defects such as vacancies are expected to be delocalized as  a result of their ability to tunnel between potential minima of the  periodic lattice.  However, experimental evidence about their  concentration and their properties is limited and inconclusive.   The proposed research is intended to resolve certain outstanding  issues in both systems.  Further, the tunneling phenomena are  potentially of technological interest as microelectronic devices  become smaller and tunneling between closely spaced structures more  likely.  %%%  This is a combined experimental and theoretical which will study  quantum tunneling in two model systems.  Quantum tunneling is  analogous to finding your car outside your garage in the front yard  in the morning, even though it was left locked inside the night  before.  This macroscopic event is very unlikely, but if the car  and surroundings are shrunk to atomic dimensions, tunneling becomes  a measurable phenomenon, particularly at very low temperatures.  In  this work, one model system consists of electrons tunneling through  a potential barrier to leave a surface.  In the other model system,  helium atoms in the solid tunnel from lattice sites (garages) to  defects (front yards).  In both cases, there are fundamental issues  of both a theore tical and experimental nature that need to be  resolved.  Further, the tunneling phenomena are potentially of  technological interest as microelectronics devices become smaller  and tunneling between closely spaced structures more likely.  ***",
