Lee, Department of Electrical and Computer                                      Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, to                                  pursue with Dr.Young Moon Park, Department of                                   Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University,                              for 36 months, a program of cooperative research on                             intelligent distributed control for power plants and                            power systems.  These scientists will collaborate in                            research to achieve a highly automated control                                  system which will maximize safety, reliability, and                             efficiency; minimize pollution; and ensure a rapid                              and cost-effective load following capability.  The                              control systems to be developed will be applicable                              to nuclear and fossil-fuel power plants.                                                                                                                        In the present operating environment, system and                                controller failures or significant variations in                                operating conditions are dealt with by a human                                  operator who must initiate appropriate control                                  actions.  Utility companies, therefore, rely on the                             development of extensive and complicated operating                              procedures and operator training to cope with the                               nearly continual changes inherent in normal power                               plant operation.  The intelligent distributed                                   control approach offers an alternative by providing                             fault-accommodating control algorithms and automated                            reconfiguration of control strategies.  The U.S. and                            Korean collaborators are highly respected scientists                            with proven ability in this field.  They have                                   collaborated successfully in related research under                             NSF Grant No. INT-8617329.  The present project will                            add an international cooperative dimension to Dr.                               Lee's research under NSF Grant No. EID-9212132 and                              will allow the collaborators to combine their                                   talents and interests for mutual benefit.  This                                 project is relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-                              Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to                                increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and                              Korean scientists and engineers through the exchange                            of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                                   techniques and through collaboration on problems of                             mutual benefit.  Korean participation in the project                            is supported by the Korea Science and Engineering                               Foundation (KOSEF).",
