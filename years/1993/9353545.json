 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Fall of 1994 The New York Botanical Garden will  begin its second 100 years of commitment to science education  with the opening of the Children's Adventure Garden and the  Children's Adventure Trails.  As two components of the  Children's Adventure Project , these informal science  education facilities will use  participatory discovery to  engage urban children and their families in learning botanical  science, inquiry skills, positive attitudes towards science,  and the methods of scientists.  In the 1.5 acre Adventure  Garden children will interact with living plants and  fabricated exhibits to discover fundamental principles of  plant biology; and in the one mile of Adventure Trails they  will closely observe interdependencies of complex ecosystems  using the framework of these fundamental principles.  To  expand visitor understanding of plant biology and the ways  that scientists study it, Investigation Stations, integral  components of each facility, will be placed so that visitors  will handle, sense, and observe living plants in situ and  interact with fabricated exhibits and scientific tools.  The  Project will be developed by NYBG staff educators and  scientists with on-going participation of a broad spectrum of  advisors and consultants, including exhibition designers,  evaluators, community school teachers, and environmental  education specialists.  ***",
