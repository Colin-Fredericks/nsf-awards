 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hupp of Northwestern University will investigate the                  effects of molecular recognition on electron transfer rates                     with support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                              Organometallic Program.  He plans to probe two fundamental                      aspects of electron transfer reactions, one being the molecular                 aspects of the solvation barrier, the other being the influence                 of the intervening medium on the donor/acceptor electronic                      coupling strength.  He will conduct four classes of experiments                 to assess these issues.  1)  Crown ethers in solution will bind                 to D/A complexes, and this binding will simulate the molecular                  aspects of solvation.  2)  Donors and acceptors will be trapped                 inside hemicarcerands, and the influence on bimolecular                         electron transfer will likewise simulate the molecular aspects                  of solvation.  3)  D/A complexes where the bridging ligand is a                 crown ether or related moiety will be examined vis-a-vis their                  binding of cations;  this will give information on the effects                  on coupling strength.  4)  D/A complexes will be examined as a                  function of the conformation of the bridging ligand;this will                   give information about gated electron transfer and it will help                 in the interpretation of the studies in part 3.  The general                    outcome of these studies will be an enhanced understanding of                   how electron transfer over long distances is affected by the                    intervening and surrounding media.                                              %%%                                                                             One of the major types of chemical reaction is electron                         transfer from one atom to another.  This can even occur over                    long distances, when the two atoms are separated because they                   reside in bulky molecules, or because they reside in remote                     sites within the same molecule.  Under such circumstances the                   rates of electron transfer are quite sensitive to the                           intervening medium and also to the surrounding solvent.                         Experiments to gain a general understanding of these effects                    will be undertaken by examining electron transfer in molecules                  that have been designed specifically for this purpose.  In                      particular, aspects of \"molecular recognition\" will be                          investigated.  Molecular recognition means that the specific                    structural features of one molecule will cause it to bind to                    another molecule in a highly controlled way;  this binding will                 then lead to effects on the rates that can be directly                          attributed to known aspects of the bound molecule.",
