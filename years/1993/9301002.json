 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues previous research in network time-                  synchronization technology and proposes new algorithms adapted for              use in high speed, wide area networks including supercomputers and              superscalar workstations.  The technology makes use of the Network              Time Protocol (NTP) widely used now in the Internet, together with              engineered modifications designed to improve accuracy in high speed             networks, including SONET and ATM.                                                   The project also involves the design and construction of                   precision timekeeping devices that provide improved timekeeping                 accuracy which it is expected to improve to some tens of                        microseconds in modern RISC-based workstations.  Finally, the                   project involves the conduct of experiments designed to evaluate                the success of the research and assist technology transfer to                   computer manufacturers and network providers.                                        The requested support will permit the assignment of                        professional management and staff resources to implement these                  programs so that the efforts of the regional and other midlevel                 network participants can be coordinated.",
