 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is based on the premise that mathematical                          knowledge is acquired through research, synthesis, practice and                 teaching. To effectively implement this belief, the mathematics                 department at Buffalo State College is creating a computer                      based Math Lab where faculty and student groups can do                          mathematics. We are assigning team \"discovery\" projects which                   complement the coursework, emphasizing the written and oral                     presentation of these projects. This project is impacting a                     large number of mathematics/secondary education majors in                       addition to other students taking these mathematics courses.                    Laboratories are being designed with the NCTM Curriculum and                    Evaluation Standards in mind.  These future teachers are                        learning mathematics as it is hoped they will later                             teach.Students and professors also use computers to do                          classroom demonstrations, which will be made available to                       students to view on their own in the lab. Finally, the lab is                   serving as a tutorial center conducted in part by the young and                 enthusiastic members of the math club, which is an active part                  of our math department.The laboratory consists of 20 Macintosh                  IIci computers, one laser postscript printer, and a powerbook                   with an overhead projector interface. The primary software                      packages are Mathematica, APL, and TEX. The courseware Matrix                   Algebra and Tarski's World are also used.They are making a                      substantive addition to their core courses by giving students                   \"field\" experience in a computer lab setting. Students are                      being actively involved in learning, and have the opportunity                   to explore new concepts, to collect and synthesize data                         obtained in the Math Lab, and then formalize and present their                  discoveries to the class.",
