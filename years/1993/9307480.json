 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, Mr. Kim Seung-Og will               collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze an                  extensive data set collected over 5 seasons of excavation at the                site of Taegok-ri which is located in the Bosung river basin in                 southwestern Korea. Situated on an alluvial plain the settlement                occupies an area of about 12,000 square meters. Excavation produced             approximately 150 houses and many functionally specific structures              including storage buildings and kilns. According to the preliminary             site reports its occupation extends from ca. 500 B.C. to 300 A.D.               About 108 well-preserved megalithic dolmens have also been found in             this region and appear associated with the site. Each contains up               to 20 human burials, many with associated artifacts. Mr. Seung-Og               will analyze both the burial and settlement remains. He will focus              on pottery which, in conjunction with absolute dating will provide              a sensitive chronological indicator. He will then study the                     organization of the settlement and the relationship between this,               the burial materials and the distribution of material remains. In               this way he will attempt to reconstruct the social and economic                 organization of this community.                                                                                                                                 Mr. Seung-Og shares with many archaeologists the goal of                        understanding how complex societies arise. The material with which              he will work documents an early stage in this process when social               stratification first becomes apparent and chiefdoms appear. The                 combination of a large extensively excavated site, a wealth of                  material remains and an associated cemetery provides an excellent               data base with which to address this issue. It will provide                     information directly comparable with research done in other regions             of the world.                                                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons. It addresses an                 important archaeological issue. It will make a rich and little                  known data base available to Western archaeologists and also                    strengthen scientific links between Korea and the United States.                Finally it will assist in the training of a promising young                     scientist.",
