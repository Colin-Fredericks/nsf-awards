 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the properties of superfluid He-3 and spin-              polarized He-3/He-4 mixtures.  He-3 serves as model complex                     superfluid.  Experiments on this system relate to other highly                  correlated systems, including high-Tc superconductors.  The                     collective modes in the superfluids will be investigated by                     acoustical methods, including second-sound.  Additional experiments             will use nuclear magnetic resonance as a characterization probe.                The experiments on dilute spin polarized He-3/He-4 mixtures will                focus on relaxation process in the fluids which arise via domain                wall or soliton motion in the fluids.  A goal of the research is to             determine the relative importance of direct radiation of                        radiofrequency, as compared with radiation of spin waves, as a                  domain wall moves in a magnetic field.                                          %%%                                                                             This project investigates the fundamental properties of fluids at               very low temperatures.  These \"superfluids\" exhibit behavior                    related to high-temperature superconductors, whose properties                   remain unexplained.  The superfluids also provide model system for              studying fundamental thermodynamics of fluid mixtures.  Again, the              results are relevant to systems at higher temperatures and in                   practical conditions.  Finally, the author has a facility that                  provides a way to apply a very large magnetic field to the samples              and hence carry out unique experiments to study magnetic domain                 wall motion, and other dynamical behavior exhibited by magnetic                 materials.",
