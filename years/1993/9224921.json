 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an examination of the geochemistry of naturally                 occurring trace elements in the Arctic Ocean.  The primary trace                element is aluminum, but measurements of iron, beryllium, and                   selenium will also be made.  The objective is to determine the                  magnitude, variability, and source of aluminum enrichment of the                shelf brines in the Barents, Kara, and Laptev Seas, and to use                  these results to infer hydrographic processes of the eastern Arctic             Ocean.                                                                                                                                                          The Norwegian and Greenland Seas have a dissolved aluminum                      concentration that is considerably higher than expected from the                exchange of water masses, pointing to a regional external source of             aluminum.  While the normal pathways are the dissolution of                     aluminum carried through the atmosphere and deposited at the                    surface, and through river discharge, an additional arctic pathway              is by fractionation in the freezing process.  That is, sea ice is               depleted and the resulting brine is enriched in aluminum.                                                                                                       The measurements will be made on a Summer 1993 cruise of the German             polar research vessel POLARSTERN as part of a wide-ranging physical             and chemical observing program.  An exceptional framework of                    hydrographic data will be available for the interpretation and                  analysis of these geochemical measurements.",
