 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanistic basis underlying intramolecular hydrogen migration              reactions in reactive organic and organometallic intermediates will             be studied. Low-temperature matrix isolation spectroscopy, low-                 temperature NMR spectroscopy, and time-resolved absorption                      spectroscopy will be used to establish rearrangement pathways and               to characterize the reactive species. Organic carbenes, organic                 nitrenes, and certain coordinately unsaturated 16-electron                      organometallic intermediates comprise an isolobal class of                      electron-deficient reactive intermediates that will be studied. In              the organometallic studies, low-temperature NMR will be used to                 follow the chemistry of reactive allyl hydride intermediates and                the involvement of these species in alkene isomerization processes.             Iron, Osmium, and Ruthenium metal atoms will be incorporated in the             organometallic intermediates. In particular, studies will be                    directed to allylic C-H and beta C-H insertion reactions. In the                organic studies, experiments will focus on direct observation of                hydrogen migration reactions of carbenes and 1,4-biradicals by                  time-resolved spectroscopy.                                                     %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of               Professor Robert J. McMahon at the University of Wisconsin. The                 details of how hydrogen atoms migrate in reactive electron-                     deficient organic and organometallic intermediates by                           intramolecular processes will be studied. These elusive                         intermediates will be studied at low temperatures by various                    spectroscopic methods in order to characterize the intermediates                and individual steps in the overall reaction. The reactive                      intermediates that will be studied include carbenes (divalent                   carbon species), nitrenes (monovalent nitrogen species), and                    organometallic intermediates that have 16 electrons rather than the             stable 18-electron complement about the metal atom. Iron, Osmium,               and Ruthenium metal atoms will be incorporated in the                           organometallic intermediates.",
