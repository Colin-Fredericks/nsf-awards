 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357373  Kiley  More than a century ago, Pasteur observed the profound effects of  oxygen on cell metabolism.  It is now known that oxygen has two  major effects.  First, excess oxygen can create reactive compounds  that damage key molecules in cells, and secondly, too little oxygen  may deplete energy resources vital for cell function.  Although  oxygen is known to play a pivotal role in cell physiology, little  is known about the molecular mechanism(s) used by cells to sense  and respond to changes in environmental oxygen concentrations.  To  begin to understand how this occurs, I will attempt to determine  how the Escherichia coli transcription factor Fnr is activated by  oxygen deprivation.  The increase in Fnr activity under anaerobic  conditions is critical for E. coli survival, since Fnr allows cells  to adapt to anoxia by altering expression of genes involved in  energy metabolism.  Since Fnr levels are not oxygen regulated, a  key problem is to identify the factor(s) which modulate its  activity.  Knowledge of such a factor(s) should ultimately allow  dissection of the pathway for cellular oxygen sensing.  In the  present research program biochemical, genetic and physiological  approaches will be used to learn how Fnr activity is regulated.   Specifically, we wish to define the steps in Fnr activation, so  that we may define how oxygen deprivation effects Fnr's  conformational and oligomeric state(s), and then identify factors  that regulate Fnr activity to gain insight into the pathway of  cellular oxygen sensing.  %%%  Many cells require oxygen to grow and to metabolism.  However, too  much oxygen can kill cells, and too little oxygen can stop their  growth.  As a result, for a cell to survive and grow efficiently,  there must be mechanisms which allow it to recognize oxygen and  protect itself against changing concentrations of the gas in its  environment.  Escherichia coli, a bacterium, has a factor called  Fnr, which may be involved in this detection system.  This factor  is formed  in cells when too little oxygen is available to support  cell growth.  In the absence of oxygen, the factor appears to  protect the cell by stopping the formation of certain enzymes  ordinarily needed to form energy in air.  The effect saves cell  energy until oxygen again is available and growth resumes.   Experiments in biochemistry, genetics and physiology will be  performed to determine how oxygen influences the structure of Fnr  and what other factor(s) might be involved in regulating its  formation.  ***",
