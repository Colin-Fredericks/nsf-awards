 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304992  Segall  A new method (termed the micropipet assay) has been  developed to demonstrate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells  direct growth of mating projections towards higher  concentrations of mating pheromone.  Current work studying  yeast mating has focussed on components that are absolutely  required for mating formation.  The micropipet assay allows  analysis of a new aspect of this pathway, gradient sensing,  and thus provides the potential for identifying proteins  specifically involved in this process.  The work described  here focuses on the signal transduction pathway that allows  yeast cells to determine the direction of an external  spatial gradient of mating factor.  The first objective is  to use this new method to assay mutants in genes potentially  involved in gradient sensing.  The second objective is to  identify new mutants specifically defective in this  orientation.  The first objective will utilize the  micropipet assay to characterize mutants in genes  potentially involved in sensing gradients of mating factor.   For example, mutants in the mating pathway, bud site  selection, and cytoskeletal proteins could have altered  abilities to sense and orient in spatial gradients.  The  second objective, identification of mutants defective in  orientation in spatial gradients, will involve a two stage  process.  The first stage is a genetic screen for mutants  with altered partner selection during mating.  The phenotype  expected for cells that no longer can determine the  direction of spatial gradients of mating factor is a more  random selection of mating partners.  A simple, visual color  assay of colonies on a plate will be used to identify  mutants that are still able to mate, but whose choice of  mating partner is no longer determined by the amount of  mating factor produced by that partner.  Strains that  reproducibly show reduced discrimination in this assay will  then be directly assayed using the micropipet assay for  orientation.  Strains  with reduced orientati on in the  micropipet assay will be grouped into complementation  groups, with the eventual goal of cloning the genes via  complementation with a genomic library.  %%%  This research is expected to provide insight into the  sensing of spatial gradients of chemicals in a wide variety  of organisms.  ***",
