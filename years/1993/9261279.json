 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chronic needs for higher materials performance in present and                   future commercial and military systems mandate improvements in                  materials properties.  High melting point, low density and high                 strength are among the material properties necessary to achieve                 future system performance goals.  Such requirements can no longer               be met using conventional metal alloys (including aluminum-based                alloys which melt at only 660 C).  Magnesium-based intermetallics               are among the best candidates to fulfill the aforementioned                     requirements.  Based on density, melting point (926 C), crystal                 structure (B2), and oxidation resistance considerations, an                     intermetallic compound MgY has significant potential as a light-                weight material for 500 C - 550 C applications.  The Phase I                    investigation concentrates on establishing the room and high                    temperature mechanical properties of the intermetallic MgY,                     improving the room temperature ductility, fracture toughness and                elevated temperature strength of the intermetallic.  The Phase I                investigation should establish the potential of dispersion-                     strengthened MgY for further development under a Phase II program.              Unique plasma synthesis processing will be utilized to produce                  these magnesium intermetallic alloys with specific strengths higher             than heretofore reported.                                                                                                                                       High strength-to-weight ratio magnesium intermetallic alloys have               a high demand in aerospace and transportation applications.                     Further, fiber-reinforced composites based on such intermetallic                matrices exhibit very high specific properties.",
