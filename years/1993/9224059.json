 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies in steam ecology have indicated that                             stream sediments support a biologically active                                  community.  This community is connected to the surface                          stream by vertical currents that transport substances                           such as nutrients and organic matter between these two                          areas.  Even when the stream appears \"dried up\", flow                           may continue beneath the sediment surface; thus,                                biological activity can continue in this \"hyporheic                             zone\" during drought.  While it is know that the                                hyporheic zone is biologically active; the source of                            energy supporting these activities is unknown.  The                             goal of this research is to determine how the hyporheic                         zone is \"fueled\" on a seasonal basis and between flood-                         disturbance events.                                                                                                                                             A combination of field measurements and experiments                             will be conducted to test several hypotheses explaining                         the economy of this ecological system.  Chief among                             these are that organic matter is derived from surface                           photosynthesis and transported either as dissolved or                           particulate material deep into the hyporheic zone.  An                          alternative is that organisms of this depend on                                 material derived from the terrestrial watershed (e.g.                           leaves, twigs, decomposed wood) and transported to the                          stream channel during flash floods.  A better                                   understanding of the hyporheic zone as part of the                              larger stream ecosystem will aid in managing this                               resource wisely and in extending environmental                                  protection to all functional components of the                                  ecosystem, including subsurface and groundwater                                 elements.",
