 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352680  Nyhof  In support of developing an investigative approach to the  physiology laboratory, the equipment requested in this project  will permit students to systematically study physiological  phenomena by forming hypotheses, devising the means to test  these hypotheses, systematically collecting the data, and  mathematically analyzing the data for critical evaluation. In  addition, students will experience a greater degree of hands-on  experimentation in the laboratory activities using the  independent data acquisition stations.  The equipment request is for computers using versatile  recording and analysis software. To interface with the  computers are signal amplifiers, force transducers, and  respiratory volume measuring equipment. Related laboratory  equipment will provide temperature regulation for isolated  tissue and capabilities to measure metabolic activity in  different types of isolated tissue. This equipment will provide  the opportunity for students to develop detailed investigations  into many aspects of both human and animal physiology using  state-of-the-art laboratory equipment. The versatility of the  equipment will encourage student experimentation by greatly  expanding the range of techniques currently possible and will  foster more systematic evaluation of the data collected.     ***",
