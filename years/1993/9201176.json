 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research from the mid-1980s has indicated that academic-industry                relations in fields closely allied to genetics may have                         significant effects on research activities, including the                       academic and commercial productivity of involved industries and                 scientists, as well as levels of secrecy, openness of                           communication and the direction of research in academic labs.                   Much remains to be learned about the long-term significance of                  these potential effects.  This grant provides funds to permit the               development of an ethics component in a large scale study of                    academic-industry relationships in genetics and life sciences,                  being supported through the National Institutes of Health.  This                support allows a philosopher and a sociologist to collaborate in                developing the ethics component, and in conducting and analysing                results from case studies and surveys of researchers who have                   received awards from the Human Genome Research program as well as               other academic life scientists.  The ethical topics deserving                   exploration include traditional scientific norms and                            counternorms, and also new areas of concern including research,                 organizational, and interpersonal misconduct.  Project results                  will be disseminated through books, articles, and presentations                 at professional associations and relevant meetings.",
