 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lucas  9222313    An important focus in the study of the functional significance of behavior has been  the impact of physiological state on the expression of foraging decisions.  In the  past, experimenters have imposed changes in hunger and mass on an animal and  have monitored the resulting changes in behavior.  However, behavioral systems  involve a feedback loop, because foraging decisions themselves will influence  further changes in physiological state.  Dr. Lucas's research will be one of the first  attempts to evaluate the entire feedback loop for a caching animal.    Food-caching behavior has often been seen as one mechanism that permits small  animals to live through energetically stressful periods, notably winter.  Dr. Lucas  has found that certain conditions actually retard the storage of food by chickadees,  and this in turn reduced the ability of these birds to maintain sufficient body mass  to survive when food was scarce.  The current reseearch is designed to study  conditions that affect the storage of energy, both in the form of body mass and  food stores.  Energy-storage tactics will in turn affect the ability of birds faced  with resource shortfall to alter their behavior in order to improve their chances of  survival.    Because Dr. Lucas will be studying regulation of body mass as well as food hoards,  his results will be broadly applicable to understanding regulation of energy and  body mass in any species, including humans.",
