 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some types of foraminiferan protozoa produce shells composed of                 mineral grains tightly bound by a chemically-resistant,                         biological cement.  During shell development, these single celled               animals collect mineral grains from the sediment and secrete                    cement in the proper amount and location to sculpt                              architecturally elegant structures.  The high abundance of                      certain giant species at an antarctic collection site makes the                 foraminiferan community there uniquely suited for studying                      specific aspects of such shell construction, and for addressing                 related questions concerning the evolution of the group.  Studies               on the development of these structures will focus on a giant                    one-celled species that allows the study of the secretion of                    cement in a cold-adapted marine organism without the                            complications of cell to cell and cell to tissue interactions                   common to multicellular animals.  Studies using time-lapse                      videomicroscopy, light- and electron-microscopic cell chemistry                 and gel electrophoresis will provide information on this kind of                test construction at the cellular and biochemical levels of                     analysis.  Materials testing combined with structural modelling                 will characterize the mechanical properties of the cement. From a               practical standpoint, this environmentally-safe cement binds                    immunoglobulins and has useful material properties that may have                applied biotechnological or biomedical applications.  Finally,                  molecular genetic analyses of selected species, will provide a                  much-needed framework for determining the evolution of this                     important protozoan group.  This highly interdisciplinary project               is made possible by new advances in biotechnology, and has both                 basic and applied implications for a variety of fields, including               medicine, molecular pharmacology, protozoan development and                     evolution, paleontology, engineering, and marine products                       chemistry to name a few.",
