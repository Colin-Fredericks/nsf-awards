The focus is on engineering analysis,  reliability, economics, and implementation of intelligent systems.   Several existing courses at Ohio State University will be combined  and developed into a new lecture-only course and a lecture-  laboratory course.  The first course will introduce intelligent  systems concepts, fuzzy logic and systems, contemporary fuzzy and  expert control techniques, and analytical techniques for  intelligent control systems, and will infuse research into the  classroom through introduction of current thesis topics that focus  on industrial applications and through guest lectures by colleagues  in academia, industry and government laboratories.  In the second  course, students will perform a series of experiments for an  introduction into experimental research and industrial  applications, and will complete a design project in intelligent  systems that includes laboratory implementation and practical  economic and reliability considerations.",
