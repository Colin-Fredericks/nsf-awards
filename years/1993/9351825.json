 "awd_abstract_narration": "A  new laboratory component is proposed for the introductory                    computer science sequence. A computer science facility will be                  established that will provide for an effective \"closed\"                         laboratory component to these courses. The project will affect                  all the courses taught by the computer science department. New                  computer-servers will be added to the existing network and will                 function as a computer science facility. Students taking                        computer science classes will be able to access this facility                   from on and off campus. Since it will be a department facility                  the students will be given as much access as possible. Material                 developed by previously and currently funded NSF projects will                  be used as much as possible in the development of the                           laboratories in this project. This will provide the best                        laboratory software as quickly and as expensively as is                         possible. Every student taking computer science courses, both                   majors and non majors will have the opportunity to learn as                     much as they can and will be better prepared for transfer to                    other colleges and universities.",
