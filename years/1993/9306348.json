 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range goal of this research is to define the role of the               lipid bilayer in mediating oxidative damage to membrane-associated              proteins.  The data resulting from the preliminary experiments                  proposed here will be the basis of a regular proposal to NSF.  That             proposal will be to use the model system consisting of cytochrome               b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase incorporated separately and together             into the bilayer of liposomes and to characterize, in terms of                  protein structure and function, the effects of free radical                     generation within the bilayer and from the acqueous media. Changes              in protein structure will be determined by peptide mapping on HPLC,             amino acid analysis and, ultimately, by protein sequencing.                     Oxidative damage to a cysteine or lysine residue essential for the              binding of NADH by cytochrome b5 reductase would be expected to                 result in impaired enzymic activity.  In addition,, the oxidation               of other amino acid residues including histidine, arginine and                  proline as well as cysteine or lysine residues of either protein,               not involved at the active site, could potentially impair function              because of alterations in conformation.  Finally, cytochrome b5                 contains heme iron which may serve as a nucleation site for                     oxidative damage of amino acid residues in which vicinity of the                heme or on a neighboring cytochrome b5 reductase molecule.                      Once the amino acid residues susceptible to oxidative damage are                known, careful studies can be done on the effect of changing the                lipid composition of the liposomes and contrasting the effects of               free radicals generated within the bilayer to those generated in                the surrounding aqueous compartment.                                            %%%                                                                             The studies proposed here will establish conditions for examining               oxidative modifications to membrane-associated enzymes in a model               system.  Oxidant species may originate exogenously from components              of tobacco smoke and air pollutants as well as exposure to                      radiation.  They may arise endogenously from normal metabolic                   reactions and through the metabolism of certain solvents, drugs and             pesticides.  Highly reactive oxidant molecules can cause tissue                 damage by reacting with polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell                     membranes, nucleotides in DNA and cytosolic proteins.  However,                 little is known about the extent of oxidation of proteins                       associated with lipid bilayers.  The potential for impaired                     function is great as membrane-associated proteins are responsible               for a host of reactions necessary to maintain viability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  //",
