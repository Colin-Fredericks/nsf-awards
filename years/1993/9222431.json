Specific improvements                   include herbarium cases to relieve crowding, replace older                      inadequate cases and accommodate growth for the next 4-5 years.                 Other improvements are a microscope for student and visitor use and             acid-free folders to replace ones that are potentially damaging to              specimens.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This project will greatly improve research, educational and public              service activities at the New Mexico State University herbarium,                which maintains a strong regional plant collection representing                 habitats from New Mexico and surrounding areas.  The collection                 will receive new cases to relieve crowding and accommodate 4-5                  years' growth, as well as a microscope for student and visitor use.             Apart from students at the university, the plant collection is a                resource for many local, state and federal agencies involved in                 land management, ecological studies, conservation and tourism.",
