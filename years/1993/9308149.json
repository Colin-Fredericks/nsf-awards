 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with applications of the concepts               of multivariate conditional hazard rate functions, and of                       stochastic convexity and concavity, for the purpose of                          characterizing optimal allocation policies, stochastic orders and               aging in reliability theory.  In many applications in reliability               theory, the main interest lies not necessarily in the total                     lifetime of the components of the system, but in the total                      benefit delivered by the system during its lifetime.  This is                   particularly important when a limited resource is available for                 enhancement of the components which make up the system.  Using                  the notions of majorization, stochastic convexity and stochastic                concavity, the optimal allocation policies will be sought.  The                 performance of reliability components is often strongly                         influenced by the environment in which they function.  Using the                multivariate conditional hazard rate functions, it is possible to               mathematically model such environments in a relatively simple                   manner.                                                                              This research is concerned with the applications of concepts               from statistics and probability for the purpose of characterizing               optimal allocation policies and aging in reliability theory.                    Performance of reliability components is often strongly                         influenced by the environment in which they function.                           Mathematical models will be described and analyzed, and optimal                 policies for allocation of limited resources will be                            characterized.",
