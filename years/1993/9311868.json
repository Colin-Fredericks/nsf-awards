Glass of the University                                  of Arizona Tucson and Drs. Jan Michalski, and                                   Aleksandra Skowronska of the Centre of                                          Molecular and Macromolecular Studies of the                                     Polish Academy of Studies.  The researchers                                     will develop the chemistry of selenophosphates,                                 devise chemoselective synthesis of                                              organoselenium compounds as models for                                          selective introduction of selenium moieties                                     into proteins and RNA's, and identification, by                                 comparison with authentic compounds, of P-Se                                    compounds produced enzymatically.  The proposed                                 international collaboration is mutually                                         beneficial because the Polish group's extensive                                 experience and expertise in the difficult                                       synthesis of organophosphorus-selenium                                          compounds is complemented by the mechanistic                                    and 77 NMR spectroscopic experience of the                                      American group.  This collaboration will                                        strengthen and broaden the research efforts and                                 infrastructure of the collaborating groups.                                     The proposed chemoselective methods for                                         introducing selenium into biomolecules, if                                      successful, would permit introduction of the                                    valuable 77Se NMR spectroscopic label.  This                                    label would allow structure studies using NMR                                   spectroscopy of these macromolecules (a project                                 in which the American group and Dr. T.C.                                        Stadtman of NIH collaborate).  Such methodology                                 would also facilitate synthesis of                                              semisynthetic enzymes with selenium at their                                    active site with potentially new and useful                                     catalytic activities as well as synthesis of                                    derivatives of biomolecules for multiwavelength                                 anomalous diffraction structural studies.                                                                                                                       This proposed research in chemistry fulfills                                    the program objectives of advancing science by                                  enabling leading experts in the U.S. and the                                    Poland to combine complementary talents and                                     pool research resources in areas of strong                                      mutual interest and competence.",
