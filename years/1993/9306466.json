 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306466  Carrier    Vigorous activity requires increased rates of metabolism, so for an  animal to sustain vigorous locomotion, it must breathe as it runs.   Lizards are unable to do both simultaneously, because the muscles  required for ventilation are also involved in locomotion, and can  not accomplish both functions at the same time.  Evidence from the  fossil record suggests that the early ancestors of birds and  mammals were probably also restricted in this way.  The research of  this proposal aims to increase our understanding of the mechanical  linkage between the locomorotr and ventilatory systems by  investigating the role of the axial musculo-skeletal system in  locomotion.  There are three main goals. The locomotor activity of  the epaxial and hypaxial muscles in green iguanas and domestic dogs  will be characterized by electromyography. This information is not  known for any tetrapod.   Then the activity of the external and  internal intercosatal muscles of dogs, lizards and opposums during  locomotion will be compared to their activity during ventilation of  the lungs.  Recordings of the forces exerted by their limbs on the  ground will be correlated with muscle acitivty to test hypotheses  of muscle function.  These stduies will result in a better  understanding of the function of these muscles, and by looking at  three different animals will aid in understanding the evolution of  the axial musculo-skeletal system.  ***",
