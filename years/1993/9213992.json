 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insulin is a protein hormone important in the regulation of blood               sugar or glucose.  This hormone exerts its effects on cells by                  binding to a cell surface receptor.  This binding causes the                    receptor to transmit signals into the interior of the cell which                result in the uptake of glucose.  While we know a great deal                    about the insulin receptor structure, it is not clear how its                   signals are transmitted within the cell or the components of its                signalling pathway.  Dr. Garofalo is using Drosophila as a model                to define the mechanisms of action of the insulin receptor.                     Drosophila contain both an insulin-like hormone and an insulin                  receptor which are strikingly similar to their human                            counterparts.  Since it is likely that the biochemical pathway                  involving this receptor has been conserved, research in this                    species which offers an unique advantage over other experimental                systems will undoubtedly lead to a better understanding of the                  components in the insulin receptor signalling pathway.  To                      address this important question, Dr. Garofalo is generating and                 characterizing mutations in the insulin receptor.  By examining                 the consequences of these mutations, he will begin to unravel the               function of the receptor.  This will provide a better                           understanding of the roles of the insulin receptor in                           development, and should also lead to the identification of other                genes encoding proteins important in signal transduction cascades               initiated by insulin or insulin-like growth factors.  Basic                     research on this fundamental mechanism is important for our                     understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes, a                  consequence of insulin deficiency and may eventually lead to                    identity of possible targets for therapeutic intervention.",
