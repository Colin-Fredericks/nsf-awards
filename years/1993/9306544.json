 "awd_abstract_narration": "Latombe  This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  This  research will investigate the spatial reasoning issues raised by  such questions as In which order can a product be assembled, what  parts should be removed from the assembled product to allow the  extraction of a specified subassembly, and what is the complexity  of the required motions and grasps.  The effort will also develop  efficient algorithms to answer these questions, given a CAD  description of a product.  The goals of this research include: (1)  Developing assembly planning algorithms that take a wide range of  constraints into account, including part collision, subassembly  stability, grasping, and fixturing, in order to produce realistic  assembly plans; (2) Improving the computational complexity of these  algorithms in order to make them efficient enough to be eventually  applicable to products made of several hundreds or thousands of  parts, for which automated reasoning tools are particularly  critical; (3) Developing algorithms for inferring the inherent  complexity of an assembly product, i.e., a lower-bound on the  complexity of all assembly plans for this product along various  dimensions (e.g., number of steps, hands, motions, degrees of  freedom); and (4) Studying incremental versions of the above  algorithms that will be applicable at low marginal cost while a new  assembly product is being designed, in order to provide quick,  pertinent feedback to the designers.  These issues will be  investigated with the use of the ``non-directional blocking  graph,'' which addresses the intrinsic structure of a product as  determined by the potential interference relations among its  components.  Because the intrinsic interference structure of a  product is a compact representation of all feasible assembly plans,  not just of a few of them, it should make it possible to estimate  inherent complexity measures of the product and generate plans with  the lowest complexity, without having to explicitly enumerate all   assembly plans.",
