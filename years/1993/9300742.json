 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research aims at determining the                    feasibility and practicality of recently developed machine learning             methods to the acquisition and/or creation of conceptual design                 knowledge.  Specifically, this research investigates, enhances and              adapts to the design problems new methods of constructive induction             that are capable of automatically inventing new problem-oriented                attributes, in contrast to the conventional machine learning                    methods that use only the attributes given in advance by the user.              Two novel approaches are investigated-DCI (data-driven constructive             induction) and HCI (hypothesis-driven constructive induction).                       The first part of this research studies, adapts, and                       experimentally tests the methods on the problems of learning                    decision rules for conceptual design of wind bracing in tall                    buildings.  The  primary training data is a collection of optimal               (minimum weight) designs produced by a design and  optimization                 computer system.  In the second part, the methodological experience             gained will be used to suggest and implement improvement to the                 methods, and to synergistically integrate them into a single                    system, specifically oriented toward problems of conceptual design.             This experience will be also utilized to develop a method for                   applying constructive induction-based learning systems in design                knowledge acquisition.  The resulting system and method will be                 tested in an industrial environment.  The research has a potential              to significantly improve conceptual design by developing a new                  powerful tool for the designers, as well as to make contributions               to the field of machine learning by conducting the study in the                 context of practical and important real-world problems.",
