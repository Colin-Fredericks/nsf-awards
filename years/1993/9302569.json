This 19th meeting is being held in Zaragoza               Spain from August 22 to 29.  This award partially supports the                  international travel costs of at least 23 American researchers in               the fields of history of science and technology and the social                  studies of science and technology.                                                                                                                              US researchers play a disproportionately large role in the                      development of science and technology studies today.  It is                     important that the strength and vitality of US scholarship be                   demonstrated at these meetings.  More important, however, is the                chance to expose US researchers to the leading researchers in                   science and technology studies from Europe, Asia, Africa and South              America.  Spain provides an ideal site for such an international                meeting at a time when the discovery by Europeans of new worlds is              being reflected upon.  The exchange of ideas and approaches among               international scholars and the professional contacts which will be              established at this meeting promise to enliven and strength                     research around the world.",
