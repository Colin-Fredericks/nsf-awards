An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Ergonomics can study the systematic and rational means to fit the  work to the person.  The primary goal of the proposed Center's  research would be to improve work performance and safety through  the study and development of general principles that govern the  interaction of humans and their working environment.    This action funds Texas A&M University to hold a planning meeting  with potential industry members to determine a possible research  agenda for the Center and its potential for support as an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center.    The Co-Principal Investigators are nationally recognized  researchers in ergonomics and have the facilities to conduct a  planning meeting.    The Program Manager recommends that Texas A&M University be awarded  $10,000 for one year for this project.",
