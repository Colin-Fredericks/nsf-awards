 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program has                            transformed itself from a loosely affiliated collection                         of sites to an integrated network.  Recent                                      accomplishments include: development of an effective                            electronic communication system; creation of data                               catalogs and shared data sets, including comprehensive                          satellite imagery for the network of sites; stimulation                         of cross-site syntheses and experiments; and linking                            with other scientific centers and federal agencies.                             Collectively, the LTER Network has expanded its focus                           to include larger spatial dimensions (regional and                              global) and has assumed a leadership role in ecological                         research involving long-term experimentation and                                observation and multi-site synthesis.                                                                                                                           The networked activities of LTER had allowed scientific                         collaboration far beyond the formal LTER Network.                               Initial collaborations with the general ecological                              community and other research organizations and agencies                         have involved research planning and electronic                                  communication.  During the next two years LTER expects                          to forge new linkages with such diverse entities as the                         NSF-funded supercomputer and GIS centers, NASA, and                             LTER-like programs in other countries.                                                                                                                          This project will presents the continuation of                                  activities which facilitate collaborative research in                           the LTER Network and provide the linkages to other                              long-term research networks (domestic and                                       international), agency programs, and scientists.  Most                          of the resources will be used to support the                                    infrastructure of the organized, electronically-linked                          group of scientists working on multi-site research and                          synthesis within and beyond the formal LTER Program.                            Support of Network communication, information and data                          exchange continues as a primary focus for the Network                           Office.  A major element is electronic access and                               information exchange, ranging from electronic mail                              services to on-line databases and data sharing.  A                              special project during this proposal period (1993) is                           the third LTER All Scientists meeting and an associated                         international LTER summit.                                                                                                                                      The major strategic emphasis in the next two years is                           building working linkages with other agencies,                                  institutions, research programs, and scientists with                            interests in long-term ecological research, including                           other NSF-funded science centers.  Proposed activities                          include: (1) Expansion of the existing communication                            network, data catalog, and on-line databases and                                development of a bibliographic database;                                                                                                                        (2) Acquisition, archiving, and analysis of an array of                         remotely sensed data from collaboration with NASA and                           the Supercomputer Centers; (3) Maintenance of the                               facilitating structure and publication program                                  associated with the Coordinating Committee and LTER                             Network; and (4) Increased involvement with other long-                         term research programs both domestically (e.g.,                                 sponsored by USGS, USDA, and NPS) and internationally.                          Research and development efforts by the network staff                           will occur in areas of database management, remotely                            sensed data, geographic information analysis, and                               intersite comparisons.",
