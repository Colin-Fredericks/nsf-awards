In recent decades, the United States has led all                     industrialized nations in per capita fire losses.                                                                                                                    Over the past 30 years, great advancements have been made in               the scientific understanding of fire behavior and the performance               of fire protection systems.  Indeed, a fire protection engineering              discipline is emerging to deal with this problem of national                    importance.                                                                                                                                                          In the 1970's, Worcester Polytechnic Institute recognized the              growing body of knowledge in fire science and the enormous                      potential it had to offer for the greater social good.  In 1979, it             implemented the firs-of-its-kind master's degree program in fire                protection engineering to help the nation move forward in the                   development of this discipline and to produce more human resources              to apply new technologies to the solution of complex fire problems.                                                                                                  It was soon recognized that doctoral professionals were sorely             needed to write the textbooks of the future, perform leading edge               research, to teach and to work in industrial and government                     laboratories, worldwide.  Accordingly, in 1991 WPI launched the                 first-of-its-kind doctoral degree program in fire protection                    engineering...building on its successful track record at the                    master's level.                                                                                                                                                      This Graduate Research Traineeship proposal will establish the             first critical mass of Ph.D. fire protection engineering scholars.              Five candidates will be selected as a result of an intensive                    nationwide recruitment campaign focusing on campus engineering                  society organizations and other specialty groups networked to                   women, minorities and students with disabilities.",
