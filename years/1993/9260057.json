 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLC),                    optically more efficient light valves (compared to TNLC                         technology) for projection LCD displays are now feasible, as                    polarizers are not needed for light modulation.  The same                       benefits cannot be achieved for direct-view displays as the                     diffuse backlight cannot be modulated by scattering with the same               efficiency as the highly collimated beam used in projection                     displays.  Dye has to be added to the PDLC formulation in order                 to achieve an acceptable contrast.  However, by adding the dye to               the PDLC formulation, the optical efficiency of such a display                  becomes comparable to a standard TNLC display.  In order to                     improve the optical efficiency of direct-view displays, a new                   concept of micro-projection has been conceived wherein each pixel               becomes a miniaturized projector.  This display system can use a                PDLC without a dye.  Additional improvement is achieved by almost               full utilization of the available collimated light which can be                 steered by a microlens array to pass by the opaque structures on                the active matrix substrate (AM circuitry) and color filter                     (black matrix).  Significantly brighter direct-view displays with               a contrast ratio of 100:1 should be achievable.",
