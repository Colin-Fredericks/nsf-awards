 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference, Arithmetic Geometry with an Emphasis in                    Iwasawa Theory, is to be held at Arizona State University, March                15-18, 1993.  This conference has several goals.                                                                                                                     .  Recently, there has been a great deal of activity                               and many striking advances in arithmetic                                        geometry.  Due to the heavy backlog in journals,                                work frequently does not appear in print for                                    several years after completion.  This conference                                will provide a means for researchers outside of                                 select circles to learn what is currently the                                   state of the art.                                                                                                                                            .  The problem of time lag alluded to above is more                                acute for new conjectures and work in progress.                                 The overwhelming preponderance of journal                                       articles in number theory are for finished work.                                The conference will provide an arena for                                        researchers to pose new questions to the number                                 theory community, offering interesting ideas for                                new directions researchers may wish to take.                                                                                                                 .  By bringing people together from across the                                     country and around the world, the conference will                               facilitate researchers discussing their work with                               the world's experts, potentially leading to new                                 insights.                                                                                                                                                    .  Finally, talks which survey a sub specialty can                                 provide direction for researchers looking to                                    enter a new area (especially graduate students).                                                                                                             The conference will include a combination of one hour and                  half hour talks, with no two given simultaneously (so that                      participants can attend them all).  All of the talks will be on                 the conference theme of arithmetic geometry; some talks will                    focus on recent results, some on new conjectures, and others will               give overviews of sub-disciplines within arithmetic geometry.                   All lectures and informal discussion periods will take place in                 space provided by the mathematics department on the Arizona State               University campus.",
