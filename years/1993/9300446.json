 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300446  Davis       This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing  award.  Conventional computer models of physical processes demand  precise mathematical accounts of the laws governing the domain and  precise numerical measurements of the particular system being  modelled.  Human reasoners, by contrast, can often come to useful  conclusions even when they have only a partial model of the  underlying physics or partial knowledge of the parameters of the  particular system.  It would be of great practical value and  theoretical interest to implement a computer system that could do  likewise.  Artificial intelligence work on qualitative physical  reasoning has obtained interesting but limited results in this  direction.  Building such systems of greater flexibility and power  will require an extensive study of the issues of representation and  inference that arise within physical reasoning.  This work will  concentrate primarily on formally characterizing a wide range of  physical domains and the perceptual and effectual interfaces  between robotics and physics; on developing useful representations  for qualitative spatial information and techniques for dealing with  this information; and on developing inference techniques that  support temporal reasoning over extended intervals.",
