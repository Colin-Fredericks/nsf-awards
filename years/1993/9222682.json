 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent emphasis on strongly correlated fermion systems,                     stimulated in part by the discovery of high temperature                         superconductivity, has led to the development of new concepts and               techniques which go beyond the conventional Landau theory of a                  Fermi liquid which for four decades has been the basis for the                  understanding of metals, semiconductors, insulators and                         superconductors.  The strong interactions between electrons in the              oxides, when compared to the relatively narrow band widths                      involved, lead to partial charge localization and local magnetic                moment formation.  These moments, coupled by exchange interactions,             produce antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations which exhibit long                  range spin order at low temperature for certain ranges of electron              concentration.  This research addresses the nature and mechanism of             the transition from Fermi liquid to strongly correlated behavior                with emphasis on the spin correlation effects as seen by neutron                scattering, magnetic resonance, photoemission and transport                     properties.  Continuing previous work, the one electron spectrum                and the dynamic spin susceptibility are being studied using                     diagram, functional integral and numerical methods based on one-                and three-band Hubbard models.  A new transport equation is being               developed to include strong spin fluctuation effects.  Contact with             experiment and other theoretical approaches will be stressed.                   %%%                                                                             The theoretical research will address the transition in interacting             systems of electrons when they go from conditions in which they can             be treated as independent particles to when they are strongly                   correlated.  The conditions for this transition, and the                        theoretical techniques to deal with it, lie at the foundations of               much of current condensed matter physics including the high                     temperature superconductors.",
