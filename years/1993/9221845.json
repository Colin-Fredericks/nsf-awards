 "awd_abstract_narration": "9221845  Trigo    Abkhaz, a Northwest Caucasian language spoken in Turkey and the  Georgians S.S.R. is typologically anomalous in that it exhibits  an extraordinarily complex consonantal inventory.   Morphologically, it is an ergative language in which virtually  the entire syntactic structure of the clause is capitulated in  the verbal complex.  It contains several grammatical subsystems  that interact with each other in ways that are relevant to  theories of sound patterning (morpho-phonology) and sound  realization (phonetics).  The grammar of Abkhaz has been well  described, but descriptive and theoretical work on the above  topics has been superficial and of limited access.  Moreover,  present demographics and political conditions in Georgia and  Turkey pose a significant threat to the language of the Abkhaz.    The Principal Investigator will work with her consultant of the  last two years and with two additional speakers to transcribe,  analyze, gloss, and translate new and existing data.  In  addition, the PI will record and analyze the acoustic properties  of the various sounds of the language.  The PI will also  investigate specific linguistic hypotheses about the grammar of  Abkhaz based on the analyzed corpus of data.  This will culminate  in a volume describing the sound system and morpho-phonology of  Abkhaz.   ***",
