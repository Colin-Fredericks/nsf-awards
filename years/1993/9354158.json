 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354158  Lyons, Sr.    Several sources indicate that HBCUs have been the major source of  B.S. degrees awarded to African-Americans i Science, Engineering  and Mathematics (SEM) disciplines.  But the situation is rapidly  changing.  Several data also suggests that SEM bachelor degrees  awarded to African-Americans by HBCus has been declining since  1987.  The Jackson State University School of Science & Technology  (JSU-SS&T) is submitting a proposal for a planning grant to develop  thorough, comprehensive Model Institution for Excellence (MIE)  implementation project that will enhance existing programs and  create new areas of strength in science and technology.   The  planning grant will provide resources to review, assess, and  evaluate in a systematic way, the process presently being used in  the recruitment retention, and graduation of students in SEM  education.  Enhanced/corrective strategies will be planned for  implementation using known models which have proven successful.    The overall project goal is to enhance and strengthen JSU's SEM  degree-producing capacity all levels and increase the number of SEM  graduates, especially minorities quality scientists/engineers who  can contribute to advancing the state of SEM knowledge and address  the technical problems of society.  Specific focus will be directed  toward identifying, enhancing, or developing programs to increase  SEM recruitment, enrollment, retention, graduation rate, and  students pursuing graduate degrees.  It is expected that all areas  will be improved by at least 100% over the 1988-92 (five-year)  average.  Activities to be developed in support of JSU MIE goals  include:  curricula analyses and restructuring, enhancement of  specialized SEM academic programs, development of new degree  programs, development of a comprehensive SEM student support  center, integration of information technology into the curricula,  and enhancement of the educational/research support infrastructure.    Jackson State University's administrat ion is totally committed to  the success of the MIE initiative - planning phase and  implementation.  It's commitment is demonstrated by the fact that  the Project Director is the President of the University and the Co-  Project Director is the Dean of the School of Science & Technology,  the unit responsible for the planning and implementation of the  project.  Several faculty representing various disciplines are  responsible for key components of project planning and  implementation.  The project leadership by the President of the  University will stimulate involvement of the whole University, with  its various support mechanisms, to ensure inclusion, diversity and  success.    To develop a complete, comprehensive proposal to establish a Model  Institution for Excellence at JSU, a total of $75,000 is being  requested.  In an effort to sustain program operations beyond  federal funding, the JSU MIE key strategy is to establish and  maintain a SEM Endowment through contributions form industry  partners committed to the MIE program goals and continuity.   Several representatives from industry partners in this planning  process and indicated continued support through the development and  implementation phases.",
