 "awd_abstract_narration": "Butterflyfishes make excellent models for studying patterns of             genetic variation and diversification in marine organisms.  They                are common and conspicuous members of coral reef communities and                display considerable ecological diversity.  This study is designed              to integrate population genetics (using both nuclear and                        mitochondrial gene markers) and ecology in an effort to examine                 overall patterns of variation seen in related species of Indo-west              Pacific Butterflyfishes.  Indo-west Pacific coral reef communities              are some of the most diverse, and possibly threatened, marine                   systems.  Research on Butterflyfishes will provide valuable                     information on how such coral reef communities form from an                     historical perspective.  In addition, the combined use of genetic               and morphological markers will provide a better assessment of the               uniqueness of various Butterflyfish stocks occupying these coral                reef communities, an absolute necessity for the preservation and                management of biodiversity.",
