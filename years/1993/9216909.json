 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in condensed matter physics involving Peter A. Schroeder,                       William P. Pratt and Jack Bass of Michigan State University and                 Albert Fert of the University of Paris (Orsay), and M. Panissod                 of the Institute of the Physics and Chemistry of Materials in                   Strasbourg, France.  The subject of the research explores the                   recent discovery that metallic multilayers with one ferromagnetic               component, display Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR).  GMR, a                       large drop in resistance when a magnetic field is applied, has                  been observed in several systems of metallic materials. The                     investigators propose to understand the physics involved and find               other systems which exhibit similar properties. The research has                important practical applications in the area of magnetic storage                and magnetic sensors and could lead to improved commercial                      devices based on GMR.                                                                                                                                           This cooperative research project takes advantage of unique                     facilities in Orsay and Strasbourg and complementary expertise of               the U.S. and French research groups.  The Michigan State group                  has a unique sputtering system, which has produced record high                  GMR samples.  They have also developed techniques for                           measuring magnetoresistance of metallic multilayers.  The Orsay                 group was the first to discover the GMR phenomenon and bring                    to this collaboration their expertise in characterization of                    materials, which is further enhanced by NMR (nuclear magnetic                   resonance) techniques and theoretical expertise of the Strasbourg               investigators.",
