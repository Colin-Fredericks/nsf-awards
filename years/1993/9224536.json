 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael Klein is supported by a grant from the                        Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                 research in the application of computer simulations of                          classical and quantum phenomena in condensed molecular systems.                 Constant pressure molecular dynamics will be used to                            characterize disordered phases, and to study phase transitions                  in molecular systems including fullerenes and sulfate crystals.                 Path-integral Monte Carlo will be used to characterize and                      study quantum phenomena in solids, fluids and clusters, and                     quantum simulations using the Car-Parnello approach will be                     used to probe the electronic states of metal ammonia solutions                  as they pass through the metal-insulator transition region.                     %%%                                                                             Computer simulation of molecular systems is providing many rich                 insights into chemical behavior at the molecular level.  As the                 computer algorithms and force field models continue to improve,                 it becomes possible to study larger systems, and to gain useful                 insights regarding more and more physical and chemical                          properties.  Using a combination of simulation techniques                       including molecular dynamics, quantum Monte Carlo, and                          Car-Paranello theory, Klein is able to perform computer                         simulations on systems consisting of large numbers of molecules                 such as crystalline substances, and metal ammonia solutions.                    He is able to study a number of important chemical and physical                 properties of interest in the design of new materials.",
