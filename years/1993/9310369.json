Among the committee's accomplishments are development  of three major interdisciplinary research projects that involve  eighty researchers from around the world, sponsorship of  workshops and other gatherings to stimulate research, and  development of plans for training institutes and fellowships.  This renewal award continues support for core operations for the  committee for three additional years.  Among the activities to be  undertaken by the committee over that period are continued  catalytic development of major international, interdisciplinary  research projects, exploration of a variety of ways to foster  interdisciplinary research training, and sponsorship of the first  regularly scheduled meeting of researchers examining the human  dimensions of global environmental change, tentatively scheduled  for October 1994.       Through continued operation of the SSRC Committee for  Research on Global Environmental Change, major interdisciplinary  research and training activities designed to attract more  scientists to the study of longer-term, wide-ranging human-  environmental interactions will continue.  Special emphasis on  expansion of outreach activities during the next three years  should increase the number of scholars who benefit directly  through participation in committee-sponsored activities and  indirectly through the advancement of research on this important  topic.  ***",
