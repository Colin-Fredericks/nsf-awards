 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309514  Rios-Rull    The principal investigator will study a series of interrelated  projects, all of them sharing the feature of studying the  determinants and the dynamics of the income and wealth  distribution.    The projects can be divided into two main groups differing in the  mechanism in place for the redistribution of income and wealth.   The first group of projects considers uninsurable employment risks,  while the second group allows for redistribution through tax  policies that are endogenously generated by the interaction of  agents.    The first project tries to answer the question of whether the key  properties of the income distribution in postwar U.S. can be  accounted for by the movements associated with fluctuations in  economic activity.  Both employment and the factor shares of output  present strong cyclical behavior.  The models used are hard to work  out and this study will solve a simpler approximated economy.   Associated with the problem just described is the question of what  can account for the large values of the Gini Indices in the  distribution of wealth.  This issue of understanding the origins of  the large wealth and income inequality is addressed in a second  project that tries to determine the properties of the process for  uninsurable labor income risk that are required to obtain wealth  distributions like the one observed.  This labor income process  will be compared to those found in empirical studies.    The second main part of this research deals with general issues of  economic policy determination and its relation to the distribution  of people over key variables, like wealth.  It builds on a dynamic  notion of political equilibrium.  The specific projects involved  are, first, to investigate the success of the redistributional  model, in accounting for empirical findings that relate growth  performance and the distribution of wealth.  The second project  explores the changes in the income and wealth distribution since  World War II.  It aims to find  out how much of those changes can be  accounted for purely on redistributional grounds.    ***",
