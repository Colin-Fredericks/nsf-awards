 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of flavins and flavoproteins is a broad, but clearly and               simply defined one.  It covers all aspects of work pertaining to                the chemistry and biology of compounds based on the isoalloxazine               nucleus and on a very few closely related structures.  Because of               the extraordinary versatility of flavins as a prosthetic group                  and its involvement in a variety of important biological                        oxidation and reduction processes, this area continues to expand                rapidly.  Interest in flavins ranges from theoretical chemistry                 to medical aspects.                                                             %%%                                                                             The 11th International Symposium on Flavins and Flavoproteins                   will be held in Nagoya, Japan in 1993 as one of a series which                  has been organized at 3 year intervals since 1965.  Because of                  the continued and increasing pace of research in this area, it is               important that regularly scheduled meetings be held.  The attempt               has been to plan such symposia at three year intervals in order                 to maximize communication of the rapidly acquired new knowledge,                allow timely adjustments on best directions to follow and                       stimulate new research.  Review lectures will cover the entire                  field and the meeting will bring together scientists from all                   over the world from a wide variety of disciplines and promote                   valuable discussion and exchange of information.",
