 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307225  Thorp   Factors regulating biotic communities in large rivers are poorly known   both because of the dearth of research on large rivers in general (4% of stream   studies) and because of the lack of experimental techniques to study these   ecosystems. The PI's hypothesize that riverine plankton, or potamoplankton, in   the Ohio River are physically controlled during period of high river discharge and   turbidity (Phase I) and relatively biologically controlled at other times of the year   (Phase II). This research will examine experimentally the importance of   vertebrate planktivory by emerald shiners and rotifer-copepod interactions in   Phases I and II. To do so, the PI's will employ unique \"potamocorrals\" (in situ   floating nitex enclosures) in four drift experiments in the Ohio River. During   these studies, data will be collected to test the efficacy of these enclosures   relative to ambient conditions.   %%%  Potamocorrals should prove useful for both basic and applied research, such as   the effects of energy byproducts on riverine plankton. Also, this research will add   much needed data on the effects of different disturbance agents on the   biodiversity of large river systems.  ***",
