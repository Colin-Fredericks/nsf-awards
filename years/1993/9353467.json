These institutions, as members of The University of North  Carolina system have entered into a consortium (North Carolina  Consortium for  Undergraduate Research (NCCUR)) to promote the  development of institutions-wide undergraduate research programs,  to enhance research activities, and to implement the Seizing  Opportunities for Advancing Research Scholars (SOARS) Program.  The  SOARS Program initially will involve twelve (12) undergraduate  students from the six campuses in research projects distributed  among six (6) Undergraduate Research Groups (URGs) directed by  faculty researchers selected by the six Consortium institutions.   The research projects available in the 6 URGs are widely  diversified, and all have some form of collaboration with major  research universities in the State of North Carolina.",
