 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304691  Chen  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program in the  Chemistry Division, Prof. Y. Chen of the University of  California at Berkeley will pursue a program of research to  provide a systematic understanding of the interplay between  intramolecular energy transfer and chemical reactions.  To this  end the new technique of femtosecond time-domain Transient  Stimulated Emission Pumping (TSEP) spectroscopy invented by him  will be applied to two model systems, ozone and methylnitrite  to obtain real-time emission spectra during the  photofragmentation of these species.  %%%  The details of chemical reaction and dissociation processes  occur at pico- to femtosecond time scales and research in this  field is at the forefront of contemporary physical chemistry.  Among the questions posed by these processes is how the energy  which excites a specific molecular vibrational state  redistributes itself within the molecule to result in the  dissociation of the molecule by the breaking of a specific  chemical bond or in the molecular rearrangement into a  different conformational structure.  The STEP method possesses  several distinct advantages over other techniques currently in  use: it is capable of furnishing both time and frequency  information, the spectral assignments are unambiguous, and it  has high sensitivity.  These make the STEP method an ideal tool  for studying the energy transfer and chemical reactions in  polyatomic systems.  ***",
