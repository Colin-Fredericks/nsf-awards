 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical solutions to the problem of salt water intrusion have                 traditionally been validated by attempting to reproduce previous                numerical and analytical solutions.  In recent years, our ability               to solve the governing equations accurately has improved                        dramatically due to superior numerical algorithms and the                       widespread availability of computational resources.  Yet no recent              studies have examined the accuracy of salt water intrusion models               by comparison of sand box model studies with numerical solutions                to the problem.  Furthermore, there are some fundamental problems               with current salt water intrusion models related to the underlying              dispersion and diffusion mechanisms which couple the fluid flow                 equation to the solute transport equation.                                      In this study, we propose to compare the results of sand box model              experiments with numerical models of the same problem in order to               evaluate the accuracy of the standard mathematical model for salt               water intrusion and to develop new mathematical models of the                   saltwater intrusion process which better describe the physics and               chemistry of the density-coupled flow and transport process.  The               sand box model experiments will serve as a new and unique data set              with which to verify the correctness of the new approach and to                 validate numerical models of salt water intrusion.",
