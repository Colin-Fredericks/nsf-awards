 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents the balance of support required for studies             related to time-series sediment trapping in the Sargasso Sea and                for assuring continuation of the work beyond the present P.I.'s                 full-time involvement.  The proposed work has two primary                       objectives: (1) A major portion of the effort will be spent on                  identifying relationships between surface-ocean variables and deep-             ocean carbon flux.  The marine biota is thought by many                         investigators to play an important part in the removal of carbon                from the atmosphere and upper ocean to the deep ocean through the               production of organic and carbonate particles which sink out of the             mixed layer.  There is, however, a considerable range in estimates              of the effectiveness of this mechanism, the \"biological pump\",                  relative to the amounts of carbon dioxide injected into the                     atmosphere by human activities.  An assessment of the magnitude,                variability and secular trend of the pump is thus desirable.                    Direct measurement of deep-ocean carbon flux is far too expensive               and labor-intensive to be done on a large scale over extended                   periods.  However, there is a distinct possibility that much more               easily monitored surface-ocean properties may serve as proxies for              deep carbon flux.  To test this hypothesis, this study will                     investigate whether or not carbon flux varies in a consistent                   relationship to variations in one or a combination of several of                those surface properties.  Identification of suitable proxies may               permit long-term monitoring of the deep carbon flux on large                    scales.  Comparative studies of existing time series of remote-                 sensing, meteorologic, and hydrographic data on one hand and of                 deep carbon-flux data on the other are a promising approach.  The               emphasis in such studies will be on other-than-annual periods                   because the annual cycle, common to all likely proxy candidates, is             of little value in revealing causative connections.  Comparisons                will be made between continuous deep carbon-flux measurements in                the Sargasso Sea and a superior variety of hydrographic and                     meteorologic data sets, as well as satellite data, for the area.                While the Sargasso Sea is representative of only one of several                 major oceanographic domains which are likely to have different                  characteristic proxies and proxy-carbon flux relationships, the                 ability to assess carbon flux by means of proxies even in part of               the ocean can free resources for more intensive in-situ studies in              other areas.  (2) Present modeling efforts at determining means and             time variances of the source areas and paths of particles collected             by sediment traps at different depths, i.e. using real and model                current vectors in the sampling area to delineate the shapes of the             statistical funnels connecting the traps to the sea surface, will               be completed.",
