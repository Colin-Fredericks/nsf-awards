 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311544  Hall    Several theorists have suggested that subtle aspects of nonverbal communication help to foster dominance relations among individuals, both as role displays and as means of interpersonal control.  These writers propose that subordinate or low status people (such as women) are especially sensitive to nonverbal communication, and that behaviors such as interpersonal touch and smiling both create and maintain a dominance/status hierarchy between sexes.  However, others have noted that although nonverbal gender differences are well documented, there is only a slim empirical foundation thus far for dominance/status as the explanation.  The present research will help to establish how dominance/status, measured in several ways, relates to nonverbal communication and to nonverbal gender differences.    Four studies will be conducted.  The first study, conducted in a laboratory, will relate ability to decode nonverbal cues to trait measures of status/dominance and will measure nonverbal behavior is a structured interaction in which dominance/status roles are assigned experimentally.  In Studies 2 and 3, attendees at psychology and philosophy professional meetings, respectively, will be observed for instances of interpersonal touch, and their genders and names/affiliations will be noted.  Touch will be related to objective indicators of status/prestige.  In Study 4, employees in the company headquarters of a convenience foodstore chain will be videotaped while interacting in a controlled situation, and their respective status's in the organization, genders, and nonverbal behaviors will be recorded.    The value o f the work will be (a) in providing a wide set of definitions of dominance/status, (b) in relating dominance/status to a wide range of nonverbal skills and behaviors, (c) in conducting studies in both laboratory and field settings, (d) in addressing  key gaps in  current knowledge and theory, variables to nonverbal communication, and (e) in testing whether these relations are capable of statistically accounting for sex differences in the nonverbal communication skills and behaviors observed.  The significance of the research goes beyond the study of gender.  For example, subtle nonverbal cues indicating dominance and subordination may help to express and maintain racism, through self-fulfilling interpersonal expectations.  And, in work environments, hierarchical roles may be hard to break down due to employees' continued but unconscious use of dominance and subordination cues.  ons of the ways that different things relate to each other at specific places and the ways that places are connected with each other.
