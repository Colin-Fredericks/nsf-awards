 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307676  Hadjipanayis  This project deals with the synthesis and characterization of  granular solids and exchange-coupled magnetic metal multilayers.   The magnetic properties will be correlated with the microstructure  and the magnetic domain structure observed by Lorentz microscopy.   The magnetic studies include field and temperature dependence of  coercivity, remanence curves, anisotropy measurements, and magnetic  after effects.  The magnetic properties of iron and cobalt granular  solids will be studied systematically by investigating the effects  of sample preparation, different matrix material, film  microstructure and particle interactions.  Similar Studies will be  made on iron/iron oxide and cobalt/coblat oxide films.  The  research includes modeling studies of the micromagnetic behavior of  the materials.  %%%  This project will support research that will produce new types of  magnetic materials.  Some of the materials consist of small  magnetic particles.  Others are thin films of iron and cobalt and  ion and cobalt oxides.  The materials are of fundamental interest,  but are of great technological interest also in the area of  magnetic recording materials.  The complex materials properties of  the magnets will be characterized by a variety of techniques,  electron microscopy.  In addition, the properties of the materials  will be modeled as an aid in the interpretation of the observed  phenomena.  ***",
