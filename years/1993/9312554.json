 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312554  Georgakis    This award provides funding the first year of a three-year  continuing award for a \"Self-Sufficient Partnership award for  Research \" at Lehigh University's Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center for Chemical Modelling and Control.  The Center has  demonstrated successful research support from industrial members  and has met the review criteria of I/UCRC Self-Sufficient  Partnership Program.      Funding is also provided to support an evaluator at the Center to  continue the evaluation responsibility on monitoring the  industry/university interaction for the Center.      Additional funding is provided for a woman undergraduate student to  aid the Center in its's ongoing research activities.        The U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste  Management Office has provided funding to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends Lehigh University be awarded:   $30,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award; $8,000  to support an evaluator at the center for one year; $10,000 for one  year with funds provided by the Department of Energy; and $5,000  for one year to support an undergraduate student at the Center.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
