 "awd_abstract_narration": "9221854   Gilbert    A nerve cell in the sensory cortex of the brain is activated by  stimuli that lie within a certain spatial area, called the  \"receptive field\" of the cell.  Evidence from work on the sense of  touch on the body surface (somatosensory system) has shown that  these receptive fields in adults are surprisingly dynamic in  location and size, rather than having fixed characteristics for a  given cell.  Active sensory experience is important for defining  the receptive field; a loss of sensation from the peripheral area  reduces the size of receptive fields of cortical cells for that  area, and persistent stimulation leads to an increase.  Recent  efforts have been to establish how connections in the neuronal  pathway are modified when these plastic changes occur.  This study  is a novel application that parallels somatosensory approach, but  uses the visual cortex to exploit known details of the visual  pathway and intracortical connections.  Here, changes in receptive  fields in the visual system are studied when part of the visual  field is made invisible (a scotoma).  Anatomy and pharmacology will  be used to examine connections to and within the cortex, to  differentiate the contributions of such connections in the cortical  dynamics.  These studies will help elucidate the mechanisms of  integrating information across space, and of cortical memory; the  emphasis is on visual processing, but the results will have impact  beyond visual neuroscience to sensory neuroscience in general, and  to cognitive neuroscience.  ***",
