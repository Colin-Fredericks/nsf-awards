 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351858  Bagenal     The goal of the project is to enhance science literacy of the  1200 non-science majors who take introductory astronomy courses  at CU. a significant improvement to our undergraduate astronomy  classes and labs results with the introduction of hands-on  computer experiences to augment the present telescopic  observing. the observing experience is being enriched from one  in which the students look at a few brighter objects through  the telescope to one in which they can observe many more much  fainter objects with a state of the art CCD camera attached to  the telescope and then manipulate the image themselves on a PC,  finishing by making a hard copy of their results that they can  keep. This is effectively the difference between astronomy 100  years ago and astronomy of today. What is needed is a way for  the students to fit their observations into the material that  they are learning in the rest of the course: the discovery of  the layout of the solar system, the celestial motions,  comparisons of different types of celestial objects, the  organization of material from molecular clouds to star clusters  to galaxies, etc.  This is much easier when students have  images that they can access on a computer screen or on a hard  copy that they can measure. The process of making one's own  observation, manipulating the image, measuring such things as  stellar magnitudes and positions, and making a print to keep  are vital parts of the experience. The project uses two CCD  cameras attached to currently-existing 24\" and 18\" telescopes.  Separately, the University of Colorado has been asked to  provide 10 personal computers, a SUN Sparc II workstation and  a high resolution printer. In addition, the project uses 10 CD-  ROM readers to allow the students to access large data bases of  planetary and astrophysical images for use during daytime and  cloudy nights.  ***",
