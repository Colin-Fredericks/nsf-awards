Grant of Purdue University will                   pursue a program of research on the state-to-state-dynamics of                  intramolecular relaxation and electron ejection in highly                       excited small molecules.  Specific systems to be investigated                   are hydrocarbon and metal-centered free radical molecules.                      Multiple-resonance laser methods will be used to isolate                        individual transitions that bring the molecules close to their                  ionization thresholds.  Experiments will also be performed to                   obtain high-resolution information on ionization potentials,                    photoionization cross sections of free radicals and the                         rotational-vibrational structure of the corresponding cation,                   as well as on the vibrational structure of excited electronic                   states that lie below the adiabatic ionization thresholds.                      %%%                                                                             The conventional view of the properties of a polyatomic                         molecule is based on the Born-Oppenheimer (B-O) approximation                   according to which its total energy is the sum of independent                   energies associated with the translational, rotational,                         vibrational, and electronic degrees of freedom, the actual                      non-vanishing couplings between these being assumed to be small                 and negligible in the first approximation.  Chemical reactions,                 however, often involve highly excited electronic and                            vibrational degrees of freedom and the B-O approximation may be                 of questionable validity.  Processes that involve energies near                 or above the first ionization threshold, where the dynamics of                  intramolecular energy relaxation leads in particular to                         electron ejection, are not amenable to be treated in the B-O                    approximation.  This research concerns fundamental questions                    about the processes that occur in excited molecular states near                 the ionization threshold and will provide information suitable                  for the development of theoretical models of chemical                           reactivity.",
