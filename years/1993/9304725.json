 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cohen  9304725    Northwestern University, E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Dow  Chemical have formed a Collaborative Access Team, known as  DUNU, and are proposing to instrument and operate a sector  at the Advanced Photon Source. A funding schedule, with  costs to be shared equally by both parties has been agreed  upon, covering both a five year construction phase, as well  as a ten year minimum operations phase. Currently DUNU  employs three full-time senior scientists and engineers  headquartered at Northwestern (a nationwide search is on for  a fourth senior  scientist), with extensive experience in beam line  construction and operations both at the Cornell High Energy  Synchrotron Source (CHESS) and the National Synchrotron  Light Source (NSLS Brookhaven), plus management of one of  the largest x-ray diffraction laboratories in the country.    The purpose of this Collaborative Access Team is to carry  out research on the structure of advanced materials. Our  understanding of the structure (atomic to micron level) is a  crucial prerequisite to the development of new materials  with enhanced properties. Synchrotron radiation has become  an essential tool in every aspect of structural analysis and  has revolutionized many subfields of science and  engineering. Many members of our CAT have been very active  users of our national facilities. The vastly increased  capabilities of \"third generation\" machines, such as the APS  and similar storage rings in Europe and Japan, promise a  second revolution.    A broad research program has been formulated, involving  currently more than 30 principal investigators from Du Pont  and Northwestern. At least fifty other scientists and  engineers, students and post-doctoral fellows will  ultimately be involved. Although many fields of materials  science and engineering are represented in this research  program, the research to be supported by the instrumentation  in this project has a particular focus: It deals with  materials, whose  intermediate scale structure  (nanometer to  micrometer) has a profound influence on their properties.  Such materials are of immense technological importance and  include precipitation-hardening alloys, ceramics, polymers,  cement and composite materials. Many elements of this  research program are totally beyond current capabilities at  available x-ray sources (conventional and synchrotron). The  instrumentation that we will develop depends heavily (or  crucially) on the characteristics of the APS. It is grouped  in two experimental stations, both utilizing undulator  radiation:    1. General purpose scattering instrument, suitable for all  types of diffraction experiments (amorphous, powder and      single crystal work, surface and interface diffraction,  standing waves etc.). Collimated beams (0.1-1 mm) and      microbeams  will be available for diffraction and  microprobe work. The microbeam capability is of      particular interest in the context of this proposal.                                  2. Small Angle X-ray Scattering  microtomography instrument  equipped  with 2-D position   sensitive detector and environmental chamber with multiple  attachments (low and high temperature, UHV,     sample changer). This may be the first x-ray instrument                              with  sufficient imaging and scattering resolution to     allow the two techniques to overlap in studying micron-                              sized  structural features.    We believe that DUNU possesses all the key ingredients of a  productive and strong Collaborative Access Team.  Northwestern University anchors an interactive research  community through its interdisciplinary research centers  (many of which, such as the Materials Research Center and  the Center for Advanced CementBased Materials are supported  by the National Science Foundation) and individual faculty  research. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &  Co. brings its immense capabilities in scientific research  and development. It is a world leader in process chemistry  and engineering and t he manufacturing of high technology  products. It is the intent of this collaboration not only to  share a station at this major facility, but to develop  interactive, collaborative research between the two  institutions (we have installed a videoconferencing link to  aid this interaction).",
