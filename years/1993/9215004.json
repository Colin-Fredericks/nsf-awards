 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many important physical phenomena are modelled by nonlinear                partial differential equations.  The aim of this conference is to               present some general techniques recently developed to study                     existence and qualitative behaviour of solutions to nonlinear                   PDE's.  In particular it will focus on competing effects of                     oscillations and nonlinearity in partial differential equations.                The theory of compensated compactness was developed to solve some               fundamental problems of continuum mechanics using tools of                      functional analysis, weak convergence and Young measures.                       Studying oscillations solely by means of Young measures gave a                  static and not a dynamic description.  To further understand                    homogenization, geometric optics and obtain more precise results                on propagation of oscillations and concentrations effects, Luc                  Tartar introduced a quadratic microlocal tool:  the H-measures.                 The methods that will be discussed in this conference are aimed                 to answer basic questions aring in physics and applied                          mathematics by means of rigorous mathematical tools.                                 This project will support an NSF/CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Compensated                          Compactness, Homogenization and H-Measures, to be held June 27 to               July 1, 1993, at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  This                project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conference in                the Mathematical Sciences on Compensated Compactness,                           Homogenization and H-Measures to be held June 28 - July 3, 1993,                at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  Professor Luc                     Tartar of Carnegie Mellon University and  a corresponding member                of the French Academy of Sciences,  will be the principal                       lecturer.  To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical                   research, the National Science Foundation each year supports a                  number of NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in the                         Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day conference features a                     distinguished lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic on                  important current research in one sharply focused area of the                   mathematical sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an                   expository monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally               published by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for               Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                       Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                   from typical research conferences.  These are:  (1) Focus on a                  single important and timely area of research by a leading                       practitioner,  (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through               regional emphasis,  (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                  timeliness, and  (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.",
