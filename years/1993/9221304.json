 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for travel grants for United States                          participants to attend the 49th Session of the International                    Statistical Institute (ISI) in Florence, Italy, from August 25 to               September 3, 1993.  The funds, which will be administered by the                American Statistical Association (ASA), will provide partial                    support for transportation costs for individuals selected from                  institutions and non-profit associations.  A priority of the ASA                is to provide opportunities for junior researchers who have no                  other funding opportunities, to attend and participate in this                  important meeting.                                                                   The sections of the ISI include  (1) the Bernoulli Society                 for Mathematical Statistics and Probability, with specific groups               or committees in stochastic processes, statistics in the physical               and engineering societies, European statisticians, and Latin                    American statisticians;  (2) the International Associations for                 Survey Statisticians which holds seminars, work-shops, and                      tutorials preceding the ISI meeting;  (3) the International                     Association for Statistical Computing;  (4) the International                   Association for Official Statistics; and  (5) the International                 Association for Statistical Education.  Also meeting in                         conjunction with ISI are specific groups with interests in                      international training centers, problems of industrial                          statisticians, and other special interest groups.                                    The convergence of this broad spectrum of statisticians,                   with participants from many countries, provides an excellent                    forum to present and discuss research results and educational                   activities in statistics.",
