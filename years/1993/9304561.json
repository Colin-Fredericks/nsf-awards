John Ketterson and R.P.H. Chang,                                           Northwestern University and Dr. Peter Brusov,                                   Rostov-on-Don State University.  Their                                          cooperation will feature three areas of research:                               (1) nonlinear optical oxide materials, where                                    newly developed sputtering techniques will be                                   applied; (2) unconventional superconductors and                                 superfluids, where tunneling and atomic force                                   microscopy will be used to study the magnetic                                   field distribution in the vicinity of a vortex in                               HFS; and (3) high temperature superconductors                                   (HTSC), where ribbon conductors will be produced                                using a novel sputtering system constructed at                                  Northwestern University and targets made at                                     Rostov-on-Don State University.                                                                                                                                 Progress in the fields of high temperature                                      superconductivity and nonlinear optics is                                       intimately coupled to advances in oxide                                         materials.  Interest in nonlinear oxide materials                               developed only recently at Northwestern, while                                  Rostov is a leading Russian supplier and                                        developer of oxide ceramic materials.                                                                                                                           This research in materials research fulfills the                                program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                                United States and Russia to combine complementary                               efforts and capabilities in areas of strong                                     mutual interest and competence in the field of                                  basic scientific research on the basis of                                       equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
