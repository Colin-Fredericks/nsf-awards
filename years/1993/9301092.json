 "awd_abstract_narration": "A process is a partially ordered set of steps to be  followed  in developing a software system.  Processes may  vary across organizations and  systems.  A process-centered  environment provides computer-aided support for a  range of  project-specific processes.  The general goals of research  in  process-centered environments are to devise useful  notations for specifying  processes and to investigate ways  in which environments may assist users in  carrying out  processes.  The Marvel process-centered environment is  tailored by  a rule-based process model, where each rule  defines a process step and states  the condition for  initiating the step and the result of finishing the step.  The permitted sequencing among steps is implicit in their  conditions and  results.  The environment enforces the  specified process and assists users in  satisfying the  conditions of steps. Recent work has concentrated on  concurrency control for teams of users, and on evolution of  processes while  they are in progress. Both are  prerequisites for scaling up process-centered  environments.    This project addresses four problems; (1)  translation of higher-level process modeling  formalisms into rules for  execution, (2) formal notations for coordination modeling and the  interaction of corresponding concurrency control algorithms  with process  assistance mechanisms, (3) requirements placed on environment frameworks  by  process and coordination, and possible protocols for  interfacing process  and coordination components to a range  of existing classes of frameworks, and  (4) decentralized environment architectures that permits  a degree of site  autonomy for different process and  coordination needs.",
