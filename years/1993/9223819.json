This workshop brings together interested and knowledgeable persons from a wide range of backgrounds to facilitate the development of undergraduate course material dealing with ethical issues in physics.  These issues involve interactions within the physics community (such as those related to the publication process and research standards) as well as between physicists and society (such as those related to the role of physicists as technical advisors and the impact of physics research on society).  Workshop participants will identify topics suitable for course modules, ethical issues or problems associated with the topics, and relevant bibliography and key references for classroom use.  Results will include a publication detailing the results of the workshop and shorter papers for relevant physics journals.  This effort lays the groundwork for further proposals to develop the course modules and related activities. ***",
