Since 1974, the striking cross-national  differences in macroeconomic performance has led scholars to study  the ways that wage-setting institutions affect how well the labor  market functions.  The majority of the literature argues that  centralized bargaining systems produce superior macroeconomic  outcomes, expecially lower unemployment, by preventing individual  unions from seeking to improve their own members' wages at the  expense of workers who belong to other unions or to no union at  all.  Yet many studies argue the opposite, that decentralized wage  setting offers the greatest flexibility and sensitivity of wages to  conditions in the local labor market.  Most recently, the  intermediate position that both highly centralized and highly  decentralized systems work better than systems with intermediate  levels of centralization has gained wide acceptance.    All of the research to date has proceeded on a weak empirical base.   The basic problem is that no one has developed adequate measures of  the different attributes of wage-setting institutions that might  matter for economic performance.  In this research, the  investigators continue their work of compiling a sustematic cross-  national and longitudinal data base coverning the most important  institutional characteristics of the wage setting process.  In  collecting the data, the investigators put together information  from secondary sources, data supplied by the major labor market  actors in each of the countries, and expert surveys.  Their data  will be constructed to allow reliable comparisons over time and  between countries.  On the basis of the data, which will be made  publicly available for use by other scholars, the investigators  propose to construct indicators of critical aspects of the  organization  of unions, employers and collective bargaining.   Finally, they intend to use the indicators to test the relationship  between bargaining institutions, wage formation, and various  aspects of aggregate economic performance.  ***",
