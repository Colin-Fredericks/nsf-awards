 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the Makah tribe will                  upgrade the storage and accessibility of archaeological materials               and data from the Ozette archaeological site. Ozette village                    results from approximately 2000 years of habitation by Northwest                Coast Native Americans. Occupation was finally terminated by a mud              slide which buried entire houses intact therefore preserving an                 astonishing range of material culture. Because the sediments                    remained waterlogged the state of these materials is excellent and              many fragile organic items are well preserved. They provide a                   unique insight into a disappeared way of life. The specific goals               of the project are to: complete a physical inventory of the                     collection; develop location inventories for stored materials;                  organize portions of the collection in terms of archaeologically                visible social units; acquire and install storage equipment; and                finally develop documentation for accessing and using the                       collection.                                                                                                                                                     This work is important for several reasons. It represents an                    important step in collaboration with Native American groups to                  permit both tribal control of culturally significant materials and              scientific access to them. The Makah tribe has invested over 1.3                million dollars in the curatorial facility and NSF funds provide a              modest and needed supplement to this amount. Because of their                   present condition the materials are not adequately available for                scientific study and this grant will remedy this situation.                     Finally, these funds will help to preserve the artifacts from                   disintegration.",
