This study is the first to explore the origin of a polyploid species (a species with more than two sets of chromosomes) in the Orchidaceae through the application of molecular techniques.  The research will provide information regarding the possible allopolyploid origin (via hybridization of two genetically distinct diploid species) of S. diluvialis and its distinctness as a species.  Electrophoretic data will allow identification of the putative parental taxa and provide insight into the genetic variability present within the genus.  Knowledge of the evolutionary origin of S. diluvialis will provide a meaningful framework for and insight into both genetic and ecological studies critical to the continued existence of this rare orchid.  ***                                        9310810  Ranker    This research project will address three questions central to understanding the evolution o f the rare orchid,                                                                                                                    Y                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   U                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 F                                                                             (    Times New Roman    Symbol  & Arial                             p                            Y     \"             h     _  ea  e                        Z    Ranker/Arft Abstract Dissertation  Elizabeth M.
