 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forest landscapes are increasingly fragmented.  This project               will explore an important mechanism of forest response to this                  fragmentation.  The objectives of the proposed research are to 1)               determine experimentally whether edges inhibit, facilitate, or have             no net effect on the exogenous control of forest interior dynamics;             and 2) to determine the specific mechanisms for the interaction                 between forest edge and interior, and the surrounding landscape.                The study uses exotic species that are not common in forest                     interiors as indicators of external influence, & examines relevant              processes, including seed input, seed storage, seed and seedling                survival, role of seedling predation, and role of fine scale                    disturbances.                                                                   %%%                                                                             The interaction between forest islands and the surrounding                      landscape may occur principally through forest edges.  Yet,                     existing research does not indicate how edges work to control the               input and survival of tree seedlings in the forest interior.  Plant             dispersal and plant-animal interactions across forest edges play a              key role in forest dynamics in fragmented landscapes.  The                      information will be relevant to management of forest fragments,                 restoration and conservation of forests in fragmented landscapes,               and monitoring and compensating for the effects of global                       environmental change on fragmented forests.",
