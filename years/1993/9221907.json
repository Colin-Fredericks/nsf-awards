 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted to address problems in                   condensed matter physics which are concerned with explaining and                predicting the physical properties of a variety of interesting                  materials which are currently subjects for experimental studies and             technological promise.  The properties of these materials are so                unusual that new theoretical approaches and techniques are often                required.  These will be developed based primarily on the methods               of quantum statistical mechanics.  Thus research to be carried out              has both intrinsic theoretical importance and immediate                         experimental relevance.  The research will have impact on materials             science, solid state physics and quantum chemistry.                                                                                                             The materials which will be investigated in this project include:               new, strongly correlated metallic and magnetic materials; heavy-                fermion materials; high temperature superconductors; disordered                 electronic substances; and, quantum solids and fluids.  In all of               these subjects, the interactions between the elementary                         constituents play a fundamental role.  The theoretical approach                 will introduce and elaborate models and methods which deal directly             with that central issue.                                                        %%%",
