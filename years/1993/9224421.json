 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to explore the design,                 synthesis, and properties of dendritic molecules as well as hybrid              polymer structures containing both linear and globular fragments.               Main targets include the preparation of regular dendritic molecules             with functionalized chain-ends, hyper-branched polymers prepared in             a one-step polycondensation reaction, and hybrid linear-globular                copolymers in which the dendritic (globular) fragment will                      contribute to modify drastically the properties of the linear                   polymer fragment.  In order to prepare regular, size monodisperse               dendritic structures, both stepwise and accelerated approaches                  involving new monomers will be used.  The chemical modification of              functionalities located at the chain ends or within the inner                   layers of the dendritic molecules will be used for a number of                  purposes such as the creation of novel type of micellar structures.             These micellar structures are constituted of single molecules in                which a hydrophobic outer layer surrounds inner hydrophilic layers              (reverse micelle) or vice-versa (normal micelle).  The unique                   control over architecture afforded by the convergent method of                  synthesis of dendritic molecules will be used to create unusual                 polymer topologies.  The study of structure-properties                          relationships for these molecules will contribute to the                        advancement of knowledge may provide novel solutions to current                 technological problems.                                                                                                                                         This research is directed toward the production of a new form of                matter:  polymers with a globular shape that cannot be made by any              other known method.  These globular polymers may be uniquely                    engineered for applications in a broad array of emerging advanced               technologies such as molecular electronics, the design of                       microreactors that will allow more efficient chemical processes to              be carried out with significant reduction in environmental                      problems, or the elimination of highly toxic pollutants from water.",
