 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBPCase) is the                   enzyme responsible for nearly all carbon fixation on this planet                and is the major carboxylating enzyme in the phytoplankton of the               world's oceans.  Additionally, RuBPCase may play a global role in               modulating one of the greenhouse gases, CO2.  Knowledge of the                  regulation of this enzyme is important for understanding control of             primary production in the oceans and phytoplankton response to                  environmental perturbations or long term change.  Dr. Paul and his              collaborator, Dr. Tabita, will focus on the molecular regulation of             this enzyme in picoplankton in coastal and oligotrophic oceanic                 environments.  They have recently developed a method for extraction             of mRNA from phytoplankton and have detected RuBPCase gene                      expression in natural populations.  These biomolecular techniques               will be used to study diel and light-dependent regulation of the                RuBPCase gene in cultured Synechococcus spp. and prochlorophytes,               and in natural populations.  The second objective is to identify                and characterize the key primary producers by amplifying RUBPCase               mRNA for cloning and sequencing from natural populations.                       Amplification of mRNA will result in clones that originated from                transcriptionally active phototrophs.  Sequence data will be                    compared to RuBPCase data bases to identify the active species.  If             novel phototrophs are encountered, parsimony analysis will be                   performed to relate these forms to their evolutionary closest                   relative.  In summary, the project will provide fundamental                     information on the control of the RuBPCase genes in response to                 environmental factors and identify key phototrophic organisms in                oceanic picoplankton.",
