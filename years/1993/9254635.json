 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Project VTC is to introduce and explore the use of                  pedagogical \"cases\" in teacher education in mathematics and                     science. These cases are realistic scenarios which raise                        contextualized issues of theoretical and practical concern for                  discussion and analysis. Pedagogical cases are beginning to be                  used in teacher education to teach such generic aspects as                      problem solving and classroom management, but this approach has                 rarely been tried in the subject matter areas, including                        mathematics and science. Project VTC will produce approximately                 one hour of videotape representing several pedagogically                        interesting cases in secondary-level quantitative science.                      These cases will integrate issues of school children's                          mathematical understanding and expression with their developing                 sense of fundamental scientific concepts. Project VTC will also                 produce a short manual to accompany the videotaped cases. This                  manual will provide a brief introduction to the use of                          pedagogical cases in general, as well as suggestions for using                  the cases presented on the tape. The Project will disseminate                   these materials to mathematics and science educators and to                     researchers in the use of case studies in teacher education.",
