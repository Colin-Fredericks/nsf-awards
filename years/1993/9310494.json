If this cognitivist view is correct, the meanings children initially associate with spatial words should be similar regardless of input language.  The project will evaluate this hypothesis by comparing the meanings associated with spatial words by one- to three-and-a-half-year old children learning English, Dutch, and Korean, three languages that classify spatial relations in strikingly different ways.  Two cross-sectional studies are proposed.  In a production experiment, topological spatial action descriptions are elicited in a naturalistic setting with familiar objects.  In a comprehension study, sensitivity to language-specific topological distinctions are assessed with the \"preferential looking paradigm\", a technique that is minimally demanding and hence ideal for young children.  The data will be analyzed (1) to determine how early children develop language-specific principles of categorizing spatial actions, and (2) to assess, through analysis of correct and incorrect patterns of generalization, the relative difficulty for children of alternative principles of spatial classification.  The results will contribute toward a clearer picture of the interaction in early language development between children's nonlinguistic grasp of spatial relations and their sensitivity to the semantic categories of the input language.  5p0    6hC 6fC3 P d ;4   3 P 6hC  | & 7 6h CP &+p0      P  x                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  !         !
