 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two species of salps, Salpa thompsoni and S. gerlachei, occur in                the Southern Ocean near the Antarctic Peninsula.  Both are known                to form immense blooms that almost entirely dominate the biomass.               A knowledge of the biology of these species is essential to                     understand the trophic relationships and global processes that                  occur in the Southern Ocean.  This project will investigate the                 feeding rates, defecation rates, assimilation efficiency, growth,               reproduction and metabolism of both species, in order to develop                an energy budget.  The behavior of salps will be studied in the                 field, and laboratory experiments will incorporate these field                  observations.  Feeding rates will be measured both in the                       laboratory and in the field, and the results will be compared.                  Growth, reproduction and metabolism will be measured in the                     laboratory.  In addition, the hyperiid amphipod parasites of                    salps will be examined using a combination of field and                         laboratory methods.  The potential effect of these parasites on                 the growth and reproduction of salps will also be considered.                   Several species of Antarctic fish will be observed in the                       laboratory to study predation on salps and other gelatinous                     zooplankton.  A number of fish that occur near Palmer Station                   feed heavily on salps.  Fish will be fed known quantities of                    gelatinous prey, and digestion rates will be determined.  These                 studies will assess the ability to identify and quantify the                    remains of gelatinous organisms with gut content analyses.  These               studies will provide important data on the trophic position of                  salps in the Southern Ocean, both as consumers of phytoplankton                 and as prey of other organisms.  These studies are an essential                 prelude to further studies on recruitment and population                        structure in Southern Ocean planktonic communities.  In addition,               the research proposed herein will provide basic information on                  the ways in which oceanic zooplankton cope with the seasonally                  variable food resources of the Southern Ocean.",
