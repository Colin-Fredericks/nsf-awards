 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project envisions the continuing development of                       symplectic geometry and topology in its interaction with other                  fields of mathematics.  The main progress under prior support was               achieved in 3-dimensional contact geometry, construction of new                 invariants of high-dimensional closed and open contact manifolds,               in the description of invariant properties of boundaries of                     symplectic manifolds, and in the application of symplectic                      methods to the theory of 2-knots in real 4-space.  In the present               continuation, several new areas of research are suggested.  In                  particular, there is the study of newly discovered connections                  between symplectic geometry, pseudoisotopy theory and algebraic                 K-theory, applications of Lagrangian intersection theory to Morse               theory for plurisubharmonic functions on complex manifolds, and                 the development and application of contact homology theory.                     Other projected directions of research are:  3-dimensional                      contact topology and further development of symplectic methods in               4-dimensional topology.                                                              It seems that in modern mathematics interdisciplinary                      research plays a very special and important role.  Many recent                  discoveries were made in areas which do not fit into any                        traditional classification.  For instance, a breakthrough in                    4-dimensional topology by Donaldson came from gauge theory, a                   topic in quantum physics, and many other recent topological                     discoveries were motivated by physics.  Symplectic topology at                  present is a beautiful blend of different mathematical sciences:                topology, Hamiltonian dynamics, complex analysis, differential                  geometry, etc.  It attracts more and more ideas from different                  fields and repays them with unexpected new applications, which                  makes research in this direction especially promising.",
