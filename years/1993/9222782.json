 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is the first phase of a longitudinal study of                        organizational and contextual influences on academic research                   groups in U.S. science and engineering.  The study will examine how             research groups are organized and how they change over time; how                contextual variables influence group structure, functioning, and                performance; and how contextual and group variables together                    influence members' careers, work-related attitudes and values, and              research behavior (including problem selection, research style,                 productivity, quality, and risk tolerance).  The main purposes of               Phase I are to operationalize major concepts and develop measures,              field test data-gathering techniques, devise a sampling plan,                   design data management and analysis systems, and address and refine             the research questions through analysis of preliminary data,  This              will be done through face-to-face interviews, questionnaires, and               an examination of documents for approximately fifty-five                        researchers and their teams, drawn from a national sample of                    scientists and engineers in four fields.                                                                                                                        This project addresses fundamental questions about the social                   organization of academic research and thus should be of interest to             a wide audience, including federal decision makers, scholars                    interested in the social organization of science, the community of              researchers and practitioners concerned with higher education, and              social scientists interested in groups, organizations, and work                 life.                                                                                                                                                           The immediate products of Phase I will be a detailed final report,              an executive summary, and a one-page abstract of the project (25                copies of each) for NSF, and an academic paper (based on cross-                 sectional data) reporting on differences in group characteristics               and performance among research teams.",
