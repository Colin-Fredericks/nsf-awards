 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in                         materials science between                                                       Robert A. Weiss of the University of Connecticut and                            Claudine Williams of the University of Paris Sud (Orsay).                       The investigators plan to conduct small angle x-ray                             scattering studies of block copolymer ionomers and their                        blends.  They propose to characterize the microstructures of                    lightly sulfonated di- and tri-block copolymers to determine                    their composition, sulfonational level and cation.                              Microstructure and temperature studies will be carried out                      using the synchrotron light source available at LURE                            (Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation du Rayonnement                                  Electromagnetique).  Dr. Weiss brings to this collaboration                     extensive experience in the synthesis and characterization                      of block copolymer ionomers. This is complemented by Dr.                        Williams' expertise in the use of synchrotrons for small-                       angle x-ray scattering studies generally and specifically                       related to ionomers.  The project will benefit from the                         excellent facilities at LURE.                                                                                                                                   Copolymer ionomers are an important class of materials whose                    chemical composition, properties and microstructure can be                      adapted by polymer chemists for specific applications.                          Polymeric materials are utilized in microelectronic and                         information storage devices and in the aerospace, marine,                       automotive and biomedical fields.  Ionomers have important                      applications as membranes, thermoplastic elastomers and                         adhesives.  This project will advance our understanding of                      structure-property relationships of copolymer ionomers and                      their potential as advanced materials.",
