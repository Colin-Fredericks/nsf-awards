MCNC Center for Communication  High speed computer networks support shared databases and new modes of collaboration in several scientific areas.  These capabilities have yet to be widely applied at the state level. The MCNC Center for Communication is convening a planning workshop which will convene people from each state to provide information about the National Research and Education Network (NREN).  They request support for a workshop to plan a framework for how the states could best invest in an interoperable network that would take full advantage of the resources and capabilities that the NREN has to offer.  Network capabilities and database and conferencing technology such as dial up video service would demonstrated in this two day workshop.  This conference will bring together many academic and government representatives from the numerous states and from the networking technology community who are essential for the design, development, deployment, and operation of a robust, high performance computer network.  This effort is in step with federal initiatives in high performance computing and its plans to meet pressing needs for improved research collaboration and productivity in the United States.",
