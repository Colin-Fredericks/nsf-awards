 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal involves the study of atmospheric airglow and                noctilucent clouds (ANLCs) with a wide field imager from the NCAR               Electra aircraft for the ALOHA/ANLC-93 campaign.  The imager will               provide correlative data to the campaign which includes lidar,                  radar, and spectroscopic information from the Upper Mesosphere-                 Lower Thermosphere region.  The basic campaign objectives are to                locate and study the geophysical conditions associated with ANLCs,              gravity wave dynamics, and sporadic Na layers.  In addition to                  providing an observational contribution to these team goals, a                  specific study of the horizontal attributes of gravity waves                    resolved from these data will be performed and compared to an                   existing data set which was taken over a 7 month period in 1991-92              at Bear Lake, UT with the same instrument that is proposed here.                                                                                                     Lockheed has developed and successfully demonstrated in                    several ground based campaigns, a sensitive, bare CCD imager                    capable of measuring OH, O2, Na, and OI nightglows with high signal             to noise ratios.  In particular, OH imaging using broad band                    techniques (7500-9300 \u001a), have produced >50:1 S:N with 60 s                     exposures using .35o pixels (\u001a.5 km resolution overhead) with all-              sky optics.  With this sensitivity, airglow intensity amplitudes on             the order of a few percent have been observed.  The array is a 1024             X 1024 (15.4mm X 15.4mm) which is \u001a4x larger than the commercially              available arrays used in aeronomical studies to date.  The system               uses commercial electronics (including a computer) which are rugged             and stable for the aircraft environment.  Coordination has been                 made with NCAR to install an all-sky dome on the aircraft to                    accommodate the all-sky field.  Aircraft pitch and roll stability               have been investigated to suggest that, for typical flight                      conditions, angular resolutions of \u001a.5o over 30 seconds can be                  achieved.                                                                                                                                                            The wide field camera will be used to (1) document                         irregularities in the OH airglow layer which are caused by                      atmospheric gravity waves and tides affecting the layer for flight              segments where the Solar Elevation Angle (SEA)<-10o (which is the               condition for most flight paths for the campaign); (2) image solar              scattered illumination of noctilucent clouds where -6o<SEA<-8o for              the ANLC phase; and (3) image the Na 'sodium flash' at SEA\u001a-6.5o in             support of the study of sporadic Na layers.  Observations (2) and               (3) are feasible on the two planned flights north into the polar                cap.                                                                                                                                                                 With the OH imagery, the horizontal wavelength, intensity                  amplitude, apparent horizontal phase velocity, and spatial extent               (up to 500 km radius of the aircraft), will be studied in objective             (1).  Spectral density analysis will be performed on imagery to                 resolve the horizontal gravity wave information.  In the ANLC                   campaign,m observations of the clouds will be attempted to provide              information of ANLC's location.  From Na 'flash' imagery, the Na                density will be inverted from the image.  For a very specific                   location (i.e. SEA\u001a-6.5o) the Na column density will be derived from            the image for an assumed constant solar illumination of the layer.",
