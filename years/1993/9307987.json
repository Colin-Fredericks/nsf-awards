 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taylor  9307987       Much of the work supported by this award focuses on  mathematical problems related to function theory and geometric  questions in the theory of several complex variables.  The work  includes a search for geometric conditions an algebraic variety  must satisfy in order that the plurisubharmonic functions on the  variety satisfy estimates in the spirit of the classical  Phragmen-Lindelof Theorem.  The reason for this line of  investigation stems from the observation that many properties of  constant coefficient partial differential operators are  characterized by estimates for plurisubharmonic functions on a  variety.  A second line of study concerns ongoing work  combining complex analysis and multiserver queues.  The  connection derives from the fact that the Markov chains  underlying the queuing processes are given by homogeneous,  vector-valued random walks on the integer points in the positive  orthant.  The resulting functional equation has coefficients that  are matrix-valued analytic functions and the unknowns are  vector-valued analytic functions. Other work centers on the  embeddability for three-dimensional Cauchy-Riemann manifolds.   The goal here is to test whether all embeddable Cauchy-Riemann  structure on the 3-sphere must be the boundary for a strictly  pseudoconvex domain diffeomorphic to the complex 2-ball.  A final  topic concerns the classification of harmonic maps on the  2-shpere into the projectivized Hilbert space and the question of  whether they must factor through a finite-dimensional  sub-projective space.       Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the  century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one  complex variable.  It became clear early on that the theory  differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was  far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more  affinity with partial differential operators of first order.  It  thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics of   differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of the  fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.  Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic  mathematical forms.  ***",
