 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry                  Program, is designed to investigate the molecular aspects of                    friction and wear.  The approach to molecular tribology to be                   used in this project includes friction measurements on well                     characterized surfaces using pin and v-block apparatus, as well                 as microbalance studies of lubricant film growth kinetics.  The                 extreme pressure lubrication behavior of possible lubricant                     compounds will be used to develop a model of the mechanism of                   lubricant action.  The results will then be related to ultra                    high vacuum studies of the molecular surface chemistry of these                 model lubricant compounds on well characterized surfaces.                       %%%                                                                             A detailed molecular level understanding of the processes of                    friction and wear would be very useful in designing improved                    lubricants and wear reducing additives in a variety of                          important technological applications.  This research project                    will approach this question from a very fundamental point of                    view, coupling engineering measurements of friction properties                  with detailed analysis of the surface chemistry of the                          solid/lubricant system.  The goal of the work is to develop the                 understanding which will enable the rational design of                          lubricant compounds.",
