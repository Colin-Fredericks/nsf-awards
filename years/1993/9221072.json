 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous examples exist in the literature documenting the                       importance of electron tunneling in enzymatic processes.  Although              much larger than the electron, protium possesses a de Brogile wave              length which is similar to the expected dimension of the reaction               coordinate in simple H transfer reactions.  This property has led               to the recognition that the behavior of protium is poised between               classical and quantum mechanical behavior.  Published studies from              this laboratory have demonstrated that quantum effects contribute               significantly to several enzyme catalyzed H transfer reactions at               room temperature.  Ongoing experiments suggest that this phenomenon             will be a general one for enzyme catalyzed reactions.  A major                  difficulty in the unambiguous demonstration of tunneling has been               the absence of suitable experimental probes. A series of protocols              have been developed toward this end: these include the comparative              study of H/T and D/T isotope effects and their temperature                      dependences.  Investigations during the next funding period will                include the following areas: (1) A number of new enzyme catalyzed               H transfer reactions will be examined for tunneling, in order to                establish a data base for this phenomenon.  In particular, the PI               plans to focus on the flavin containing enzymes, monoamine oxidase              and glucose oxidase: (2) Studies of the influence on tunneling of               specific protein substrate interactions will be pursued through the             use of site-specific mutagenesis; and (3) Computational work will               be continued, with the goal of reproducing experimental data and                providing suitable models for the mechanism of tunneling in enzyme              reactions.                                                                      %%%                                                                             Although electron tunneling in proteins has been extensively                    studied, little attention has been paid to nuclear (hydrogen)                   tunneling.  Dr. Klinman's elegant work has shown that nuclear                   tunneling contributes significantly to certain enzymatic reaction               rates under biologically relevant conditions.  This project builds              and expands upon these groundbreaking observations.",
