 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry of rotaxanes will be pursued. Rotaxanes are                       supramolecules in which a bead is threaded by a linear subunit.                 Bead dissociation is sterically prevented by two bulky groups                   (stoppers) attached to both ends of the linear subunit. A                       substantial portion of this work will be done with rotaxanes in                 which cyclodextrins are used as the beads. This project will                    investigate the nature of the fundamental interactions leading to               self-assembly of cyclodextrin-based \u01313!rotaxanes and \u01314!rotaxanes,              structures with either two or three cyclodextrin beads,                         respectively. In a second aspect of the work, rotaxanes will be                 synthesized where the cyclodextrin bead completely encapsulates a               redox-active group. These systems will allow an evaluation of the               importance of solvent reorganization in electron transfer                       reactions. The third aspect of the work will investigate the                    possibility of electrochemically controlling the position of an                 electron acceptor bead encapsulated on a thread with two different              donor stations.                                                                 %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of               Professor Angel K. Kaifer at the University of Miami. Large                     molecular systems will be prepared that are composed of a bead                  molecule which encapsulates a linear string molecule. Bulky groups              will be placed at the ends of the string to prevent dissociation of             the bead. The assembly process to form these large molecular                    systems will be studied. A particular portion of the string will be             oxidized to generate a positive charge and the effect of the bead               on this process will be evaluated in the context of solvation.                  Control of the movement of the bead along the string by oxidizing               or reducing different stations on the string, and thereby changing              charge at these stations, will be studied.",
