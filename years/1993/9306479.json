 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports work on the Inverse Galois problem.  The               principal investigator will improve the criteria for the                        realization of groups as Galois groups that he has recently                     found.  He will also search for new criteria and apply these                    criteria to realize further interesting classes of groups,                      especially simple groups, as Galois groups over the rationals and               over cyclotomic fields.  Most of this work is based on the use of               moduli spaces for covers of the Riemann sphere.                                      A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.                 It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and                chemistry.  One of the major problems in algebra is concerned                   with identifying those groups which can be represented as the                   Galois group over the rationals.  This involves a blend of                      algebra, number theory and algebraic geometry.",
