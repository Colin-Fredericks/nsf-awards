 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Carl D. Frisbie has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                    Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Frisbie's doctoral degree was from                 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the supervision                 of Professor Mark Wrighton. Dr. Frisbie will continue research                  at Harvard University under the sponsorship of Professor                        Charles Lieber. Dr. Frisbie's postdoctoral experience will                      train him in surface imaging techniques, particularly scanning                  tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) as                 applied to materials chemistry. Longer term, he plans to study                  the structure and ion dynamics of fast ion conductors by AFM                    and scanning surface harmonic microscopy.                                       %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                   viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                      broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                  and teaching.",
