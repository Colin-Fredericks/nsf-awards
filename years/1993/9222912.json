 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the travel by Prof. R. Byron Pipes of                   the Center for Composite Materials to conduct collaborative                     research with Dr. Debes Bhattacharyya of the Department of                      Mechanical Engineering at the University of Auckland. The                       principal goal of the research is to establish a base for                       fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites that can be integrated                into engineering practice. Thermoplastic polymers can undergo a                 reversible phase change from solid to liquid thereby enabling the               development of shaping and joining industrial methods analogous                 to those for conventional metallic materials. It is also                        possible to incorporate various types of fiber reinforcement to                 suit the end use of the formed product. The potential processing                advantages of thermoplastics have led to the development of                     thermoforming processes and to the adoption of sheet forming                    techniques typical of those used with metallic materials. This                  research will investigate ways fiber-reinforced thermoplastic                   sheets can be converted into three-dimensional models using                     existing metal-forming equipment with minimal modification.                                                                                                     The research areas of the principal investigators are                           complementary and the cooperative work should produce                           substantial results. Dr. Bhattacharyya is an expert in the                      sheet forming of conventional metallic materials. Prof. Pipes                   is a recognized authority in composites processing.  The                        travel of Dr. Bhattacharyya to the Center for Composite Materials               in Delaware is funded through the New Zealand Ministry of                       Research, Science and Technology (MORST).",
