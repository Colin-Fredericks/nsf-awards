 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304983  Cavener  The cap-dependent scanning model for translation initiation in  eukaryotes was previously argued to be used by all eukaryotic  mRNAs.  Recently the poliovirus, EMCV, immunoglobulin binding  protein, and Drosophila Antennapedia mRNAs were shown to use a  novel cap-independent mechanism for translation initiation in  cultured cells.  These mRNAs contain internal ribosome entry the  sites (IRES) in their 5' untranslated region (UTR) leader  sequences.  This proposal will examine the developmental regulation  of internal initiation using transgenic Drosophila.  The 5\" UTR  sequences of the Antennapedia (Antp), Ultrabithorax (Ubx), and  seven in absentia (sina) will be tested for IRES activity using a  dicistronic assay system.  The ability translation of the distal  cistron will be assessed in transgenic Drosophila.  Since the  dicistronic gene will be driven by a constitutive promoter, the  potential translation by the internal initiation mechanism can be  assessed for all tissues and stages.  Internal deletion experiments  will examine whether the putative IRES elements of Antp, Ubx, and  sina are necessary for translation in the context of their full 5'  UTRs.    %%%  Initiation of protein synthesis in eukaryotes is preceded by a  series of complex reactions primarily involving the ribosome,  initiation factors, Net-tRNA, and a mRNA.  The cap dependent  scanning model was proposed by Kozak in 1989 to explain the order  and nature of these reactions.  It was first challenged by the  discovery that the picornaviruses do not have a terminal cap and  are translated by internal ribosome binding.  This work will  examine the developmental regulation of internal initiation using  transgenic Drosophila and should allow insight into the elucidation  of alternative initiation mechanisms and also to a possible mode of  development gene regulation.  ***",
