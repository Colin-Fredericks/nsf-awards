 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at the design and development of a                     coordinated group of instructional laboratory apparatus to be                   used in student-conducted experiments to demonstrate and                        measure the operating characteristics, both steady-state and                    dynamic, of various types of heating, ventilating, and air                      conditioning control units and systems used in the HVAC systems                 of commercial buildings, auditoriums, schools, and other large-                 scale installations.                                                            This project is an extension to an initial effort, under local                  funding and industry support over the past two years, to                        develop a laboratory set-up for a student-conducted experiment                  to demonstrate and measure the steady-state and dynamic                         behavior of a typical single-loop control system controlling                    static air pressure in an air duct.  This effort will allow                     completing the design of the single-loop control system for air                 including adding a microprocessor-type control unit and the                     extension of the same approach to two other HVAC systems,                       specifically (a) A single loop control system for a hot-water                   coil and (b) A single-zone economizer cycle. This project                       should result in the attainment of a capability to challenge                    HVAC design students at the undergraduate level to apply basic                  control theory to the measurement and analysis of system                        behavior, using closed- and open-loop tests in both the time-                   and frequency-domains.  An advisory board comprised of                          educators, members of appropriate technical societies, and                      industrial representatives will guide the conduct of the                        project and actively participate in its evaluation.  The                        results of the proposed project will be the subject of a two-                   day workshop on improved instruction in HVAC design,                            particularly with respect to control theory, to be hosted by                    the project management team.  Publication of project results                    will be made at annual meetings of the American Society of                      Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)                 and the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE).",
