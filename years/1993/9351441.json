 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina in Charlotte is making the                     necessary changes in the calculus curriculum to take advantage                  of the newer curriculums as they mature and to better teach the                 concepts of mathematics with workstations to help reinforce the                 numerical and graphical part of mathematics.  This project is                   using up-to-date computing equipment that will run the software                 that they have chosen to use in their mathematics curriculum.                   The College of Engineering has implemented a Sun workstation                    network for all of their students, and this project allows                      mathematics students to work with the same materials. They are                  running Maple and other visualization programs for many                         mathematics classes. This lets the department better serve the                  engineering, mathematics, and science students that they teach                  by offering them the same type of hardware that they use in                     their other courses.",
