 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Biology Department at                          Oregon State to continue a successful  10-week program                          (summers 1993, 1994, and 1995) that will provide 11                             undergraduates  in biological sciences with research                            experiences in ecosystem studies at the Andrews Experimental                    Forest. This experimental forest is the site for several                        interdisciplinary projects, including the NSF sponsored Long-                   Term Ecological Research Program. Students will learn and                       develop skills as they interact and work closely with                           scientists from several disciplines on individual projects                      within larger established research programs.                                                                                                                    To foster student development and monitor what careers they                     pursue after they complete the program, a 4-phase program is                    planned: an overview phase which explains integrated                            ecosystem studies, an apprenticeship phase to develop                           student skills, a personal research phase, and an evaluation                    and follow-up phase. According to their interests, students                     will join a collaborating scientist for the second and third                    phases. An REU leader (the PI) will coordinate the program,                     organize the overview phase, field trips, and seminars,                         integrating the students and collaborating scientists,                          facilitate students' progress toward independent scientific                     research, and monitor the evaluation and follow-up phase so                     that students can be tracked.                                                                                                                                   Students will be housed at the field station with other                         researchers, an arrangement that encourages after-hours                         discussions and helps break barriers between disciplines.                       The project will place promising students at a scenic                           research site with an interdisciplinary team of scientists                      to produce good science and develop an enthusiasm for                           biological research.",
