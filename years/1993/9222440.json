Such lasers are desired in high capacity wavelength division networks for applications in tele  and data communications, and they may find use in optical sensors and memories as well as in spectroscopies applications.  Two of the most promising structures have been studied at UC Santa Barbara.  Wavelength tuning ranges> 30 nm have been demonstrated.  Unfortunately, current funding for this and related programs has ended without any renewal prospect due to the sponsoring company's policy. One of the problems with such lasers is that they are difficult to directly modulate without simultaneously shifting the wavelength. Thus, it is desirable to integrate them with separately controlled modulator external to the laser cavity.  At UCSB work on a simple and robust guide/antiguide modulator has indicated that is an excellent candidate for this function.  Again, funding for this work has also ended.  One goal of this proposed program would involve integrating this modulator with one of the tunable laser structures.  It is shown that this can be accomplished with no extra processing steps.",
