 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a molecular approach to studying the                     mechanism for peripheral T cell tolerance.  Exposure of T                       lymphocytes to tolerogen in vitro or in vivo inhibits the antigen-              specific proliferative capacity of T helper (Th) type 1 (Th1)                   cells, but not Th type 2 (Th2) cells.  A possible mechanism for T               cell anergy involves the inappropriate expression or activation of              cyclins, highly conserved cell cycle regulatory proteins.  The                  first objective to test this possibility is to characterize cyclin              use during cell cycle progression of non-tolerized murine Th1 and               Th2 clones.  Immunoblotting techniques and H1 histone kinase assays             will be used to study the levels and/or activation states of a                  panel of cyclin mRNAs, cyclin proteins and cyclin-CDK complexes in              resting and antigen-activated Th cells.  The second objective is to             examine the effects of tolerance induction on normal Th1 and Th2                cell cyclin use.  Since little is known about cyclin use in                     mammalian lymphocytes, the results of the experiments described                 here will be novel, and potentially useful in delineating T cell                activation and anergy.                                                          %%%                                                                             The planning activities to be supported by this grant will give the             investigator, whose background is in cellular immunology,                       experience in methods of molecular biology so that she can pursue               studies of the molecular basis of the phenomenon of T cell                      tolerance in immune function.",
