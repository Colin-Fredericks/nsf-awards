Osamu Wada and Shigenobu Yamakoshi for 24 months at Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd., in Atsugi, Japan.  The team will experiment with Dr. Sahara's designs of ultra fast electro optic sampling systems in order to improve the performance of compound semiconductor optoelectronic devices.  Optoelectronic devices, because of their high speed and compatibility with electronic systems, are a common frontier in information transfer for both communication and computer systems.  Optoelectronic modulators have already been integrated with distributed feedback laser diodes (DFBLDs) to produce components for communication systems that will allow shorter pulses to travel longer distances without degrading.  Some fabrication and design techniques developed for DFBLDs can be transferred to the relatively undeveloped technology of vert ical cavity service emitting lasers (VCSELs) that have the potential to transfer even larger amounts of information at even faster speeds.  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan (MITI) has targeted VCSELs as a key technology for the future and are encouraging Fujitsu as well as other Japanese electronic corporations to conduct research in this field.  Drs. Wada and Yamakoshi of Fujitsu are world leaders in DFBLD technology who are developing new compounds and designs to improve DFBLDs and who are turning to VCSELs as their next project as Fujitsu commercially develops DFBLDs.  Sahara's experience in subpicosecond pulse generation using DFBLDs fits well with the expertise and research goals of Wada and Yamakoshi.  A 24 month stay at Fujitsu will allow Sahara to gain not only first hand experience at a research laboratory of a major Japanese electronics producer, but also leading edge knowledge of VSCELs, commercially competitive optoelectronic devices of the future.",
