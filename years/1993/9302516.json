 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concentrates on three areas of mathematical                   research in partial differential equations.  The first concerns                 the general theory of degenerate elliptic Bellman equations with                underlying quasilinear operators.  These equations arise as the                 dynamic programming equations for controlled diffusions.  In many               important cases the equations become degenerate, i.e. the                       governing matrix in the equation becomes singular, and the wealth               of theory on elliptic equations is no longer applicable.  The                   goals of this work are to develop new techniques for proving                    a prior estimates on solutions, investigation of nonlinear                      equations related to the real and complex Monge-Ampere equations                and to study equations of surfaces with prescribed curvature.  A                second area of investigation focuses on viscosity solutions of                  nonlinear elliptic equations.  The use of this concept, which is                similar to that of finding the value function in control theory,                allows one to investigate solutions of nonlinear equations                      without assuming that they are differentiable.  Once a solution                 is known to exist in the viscosity sense, an important problem of               numerical or other approximation arises.  Work will be                          done developing methods for estimating the speed of convergence                 of approximations to the true solution.  To construct                           good approximations one must also make further investigations                   into the smoothness properties of viscosity solutions.  The third               element of this research concerns properties of solutions of                    linear parabolic equations with white noise forcing terms.  These               are equations in which randomness is a natural ingredient.                      They arise in filtering problems, genetics, quantum mechanics                   and magneto-dynamics.  Very little work has been done                           in approximating solutions to such equations.  This research will               concentrate on those equations defined on bounded domains in                    which the boundary conditions introduce unusual problems not                    encountered in the deterministic equations                                           Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical               modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical                       analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to                     provide qualitative and quantitative information about the                      solutions.  This may include answers to questions about                         uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often                 develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on                the accuracy of these approximations.",
