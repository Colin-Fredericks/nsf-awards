 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry at the University of North                     Carolina at Chapel Hill is requesting funds for the purchase of                 picosecond laser equipment and ancillary electronic and optical                 devices.  These acquisitions will supplememt present research                   capabilities for a multiplicity of programs requiring picosecond                time resolution, for example, transient absorption, dynamics of                 photo-driven events and characterization of nonlinear optical                   properties of materials.                                                                                                                                            Included in the research proposed with this equipment are:                                                                                                  1) Light induced electron and energy transfer in transition metal               complexes.                                                                      2) Directed electron and energy transfer in peptide assemblies.                 3) Electron transfer rates in polymeric solvents: slow solvent                  dipoles.                                                                        4) Glasses of polymeric layered ultra-structure for optimum                     nonlinear optical responses.                                                    5)  Characterization of  short-lived unsaturated organometallic                 complexes using transient absorption spectroscopy.                              6) Multiphoton ionizationn via short lived Rydberg states and real              time dynamics in weakly bound complexes.                                             The system will be available to all members of the UNC                     scientific community.  The instruments requested will all be                    conjoined with picosecond equipment assembled in the Department's               Laser Laboratory, a multiuser facility operating since 1975.                    %%%                                                                                  Picosecond laser spectroscopy is a method for studying the                 very rapid ( 1/1,000,000,000,000 of a second) molecular processes               that occur in chemical reactions and chemical dynamics.  Such                   studies give one accurate information about the step-by-step                    details of how a chemical reaction proceeds and often give                      information about how a chemical process can be altered in order to             give different products or make a given process more efficient.",
