 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support continued research on the feasibility               of using discarded vehicle tires for producing marketable forms                 of carbon.  The proposal leading to this recommendation results                 from successful completion of a Phase I, Small Business                         Innovation Research project conducted under NSF Grant No. 92-                   15045 in which the feasibility of a pyrolysis process to convert                used tires into potentially marketable carbon products was                      demonstrated.  In Phase II, the investigator plans on extending                 work initiated during the previous phase to address questions of                optimal tire particle size, gas composition for the activation                  step and the potential uses for process by-products.                                                                                                            A significant problem in management of solid wastes is addressed                by the project.  Accumulations of tires on occasion become                      ignited causing significant environmental problems.  Methods to                 reprocess tires for recovery and reuse of their components may be               a more environmentally correct way of dealing with them than                    either controlled or uncontrolled combustion.  This Phase II                    award was made in accord with procedures contained in Program                   Solicitation NSF 90-31, Small Business Innovation Research.",
