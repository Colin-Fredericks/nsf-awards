 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existing research is extended to include   logical-operational characterizations of computational complexity,    i.e., applicative calculi and proof formalisms.    Various  applications in computing theory and  programming methodology also is explored.   The PI introduced a new  approach to proof theoretic study of  computational complexity, which was  applied to feasible  complexity classes.  That approach is exo-algebraic, i.e.,  referring to free algebras within broader structures.  While  earlier work used  second-order logic to explicitly define  free algebras, recent work shows that  the exo-algebraic  approach can be easily applied also to first-order theories.  That approach has the advantages of being free of any  initial functions, of  permitting foundational delineations  of complexity classes, of allowing  explicit reference to all  computable functions without extending the logic to  partially-defined terms, and of having particularly  streamlined proof theory  and model theory.    This work (1) applies exo-algebraic formalisms as above  to obtain logic-based, machine-independent classifications  of computational  complexity classes, thereby relating  computational complexity to fundamental  parameters of  logical complexity; (2) uses these characterizations to obtain  new relations between computational complexity and    foundations of programming, program verification, type    theory, and computational mathematics; and (3) applies  the  logic-based characterizations to investigate computation  complexity  proper.",
