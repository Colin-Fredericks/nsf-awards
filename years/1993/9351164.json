 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed project is to enrich the research                      experiences of beginning, intermediate, and advanced psychology                 undergraduates by providing access to a networked microcomputer                 laboratory. A networked laboratory, rather than a set of                        individual PCs, centralizes and expands laboratory resources                    with a curriculum-wide exposure in psychology. This encourages                  students to communicate with each other and the instructor on-                  line as they are working, provides a detailed record of student                 use, and runs software that would be impossible on existing                     stand-alone equipment. Undergraduates also design and conduct                   three independent study projects each year and a senior thesis                  project their fourth. It is expected that this project will                     provide a setting where students can concentrate on hypothesis                  testing and conceptual analysis through data collection and                     analyses.",
