University of North Carolina at Wilmington  Wilmington, NC    \"Cape Fear Summer Science Camp\"    Cape Fear Summer Camp is a four-week summer program combined with academic year follow-  up activities aimed at increasing minority representation in the areas of science, engineering and  mathematics.  Objectives of the program include providing students with hands-on experience  developing the process skills of observation, measurement and analysis.  Successive groups of  fifty minority students will be taught by experienced public school science and mathematic  instructors.  Classroom and laboratory instruction will be integrated with field exercises with a  coastal science emphasis.  Some of the accomplished graduates from each group will serve as  peer mentors for subsequent students and will also participate in focused career exploration  activities including involvement in mentoring relationships with professionals working in science,  technology and engineering occupations.",
