 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312003  Silberschatz    The use of data at different levels of information content is  essential to the performance of very large databases because lower  information content (or lower resolution) data is smaller and thus  can significantly decrease I/O and communication costs.  The  ability to trade query response resolution for faster performance  has been suggested as an approach to meeting real-time performance  constraints.  These two performance advantages of a multiresolution  system can be exploited fully only by a database management system  (DBMS) that supports the convenient retrieval of data at different  levels of resolution.  A data model that defines and supports the  notions of multiresolution and incremental improvement of query  responses, or \"progressive refinement,\" is constructed.  The basis  of this model is a new construct, called the \"sandbag,\" for  representing imprecise information about a set.  Practical,  efficient algorithms that implement the sandbag, and thus enable a  multiresolution DBMS, are developed.  An extended query language  that specifies the tradeoff of resolution for performance, and a  mechanism for implementing such queries, are also developed.  This  research will provide solutions which effectively balance  performance and cost for the information-processing challenges of  next generation database applications such as multimedia,  scientific, geographic, and other very large databases.   ***",
