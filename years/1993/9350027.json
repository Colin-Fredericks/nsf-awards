Arkansas intends to restructure mathematics and science  education by changing attitudes toward mathematics and  science, improving student knowledge and skills and  fostering long-term community involvement in the education  system.  This transformation will occur through the work of  regional partnerships, each of which is a coalition of  schools, colleges, businesses, parents, and other community  leaders.  To ensure that needed changes occur, the  initiative will develop mathematics and science frameworks,  implement large-scale teacher development through the  Arkansas Math and Science Crusades, equip every classroom  with appropriate materials and technology, bring scientists  and mathematicians into classrooms, and place teachers in  real-world research settings.      Community education and leadership development will involve  parents and local leaders in important education system  roles.  Changes in teacher preparation and certification  will ensure that all students have access to quality  instruction.  The Applied Academics curriculum will  restructure vocational education, and appropriate forms of  technology will be employed throughout the Initiative.  In  addition, the State will be developing a new assessment  system that will include performance assessment and student  portfolios.  This new assessment system will be used to  monitor the success of the initiative.***",
