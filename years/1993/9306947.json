 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quantum mechanical tunneling of macroscopic degrees of freedom              will be studied in magnetic systems, such as the total moment in                ferromagnetic and the Neel vector in antiferromagnetic particles of             size approx. 100 Angstroms. If such exists, it would significantly              enlarge the known range of applicability of the superposition                   principle. Special emphasis will be placed upon studying                        dissipation due to environmental degrees of freedom with a view to              guiding and understanding experiments. Examples of dissipative                  agents are nuclear spins, eddy currents and spin waves. Certain                 quantum phenomena resulting from the topological phase in the spin              path integral will also be studied. Magnetic domain wall motion                 will also be studied from a tunneling perspective. A combination of             path integral and perturbative methods will be employed involving               both numerical and analytical work.                                             %%%                                                                             This proposal involves the theoretical study of quantum mechanics               applied to systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. The               question is whether systems whose state is determined by a                      superposition of macroscopically distinct states (eg. a magnetic                moment and its orientation) can behave in a similar way to those                with few degrees of freedom - that is exhibit tunneling across                  classically forbidden barriers or exhibit resonance. Good                       candidates for these phenomena are small magnetic particles, but,               to date, experiments aiming at proof of existence have been                     controversial. This work aims to guide and critique experiment and              to study those mechanisms (energy loss) which could mask the                    effect. The work has value because of its possible relevance to                 magnetic recording media where such effects would be undesirable.",
