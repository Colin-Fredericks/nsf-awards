The paradigm of an extracellular adhesin, fibronectin,                   interacting with a transmembrane receptor has proven applicable to              a number of adhesion systems.  In parallel has come the realization             that the transmembrane receptor for fibronectin is only one member              of the integrin family of functionally and structurally related                 cell surface receptors.  These receptors and their ligands are                  involved in many basic functions of cells of all types, including               plants, e.g., adhesion, determination of shape, differentiation,                migration, cytoskeletal organization, and organization of                       extracellular matrix.  The challenge to the field over the next                 several years is to comprehend and organize the large amount of new             structural information and design experiments based on it.  This                conference will serve as a valuable forum to present and discuss                new information, identify problem areas, and plan new approaches.",
