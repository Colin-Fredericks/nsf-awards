 "awd_abstract_narration": "Periglacial processes are those processes that operate in                  near-glacial conditions, whether along the margins of glaciers or               in areas where the climates are almost cold enough to support                   glaciation.  In locales like the Driftless Area of southwestern                 Wisconsin and parts of the northern Appalachians just beyond the                limits of Pleistocene glaciation, and in locales like those of                  central and northern Alaska, periglacial processes have had                     significant impacts on the landscape.  Quaternary scientists long               have attempted to differentiate between the effects of various                  periglacial processes, but unambiguous lines of evidence are                    rare, and standard analytic procedures to identify forms of mass-               wasting in periglacial environments have not been well developed.               This doctoral dissertation research process will focus on                       comparisons of the directional orientation of \"clast fabrics\"                   (materials consisting of rock fragments) within colluvium from                  three different sites.  Two of these sites (one in central Alaska               and one in southwestern New York and northwestern Pennsylvania)                 are locales where previous studies have identified formations                   that appear to be relics of previous periglacial episodes.  The                 third site (in eastern Alaska) is a site where periglacial                      processes are still active.  Data derived from material extracted               from these sites will be analyzed with other sedimentary and                    environmental data in order to assess the validity of extant                    models of sediment-transport processes operating in periglacial                 environments.                                                                        This research project will provide valuable new insights                   from a number of perspectives.  Methodological advances should be               realized through refinement of new statistical approaches for                   identifying and comparing orientational variations within and                   between deposits.  Fundamental knowledge of the processes                       operating in periglacial environments also will be advanced, with               special value likely to result from efforts to relate fossil                    evidence to active processes.  As a doctoral dissertation                       improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable               a promising student to establish a strong independent research                  career.",
