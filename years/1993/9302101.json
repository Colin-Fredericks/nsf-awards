 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302101 Kelly The dynamic performance of lightly damped structural systems subjected to wind or earthquake excitation can be significantly enhanced by the use of tuned mass dampers (TMD).  The objective of this project is to develop an innovative multidisciplinary approach to mass damping through the use of mechanical devices which provide triangular hysteresis loops as a means of dissipating energy in TMD systems.  For enhanced performance through active control, real time tuning mechanisms for these hysteretic mass dampers will be evaluated.  The goals include: (i) identification of optimal hysteresis for mass dampers systems under seismic and wind excitation; (ii) development of semi active control techniques to further enhance mass damping performance; and  (iii) construction of devices implementing the optimal hysteretic behavior and verification building system performance by earthquake simulator testing.  Support for the construction of the hysteretic mechanical devices will be provided by two commercial firms.  To accomplish both of these objectives the research team conducting this work will use a combination of conceptual and computational techniques combined with rigorous experimental modeling techniques.  All research and development for this program will be provided by a collaborative effort of both practicing engineers and academic researchers. ***",
