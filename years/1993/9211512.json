The  objective of the RALPH (Rational Agents with Limited Performance  Hardware) project is to understand the effect of limited  computational resources on the design of optimal decision-making  systems.  Work to date has specified a normative theory of  metareasoning to control computation, and has applied it to several  combinatorial problem classes; in all cases significant performance  improvements over standard algorithms have been record.  The  methodology for applying the theory has been developed in detail,  and has been used by other researchers to solve complex problems.   The PI will continue to work on more general decision-theoretic  metalevel architectures; probabilistic planning and scheduling  systems; and composition of real-time systems, for which  preliminary results have been obtained.  A software environment  will be developed that allows complex real-time agents to be  constructed automatically from elementary soft-real-time  components.  A final element of the proposal is the construction of  provably optimal bounded agents.  Working initially in a class of  simple rile-based machines, it will be shown that a learning  algorithm can converge quickly to an approximately optimal rule  set.  These results will be extended to find the scope and limits  of adaptive methods for achieving bounded rationality, thereby  contributing to the foundation for a science of artificial  intelligence.",
