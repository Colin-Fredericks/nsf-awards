The manual will be published in English and              Spanish and will include keys, diagrams, descriptions and                       geographic distribution of the plant species.  Simultaneously, this             data (checklists, keys, full treatments and illustrations) will be              available as a computerized database to scientists and students.                Collaborators in Costa Rica include scientists at INBio, the Museo              Nacional and the Organization for Tropical Studies.  The data will              be incorporated into a GIS database at INBio.  Representative plant             collections for research and training of students have been and                 will continue to be deposited at these institutions as well a                   Missouri Botanical Garden.  The manual and the on-line database                 will be an essential biodiversity research and conservation                     reference for tropical biologists and for biologists in Costa Rica              and throughout Latin America.                                                   %%%                                                                             This biodiversity study will complete a remarkable ten-year study               to survey, inventory and document the plants of Costa Rica.
