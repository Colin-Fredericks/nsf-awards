This  laboratory is part of a new two- course sequence offered to  seniors in computer engineering. The primary objectives of this  project are: (1) to expose the students to all aspects of  systems design, starting from the behavioral level down to the  layout level; and (2) to teach the fundamental engineering  discipline involved in evaluation, testing and redesign. These  primary objectives are being achieved by addressing the  following important aspects of systems design: (1) use of  multiple levels of abstraction; (2) methods of evaluating a  design in terms of performance, area, design time and cost at  each level; (3) examining tradeoffs among the possible choices  that are available at each level; (4) understanding the limits  of fabrication technology, causes and effects of failures and  fault models; and (5) understanding that design and test cannot  be separate activities by introducing design for testability.   The purpose of the laboratory is to provide hands on experience  through the use of the latest CAD tools and a computing  environment that reflects the state-of-the-art in industry. The  tools  eliminate much of the mundane aspects of the design and  allow the students to focus on the important high level design  issues. Theoretical knowledge and practical design experience  are carefully balanced through a set of realistic design  projects that involve the students in all aspects of systems  design. In addition, the laboratory provides for rapid  prototyping of the designs through the use of Field  Programmable Gate Arrays. This allows students to build,  exercise, and re-evaluate designs.  ***",
