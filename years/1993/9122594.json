 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Hungary biochemical research project on                                 \"Structurally Related Serine Proteases\" is                                      between Dr. William J. Rutter of The Hormone                                    Research Institute, University of California-San                                Francisco, and Dr. Gabor Pal of Eotvos                                          University, Budapest.  Serene proteases, such as                                trypsin and chymotrypsin, share a 3-dimensional                                 structure and possess an identical catalytic                                    apparatus but display strikingly different                                      substrate specificities.  As such, they are ideal                               models to study how the substrate recognition                                   process (ground state stabilization) relates to                                 catalysis (transition state stabilization).  Via                                site-directed mutagenesis, a series of                                          alterations of the substrate binding pocket of                                  trypsin (residues 189195, 214-220, 225-228) were                                made to produce mutants with chymotrypsin-like                                  specificity.  One of the trypsin mutants (D189S,                                YG217-219SGG, Q192M) is of particular interest.                                 Its affinity toward various peptide substrates of                               chymotrypsin (P1=Leu, Phe, Tyr, Trp) is                                         comparable to that of chymotrypsin, while its                                   catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) is 3-4 orders of                                 magnitude less than that of chymotrypsin or                                     trypsin.  Thus the redesigned and apparently                                    tight enzyme-substrate interactions in the ground                               state do not seem to properly contribute to                                     transition state stabilization.  One                                            interpretation of these results is that the                                     interaction of trypsin and chyumotrypsin with                                   their own substrates might induce differential                                  conformational changes crucial for optimal                                      transition state stabilization.  In this                                        proposal, the researchers suggest that the                                      structural unit that mediates such differential                                 structural changes upon substrate binding may be                                identical with the so-called \"activation domain\"                                of trypsin and chymotryupsin.  The researchers'                                 view is that the different conformational                                       flexibility of these domains in trypsin and                                     chymotrypsin may represent the structural basis                                 for different substrate specificities of these                                  two proteases.  Thus, to interchange the                                        substrate specificities of trypsin and                                          chymotrypsin (without a dramatic loss of                                        activity), the activation domains rather than                                   just the substrate binding pockets have to be                                   interchanged.  The researchers will test this                                   hypothesis.                                                                                                                                                     This project in biochemistry fulfills the program                               objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                  enlisting leading experts in the United States                                  and Eastern Europe to continue complementary                                    talents and pool resources in areas of strong                                   mutual interest and competence.",
