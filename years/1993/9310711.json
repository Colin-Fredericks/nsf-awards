 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310711  Winkler    Mr. David G. Haskell's doctoral-dissertation research will investigate how  variations in predation risk have affected the evolution of begging calls of nestling  wood warblers (Parulidae).  These diverse New World tropical migrants nest in a  wide variety of sites, and Mr. Haskell's recent experiments show that nestlings  begging from ground nests incur greater increases in the risk of predation than do  nestlings begging from trees.  Mr. Haskell will now test the hypothesis that  ground-nesting species have begging calls that are harder to hear and to locate  than the begging calls of tree-nesting species.    This will be the first comparative study of nestling calls to use standardized  recording protocols and to take into account the phylogenetic relationships of the  species being compared.  Predation is the major source of mortality for most  nestling birds, an the results of this study should be of interest to biologists  interested in the productivity of bird populations and the behaviors that have  evolved to mitigate nestling mortality.  The evolution of begging has also been the  subject of considerable theoretical work, and this study should be of interest to  biologists studying the evolution of parent-offspring interactions as well.",
