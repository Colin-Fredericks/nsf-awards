 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support to enhance the scientific skills                    of 72 middle school teachers in Northern Florida and Southern                   Georgia. The project is for three years and is designed to                      help the middle school teachers improve their knowledge and                     understanding of science. The project also aims to decrease                     the isolation of these teachers by increasing the                               communication between and among teachers and a university-                      based team. These needs will be met through the following set                   of interrelated activities: (a) Course work in science content                  and curriculum and instruction; (b) Activities including                        seminar series on: the use of computers for research,                           communication and instruction; issues in science education,                     such as special needs of minority and female students, and                      current topics in science; and leadership training; (c)                         Research in both science and science education; (d) Short and                   extended site visits; and (e) Communication including                           electronic mail, and meetings during the academic year.                                                                                                         Teachers participating in the project have the opportunity to                   complete the program in three years and will have met the                       requirements for a Masters' Degree in Science Education.                                                                                                        Cost sharing is equivalent to 30% of the NSF award.",
