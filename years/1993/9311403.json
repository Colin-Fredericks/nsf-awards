This transnational study will compare  orientations toward law and normative ordering in three new  democracies in Eastern Central Europe (Hungary, Poland and  Bulgaria) to those in more established democracies (Spain, France  and the United States).  This research represents the first phase  of a project which will measure citizen rights consciousness, and  attitudes toward procedural justice and rights and duties in these  six countries.  During this first phase, the investigator, working  with U.S. collaborators and collaborators in various countries in  Eastern Europe, will develop a survey questionnaire to measure  attitudes towards law and normative ordering across the six  countries.  The questionnaire will be pretested in the U.S. and the  five foreign countries and surveys conducted in two U.S. cities.   Findings from this preliminary work will be analyzed and used to  develop a larger study in the five foreign countries.  %%%  This research will increase knowledge about orientations toward law  and normative ordering in countries which are in different stages  of democratization.  It will also contribute to our understanding  of how to successfully conduct cross-cultural surveys.   ***",
