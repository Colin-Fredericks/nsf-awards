Based in  the State's existing standards-based reform efforts and in strong  connections to the State's major science- and mathematics-focused  businesses, PEAKS will support local school districts as they first  develop curriculum and assessment standards based on those adopted  by the State and then prepare and implement a plan for staff  development, uses of technology, community involvement, assurance  of educational equity, assessment, policy review, documentation of  student achievement, and establishing a professional development  school for teacher development.    The program will develop a centralized enabling structure for  bottom-up changes, making extensive use of existing efforts that  have proven successful in the State.  Local Catalyst Partnerships  between schools and institutions of higher education, parents,  business and industry, state and federal agencies will develop and  implement a standards-based education system that has high  expectations for all students.  Regional Collaboratives will  provide technical assistance, professional development, and  linkages to national, state, and local resources to the Local  Catalyst Partnerships.  A State infrastructure of leadership,  policies, and mechanisms to support system alignment and local  innovation completes the set of networks that will organize the  program.  ***",
