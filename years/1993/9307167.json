 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past year, a number of sources have independently                    reported and documented a multi-year history of dumping of nuclear              and other toxic waste materials by the Former Soviet Union (FSU)                into the Arctic Ocean, its marginal seas, and its larger                        tributaries.  Materials dumped or lost in the marine environment                are purported to include: sealed barrels of radioactive waste,                  other hazardous and toxic waste, fueled nuclear submarines, and                 intact nuclear reactors.  The magnitude of the damage and risk                  resulting from these historical activities of the FSU to aquatic                ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems, and human inhabitants of the                Arctic and beyond is unknown.  However, the Arctic nations and many             other non-governmental entities are voicing concerns about both                 short- and long-term consequences.                                              The purpose of the IARPC workshop is to assess the extent of                    marine, terrestrial, and atmospheric contamination in the Arctic                resulting from the historical practices of the Former Soviet Union.             The primary product of the workshop will be a document, An IARPC                Action Plan for Assessing Arctic Contamination Resulting From                   Disposal Practices of the Former Soviet Union.                                  The principal tasks of the workshop will be to:                                      A)  characterize the extent of Arctic contamination by                          evaluation of existing data and information about sources and                   types of FSU contaminant releases.                                              B)  evaluate and define known and probable transport pathways,                  sinks, and likely effects of Arctic contaminants.                               C)  prepare a plan with recommendations for an integrated                       assessment of FSU Arctic contamination.                                         D)  plan for future systematic monitoring efforts, and                          formulate a strategy to utilize ships and aircraft of                           opportunity that will be journeying to the Arctic.                              E)  prepare for Federal policy and decision makers                              recommendations and a summary of existing information on how                    to best deal with the issue of Arctic contamination.                                                                                                       This workshop is being sponsored by several of the IARPC agencies.",
