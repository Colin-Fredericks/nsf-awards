 "awd_abstract_narration": "Feather mites are obligate commensals on or in the feathers of            birds and are known to occur on every avian family except the                   penguins, totids, and ratites of South America and Australia.  The              more than 2,000 species (estimated to represent 10% of the total                fauna) are assigned to 379 named and approximately 64 new genera                arranged in 32 families and three superfamilies.  Among these taxa              there are many examples of convergent evolution of form, apparent               coevoloution of hosts and commensals, and specializations for                   different microhabitats on and in feathers.                                           At the present time, it is still practically impossible for               non-specialists to make valid determinations even though there are              many papers on feather mites.  The reasons for this are simple -                there are no reliable keys to families, few inclusive keys to                   genera and species within families, and no guides to the vast                   literature.                                                                           In collaboration chiefly with Dr. J. Gaud (Nice, France), the             leading authority of feather mites, we will rectify the lamentable              situation concerning identification.  We plan to produce an                     illustrated publication for the identification of the                           aforementioned supraspecific taxa.  The first step is to complete               illustrations of species to represent the 379 genera.  These should             be completed in one year.                                                             The combined 75 years of experience of Dr. J. Gaud and the                principal investigator make us uniquely qualified to undertake this             major project.  When completed, the publication will open the field             of feather mite systematics where so much basic research is needed,             especially phylogenetic, biological and ontogenetic studies, and                host-commensal relationships.",
