 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores three aspects of algorithmic  techniques,  partitioning schemes and fault-tolerance schemes   of parallel  algorithms by designing and implementing several classes of  algorithms on the  CM-5 parallel machine.  The motivation for this  project is in developing a  methodology for the design and  implementation of fast, efficient, and robust  parallel algorithms  for scalable multicomputers.  In the context of algorithmic  techniques, the results of the research enable the designer  to choose  between synchronous and asynchronous algorithms, and  allow the designer to use  different techniques, such as iterative  and divide-and-conquer, at different  levels of a parallel  algorithm.  The research also identifies the tradeoffs  among  various partitioning schemes for a given application.  In the  context of  fault-tolerance techniques, the research shows how  to exploit the  fault-tolerance inherent in iterative algorithms,  and devise suitable  fault-tolerance schemes for applications such  as solving partial differential  equations.  Preliminary results,  obtained from implementations on the CM-5  machine, indicate that  asynchronous iterative algorithms achieve speedups over  their  synchronous counterparts, and that several divide-and-conquer  algorithms  can be implemented efficiently on the CM-5 parallel  machine.  As part of this  project, many subproblems that are  specific to the CM-5 system are  formulated and solved.",
