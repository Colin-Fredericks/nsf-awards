 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Massachusetts Microelectronics Center (M2C) plans to                        conduct a two-week (ten day) project-oriented workshop on the                   fundamentals of microelectronic systems education. This                         workshop is directed towards Electrical and Computer                            Engineering faculty with some experience in VLSI design but                     little or no experience with microelectronic systems building.                  The goal of the workshop is to equip the faculty with the                       resources necessary to develop and conduct undergraduate                        courses in microelectronics systems design that would culminate                 in rapid prototyping and testing of a system that incorporates                  multiple components and technologies with well-defined                          interfaces. Topics will include: the computer-aided engineering                 (CAE) approach to systems design, technology selection                          criteria, rapid prototyping, technology re-targeting, high-                     level description languages, multi-level simulation techniques,                 and systems test methodology. An integral part of the workshop                  experience is a system design project which illustrates each                    stage of the design process with an emphasis on design trade-                   offs based upon implementation technology. A combination of                     public domain and commercial CAE tools is used. Working in                      project teams, attendees  build a prototype system in FPGAs and                 then re-target the design specification to a standard-cell CMOS                 technology.  One month after the workshop each attendee                         receives a set of the chips designed by his/her team and a test                 fixture for use in their undergraduate microelectronic systems                  design courses.",
