 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to better prepare students of computer              science/software engineering, both majors and minors, in the areas              of hardware-dependent software development. A laboratory built                  around the central theme of the interdependence of software and                 hardware in computer, as well as embedded, systems will be                      developed. This laboratory will serve as the hands on and                       experimentation center for three courses; Computer Architecture,                Microprocessor Systems, and Real-Time Software Systems.                         Students graduating from such a program, will have had hands-on                 experiences with interfacing, data acquisition, real-time                       programming, and observing the physical results of numerically                  computed solutions to problems. They will be better prepared                    for positions as systems developers and/or applications                         programmers to work as members of computing and/or embedded                     systems development teams. Likewise, the laboratory to support                  this series of courses will better prepare students for                         graduate school.",
