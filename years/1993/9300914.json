They will apply Dr.  Silverstein's theories on the genetic parameters defining growth and reproductive traits of the  male coho salmon to the stock of masu salmon at Dr. Ogata's laboratory.    The breeding of fast growing, late maturing fish is a central goal of salmonid culture.  The  relationship between growth and sexual maturation is of great importance especially since  there is a marked reduction in growth rate and loss of economic value in salmon when they  begin to sexually mature.  Previous research on condition factors and fat levels of fast  growing, early maturing males has led to a hypothesis that an energy or growth threshold  must be surpassed in order for sexual maturation to ensue.  The goal of Silverstein and Ogata  is to examine salmonids with known differences in sexual maturation phenotype for  differences in nutrient partitioning into fat and lean growth.  Utilizing Dr. Ogata's expertise in  masu salmon genetics, the team will examine 10 full-sibling families of salmon which have  high and low probabilities for early maturation and develop assays for metabolic enzymes  such as ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), fatty acid synthetase, ATP citrate lyase, and several  NADPH generating enzymes.  The experimental results will not only clarify the association  between metabolic and sexual maturation phenotypes, it will provide evidence of biochemical  differences between fast and slow growing phenotypes.  By gaining an understanding of lean  and fat growth in these species of salmon, the salmonid industry will be able to more quickly  modify its selection criteria and approach its goal of fast growth and delayed ma turation in  cultured fish.",
