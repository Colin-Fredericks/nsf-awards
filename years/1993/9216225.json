 "awd_abstract_narration": "The right of appeal is a critical factor in the American judicial               system not only because of its implications for the status of the               individual in the political system but also because its use defines             the real scope of the judiciary.  Therefore, the decision by a                  losing litigant to appeal, or not to appeal, carries great import               for the functioning and legitimacy of the political system.  This               issue has been addressed at the theoretical level, producing a                  range of models purporting to account for the decision to appeal:               a systemic model, that locates the explanation of a decision to                 appeal in the structure and process of the judicial system itself;              an individual resources model, that imputes the decision to the                 litigant's access to resources; an economic model suggesting that               a calculus of costs and benefits determines the decision; and a                 psychological model that posits three motivational processes of                 naming, blaming and claiming.  These models all assume that the                 decision to litigate is determined by some kind of response to the              outcome of the case at trial, but no empirical work has yet been                done to test the validity of these models.  Another theory of                   litigant decision-making focuses not only on the outcome of any                 case but also on how the procedure to reach that outcome affects                the litigant.  Empirical studies of this \"procedural justice                    factor\" at the trial level suggest that it could be applicable to               the decision to appeal.                                                                                                                                         This doctoral dissertation proposes to test hypotheses drawn from               these various theories.  Data will be collected from several                    sources.  First, the investigator will analyze interview data from              the RAND/ICJ study.  Second, 60 open-ended interviews will be                   conducted with losing litigants in tort and contract cases who                  filed a Notice of Appeal with the Court of Appeals of Cook County               in Chicago.  For purposes of testing external validity, a                       comparable group will be interviewed in Ramsey County in Minnesota.             A control group of losing litigants who chose not to appeal will                also be interviewed in each jurisdiction.  Third, an extensive                  questionnaire will be administered to 100 appellants and 100 non-               appellants in tort and contract actions, including both plaintiff               and defendant appellants.  Various quantitative and qualitative                 analyses will be employed to test the validity of the various                   explanatory models discussed above.                                                                                                                             The research will make an important theoretical contribution to our             understanding of individual dynamics within the judicial system.                The findings will clarify a continuing debate over the character                of litigant motivations, and provide an empirical basis for                     interpreting how these motivations affect the appellate process.",
