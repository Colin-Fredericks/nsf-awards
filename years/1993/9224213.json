 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zeta functions play a well-recognized role in many areas of                mathematics.  In 1992-93, the Japan-US Mathematical Institute at                Johns Hopkins University is hosting a special year on zeta                      functions in number theory and in geometric analysis.  This award               is for a conference to be held March 29- April 3,1993, to bring                 together researchers in these subjects.  Visitors to Hopkins                    during Spring 1993 in areas related to number theoretic zeta                    functions include A. Gyoja, T. Kimura, D. Meuser, F. Sato, and T.               Yano.  Visitors in areas related to the geometric analysis                      aspects include T. Adachi, A. Katsuda, Y. Petridis, and T.                      Sunada.  One connection between these two areas is the study of                 zeta functions associated to quotients of symmetric spaces, e.g.                in the spectral theory of automorphic forms.  Another is the                    study of the fine structure of the zeroes of various L-functions,               which resembles that of the eigen-values of various Laplacians.                 A more informal connections is that the principal researchers in                these areas often have an intense interest in the strong                        analogies between their work and that in areas not directly                     related.  We will describe the two areas separately below, but in               the second part (zeta functions in geometric analysis) we will                  try to indicate some of the overlap between number-theoretic and                geometric-analytic zeta functions.                                                   This project proposes a conference on zeta functions in                    number theory and geometric analysis, with emphasis on the                      following subjects: (i) zeta functions of prehomogeneous vector                 spaces and Igusa zeta functions; (ii) the zeta functions which                  arise in the spectral theory of the Laplacian.  The proposed                    conference is planned so as to take advantage of the                            concentration of experts in these areas present at Johns Hopkins                in connection with the concentration year held by the Japan-U.S.                Mathematical Institute.",
