 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Olson will work with collaborators at Rutgers University /                  Newark and the New Jersey Institute of Technology to design,                    construct and test a miniature hydrophone for intracochlear                     pressure measurements.  By reducing sensor size and increasing                  sensitivity compared to previous intracochlear pressure probes,                 spatial resolution will be improved, and a better opportunity will              exist to explore cochlear pressures at low signal levels.  At these             levels, the motion of cochlear sensory tissue becomes nonlinear,                apparently to enhance sensitivity.  If measurements of nonlinearity             in intracochlear pressure are possible, their results will be                   useful in resolving the controversy over the process driving                    cochlear nonlinearity.  Beyond its use in cochlear research, a                  miniature pressure sensor will have diverse applications, for                   example, as a component of hearing aids and ultrasonic image                    processors.                                                                                                                                                     Interactive activities at the host institution include conducting               a \"Saturday Science Program\" outreach effort targeted at junior                 high school students in the community, in which a group of                      students, parents and chaperones will go on bi-weekly field trips               to area science labs.  Lab tours will be conducted by host                      scientists, half of whom will be women.  The goals of the program               are improvement of scientific literacy, infusion of scientific                  curiosity, and demonstration of the capability of women to be                   successful in scientific endeavors.                                                                                                                             This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
