CH4 and NMHC oxidation rates will be determined by measuring             14CH4 and 14C2H6 uptake.  The role of CH4 and NMHC oxidation in                 carbon cycling and local productivity will also be investigated.                Specifically, the contribution of oxidation to the production of                utilizable organic carbon, in the form of methanotrophic biomass,               which is available to the benthic community in the immediate                    vicinity of these sites will be estimated by measuring the fraction             of labelled CH4 or C2H6 which is incorporated into cell carbon.                 This study will allow a better assessment of the role of oxidation              in removing CH4 and NMHC released from seeps and hydrates into the              coastal ocean and identify the major sites where oxidation occurs.",
