 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Brazil Cooperative Science Program                                      award will support research collaboration by                                    seven US mathematicians from various                                            institutions, led by Bradley Plohr of the State                                 University of New York at Stony Brook, with a                                   Brazilian group led by Daniel Marchesin of the                                  Pure and Applied Mathematics Institute (IMPA)                                   in Rio de Janeiro.  The award will also support                                 participation by two US mathematicians in a                                     July 1993 Workshop on Partial Differential                                      Equations, held at IMPA.  The research project                                  aims to analyze mixed-type systems of                                           conservation laws, which will also be a focus                                   of the Workshop.                                                                                                                                                These systems occur in several scientific                                       areas, including multiphase flow,                                               elastoplasticity, and magnetohydrodynamics.                                     Funds will support travel to Brazil by four US                                  mathematicians and three US graduate students,                                  as well as travel to the US by a Brazilian                                      graduate student.  The researchers will build                                   on their previous work on the mathematical                                      theory of fundamental solutions of nonlinear                                    systems of conservation laws, including                                         stability and bifurcation.  They will use this                                  theory to upgrade the general computer program                                  for nonlinear waves, to allow use in more                                       complicated systems that arise in applications,                                 such as enhanced oil recovery and                                               elastoplasticity.  They will also focus on modelling                            issues uncovered from knowledge of such                                         solutions.  The US side will benefit from                                       interaction with counterparts at IMPA, which is                                 a center of excellence in dynamical systems.                                    The Brazilian side will strengthen their                                        expertise in applied mathematics.",
