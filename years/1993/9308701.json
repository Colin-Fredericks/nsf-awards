 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large networks form an essential part of the modern global  infrastructure.  It is essential to use and manage these  networks in the most efficient way possible.  This project  focuses on two fundamental problems in network optimization:  (1) computing flows and cuts, and (2) scheduling processes on a network  of processors.  The goal is to design efficient algorithms, both  sequential and parallel, for a range of problems in these fields.  The flow and cut problems include maximum flows,  multicommodity flows and minimum cuts.  This work on basic  network algorithms has applications ranging from cutting  plane algorithms for traveling salesman problems to VLSI design  problems to sparse matrix problems.  The scheduling work  analyzes problems of scheduling processes on a network of  processors and develops algorithms that help to decide  whether jobs should be processed locally or sent over the network  to a remote processor.  By understanding the complexity of  scheduling on various parallel machines and networks of machines,  current computers can be better utilized and future computers can  be designed based on the difficulty of scheduling on that  machine.  The work will have a significant experimental  component, taking advantage of access to a DECmpp 12000 with 2K  processors.",
