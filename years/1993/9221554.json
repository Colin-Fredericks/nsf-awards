 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Lawrence Kaplan will               obtain thirty-three accelerator radiocarbon dates on early                      domesticated beans (genus Phaseolus) obtained from archaeological               sites. Although indirect dates are available (based on charcoal and             other organic materials associated with beans) very few direct                  determinations have been made and these vary significantly from the             ages suggested by the indirect dates. The result is that very                   little is known about the timing and places of origin on this major             New World domesticate. In conjunction with other chemical analyses,             this project will permit archaeologists and biologists to                       understand the process of the domestication and spread of this food             crop.                                                                                                                                                           The genus Paseolus includes five species of beans which were                    domesticated and widely used in the pre-Columbian New World.                    Together with corn and squash they formed the basis for much of the             prehistoric diet over North, Middle and South America and were                  crucial for survival because they contain essential amino acids                 which are otherwise lacking. Given the presence of wild progenitors             it is clear that domestication did take place in the New World but              beyond that archaeological understanding is limited. The problem is             of interest not only to biologists but also to archaeologists who               wish to understand how complex chiefdoms developed. Until recently              it was believed that the subsistence base necessary to support such             a form of organization required a major domesticate. However recent             work has suggested that such social complexity predates the                     domestication of corn and possibly beans as well. It seems likely               that less well known and less productive crops played an important              role. Dr. Kaplan's research will help to answer this question.                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to both biologists and anthropologists. It will                also shed light on the origins of plant domestication and the                   development of complex societies.",
