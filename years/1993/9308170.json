Five distinguished speakers           will deliver fifty-minute talks on their current research.  The program         will cover a broad range of current topics on theoretical computer              science and its applications, including biological computing,                   combinatorial analysis of algorithms, complexity theory, learning               theory, and cryptology.  This one-day event is expected to attract              approximately one hundred researchers and advanced graduate students            from the greater Baltimore-Washington D.C. area, including members of           local Universities, businesses, and government agencies.  Maryland              Theory Day, which is held in cooperation with the University of Maryland        Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, stimulates and facilitates the         advancement of computer science through promoting interaction and joint         work among local researchers.  In addition, holding this event for the          first time at UMBC will help establish UMBC's young and growing Computer        Science Department.",
