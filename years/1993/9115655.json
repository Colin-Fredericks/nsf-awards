 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this three year proposal is to construct a                     low temperature atomic force microscope (AFM) combined with                     the freeze-fracture/freeze-etch technique of structural                         biology research.  A prototype is expected to be completed                      within three years, and it will be dedicated to                                 instrumentation calibration and structural study of                             macromolecules of biological importance.  Structural                            information on functional proteins in liposome obtained by                      electron microscopy is limited to a resolution about 2-5 nm                     in conventional freeze-fracture/etch practice, due to the                       limitation by the gain size of shadowing metal particles.                       However, the newly developed AFM, which uses interacting                        force between a sharp tip at the end of a cantilever and the                    specimen surface topology, can achieve atomic resolution                        with high signal to noise ratio.  Unfortunately, the                            conventional AFM applies a much stronger probing force to                       the specimen surface than that can be withstood by a                            biological specimen at room temperature.  At low                                temperatures this become a minor problem, because a frozen                      specimen is less disturbed by the probing force.  We propose                    to build a liquid nitrogen temperature AFM system, and use                      this modified AFM for elucidation of molecular and submit                       structures of membrane associated and purified                                  macromolecules.  The system incorporates an ambient pressure                    freeze-fracture/etch apparatus working in liquid nitrogen                       and an AFM in pure nitrogen vapor, thus a freshly prepared                      specimen is immediately scanned to study its surface                            structure.  Furthermore, the system is self enclosed and                        sufficient measure has been taken to keep specimens free                        from any contamination, especially water condensation on the                    specimen .  Thus, the proposed low temperature AFM can be                       used to elucidate the molecular structures of a variety of                      functional membrane proteins and specific inhibitors, and                       will provide valuable information about their interaction,                      conformational changes, and higher order structures.",
