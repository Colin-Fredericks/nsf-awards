In addition to chemical and physical measures              of resource heterogeneity, assessments of how this resource                     variability is perceived by plants will be pursued, including: Root             and foliage characteristics that reflect local resource                         availability, acquisition of resources, competition with other                  plants and microbes for resources, and translation of resources                 gleaned from patches and pulses into fitness and seedling                       recruitment.  Plant response to incongruity of resources and factors            that might smoothe heterogeneity (mycorrhizae and water efflux from             roots) will also be investigated.  Parameters to be measured include            nutrient pools, flux rates through nitrogen pools, microbial                    biomass, soil water potential, plant nutrient acquisition,                      photosynthesis, root uptake kinetics, respiration and growth, and               biomass and seed production.  Stable isotopes will feature                      prominently in the work including new isotopic dilution procedures.             Data collected in addressing 21 hypotheses will also be applied in              a new modeling application of Ecological Field Theory and kriging               interpolation.  The study features two species each of shrubs,                  perennial grasses and exotic annual grasses.  The current conversion            of the sagebrush steppe from a perennial system to exotic annuals is            also addressed.  This research will produce findings of importance              to the general ecology and ecosystem function of arid lands as well             as to the management of grazing land resources.",
