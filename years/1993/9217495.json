 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                   in atmospheric chemistry between Thomas M. Church of the                        University of Delaware and Alain Veron of the University of                     Aix-Marseille III.  The collaboration focuses on a problem of                   common concern; that is, the delivery of atmospheric pollution                  from both North American and the European continents to the                     North Atlantic Ocean.  The investigators will study the processes               governing air-sea transfer and oceanic cycling of atmospheric                   trace elements.  Sampling will occur on two joint international                 cruises for aerosol, precipitation, fog and sea water samples.  The             samples will be then be analyzed for trace metals, stable isotopes              and radionuclides which are identifiers of continental sources and              atmospheric transports to the sea.  These atmospheric elements                  and their isotopes are useful for tracing oceanic circulation and               biogeochemical cycling.                                                                                                                                         The U.S. side will prepare and organize the ocean going                         sampling equipment. The atmospheric and oceanic samples will                    be analyzed jointly in a newly established French clean laboratory              and at existing U.S. laboratories in Delaware and California.                   The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in                 analysis of stable elements and radionuclide isotopes.  This is                 complemented by unique atmospheric trace elements developed                     by the French investigator.  The results will advance our                       knowledge of continental origins of air pollutants and their                    deposition in the North Atlantic Ocean.",
