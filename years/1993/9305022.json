 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rhizobium-legume symbiosis offers a model system for the                        examination of plant microbe interaction and plant developmental                regulation. Many bacterial polysaccharides have been shown to be                important factors in successful nodulation of the host plant,                   particularly LPS and EPS. This project is aimed at furthering an                understanding of the infection and nodulation process.  R. meliloti             Rm1021 EPS- mutants are unable to infect the normal host plant;                 however strain AK631 (EPS-) produces a non-LPS, 3-deoxy-D-manno-2-              octulosonic acid (Kdo) containing polysaccharide that appears to                substitute for the EPS in the nodulation of alfalfa. The Kdo-rich               polysaccharide is novel to rhizobia and is analogous to a class of              K-antigens from E. coli. A form of this polysaccharide  has been                found in all R. meliloti strains examined to date. Preliminary data             indicate that the lpsZ gene and the fix-23 gene region are involved             in the synthesis and modification of this polysaccharide; mutation              of these genes result in strains that  are unable to nodulate the               host plant and are defective in the production of this                          polysaccharide.  In addition, the incorporation of the lpsZ gene                into R. meliloti Rm1021 EPS- mutants results in the modification of             the Kdo polysaccharide and the restoration of the Fix+ phenotype.               The objectives of this project are: 1) the structural                           characterization of the wild type polysaccharide from R. meliloti               AK631; 2) the characterization of the polysaccharides from fix-23               and lpsZ mutants of R. meliloti AK 631; 3) the purification of                  bacterial surface components for use in biological activity                     studies; and 4) the determination of the biochemical effect of lpsZ             in Rm 1021. Biological nitrogen fixation offers a cost effective                and environmentally sound alternative to chemical fertilizer, where             applicable. This research constitutes a significant contribution to             the broad base of scientific knowledge required for advancements in             the areas of plant-microbe interaction, plant developmental                     regulation, and biological nitrogen fixation in agriculture.",
