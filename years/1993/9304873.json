 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now well established that potassic hydrothermal alteration of             igneous and sedimentary rocks is intimately associated with                     extensional tectonics and the evolution of regional groundwater                 flow systems within continental rift basins.  While the                         paleohydrology of compressional tectonic systems has received                   considerable attention in the literature in recent years, the                   hydrodynamics of extensional terrains remains poorly understood in              a quantitative sense.  Little is know, for example, about the                   effects of listric fault block motion, the relative importance of               different fluid flow inducing mechanisms, and the evolution of                  brines on basin hydrodynamics.  In this proposal a methodology is               presented for investigating crustal scale groundwater flow within               continental rift basins using mathematical modelling.  The approach             will be used to study the giant potassium anomaly within the Rio                Grande Rift system near Socorro, New mexico, a site where                       sufficient geologic and hydrologic data are available to evaluate               the utility of the analysis.  Finite element models of hydrothermal             fluid flow brine evolution, and the kinematics of normal fault                  block motion will be constructed along cross-sectional transects                through the rift.  Special emphasis will be place on assessing the              hydrologic  connection between shallow (0-5 km) and deep (5-15 km)              flow systems as well as the relative importance of compaction-,                 topography-, density-, and seismogenically-induced groundwater                  motion.  The quantitative results will be compared with observed                potassic hydrothermal alteration of igneous and sedimentary rocks               within the Rio Grande Rift system in cooperation with Dr. Charles               Chapin, Director of the New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral                  Resources, Socorro, New Mexico.",
