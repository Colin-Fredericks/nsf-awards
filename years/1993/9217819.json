 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year cooperative research project                     between Professor John Hildebrand, Scripps Institution of                       Oceanography, University of California, San Diego, and Professor                Junzo Kasahara, Earthquake Research Institute, University of                    Tokyo.  The project involves placing seismic stations in island                 sites along the Mariana, Yap and Palau Trench regions of the                    western Pacific, in coordination with a program for long-term                   instrumenting abandoned telecommunications cables in the western                Pacific with seismic and magnetic sensors.  A graduate student                  from UC San Diego will conduct research at the University of                    Tokyo as part of this project.                                                                                                                                  The oceanic deep-sea trenches of the western Pacific are the                    result of large-scale subduction of oceanic crust in this region.               Associated with subduction is the generation of high levels of                  seismicity along dipping Benioff zones on the landward side of                  the oceanic trenches.  The large magnitude earthquakes generated                at western Pacific subduction zones has been extensively studies                using the Global Seismic Network, providing a detailed mapping of               the configuration and characteristics of the seismogenic zone.                  Smaller magnitude earthquakes require regional seismic networks                 for study.  This has particularly been accomplished on the                      Japanese Islands where an exensive regional netowrk of seismic                  stations are positioned above the seismogenic zone.  Other                      subduction zone regions of the western Pacific have fewer island                sites available for placement of seismic stations, yet these                    areas are important to gain a complete picture of the seismicity                and tectonic behavior of the western Pacific.",
