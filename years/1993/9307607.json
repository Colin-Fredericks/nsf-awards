 "awd_abstract_narration": "Local patterns of community changes are often embedded within              larger regional scale processes. Interpretation of changes at the               local scale are thus a function of regional level changes. Climatic             fluctuation and land use practices                                              are two regional level processes that affect local dynamics of                  forest community structure and biodiversity. This project will use              dendro-ecological methods to reconstruct a multi-century, regional              scale forest fire and climate history of southern taiga forests on              the central Siberian Plateau. Fire scar and ring-width chronologies             will be developed from a network of sites. The reconstructed fire               and climate records will be used to assess temporal and spatial                 changes and trends in fire activity in association with centuries               long fluctuations in climate and land use practices. Parallel                   studies of paleofire and climate histories in similar forests in                the southwestern US and Sierra Nevada of California will provide                comparative data for assessing differences and similarities of                  regional scale fire climatologies of semi-arid regions in North                 America and Siberia.                                                            %%%                                                                             This long-term historical perspective will provide baseline data                for models of future changes in forest communities driven by global             change and human land-use practices. In addition, reconstruction of             fire occurrence will be useful for assessing the importance of                  conifer forests as a source of atmospheric trace gases and                      particulates. Finally, the proposed research will strengthen                    collaborative scientiific relationships between US and Russian                  scientists.",
