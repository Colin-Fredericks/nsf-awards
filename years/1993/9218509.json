 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to conduct preliminary structural analysis             on fullerenes, using a high-resolution transmission electron                    microscope (HRTEM) facility.  In essence, this Research Planning                Grant is designed to develop a collaboration between the Principal              Investigator who installed the HRTEM facility and members of                    another group at the same institute who discovered methods for bulk             production of fullerenes and the subsequent crystal growth.                     Graduate students from two groups are trained in the use of the                 HRTEM technique.  The HRTEM facility is uniquely suitable for                   structural analysis in the 10 to 100-oA range for a variety of                  structures and topographies such as higher fullerenes, tubular and              intercalated geometries, and for examination of novel compounds                 having metal atoms or ions in between carbon frame or encased                   within carbon spheres.  The results of preliminary studies will be              used to prepare a full proposal for NSF.                                                                                                                        Fullerence chemistry has created a frontier avenue for the                      synthesis and fabrication of new materials with unusual optical and             magneto-optical properties.  The characterization of fullerenes and             associated compounds is uniquely served by the use of the                       nanoanalytical TEM facility.  The training of graduate students on              this facility, and the preliminary results obtained as the                      consequence of this research planning proposal will contribute to               the better understanding of the fullerene field and to the                      development of women scientists in the frontier areas of chemistry.",
