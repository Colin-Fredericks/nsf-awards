 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students have a difficult time visualizing complex biological                   structures and understanding how the shapes of these structures                 relate to their function.  This is especially true when a                       number of structures are spatially integrated in order to                       produce a single function or complex changes in shape are                       necessary to perform a function.                                                To address this problem, three-dimensional models of biological                 structures are being animated and rendered onto video format.                   Text descriptions of the objects and events occurring within                    the animation are linked via a hypermedia system to provide                     additional information about these structures and events as                     requested by the student.  Various other forms of related                       information such as time lapse video, electron micrographs,                     serial sections etc., are also available to the student within                  the hypermedia framework.  During the grant period a three-                     dimensional model of a cell and its organelles is being                         created, and an animation of a journey around each organelle                    within the cell is being linked through a hypermedia system to                  a text description of each structure or event.  Also an                         animation depicting gametogenesis and fertilization is being                    produced and linked to text descriptions and other related                      media forms through a hypermedia system.  The animations and                    related media data bases are being used in teaching                             Introductory Biology and Developmental Biology.                                 The ability of students to conceptualize and utilize the                        information presented by the animation/hypermedia format will                   be evaluated by comparison with student progress from previous                  years.  Students will also be examined on their ability to                      visualize the spatial relationships of cellular components as                   they relate to biological events.                                               The animations will be made available to other institutions by                  distributions on CD's and made compatible with available                        hypermedia systems.  The animations will also be used as                        demonstrations in local high school and middle school science                   classes.  The teachers of these classes will evaluate the use                   of this technology to interest and stimulate students in the                    secondary education system.  It is hoped that three-dimensional                 animations will provide students with a much better view of the                 structure and dynamic nature of biology.  It is also hoped that                 the use of the additional information sources through the                       hypermedia will encourage students, of all ages, to ask                         questions and learn to investigate in a very non-threatening                    and personal environment.",
