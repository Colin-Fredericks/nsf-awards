 "awd_abstract_narration": "This modular, tenth-grade biology curriculum redefines                          biology instruction so that the teaching of biology                             encompasses new concepts and technologies, is socially                          relevant, is accessible and stimulating, and builds on the                      natural connections between biology, health-related issues                      and society.  Taken together the six modules constitute a                       complete curriculum, which is interactive, hands-on, and                        inquiry-based, in which information is integrated into a                        coherent and related set of concepts which are relevant to                      students' lives and experiences.  The modules integrate                         concepts and themes of biology in topics such as infections                     diseases, cancer, plants as food and medicine, habitat                          growth, mitochondrial Eve, and your body, yourself.  The                        biological concepts of cell and molecular biology,                              evolution, energy and metabolism, development, reproduction                     and heredity, ecology and human biology are woven into                          themes of systems and interactions, energy and matter,                          evolution and patterns of change, diversity and variation,                      and structure and function.  Each module contains a                             teacher's guide, students materials and performance                             assessment strategies and instruments, A Curriculum Planner                     provides assistance in implementing the curriculum and also                     a set of recommendations for program adopters for                               introducing and implementing the materials into the school                      system.  The materials are developed by EDC in collaboration                    with distributors, evaluators, teachers and school                              districts.",
