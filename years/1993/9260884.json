The software                   will enable students to search for evidence, sharpen their                      analytical skills, consult with national experts, and invoke                    strengths in writing and creative expression to stimulate their                 interest in science.  In particular, the software will provide                  students with a toolkit for (1) searching video recordings of                   scientific and natural phenomena for usable data, (2) extracting,               organizing, and analyzing the data, and (3) preparing written,                  audio, and video presentations on the computer.  Students will                  also be able to add their own video events for analysis and be                  able to compare their results with the comments and findings of                 scientific experts.  In the creation of the software, special                   attention will be paid to female and minority students.",
