 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high power laser and microscopic image analysis system will              be used to perform controlled experiments on multilayered ceramic               thermal barrier coatings.  These coatings are developed for high-               temperature applications such as diesel engines, jet engines and                gas turbines used in land and aerospace vehicles.  Current research             performed by subjecting coated specimens to low heat fluxes has                 resulted in identifying some of the failure modes.  It is now                   necessary to subject similar specimens, as well as specimen with                thin multi-layer coatings to large heat fluxes in order to obtain               larger temperatures and temperature gradients.  The cracking                    process occurring during the application of the high heat flux will             be quantified interactively using the microscopic image analysis                system.  The fundamental understanding that this research will                  provide will be used to develop and design multilayer coatings with             a significantly longer life under high temperature.                                  The second program is a multidisciplinary investigation to                 develop a thermally enhanced processing technique in order to                   improve the productivity and surface quality in the machining of                ceramics.  The approach is to locally heat the surface of the                   workpiece by using a high power laser beam in front of the cutting              tool edge so as to soften the material and increase the ductility.              It is anticipated that this hybrid technique can allow for                      machining of the difficult-to-cut materials.  Thereby reducing the              cost to fabricate ceramic parts and improving dimensional and                   surface quality.  The research seeks to perform experimental                    investigation by constructing a testbed, to develop models for heat             transfer and surface deformation along with crack propagation, and              to implement a control scheme based on the process models.  In-                 process sensing techniques pertinent to process control will be                 developed as well.",
