 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research represents the                        application of a new approach to a \"mature\" research area:                      vinyl polymerization.  This research will characterize the gas                  phase photopolymerization of vinyl monomers onto metallic                       substrates as a function of processing conditions.  Solvent-                    free, gas phase photopolymerization shows promise in creating                   defect-free, uniform thin films with excellent electrical and                   optical properties for commercial applications such as                          protective coatings and electrical insulators.  The issues to                   be considered in this work are how the final film quality is                    related to the interface and the polymerization mechanisms and                  kinetics, and the characterization of the gas phase reactions.                                                                                                                                                                                  This research will develop surface second harmonic generation                   to  characterize the dynamics at the metal/polymer interface.                   Surface second harmonic generation techniques are powerful                      methods for probing surfaces, and have general applicability                    in examining reaction dynamics at many surfaces and                             interfaces.                                                                                                                                                     The ultimate goal of the work is to show that second order                      nonlinear optical techniques such as surface second harmonic                    generation will be excellent methods for multi-disciplinary                     studies of many surface phenomena including reaction,                           adsorption, and adhesion.  This initial work specifically                       addresses polymerizations of well characterized vinyl monomers                  onto well characterized metallic substrates in order to                         validate the use of surface second harmonic generation as an                    analytical technique to perform real-time characterization of                   the surface dynamics.  There is a strong need to develop novel                  methods for characterizing surfaces and interfaces,                             particularly methods that are efficient, have high resolution,                  and can be used to monitor in-situ processing.",
