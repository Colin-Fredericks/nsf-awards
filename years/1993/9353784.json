The non-residential program will introduce  students to science, engineering, and  mathematics (SEM) careers, while encouraging them to  attain their academic potential through hands-on SEM activities.  Monthly spring semester  workshops, a four week summer camp component, and a follow-up fall workshop will be held  to provide participants with positive learning experiences, exposure to appropriate role models,  and activities inspiring teamwork and cooperation.    Instruction will be provided in science, math and engineering, and oral and written  communication skills, as well as field trips to the Pocono Environmental Education Center in  Dingmans Ferry, Pennsylvania, the Marine Science Consortium in sandy Hook, New Jersey, the  Franklin Institute in Philadelphia and the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City.  In addition,  students will receive academic and career counseling and will be exposed to formal and informal  interaction with female professionals, faculty and students already engaged in SEM careers.   Participants will be involved in daily structured athletic events to encourage teamwork and  cooperative efforts.  Study groups will be formed to investigate scientific, math and engineering  concepts to teach and promote cooperative learning habits.  Elementary and secondary teachers  will form teams to work with the students, under the leadership of NJIT faculty.  The partners  in this project are the Newark, Irvington, and East Orange school districts, the New Jersey  Marine Science Consortium, and the Liberty Science Center.  Additionally, all participa nts will  be provided information and applications for existing precollege enrichment programs in SEM  during summers following students' initial participation.  The activities will promote students'  skills and motivate them toward attainment of academic skills necessary for college preparatory  courses in middle and high school, thus giving them the option to continue with post-secondary  education.  ***",
