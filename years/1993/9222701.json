 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ms. Ann S. Oliver's dissertation research is a comparative field                study of behavioral endocrinology in two species of fish that are               simultaneous hermaphrodites.  Spawning behavior depends upon size               in one species, which is serially monogamous, and upon social                   status in the other species, which is permanently monogamous.                   The objective of this project is to complete hormone analysis                   necessary to test three hypotheses about the relationships                      between behaviors and the absolute levels and relative                          concentrations of circulating steroid hormones.  Comparison of                  hormonal correlates of behavior in two species will allow                       generalizations about the influence of steroid hormones on                      hermaphrodite mating behavior.  Analysis of the relationship                    among aggression, androgens, and size or social status will                     clarify the complex interaction of social and physiological                     factors regulating hermaphrodite mating systems.  Timing and                    duration of hormone surges will be compared between species to                  examine physiological influences on the daily pattern of egg                    maturation and time of spawning.  Ms. Oliver's physiological data               will provide the basis for future hormone manipulations critical                for testing theoretical concepts about the evolution and                        maintenance of hermaphroditism as a stable reproductive strategy.",
