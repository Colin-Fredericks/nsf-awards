 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increase in atmospheric pollution and a new, growing              public awareness of resulting environmental damage, there is a need             for new technology to measure the concentration of trace species in             the atmosphere.  Extractive methods, in which a sealed sample of                air is analyzed in a laboratory, are expensive and are inapplicable             to continuous, in situ monitoring of concentrations.  Science                   Research Laboratory proposes the development of an instrument                   called a Pulsed Absorption Diffractometer (PAD) to fill this need.              The basis of this instrument is the detection of a transient,                   volumetric diffraction grating that is formed after a pulsed laser              beam is absorbed by trace species present in the illuminated                    region.  The PAD will be sensitive to parts-per-trillion trace-gas              concentrations, 2-3 orders of magnitude better than instruments                 based on other approaches to monitor trace species in the field.",
