 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Undergraduates site for New Directions               in Chemical Engineering is designed for ten undergraduate students              at Purdue.  The students will receive a ten week research                       experience in three major areas of chemical engineering: 1)                     polymers and materials; 2) adsorption science and engineering; and              3) process systems engineering.  Students will be recruited from                a variety of colleges and universities - particularly from smaller              midwestern colleges that do not have major research programs and                with an emphasis on historically underrepresented groups.  Student              projects will be managed to provide a balanced experience in which              they will be exposed to and work with tools and techniques at the               forefront of modern engineering research.  The students will have               direct and frequent contact with both faculty and graduate                      students.  They will participate in weekly research seminars,                   prepare written reports describing the methodologies, results, and              conclusions of their projects, and give oral presentations of their             work in a colloquium at the end of the project.  The students'                  future progress and professional plans will be monitored and                    analyzed to suggest optimal ways to enlarge the pool of research-               oriented undergraduates for advanced studies and industrial                     research and development.",
