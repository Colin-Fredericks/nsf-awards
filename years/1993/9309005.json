 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Katharine Hunt is supported by a Career Advancement                   Award from the Special Projects Program in the Chemistry                        Division to pursue new directions of research in the theory of                  electromagnetic response and non- equilibrium thermodynamics.                   In the first area of research, Dr. Hunt will develop a new                      theory, based on nonlocal current- density susceptibilities,                    which will be used to characterize the intramolecular                           contributions to experimentally measured magnetic properties of                 molecules.  Dr. Hunt will conduct research on a novel method                    for screening nonlinear optical materials via the ordinary                      Raman effect.  Additional problems to be studied within this                    field of research include selective bond cleavage, and studies                  of van der Waals forces between macromolecular chain segments.                  In the second field of study, non-equilibrium thermodynamics,                   Dr. Hunt will conduct theoretical research in chemical wave                     front propagation in inhomogeneous systems in an effort to                      better understand the thermodynamic behavior and the                            concentration fluctuations that accompany chemical oscillations                 in continuous-flow stirred tank reactors.                                       %%%                                                                             Dr. Hunt's theoretical research impinges upon two important                     fundamental problems: 1) understanding the interactions which                   are important for explaining the response of atoms and                          molecules to electromagnetic fields; and 2) the underlying                      physics which applies to non-equilibrium chemical systems which                 exhibit nonlinear properties such as wave propagation and                       chemical oscillation.  The first area has important                             implications with regard to the design of new optical                           materials, and the second area forms a basis for the                            oscillatory behavior often exhibited in biological systems such                 as the cardiac muscle.",
