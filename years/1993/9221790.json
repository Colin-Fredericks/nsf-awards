 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growth, molting and regeneration in crustaceans is controlled by                steroid hormones (ecdysteroids) from a pair of glands (Y-organs) in             the body cavity. The Y-organs in turn are regulated by a protein                hormone (MIH) from the brain. This system is comparable to human                glands (testis, ovary, adrenal) that secrete steroid hormones                   (testosterone, estrogen, cortisone) and are controlled by protein               hormones from pituitary and brain. We have found that crustaceans,              like humans, make steroid hormones from cholesterol. Accordingly,               we use crustacean glands as a simplified model to study how                     cholesterol enters cells and is converted to hormones, and how the              process is regulated by the external proteins. We already know that             all cholesterol in crustacean blood is bound to high-density                    lipoprotein (HDL), and that there are receptors on the surface of               Y-organ that recognize and bind the HDL. Using radioactively                    labeled cholesterol and HDL, the electron microscope and the                    ultracentrifuge, we now will find how cholesterol enters the cells,             how it is processed if still bound to HDL and where in the cells                the processing takes place. Part of the study is to determine how               MIH controls cholesterol entry; e.g., does MIH change the number of             receptors for HDL? We will also attempt to work out the details of              the biosynthesis of ecdysteroids, by using the mass spectrograph to             identify the individual steps in the conversion of cholesterol to               the hormones. This project embraces the fields of neurobiology,                 endocrinology and development in addressing basic questions on                  neuroendocrine coordination of functions.",
