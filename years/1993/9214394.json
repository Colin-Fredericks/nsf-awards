 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for 50% funding of a Bruker AMX-750                         (17.63 tesla, 750 MHz) NMR spectrometer which will become                       part of a $30 million planned expansion of the Biochemistry                     Department, University of  Wisconsin-Madison.  One wing of                      the planned building expansion is designed to meet current                      and future needs of the National Magnetic Resonance Facility                    at Madison (NMRFAM).   This wing will  be contiguous with                       the current shared instrumentation facility which is used by                    researchers in the physical and biological sciences at the                      University of Wisconsin-Madison campus and visitors from                        other research institutions in the United States and several                    foreign countries.  The 750 MHz NMR spectrometer represents                     newly emerging technology.  It will incorporate a persistent                    17.63 Tesla superconducting solenoid with 5-cm room-                            temperature bore of the type developed by Bruker in 1991.                       The console and probes associated with this system will be                      representative of the state-of-the-art.  The new                                construction to house this instrument will be designed to                       handle the special siting requirements of  this system.                         Research time on the 750 MHz NMR spectrometer will be                           allocated on the basis of scientific merit to competing                         projects.  The local and national advisory committees to                        NMRFAM will oversee its use.  NMRFAM has full-time support                      staff (including four facility staff members with Ph.D.                         degrees) who will provide: user training; assistance  with                      spectral data acquisition,  processing, and analysis;                           routine maintenance; and repairs.  NMRFAM also has a proven                     track record for making new technology available to its                         users, for keeping instrumentation in top operating                             condition, for modifying or constructing special circuits                       and probes, and for creating  software tools for NMR data                       analysis.  The user base for the 750 MHz NMR spectrometer                       includes graduate students, postdoctoral research                               associates, staff scientists, principal investigators form                      40 laboratories in 15 departments on the University of                          Wisconsin-Madison Campus.  In addition, the facility is used                    by about 35 groups located off campus.  The new building                        addition will have space for visiting scientists.  The 750                      MHz spectrometer will be devoted to experiments that require                    its uniquely-high field strength:  studies of the nuclear                       Overhauser effect in larger biomolecules, studies of  the                       field dependence of chemical exchange  and relation                             phenomena, functional studies of proteins and other                             biomolecules that require exceptional resolution and/or                         sensitivity.  With the addition of  this spectrometer,                          NMRFAM will be in the unique position of offering its user                      magnetic field strengths between 9.4 and 17.63 tesla for                        studies of field -dependent phenomena.  The staff of NMRFAM                     will develop NMR experimental protocols to deal with the                        problems and opportunities that this new spectrometer will                      offer to research and training in structural and mechanistic                    biology.",
