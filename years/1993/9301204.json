 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to investigate the importance of                   environmental variables on the isotopic composition of major                    component biochemicals in phytoplankton.  Specifically, the                     objective is to better understand how nutrient and light-                       limitations affects distributions and isotopic compositions of                  individual organic compounds in photosynthetic autotrophs. The                  study will assess the affects of nutrient limitation and                        representative species of the major algal biomarkers. To accomplish             this, representative species of the major algal classes (i.e.,                  Bacillariophyceace, Prymnesiophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Dinophyceae)             will live chemostat growth chambers under a variety of conditions               and their isotopic is to determine the effect of zooplankton                    grazing on the structure and isotopic compositions of lipids and                pigments.  This will be accomplished by allowing phytoplankton                  feedstock from one chemostat growth chamber to flow under                       controlled conditions into a second chamber containing zooplankton.             Composition of algal biochemical will be compared with those of the             zooplankton to investigate microbial chain interactions.  The study             includes degradation effects on isotopic compositions of algal                  biomarkers. Since herbivory is the most important 'sink' for                    autotrophic production, knowledge of structural/isotopic                        alterations during this process is critical for interpreting the                distributions and isotopic compositions of algal degradation                    products in sinking and sedimentary organic matter.  The baseline               information provided by this research is needed to better interpret             distributions of isotopic composition of lipids and pigments in                 particulate and sedimentary organic matter.  Such information will              ultimately make it possible to determine the source organisms for               numerous biochemicals and to make significant advances in                       identifying processes driving recycling of organic carbon in the                ocean.",
