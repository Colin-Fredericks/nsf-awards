 "awd_abstract_narration": "Copper ZSM-5 is the most active catalyst known for reduction and                decomposition of nitric oxide, but has limitations that limit                   it use in practical situations.  This effort tests the theory                   that the active site consists of cuprous ions stabilized by the                 zeolite matrix.  Other oxides such as copper molybdenum oxide                   and copper zinc oxide are tested for nitric-oxide decomposition.                In addition, the role of lattice oxygen on the reduction of                     nitric oxide by hydrocarbons in an oxidizing atmosphere is                      examined.                                                                                                                                                       Abatement of nitric oxide is an urgent environmental priority.                  Catalysts for converting nitric oxide to nitrogen in an                         environmentally benign manner are of great interest for                         pollution control from motor vehicles, power plants, and other                  sources.",
