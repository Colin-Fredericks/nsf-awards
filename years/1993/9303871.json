 "awd_abstract_narration": "Markwell  9303871  Protein Phosphorylation plays a major role in eukaryotic cellular  regulation.  Much recent attention has been focused on the protein  phosphatase enzymes which reverse this covalent modification, but  there remains a paucity of information about these enzymes in  plants.  Chloroplastic thylakoid membrane protein phosphorylation  in higher plants senses environmental light conditions and  correspondingly regulates steady-state photosynthetic energy  production.  Whereas much attention has been devoted to the protein  kinases which phosphorylate thylakoid proteins, relatively little  is known about the protein phosphatase enzymes which reverse this  covalent modification.  The native phosphoprotein substrates are  membrane bound and lack of a soluble substrate for the protein  phosphatase has been the major limitation in studies of this  enzyme.  Recent work by the P.I.s has found that synthetic  substrate-analog phosphopeptides are exogenous substrates capable  of selectively assaying the thylakoid protein phosphatase.  Using  these substrates, this project will purify and characterize the  protein phosphatase activity from pea thylakoid membranes.   Characterization will include kinetic analysis of the enzyme's  substrate specificity utilizing model phosphopeptides, biochemical  analysis of structure and relationship to previously characterized  eukaryotic protein phosphatases.  These studies will provide an  understanding of the mechanisms underlying reversible chloroplastic  protein phosphorylation and the role of thylakoid protein  phosphatase in plant bioenergetics and physiology.  %%%  During a normal day, a plant is exposed to continually changing  light conditions.  In order to maintain efficient photosynthetic  energy production, plants have evolved the ability to respond to  qualitatively and quantitatively different light environments.  The  signal transduction for this compensatory mechanism involves the  phosphorylation of chloroplast proteins involved in harvesti ng  light energy.  While many studies have been conducted on the kinase  enzyme responsible for phosphorylation of the light-harvesting  pigment-protein complexes, very little is known about the protein  phosphatase enzyme which reverses the phosphorylation.  The major  goal of this project is to purify and characterize the thylakoid  protein phosphatase enzyme.  These studies will provide an  understanding of the role this enzyme plays in the ability of  plants to optimize photosynthetic energy production under the  diverse light conditions which naturally occur.  ***",
