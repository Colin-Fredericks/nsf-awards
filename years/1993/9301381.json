 "awd_abstract_narration": "The photochemistry and photophysics of inter- and intra-molecular               reactions of amines with styrenes and stilbenes will be studied in              order to determine the mechanistic details of these reactions. The              intramolecular addition reactions will also provide an attractive               synthetic route to medium-ring nitrogen-containing heterocyclic                 molecules. The structure of the products in these reactions are                 dependent upon both the structure of the reactant(s) and the method             of photochemical excitation (direct vs. electron-transfer                       sensitized irradiation). In order to understand the mechanism of                these reactions, the reactants, intermediates, and products will be             characterized by modern spectroscopic and computational methods.                The study will include a characterization of styrene                            photoisomerization processes, intermolecular styrene-amine                      exciplexes, both styrene and stilbene intramolecular exciplexes,                and electron-transfer sensitized intramolecular photoamination.                 %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Frederick D. Lewis at Northwestern                 University. Amines, which are one of the important classes of                   nitrogen-containing organic molecules, undergo diverse reactions                with compounds containing a carbon-carbon double bond by                        irradiation with ultraviolet light. This study will unravel the                 details of these reactions, where the amine is part of the molecule             which contains the carbon-carbon double bond and where the amine is             a separate molecule. In the former reaction, the potential for the              synthesis of cyclic compounds containing nitrogen will be                       evaluated. There is considerable interest in these nitrogen                     heterocycles, since they are prevalent in biological systems and in             plants.",
