 "awd_abstract_narration": "Halite-bearing evaporites occur to substantial depths in 3 arid                 closed-basins in the western U.S. and preserve a record of                      paleoclimate for more than 2 million years.  This project will                  examine the paleoclimate record in salt deposits from these basins              over the last 3 glacial-interglacial cycles (approximately 300,000              years) using existing samples and materials from 2 boreholes to be              drilled to depths of 100 m.  Emphasis will be on chemical analyses              of fluid inclusions in crystals of primary halite and other                     evaporite minerals to obtain:  activity of H2O and the major                    element chemistry (microthermometry and leachate analysis),                     hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of fluid inclusion waters              (Mass spectrometry), and atmospheric gas composition, for those                 crystals which contain trapped air (quadrupole mass spectrometry).              Fluid inclusions and supplementary data (sedimentology, mineralogy,             petrography) may potentially be used to interpret paleoclimates,                in terms of:  (1) basin aridity, (2) relative temperatures, (3)                 atmospheric chemistry, (4) lacustrine water chemistry and brine                 evolution, and (5) closed-basin depositional settings.  Local and               global influences on paleoclimate will be distinguished by                      comparing data with the record from a fourth closed-basin (Searles              Lake), Great Basin vein calcites, polar ice cores, and the marine               oxygen isotope record.  Possible local influences of hydrothermal               fluids on the hydrologic record will be examined at Bristol Dry                 Lake, where Holocene volcanic activity is well documented.  Dating              of halite will done using U-series methods and 36Cl, and will be                supplemented by tephrachronology.                                               Long term records of the hydrosphere and atmosphere are needed to               document continental paleoclimates and how such climates have been              influenced by global and local processes.  Nonmarine evaporites and             associated closed-basin sediments, because of the special climatic              and hydrologic conditions necessary for their formation, hold great             promise for understanding ancient continental climates.",
