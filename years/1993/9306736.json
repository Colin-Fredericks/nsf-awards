 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306736  Williams    Research on animal learning has generally been segregated into the study of  Pavlovian conditioning, which involves the association between stimuli and  reinforcers, and instrumental (operant) conditioning, which involves the relation  between responses and reinforcers.  Dr. Williams' recent research has  demonstrated striking parallels in how contingency effects operate for the two  types of conditioning.  He will now extend the analysis to determine in more  precise detail whether contingency effects in the two domains depend on the same  underlying  associative processes.  In particular, he asks whether standard  measures of the strength of instrumental behavior, rate of reinforcement and  choice between different response alternatives, can be explained in terms of the  concept of stimulus value as predicted by Pavlovian association theory.    This research may revolutionize the conceptual foundations of general theories of  learning.  The fundamental assumption of learning theory for most of this century  has been that \"associative strength\" is composed of individual increases and  decreases in associative value due to individual occurrences of reinforced and  nonreinforced behavior.  This assumption is challenged by recent findings showing  that the animal seems sensitive to the overall rates of reward available in the  situation independent of its own behavior.  In other words, the animal uses its  behavior to estimate these overall reward rates, rather than the reverse causal  direction of the reward producing changes in the \"strength\" of the behavior.  At  the core of this issue is the viability of associative concepts to provide a  reductionistic account of learning.  This theoretical issue has ramifications for all  of neuroscience, because recent emphases on identifying the neural mechanisms  underlying learning and cognition must be predicated on the correct view of the  learning processes in order to have any hope of success.",
