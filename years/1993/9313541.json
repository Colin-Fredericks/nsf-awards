 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313541  Daigneau  The University of Rochester will use this award from the NSF to repair the environmental   systems and renovate the interiors of constant temperature boxes located in Hutchison   Hall, their main biological research and teaching facility.  The efforts of the biology faculty   at this institution include research and teaching in modern molecular, cellular,   developmental and evolutionary biology and ecology, with particular emphasis on research   and training in modern molecular genetic techniques.  Most of the constant temperature   boxes in this facility are 20 years old and are subject to frequent mechanical failure.  Their   deteriorating interiors are poorly lit and unappealing to prospective students and faculty.    They are difficult to keep clean and free of microorganismal contamination that is   incompatible with their use for biochemical experiments, for sterile culture of bacteria,   yeast, protozoa and tissue culture.  The repair and renovations planned will result in   invaluable savings, not only in reduced energy costs and maintenance, but also in direct   costs to research and teaching programs that occur when experiments fail and must be   repeated.  This project will affect the research and teaching efforts of 19 faculty, 23   postdoctoral level researchers, 50 graduate level students and about 50 undergraduate   students while enabling the university to more fully support research involving   biotechnology.  ***",
