 "awd_abstract_narration": "Techniques using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning                     tunnelling microscopy (STM) are applied to the investigation of                 platinum and palladium model catalysts.  These methods were                     developed during the previous grant to this laboratory.  Three                  types of systems are studied:  single crystals, ultrathin films,                and microfabricated model catalysts prepared by techniques used                 in microelectronic device fabrication; the last is an attempt                   to control the particle size and morphology of a supported                      catalyst.  Catalytic activity and selectivity of these catalysts                is measured for the hydrogenation of 1,3 - butadiene.  Adsorbed                 species are studied  with infrared spectroscopy.  An attempt is                 made to describe the active sites and to correlate physical and                 chemical features with activity and selectivity.                                                                                                                This is a test of the utility of these new methods in catalyst                  characterization and design.  The methods are capable of a very                 high degree of resolution that may (or may not) be helpful in                   understanding practical systems.",
