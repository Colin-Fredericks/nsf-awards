 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in three related areas will be pursued. In the first part,             heterotriangulenes will be used as building blocks for                          nanostructures. These molecules with molecular weights of over 1000             Daltons will be investigated with regard to inclusion compound                  formation, and polarizability and electron-transfer involving the               pi-aromatic systems. In the second part, topologically                          stereoisomeric entwined networks will be synthesized, whose                     structures are based on graph theory. In the third part, the                    synthesis of bowl-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons will                  accomplished. The dynamics of the bowl-to-bowl inversion will be                studied by dynamic NMR spectroscopy. Derivatives of these compounds             will be coupled to form macrocyclophanes related to fullerene                   fragments.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of               Professor Jay S. Siegel at the University of California, San Diego.             Large molecules will be synthesized which contain internal                      cavities. Inclusion of other molecules into these cavities will be              studied as well as the intramolecular interactions which will be                detected spectroscopically. Bowl-shaped large molecules will be                 prepared and the bowl-to-bowl inversion barrier will be determined              by spectroscopic methods. These bowl-shaped molecules will also be              coupled to produce fragments related to fullerene, a recently                   discovered allotrope of carbon. Finally, molecules will be                      synthesized where chains of atoms become entwined. The particular               entwined pattern is based on graph theory, a mathematical                       discipline.",
