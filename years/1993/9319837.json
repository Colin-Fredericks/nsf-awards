The  goals of the trip are the following:  (i) to discuss mutual  exchanges of students between Purdue School of Chemical  Engineering and German Universities; and (ii) to discuss  research interactions between the universities.  The ultimate  target is to involve U.S. undergraduate students for coursework  or research, graduate students for coursework or research, and  post-doctoral students.  U.S. students are expected to benefit  from the high level of chemistry and chemical engineering  education and research in German universities and from their  strong industry-university interactions.  Moreover, students  will acquire a better international perspective and be better  prepared for tackling globalization of U.S. industry.  A  report  will be provided to NSF.  ***",
