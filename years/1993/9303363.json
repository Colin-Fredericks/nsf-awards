In particular, pseudodifferential  operators with rough symbols will be considered.  The analysis of  the operators will be carried out through the construction of  molecules whose smoothness matches that of the symbols of the  operators.  Similar decompositions for parabolic spaces will be  constructed and used to study operators whose kernels have non-  isotropic singularities.  Previous work on discrete spaces and  multiplier operators will be developed further.  Work will also  be done on boundary element methods in nonsmooth domains.  Singular integral and layer potential techniques will be  employed.  The problems to be considered include the construction  of Galerkin procedures for the traction boundary value problem  from elastostatics and for moving boundary problems in unstable  solidification.  To aid in applications of this research, efforts  will be made to confine the function spaces to those that permit  efficient numerical implementation.  For this purpose, the latest  developments on the method of layer potentials in Holder spaces  and decomposition techniques for spaces of homogeneous type will  be incorporated into the project.       The application of wavelet analysis to singular integral  operators has led to new insights into the continuity properties  of these transformations.  In addition, the very discrete nature  of the wavelet decompositions allows for unexpected accuracy in  their numerical approximation.  The second part of the research  on boundary element methods continues efforts to understand the  degree by which mathematical treatment of differential equations  may be carried out in the absence of standard smoothness  assumptions.  These assumptions often do not reflect conditions  present in problems describing phenomena taken from the physical  world.  ***",
