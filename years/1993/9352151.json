The  current x-ray diffraction equipment was purchased in 1965 and  is now obsolete. The project will upgrade this equipment and  computerize the data acquisition and analysis tasks associated  with it. This equipment will be used in a new series of \"hands-  on\" experiments in Mineralogy and Crystallography, Petrography  and Advanced Mineralogy, and Theoretical Petrology. These  experiments are designed to promote active learning and empower  the students with the knowledge and experience of using a  powerful tool that is beneficial in the study of a wide variety  of geological problems. An upgraded x-ray diffractometer will  provide important support for student research, a key component  of the geology curriculum.  ***",
