 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geochemical processes in coastal and shelf environments affect                  uranium concentrations in the ocean, and have influenced the                    uranium isotope composition of the ocean during past                            glacial/interglacial cycles.  The overall aim of this research is               to improve understanding of the cycling processes that affect the               flux of uranium from coastal margins to the open ocean.  This study             focuses specifically on the Mississippi River and the adjacent                  continental shelf to achieve the following objectives.  (1) To                  characterize the behavior of uranium during river/ocean mixing;                 and, to identify the processes that govern the estuarine behavior               of uranium.  (2) To identify the conditions and processes that                  influence the role of shelf sediments as net sources or sinks for               uranium; and, to evaluate the general role that river dominated                 shelves play in the overall ocean chemistry of uranium.                                                                                                         Water-column and Seabed samples will be collected from the                      continental shelf adjacent to the Mississippi River.  Water samples             will be partitioned into dissolved, colloidal and particulate                   fractions using filtration and ultrafiltration techniques.  Uranium             concentrations and isotope ratios will be examined in all fractions             to evaluate the fate of U during river/ocean mixing.  Interstitial              waters will be extracted from shelf cores and examined for                      diagenetic uptake or release of uranium from bottom sediments, and              mixing experiments between river water and seawater will be used to             study effects of estuarine mixing on uranium.",
