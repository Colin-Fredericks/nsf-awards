 "awd_abstract_narration": "Employers use different recruiting mechanisms that can be                       classified in two broad categories.  For some jobs, firms hire                  the first qualified person to show up once a job becomes vacant.                This generally ensures that the worker will accept the job if it                is offered.  For other jobs, employers engage in a more time                    consuming process, often accepting initial applications through                 the mail.  This means that applicants are more likely to get                    alternative offers during the period that applications are                      reviewed and may turn down a job offer.  The purpose of this                    research is to analyze the economic effects of costly employer                  search under these two institutional frameworks.  The project has               three objectives.  The first is to strengthen our theoretical                   understanding of employer search by extending existing models to                account for worker heterogeneity and dynamic considerations.  The               second is to the analyze the effects of certain labor market                    policies like minimum wage laws, the immigration of unskilled                   workers, and unemployment insurance in the context of the                       extended theoretical models.  Finally, the models are tested by                 examining their implications for job-advertising.  This research                is important because it will shed new insights into the job                     matching process.",
