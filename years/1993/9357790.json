 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photorealistic image synthesis is an important problem for  such  diverse fields as architecture, lighting and industrial design,  remote  sensing from satellites and robots, scientific  visualization, simulation  systems, and entertainment and  advertising.  It also requires enormous  computation.  Carefully  chosen approximations are therefore essential for  making the  computation efficient.  Unfortunately, few such approximations  admit good error metrics, which makes controlling image fidelity  difficult at  best.  In many applications this accuracy is vital.  This research develops a  controlled-precision rendering approach  for general systems of light transport  both to provide reliable  bounds on accuracy, and also to allow an algorithm to  concentrate  its effort where the error reduction is largest.    In addition to  photorealistic image synthesis, research begins in non-photorealistic  rendering, an area with great  commercial potential that has received relatively  little  attention to date.  Mechanisms are developed to support the  generation of effective illustrations from three-dimensional  continuous-tone  images.  Specific research goals include creating  a taxonomy of traditional  illustration techniques; developing new  modeling paradigms, imaging models, and  user-interaction methods  for specifying and computing illustrations;  establishing methods  for simplifying geometric models from models with a higher  level  of detail; and developing techniques for simulating traditional  artist  tools, such as pencil, chalk, air brush, and watercolor.",
