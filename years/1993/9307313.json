 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves three senior researchers working in                  two areas of algebraic and geometric topology:  (1) Automorphism                groups of free groups, from the viewpoint of homological algebra                and geometric group theory.  Here the investigators have recently               begun the development of a new three-dimensional model for                      automorphisms of free groups, refining the standard model, which                is essentially one-dimensional.  (2) Controlled and equivariant                 topology of manifolds and generalized manifolds, in particular,                 the study of the properties of the new class of                                 higher-dimensional generalized manifolds recently discovered by                 Bryant, Ferry, Mio, and Weinberger.                                                  Group theory, the mathematical study of symmetries, is a                   pervasive thread in almost all the hard sciences, from quantum                  physics to data encryption.  Free groups are the least                          constrained types of groups, from which all other groups are                    obtained by adding special relations.  Hence the study of the                   symmetries, or automorphisms, of free groups has a particular                   significance for group theory.  Manifolds are the global                        mathematical models of the universe we live in.  Recent                         developments in theoretical physics, such as string theory, show                that one should not confine one's attention just to three                       dimensions or even the four dimensions of space-time; more                      dimensions often provide a more accurate model, even if we cannot               see them with our eyes.",
