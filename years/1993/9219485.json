 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Carol Kramer MS Louise Senior will                   collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will study ceramic              materials excavated from the site of Tell Leilan which is located               in Northern Syria. Tell Leilan was occupied from approximately 5000             - 1750 B.C. and has been excavated by a Yale University                         archaeological team for a number of years. The importance of the                site is now clear because it documents the rise of complex state                level society. Over the course of the 3rd millenium BC Tell Leilan              was transformed from a rural town to the center of an urbanized                 state. MS. Senior wishes to learn how production of ceramics                    changed over this time period. In particular she wishes to know                 whether, in effect, mass production techniques were adapted and                 less time and care were devoted to producing individual objects. To             accomplish this she will study potsherds from a number of                       perspectives. She will reconstruct the method by which they were                made and the amount of care devoted to clay preparation. Through                neutron activation analysis it will be possible to determine where              clays were collected  and whether standardization emerged. Through              reconstruction of firing temperatures MS Senior will learn how much             fuel was expended per pot.                                                                                                                                      Anthropologists wish to understand how economic organization                    changed as complex societies emerged in regions such as the Near                East. From the study of buildings such as temple mounds and                     identification of status objects much has been learned about the                development of religious and political organization. However it is              more difficult to gain insight into changes in production and                   economic organization. Since ceramics was one of the main classes               of objects produced at Tell Leilan (and many other archaeological               sites as well) and since they preserve well in the archaeological               record they afford an excellent data base to examine such an issue.             MS Senior is not interested in ceramics per se  but rather what                 they reveal about more basic processes. Since the site covers the               change from more simple to more complex society comparison of                   earlier and later assemblages will provide insight into change over             time.                                                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of how complex societies emerged and were                     organized. It will help to develop an analytic technique which will             be useful in many archaeological situations. It will also assist in             the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
