It is a  study  of  the  various               discourses about slavery that circulated in the North during  the               period  1831-1861.  It will be carried out through work in  local               historical archives, where data will be collected on a variety of               groups  involved in the debates about slavery and  the  sorts  of               discourses  they  used.  Results will be  analyzed  in  terms  of               theories  and  debates  about the role of cultural  discourse  in               social movement mobilizations.                                                                                                                                        This research will contribute to a growing trend to utilize               systematic analysis of the impact of ideas and cultural themes on               the emergence of social movements.  It will also contribute to an               enhanced  awareness of the political dynamics in northern  states               which shaped the period leading up to the Civil War.  In addition               to  the  scientific  gains to be achieved by the  research,  this               award  will  materially  assist a  highly  promising  student  in               completing  research  for  the  Ph.D.  dissertation.    Thus   it               contributes to the future scientific manpower of the  nation  and               the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.",
