 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports collaborative research in polar                    glaciology between                                                              Roger LeB. Hooke of the University of Minnesota and Wibjorn                     Karlen of the University of Stockholm.  The investigators will                  conduct research on Storglaciaren, a small valley glacier in                    northern Sweden.  Their principal objective is to develop a global              model for predicting glacier motion from meteorological data.                   Dr. Hooke and his team, including an advanced graduate student                  and postdoctoral researcher, will spend several months in the                   field to work on three interrelated projects with their Swedish                 counterparts: (1) a water input model for the glacier, (2) studies              of the relation between glacier velocity and water pressure, and                (3) subglacier till rheology.                                                                                                                                   Dr. Hooke brings to this collaboration his extensive expertise in               glacier dynamics and hydrology.  This is complemented by Dr.                    Karlen's work on Holocene climate changes, glacial and deglacial                chronology.  Both investigators are very familiar with                          Storglaciaren, the field site in Sweden and have been collecting                data in this region for several years.  Data from Storglaciaren will            contribute to overall global studies on glaciology.  In particular,             the study on the rheology of basal till could be applied to other               glacial areas including the fast-flowing ice streams of the                     Antarctica.  These investigations will also be useful to modelers               studying climate change effects on present day ice masses.",
