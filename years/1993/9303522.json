 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303522  Valdman      This dissertation research project will contribute significantly to  scholarly knowledge in two fields in which the need for greater  documentation is well known:  the sociolinguistic study of language  death, and the documentation and analysis of Cajun French (CF).   The research will involve two techniques, participant observations  in the CF community in and around Houma, Louisiana, and the oral  administration of questionnaires and a translation task to 40  members of the community falling into four age ranges:  over 60, 40  to 59, 20 to 39, and under 20.      The question of language death in this community will be approached  in two ways.  First, the questionnaire is designed to determine the  functional domains in which CF is still used.  By administering it  to representative members of the different age groups, it will be  possible to identify changes in the functional distribution of CF.   Secondly, the participant observation and the translation task are  designed to study six specific linguistic variables as a means of  identifying intergenerational differences in language skills.  An  additional time dimension will be added to the study in that some  of the variables to be examined have been looked at in previous  studies from the same areas of francophone Louisiana.",
