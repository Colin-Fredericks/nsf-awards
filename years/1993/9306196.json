 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will involve work in five areas of statistical                 modeling:  (1) efficient bandwidth selectors for nonparametric                  estimation by local polynomial regression, (2) risk assessment by               orthogonal array sampling, (3) variance modeling for quality                    improvement and productivity in engineering, (4) robust                         regression with errors-in-variables, and (5) adaptive spline                    approximations in dynamic programming.                                               The principle investigator and his graduate students will                  investigate several applications of statistics to engineering and               environmental science.  The first application is to modeling the                relationship between two quantities, for example, percent carbon                in an alloy and hardness, when there is no known mathematical                   form for this relationship so that the mathematical form must be                derived from data analysis.  The second is the assessment of                    risks (say of cancer) from environmental policies when many of                  the relevant quantities (say the dose response between cancer and               dioxin) are known only with uncertainty.  The third is the design               of engineering experiments to learn how to reduce variation in                  manufacturing processes.  The fourth is in the area statistical                 modeling when some of the data are subject to gross measurement                 errors---the object is to identify the gross errors or at least                 to eliminate their effect upon the estimation of quantities of                  interest.  The fifth is a new computational method for finding                  the best method of controlling systems, for example, the ``best''               inventory policy for a business where demand is uncertain.  Here                the ``best'' policy properly balances the cost of excess                        inventory with the loss of sales when demand exceeds                            inventory.",
