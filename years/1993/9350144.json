 "awd_abstract_narration": "At present, the sub-millimeter band is one of the few regions of                the electromagnetic spectrum yet to be studied in detail by                     astronomy.  Recent developments in detector and telescope                       technology are now making sub-mm observations feasible.  One of the             newest instruments that is becoming available for scientific                    measurements at these wavelengths is the SMT (Sub-mm Telescope) at              the University of Arizona.  Using this new telescope, observational             studies in astrochemistry will be conducted that will focus on two              main areas of research:  1) detection of diatomic hydrides in                   interstellar gas, including AIH, CaH, Ch+, MgH+ and SiH, and 2)                 spectral line surveys of Orion and other objects in the unexplored              sub-mm windows at 600-700, 450, and 350 um.  Measurements of these              hydrides has important implications for shock chemistry, dust grain             composition and electron densities in molecular clouds.  The                    surveys should yield new unidentified lines, as well as constrain               chemical and physical parameters of the sources observed.  The                  astronomical measurements will be supported by a laboratory                     spectroscopy effort to measure rest frequencies and establish the               carriers of unidentified spectral features.                                                                                                                     Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching               a graduate and undergraduate course, conducting an                              interdepartmental seminar series, and mentoring graduate students.                                                                                              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
