 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to continue his research in various  areas of probability theory that are closely related to his  previous work.  In particular, he is planning to study certain  characterization problems in multivariate exchangeability theory,  where the representations may be expressed as sums of multiple  Wiener-Ito integrals on tensor products of suitable Hilbert  spaces.  He will further extend his earlier study of exchangeable  random sets, their Palm measures and local properties.  In both  of these general areas, there are many related problems of a more  foundational nature that will also be addressed.  The investigator will continue his research on certain basic  structural problems in probability theory.  This research will  provide the general conceptual framework and basic theory  necessary for work of other researchers in more applied fields,  such as statistics and statistical mechanics, which in turn are  useful for technology and other areas of science.",
