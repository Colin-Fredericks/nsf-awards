 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the continued maintenance, collection,                      improvement and distribution of genetic stocks of Neurospora,                   Aspergillus and to a lesser extent other filamentous fungi at the               Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) currently located at                        University of Kansas Medical Center.  The FGSC was initially                    established at Dartmouth and has been continuously supported by                 NSF.  Dr. John A. Kinsey serves as the Director of the FGSC and                 oversees the operation of the Center.                                                                                                                           The ready availability of over 7,000 reliable genetic stocks from               FGSC has markedly stimulated the use of these organisms for                     research in genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry,                          microbiology, systematics, plant pathology, and other related                   fields.  In addition to genetic stocks, the FGSC maintains and                  distributes molecular tools for fungal research such as cloned                  genes and libraries of genomic or cDNA from filamentous fungi.                  Many of the strains in the collection are also used for                         educational purposes.  As part of its service to the community,                 the FGSC prepares the Fungal Genetics Newsletter as well as a                   biannual catalog of available cultures and services.  The FGSC                  plans to expand its collection to include filamentous plant                     pathogenic fungi.  It also plans to establish an electronic                     Fungal Genetics bulletin board if there is sufficient interest in               the community.                                                                                                                                                  Further information can be obtained by contacting FGSC at 913/588-              7044 (phone) or 913/588-7295 (fax).",
