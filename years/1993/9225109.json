The conference is under the auspices of               the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology                    (FASEB).  There will be nine major sessions and poster sessions.                The topics to be included for discussion are biochemistry of                    transcription, control through different sigmas, activation and                 repression mechanisms, activator-RNA polymerase interactions, and               control by multiple protein-DNA complexes.  The purpose of the                  meeting is to bring together geneticists and biochemists to                     exchange information.  The field of transcription initiation in                 prokaryotes is progressing rapidly, providing information on                    mechanisms at the molecular level.                                              %%%                                                                             This conference deals with the means by which bacteria produce the              messenger RNA blueprint from which proteins from proteins are                   produced.  This involves where the replication machinery begins on              the gene as well the role of the cellular factors which work to                 regulate the production of the RNA blueprints.  The conference                  brings together scientists that study this area with biochemical                and genetic techniques to exchange information.  This meeting                   brings basic science and biotechnology people together.",
