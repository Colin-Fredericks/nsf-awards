 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Reed of the University of Southern California will                    conduct studies on synthetic inorganic chemistry with funding                   from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic program.                   He will investigate the coordination chemistry of weakly                        coordinating anions, such as BC11H12- and its derivatives.                      These anions should allow the preparation of highly-reactive                    cationic species, including the silicenium cation and                           transition-metal complexes of very weak donors, such as xenon                   and hydrocarbons.  He will also develop a \"magnetochemical                      series\", by investigating the nature of spin-admixed                            intermediate spin state somplexes of the type                                   Fe(III)Y(porphyrin).  A third area of investigation will be in                  fulleride chemistry, where he will examine species such as                      C60n-, C70n-, and BC59-.                                                        %%%                                                                             Research in synthetic inorganic chemistry presents many                         opportunities.  Professor Reed of USC will investigate several                  sub-areas, with a focus of large anions that have a very low                    tendency to bind to cations.  This property will allow unusual                  cations to be synthesized, cations that would normally be                       strongly bound to whatever anions were available.  Potential                    applications of such unusual cations would be in catalysis and                  the development of new reagents for synthesis of organic                        substances.  Additional studies will focus on new ways to                       describe the bonding between metal cations and other atomic                     groups.",
