 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chicago group is concerned with a broad range of                       research in gravitational physics.  Some mathematical issues                    related to the theory of relativistic dissipative fluids will                   be investigated in detail; in particular, the \"Navier-Stokes                    limit\" of dissipative fluid equations will be studied and they                  will investigate the issue of how \"close\" solutions to                          different fluid equations having the same Navier-Stokes limit                   are to each other.  The possibility of formulating a                            satisfactory and interpretable quantum gravity theory for                       homogeneous cosmologies in analogy with the theory of a                         relativistic particle will be studied, and properties of the                    Wheeler-DeWitt equation for inhomogeneous cosmological models                   will be investigated.  They will examine the issue of unitary                   equivalence of quantum field constructions associated with                      Hadamard vacuum states in globally hyperbolic spacetimes with                   a compact Cauchy surface.  Numerous additional topics in                        classical general relativity, quantum field theory in curved                    spacetime, and quantum gravity will be investigated.  The                       basic goal of all of this research is to obtain a deeper                        understanding of mathematical and physical issues in classical                  general relativity, and to make progress toward formulating a                   quantum theory of gravitation.",
