 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant will support preliminary studies in                    two areas of theoretical physics that bear on our fundamental                   understanding of nucleon and antinucleon structure and                          interactions: 1) the interpretation of antiprotonic atom                        energy level shifts and widths; and 2) the determination of                     strange quark contributions to nucleon structure.  The                          objective of the planning grant is the development of a                         competitive research proposal that will be submitted to the                     \"Research in Undergraduate Institutions\" program of the                         National Science Foundation.  The activities to be supported                    in the preparation of that proposal will include:                               participation in the \"Nuclear Physics in Atoms and Molecules\"                   program of the National Institute for Nuclear Theory;                           consultation with physicists active in both areas of research;                  study of models used for nucleon and antinucleon structure and                  interactions; the development of computer code; and                             preliminary calculations to determine the most promising                        direction for the research.  A program will be developed to                     include undergraduate students in aspects of the research that                  are accessible to them.",
