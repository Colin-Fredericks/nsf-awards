Access to phylogenetic trees, and to the data underlying those trees, is needed for a wide variety of purposes, including comparative studies of morphological and molecular evolution, biogeography, coevolution, and studies of the congruence of different sources of evidence.  Such data are also needed to monitor progress in phylogenetic research, to test new methods of taxometric analysis, and to address immediate practical problems in conservation of biodiversity.  The aim of the project is to establish a prototype database of phylogenetic studies designed to make published information readily accessible, and thereby to explore the feasibility of developing an internationally comprehensive database.  Development of a prototype will involve examination of alternative strategies for obtaining phylogenetic studies from the literature and from authors via electronic submission of data.  Consultation with colleagues will help delimit a core of essential information to be included in the prototype database, including data matrices on characters, basic information on taxa, bibliographic citations, and phylogenetic trees. %%%          Software will be developed for electronic transfer of taxonomic data sets, for data entry, for retrieval and manipulation of data sets and for importing and exporting data sets to phylogenetic and analy tical programs.  The database will be designed to allow flexibility to incorporate additional information and to export data to future implementations on other platforms or software environments.  The prototype will stimulate community discussion on the development of a comprehensive phylogenetic database for all groups of organisms.",
