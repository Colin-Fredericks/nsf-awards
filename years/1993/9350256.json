 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350256  GRAUER  This award provides support to Dr. Anne Grauer under the National  Science Foundation's Presidential Faculty Fellows (PFF) Program.  The PFF Program was established at the request of the President of  the United States to recognize and support the scholarly activities  of some of the Nation's most outstanding science and engineering  faculty members early in their careers.  Awards are intended to  allow Fellows to undertake self-designed, innovative research and  teaching projects, to establish research and teaching programs, and  to pursue other academic related activities.    This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research  interests in the patterns of health and disease in historic  populations as a means towards reconstructing the past.  In the  reconstruction of history, reliance has been placed upon  documentary sources which are often biased and frequently reflect  the lives of wealthy and well-educated adult males.  Comparably  less is known about the health, disease and lives of women,  children, and the poor.  Dr. Grauer, using paleodemographic and  paleopathological techniques, will focus her research on this  \"forgotten\" population.  Specifically, she will excavate the 19th  century Almshouse Cemetery near Milwaukee which provides a large  sample of over 1200 individuals and well preserved skeletal  remains.  The goals of the research are to reconstruct patterns of  health and disease, explore the biases of these same scientific  techniques through the analysis of the historical documentation,  and formulate hypotheses concerning human adaptation in urban  environments under extreme conditions, with particular emphasis  being placed upon adaptations made by women and children and the  poor.    This research promises to make an important contribution to our  understanding of the history of the urban poor.  Also, this five  year award will provide an opportunity for the investigator, who  is an exceptional and innovative teacher, to train undergraduate  a nd graduate students in biological anthropology.  ***",
