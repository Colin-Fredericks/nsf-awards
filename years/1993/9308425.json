 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will address the problem of automatically                    synthesizing object-oriented programs, focusing on control of the               synthesis process.  The primary objective is to reduce user                     interaction in transformation-based automated synthesis systems by              means of significant advances in control mechanisms.  Secondary                 objectives include application of synthesis to object-oriented                  program development, identification of practical specification                  languages for object-oriented synthesis systems, and techniques for             specification acquisition, software modeling, and knowledge                     representation that support software reuse and maintenance.                     Automated program synthesis is one of the central methods used in               knowledge-based software engineering to enhance the quality and                 efficiency of software development. Although many transformational              synthesis systems have been successfully designed and implemented,              automatic control of the synthesis process remains a difficult                  problem.  This research proposes a domain-specific knowledge-based              system that includes intelligent control for synthesizing object-               oriented programs.  The proposed research will develop                          transformation rules and schemas used for synthesis by implementing             as experimental system for a specific domain.  The architecture                 integrates a black-board-based control mechanism with an existing               transformational system to achieve greater efficiency in program                synthesis.  By employing a blackboard-based architecture, the                   system explicitly represents control knowledge used in guiding the              selection of transformations.//",
