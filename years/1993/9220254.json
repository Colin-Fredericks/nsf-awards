 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipoxygenases are of biological interest because the primary                    products of the reaction, fatty acid hydroperoxidase, are typically             metabolized into molecules of known or suspected regulatory                     activity which may function in the response to stress.  The goal of             the proposed research is to understand the function of lipoxygenase             in the Arabidopsis defense response to pathogenic Pseudomonads. The             proposed experiments test the working hypothesis that lipoxygenase,             rapidly induced upon attack by an avirulent pathogen, is required               for disease resistance, and functions in the synthesis of jasmonic              acid which serves to regulate the host defense response.  The                   pathogen defense response will be tested intransgenic plants which              either over-produce the lipoxygenase cDNA or in antisense plants                with reduced levels of lipoxygenase activity.  These experiments                will provide evidence that the rapid induction of lipoxygenase upon             pathogen attack is an important component of an effective host                  defense response.  The spatial patterns of lipoxygenase mRNA,                   protein accumulation and gene expression will be determined in                  response to pathogen attack by in situ hybridization,                           immunocytochemistry and analysis of lipoxygenase promoter/GUS                   fusions, respectively.  Finally, the kinetics of both lipoxygenase              induction and jasmonate production inresponse to pathogen attack                will be measured to determine the relationship of these two species             in signalling.  Completion of these experiments will lead to                    important insights into the role of lipoxygenase in pathogen                    defense.",
