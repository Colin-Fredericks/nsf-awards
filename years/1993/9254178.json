A series of laboratory                            experiences will be developed in which the students are given                   tasks requiring higher-level thinking, but are not given                        explicit directions as to how to do them. The method requires                   the students to work in small groups with a tutor. The tutors                   will be science education students taking a specially-designed                  advanced education course in which they will learn the                          scientific concepts and develop  experience with the                            inquiry/discovery method of learning.",
