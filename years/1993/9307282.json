 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two related topics will be studied: (1) Carbohydrate                            molecular recognition in lipophilic and hydrophilic solvents                    and (2) Multifunctional catalysis in phosphatediester                           hydrolysis. In the first topic, molecules will be                               investigated where two intramolecular hydrogen bonds are                        both retained and broken in complexation to a receptor with                     two hydrogen bonds. Multiple energetic analyses will be used                    to probe the strength of intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen                    bonds. Bis-boronic acid molecular hosts that are                                complementary to pyranoses will be prepared that incorporate                    a redox metal ion that will change coordination on                              complexing glucose. The difference in redox potential of the                    metal ion, with different coordination spheres, will be the                     basis of an electrochemical sensor for glucose in aqueous                       medium. In the second topic, bifunctional catalysis by two                      guanidinium groups in stabilization of the transition state                     of phosphatediester hydrolysis will be studied.                                 Trifunctional catalysis with a general base and                                 tetrafunctional catalysis with an added metal ion will be                       studied in the guanidinium system. A method for predicting                      enzyme rate enhancements based on binding constants and                         transition state analogs will be applied to the proposed                        multi-functional catalysis.                                                     %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       work of Professor Eric V. Anslyn at the University of Texas,                    Austin. Two topics will be pursed: (1) Complexation of                          carbohydrates and (2) Multifunctional catalysis of                              phosphatediesters, which are important in biological                            systems. In the first project, molecules that complex                           carbohydrates such as glucose in both water and organic                         solvents will be prepared. The structures of these complexes                    and their stabilities will be determined. A metal ion, such                     as an iron, will be incorporated into the receptor, which                       will be probed electrochemically to determine if glucose is                     complexed. This will lead to a practical application for the                    detection of glucose in aqueous solutions. In the second                        topic, a molecule will be prepared that uses two organic                        groups as catalytic centers for phosphatediester hydrolysis.                    This system will be expanded stepwise to include a basic                        functional group, and a metal ion. It is anticipated that                       this synthetic system will mimic an enzyme.",
