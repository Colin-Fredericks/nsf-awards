In the past  year several user-friendly client-server tools have been developed  for locating and retrieving information contained in platforms  reachable over the Internet.  Among them, Wide Area Information  Server (WAIS), Gopher and Archie have become very popular,  globally, and World-Wide-Web (WWW) is poised for popularity once  suitable client software is developed and distributed.  WAIS,  Archie and Gopher present overviews of where information of  interest is lilely to reside, and then they assist the user in  locating specific information objects.  WWW permits a user to  thread a path through the network by opening up network connections  to referenced information by mouse-clicking on  active  hypertext.   While focused on the particulars of WAIS evolution, MCNC will work  closely with the developers of other tools toward providing  compatibility and consistency, and, to the extent possible,  convergence of the tools. The WAIS-specific activity will provide  a central focus and forum for WAIS evolution and will minimize the  divergence of individual WAIS-based implementations.  In addition,  the CNIDR will conduct a workshop, under the auspices of the  Education and Human Resource (EHR) Applications of Advanced  Technology Program.  The purpose of the workshop will be to  evaluate the state of the art in networked information retrieval as  applied to the EHR materials development, teacher enhancement,  network testbed, and dissemination projects, and to educate and  support the NSF project investigators in the uses of networked  information retrieval tools.",
