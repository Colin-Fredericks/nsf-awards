 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boundary integral method and parallel processing techniques                     are used to simulate the motion and break-up of deformable                      particles (including drops and bubbles) encountered in a                        variety of biological and industrial situations.  Particles                     are of a newtonian fluid, and are bounded by interfaces with                    generalized mechanical properties.  Analysis is performed in                    two- and three-dimensions, for individual particles, a                          periodic lattice of particles, and a random dispersion.  The                    main objectives of the research are to delineate the                            significance of interfacial properties on the motion and                        deformation of particles, compute the magnitude of interfacial                  tensions developing during deformations, establish criteria                     for permanent deformations and break-up, and study the                          rheological properties of dilute and concentrated suspensions.                  The research is conducted through numerical computations which                  are based on asymptotic methods and advanced implementations                    of boundary integral methods.  A substantial part of the                        numerical effort is devoted towards developing efficient                        techniques of coupling the flow inside and outside a particle                   and the deformation of the interfaces.                                                                                                                          The proposed field of research is relevant to bioengineering                    and chemical manufacturing processing, as well as to high                       performance computing.//",
