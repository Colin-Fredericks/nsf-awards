 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extreme environment of Antarctica provides a unique                         opportunity to study adaptation of organisms to cold as well as                 dry conditions.  This research will focus on an Antarctic yeast                 (Leucosporidium  sp.) as a model system to study cellular                       function and regulation at the molecular level through the                      isolation of genes required for cold adaptation.  Before genes                  necessary to examine these processes will be cloned, a                          transformational system, including a mechanism for the recovery                 of isolated DNA, will be developed for Leucosporidium.                          Antibiotic resistance markers on plasmid or cosmid vectors will                 be utilized to follow the introduction of exogenous DNA into this               system and plasmid or cosmid DNA will be re-isolated from the                   transformed yeast to insure replication fidelity after                          transformation.  This project will lead to the application of the               techniques of RNA subtraction and complementation of induced                    mutations to isolate those genes which are either constitutively                regulated by life in the cold or variably regulated for                         adaptation to a changing cold environment.",
