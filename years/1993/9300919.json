 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                   Dissertation Research program.  It will support a study of the                  coping process of African-American and Asian-American parents whose             children are juvenile delinquents, employing family stress theory.              Interviews with 40 families in each ethnic group will compare                   perceptions and coping behaviors, applying a theoretical model that             considers ethnicity to shape definitions of stressful events and                the selection of strategies for dealing with them.                                                                                                                   This study will contribute to scientific understanding of                  juvenile delinquency and of socio-cultural differences between                  American ethnic groups, thus building the knowledge base for public             policy on this social problem.  In addition to the scientific gains             to be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist               a highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.                 dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific                     manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next                    generation of sociologists.",
