 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to identify and explain                             cross-language patterns in ways Native American languages                       have named new objects or concepts encountered in contact                       situations with Europeans.  This will be achieved by                            surveying words for 77 items of Occidental culture (e.g.,                       hen, horse, paper, rice, and soap) in vocabularies of 600 to                    700 American Indian languages and dialects.  Such words are                     either loanwords (e.g., from Portuguese into Brazilian                          Indian languages) or terms manufactured from native                             vocabulary (e.g., \"little maggots\" for rice in many North                       American Indian languages).  Preliminary research suggests,                     for example, that languages that are heavy adopters of                          European loans for these items have histories involving                         significant bilingualism of speakers, while languages that                      show considerable use of native terms for such items do not                     have such histories.  Another preliminary finding is that                       some items of acculturation, such as the hen, tend strongly                     to be labeled by native terms across languages, while other                     items, such as the horse, tend to be labeled by loanwords.                      This finding indicates that words for items such as horse                       may have been used in interactions with donors in the past                      to a greater extent than have words for items such as hen.                      Eludications and explanation of these and other findings                        will contribute to several areas of anthropological interest                    including sociolinguistics, ethnobiology, language                              universals, language and culture change, areal phenomena,                       and social histories of individual Native American groups.",
