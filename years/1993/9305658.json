The problems proposed are of mathematical, physical and                    biological importance.  Some of the equations in the project have               been well-known to mathematicians for years, yet new and                        challenging questions about these equations remain unanswered.                  The solutions for these problems will not only deepen our                       understanding of these concrete models, but also have impact on                 the understanding of and resolution to other related problems in                the fields of mathematics, physics and biology.",
