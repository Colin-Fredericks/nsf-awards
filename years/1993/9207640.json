 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Washington University (WWU) has established the                         Shannon Point Marine Center (SPMC) as the focal point for                       new initiatives in research and education in marine science.                    SPMC is strategically located, providing direct access to a                     wide a variety of marine and estuarine habitats, including                      extensive protected wetlands, macrophytes, estuarine                            marshes, and rocky intertidal zones.  The facilities of SPMC                    provide unique opportunties for research on local estuarine                     processes, such as productivity of  local watersheds,                           nutrient cycling and regeneration, microbial ecology, and                       benthic metabolism; on environmental impacts of petroleum                       refining; and on fish and invertebrate life histories.  This                    project will expand the opportunities for research in these                     areas by acquisition of a light microscopy system, with dark                    field, phase contrast, differential interference contrast,                      epifluorescence, and photomicrography.  This will permit the                    resolution and episluorescence technology critical to algal,                    protistan, microbial, and embryological research, and will                      expand the capabilities of our newly-acquired image analysis                    system.  The project will also provide support for a gas                        chromatography system that will permit analysis of                              hydrocarbon contamination in         sediments and tissues                      following analytical procedures specified in the Puget Sound                    Protocols.  These new facilities will be used primarily to                      support research by WWU faculty and visiting investigators                      and also will be employed in academic programs that                             incorporate research into the curriculum.                                       ** *",
