 "awd_abstract_narration": "How an ant colony responds to conflict with another one, or how                 much effort ants put into some task, often depends on the number                of ants present.  But no individual ant is capable of counting.                 Individuals must use some simple cue to assess nestmate density.                Dr. Gordon will investigate one way that individuals could                      perceive changes in numbers of nestmates:  Ants may respond to                  the interval between encounters with nestmates.  When the number                of nestmates is altered, the rate of encountering nestmates will                change.  Patrolling ants search for new food sources and respond                to disturbances. The research will involve computer analysis of                 video films of ants patrolling new areas.  Path shape and                       encounter rates will be examined when numbers of nestmates                      change, and when non-nestmates are introduced.  Patrolling                      tactics of a variety of ant species will be compared.  In many                  social organizations, encounter patterns may be a crucial link                  between individual decisions and group behavior.                                                                                                                Social insects present an intriguing opportunity to study a                     system that has many features in common with other biological                   systems, from brains to embryos.  Simple units (cells, neurons,                 individual ants) follow local rules but generate amazing global                 complexity.  Just as no cell directs differentiation in the                     embryo, and no neuron directs thinking in the brain, no insect                  directs the behavior of the rest in a social insect colony.  In                 the many fields of biology that study such systems, the same                    fundamental question must be resolved:  How do local rules                      produce global behavior?  Dr. Gordon's research is an                           investigation of how one type of rule, response to the rate of                  brief antennal contact, may operate in ant colonies.                            Understanding the details of colony organization in ant colonies                may eventually help to elucidate some general principles about                  the behavior of any system in which interactions among simple                   units create global complexity.                                                                                                                                 New computer software to be developed for analyzing the shape of                paths on curved surfaces will be useful in many areas of study                  besides behavioral biology.",
