 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arthur Camins is the Science Coordinator for New York City's                    Community School District 16.  Mr. Camins has designed a                        collaborative elementary teacher enhancement project with                       Community School Districts 18 and Brooklyn College.  These                      school districts are located in Brooklyn, and include                           Bedford-Stuyvesant and other high minority and low income                       areas.  This project would train more than half of the 1,000                    teachers in the 25 elementary schools in these districts in                     constructivist inquiry-based approaches to interdisciplinary                    science teaching.  The intent of this comprehensive                             district-wide effort is to create a \"seamless\" day in which                     science forms an integral part of instruction in all subject                    areas.  Education and science faculty from Brooklyn College                     would act as resources in the project, and staff trainers                       from Lawrence Hall of Science and other curriculum                              developers would instruct teacher trainers in several                           exemplary hands on curricula. Teachers, principals, and                         school administrators will receive hands on training.  In                       addition, exemplary teachers will receive additional                            training that will prepare them to act as mentors for                           pre-service teachers from Brooklyn College.  The project                        includes several other extensions, such as a summer science                     camp, a materials support center, and supervisory training.                                                                                                     This comprehensive approach to science instruction can have                     significant and lasting impact in the classrooms of these                       underserved school districts.  Science will become a vehicle                    for teaching reading, language arts, music, social studies,                     and all other subjects.  Math instruction will use data                         gathered by the students during their science activities,                       thereby reinforcing the relationships among subject areas.                      This integration of subject areas will be modelled through                      an internship program for teachers in training at Brooklyn                      College, making this a systemic and potentially permanent                       change in science teaching in Brooklyn.                                                                                                                         Cost sharing on this project amounts to 63% of the NSF                          contribution.",
