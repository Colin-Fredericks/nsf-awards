 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, the presence of several novel neuronal                         intermediate filament species has been documented.  Dr. Shea has                shown that the \"66kDa neuronal intermediate filament,\" also known               as alpha-internexin, is constitutively expressed by NB2a/d1 cells,              and displays a unique distribution within the neuritic base and                 axon hillock during differentiation.  Dr. Shea will modulate this               protein in cells at various stages of differentiation by two                    methods already in use for the study of axonal cytoskeletal                     dynamics:  1) inhibiting the translocation, assembly, and                       interaction of this neuronal intermediate filament species with                 other cytoskeletal components, and 2) inhibiting the synthesis of               this protein by treating cells with antisense oligonucleotides.                 Cells will be examined at hourly intervals by phase-contrast                    microscopy for alterations in neurite outgrowth, neurite                        retraction, compromise of stability, and immunocytochemistry for                intracellular localization of the 66kDa neuronal intermediate                   filament/alpha-internexin as well as other axonal cytoskeletal                  antigens.  These analyses will help determine whether or not NF-66              is required for neurite outgrowth, continued elongation, or                     stabilization.  Comparison of results obtained following                        down-regulation of the 66kDa neuronal intermediate                              filament/alpha-internexin with H-200 will provide information                   regarding the role played by this novel neuronal intermediate                   filament species in axonal outgrowth and maturation.",
