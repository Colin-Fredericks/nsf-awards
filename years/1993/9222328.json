The data                   base consists of a copy of Prof. William Shipley's slip file,                   based on a portion of J.P. Harrington's Rumsen field notes, and                 copies of microfilms of the remainder of those field notes.                                                                                                          The Principal Investigator (PI) will direct a post-doctoral                Research Associate 2 in the compilation of the dictionary. The                  Research Associate will have at her disposal a Zenith-100                       Personal Computer with a hard disk and an Epson LQ-500 Printer or               the equivalent. She will enter the Rumsen words and sentences                   onto the hard disk in the form of dictionary entries.  Principal                entries will consist of underlying stems, with derived stems as                 subentries. Example sentences will be included to illustrate the                range of meaning.  Affixes will also be included in the                         dictionary, but their full analysis will await the Rumsen                       grammar.                                                                                                                                                             The Rumsen dictionary will greatly aid the PI in her on-                   going reconstruction of Proto Costanoan (the original Costanoan                 language) and Proto Utian (the original Miwok-Costanoan                         language). The project will also provide extensive data for                     Amerindianists generally.",
