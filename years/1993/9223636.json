The Shipboard Scientific Equipment Program provides funds for ship              equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean              science research.  The Program provides support for such items as               deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and                   retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as             radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin point the               location of research sites, communication equipment including radio             transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific                data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats             for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Director, Robert A. Knox is fully qualified to direct               this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the               acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                                                                                                            This project will allow the institution to acquire and install a                traction winch for the NEW HORIZON.",
