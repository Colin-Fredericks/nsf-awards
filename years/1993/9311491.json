They will employ genetic analyses and trace ontogenies to determine the complexity of breeding options available to young individuals.  %%%  This research builds on a long-term study of the relationship between social behavior and increasing density as this population has grown since its inception 30 years ago.  A key element in this society is the role played by delayed maturation and the signaling of dominance status.  By understanding differential reproductive activity, territory inheritance and patterns of dispersal and survival, light will be shed on the \"parental facilitation\" hypotheses.  These hypotheses propose that tolerance by dominants by others might under some circumstances by favored.  Study of brown jays as a model of social birds, will provide a definitive demonstration of a major, but poorly understood, branch of vertebrate sociality.  ***    ofbejays as a model of social birds            9311491  Rabenold    The investigators will conduct a study of highly social brown jays in Costa Rica.
