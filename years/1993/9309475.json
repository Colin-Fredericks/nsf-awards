 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309475  Lam       This research will carry out queuing and delay analysis when  a number of traffic streams are multiplexed in several stages.  The  first step will be to model the output process from a single first  stage asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) multiplexer.  Various models  will be considered.  Based on these models, performance measures  will be investigated including cell loss probability, delay and  delay jitter experienced in multistage multiplexing.  The aim is to  derive algorithms and deterministic or stochastic bounds for these  performance measures.  Both exact and asymptotic methods will be  used.         The performance of  multiplexing traffic streams in several  stages will be compared to the results obtained using a single  giant (one stage) multiplexer.  This research is of considerable  importance in the formulation of requirements for Broadband  Integrated Digital Networks (BISDN) equipment since cell loss or  cell delay must be at a level acceptable from network performance  and service perspectives.",
