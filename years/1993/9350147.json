 "awd_abstract_narration": "A thorough empirical evaluation of the role that recent banking                 sector distress has played in the slowdown of the credit and money              aggregates will be undertaken.  The research involves examining                 cross-sectional data at the state and bank level, prior to, during,             and after the official quarters of the 1990 recession.                                                                                                          The results of this study will have important implications for the              role of the banking system in the economy, which in turn will have              implications for how best to regulate banks without unduly                      inhibiting them.  In addition, a better understanding of the role               that banking sector problems have played in the sluggish money                  growth will help to shed light on the appropriate role of the                   aggregates in the monetary policy process.                                                                                                                      Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching               one to two masters level classes in monetary economics,                         participating in the weekly monetary workshop, having informal                  lunch meetings with female graduate students, and conducting                    workshops for undergraduate women to encourage them to pursue                   careers in economics.                                                                                                                                           This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is valuable               investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
