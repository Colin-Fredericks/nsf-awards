 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Belarus Joint Workshop, to be held by Dr. Andy R.                     Magid of the University of Oklahoma at Norman and Dr. Vladimir                  P. Platonov of the Belarus Academy of Science, will be on                       \"Representation Varieties,\"  in particular on the Platonov                      Conjecture.  Four researchers from Belarus and four from the                    University of Oklahoma will participate in a 14 day workshop at                 the University of Oklahoma in late summer 1992 to identify joint                scientific priorities and developing concrete proposals for future              joint projects.  Representation Varieties, or Character Varieties, are          geometric objects whose points parameterize the isomorphism                     classes of complex matrix representations of a fixed size of a given            finitely generated group.  One basic question for these objects is to           determine for which groups they are all finite sets.  The Platonov              Conjecture speculates that the only linear groups for which this                happens are those of arithmetic type.  By bringing together those               researchers from Belarus (including Platonov) who have been most                deeply involved in this study, and U.S. counterparts who have been              deeply involved with related representation variety theory, the                 workshop should be able to effectively identify the most promising              directions for future joint research in the area.                                                                                                               This project in mathematics fulfills the program objective of                   advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                       talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and               competence.",
