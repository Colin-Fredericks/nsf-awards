Two complementary microscopic approaches will be pursued:  one is based on explicit descriptions of the correlation structure of the quantum system in space and spin degrees of freedom; the other focuses on the modification in intrinsic properties and interactions experienced by a particle emerged in a many-particle medium.  These powerful computational methods give access to a wide range of systems and phenomena of fundamental interest, including the superfluids and superconductors that exist at superhigh temperatures inside pulsars; the superfluid phase transition in liquid helium near sero temperature; lattice-gauge models that offer insights into the nature of the vacuum and the mechanism of quark confinement; short-distance processes in nuclei and the link between nucleonic theories and quantum chromodynamics; and the rich panorama of excited states of nuclei and strongly coupled electronic systems.  Projected research on these problems will provide theoretical support for existing or planned experimental efforts, including projects at CEBAF and observations of neutron stars by orbiting X-ray observatories.  In a novel interdisciplinary initiative, neural network computational structures will be used for phenomenological analysis of nuclei and of materials of potential technological importance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                !         !
