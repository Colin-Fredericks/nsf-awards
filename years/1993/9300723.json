This questionnaire study of 100  product development teams, uses an open systems framework to  examine the effects of organizational structure and team processes  on team effectiveness.  Hypotheses to be tested concern the  dependence of the teams on the organizations, uncertainty  characterizing work of the teams, differences between teams and  organizations with respect to institutional environments, problems  at the team-organization interface, and mechanisms that facilitate  relations between team and organization.         This study will test a number of hypotheses about teams of  workers within larger organizations, thus contributing both to  scientific knowledge in the fields of small group relations and  formal organizations and to the productivity of American industry.   In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,  this award will materially assist a highly promising student in  completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it  contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the  thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.    ***",
