 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309176  Griffioen  This research project to address the issues involved in the  design of scalable high-performance distributed file systems  based on volatile storage.  The flexibility of such system  combined with recent technology trends provides an opportunity  for exceptional performance and superior resource utilization.    The research has four components.  First, a new distributed  file system abstraction that incorporates both volatile and  stable storage into a single abstraction will be investigated.   The abstraction allows users to adjust the persistence  guarantees of a file to match the requirements of the  application, thereby optimizing performance.  Second, a novel  memory architecture called loosely-coupled memory that  provides a massive aggregate memory space for use by the  proposed file system will be introduced.  The architecture  also incorporates asymmetric compression techniques to make  effective use of memory and underutilized processing power,  and to improve file system access time.  Third, a new  abstraction and file system architecture into the BM Xinu  operating system to verify our design.  VM Xinu provides a  high-performance, low-latency communication protocol ideal for  support of a loosely-coupled memory system.  Finally, the file  system will be incorporated into the Mach operating system to  demonstrate and evaluate our ideas in the context of a large  user population.  ***",
