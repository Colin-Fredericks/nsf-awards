 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve the analysis of solitary waves, multi-  solitons, and related phenomena in the theory of nonlinear  dispersive systems without dissipation.  Several questions in the  analysis of solitary waves will be examined, including their  existence, uniqueness, and stability.  Numerical investigations  will supplement theoretical analysis.  In addition, the validity  of various approximate equations and certain rigorous properties  of nonlinear dispersive systems of partial differential or  integro-differential equations will be considered.  The tools of  nonlinear analysis will be supplemented by some numerical  simulation and the special methods of inverse scattering theory.   Solitary waves are localized, nonlinear, progressing waves that  subsist on a balance struck between nonlinear and dispersive  effects.  They arise in many physical settings.  Rigorous  analysis is often quite difficult since the problem is nonlinear  from the outset.  Nonlinear model equations have been developed  that predict the presence of solitary waves and capture their  qualitative features.  The systems to be studied arise in many  areas of nonlinear science including fluid mechanics, nonlinear  optics, solid state physics, oceanography, and meteorology.",
