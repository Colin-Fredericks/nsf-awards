 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Hungary Joint Fund research project on \"Quantitative                    Structure-Activity Relationships and Computer Simulation Studies                for the Prediction of Mutant Enzyme Spec. QSAR for Mutant                       Enzymes\" will be conducted by Dr. Gabor Naray-Szabo of Eotvos                   University in cooperation with Dr. Arieh Warshel of the University              of Southern California.  The similis simili gaudet principle,                   formulated recently after experimental work, states that similar                (ionic-ionic, polar-polar, and apolar-apolar) side-chain interactions           between a mutant enzyme and its substrate contribute more to the                transition-state stabilization than dissimilar (ionic-polar, polar-             apolar, etc.) ones.  The researchers postulate that the effect can be           related to electrostatic and hydrophobic enzyme-substrate                       complementarity.  To understand the phenomenon in detail and to                 check the general validity of the hypothesis, the researchers intend            to perform both simple empirical and sophisticated molecular                    dynamics calculations on various enzyme-substrate systems and                   analyze energy terms in order to select those which may be                      interpreted as determinant of the hydrophobic complementarity.                  The combination of the similis simili gaudet hypothesis coming                  from Hungary and the simulation methods developed and applied                   by the American side should contribute to our knowledge of                      enzyme-substrate interactions.                                                                                                                                  This research in chemistry fulfills the US-Hungary Joint Fund's                 program objective of advancing science by enabling leading experts              in the United States and Hungary to combine complementary talents               and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              competence.",
