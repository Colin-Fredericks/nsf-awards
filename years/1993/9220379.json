 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support research aimed at improving the level              of accuracy attainable in the quantitative analysis of elements via             the electron microprobe. The electron microprobe is a very widely               used instrument capable of chemically analyzing for major, minor                and trace elements in solid samples with a spatial resolution of                one micrometer on polished sample surfaces. The analytical method               for determining the concentration of elements depends on the                    generation of characteristic X-radiation from atoms near the                    surface due to collisions with a finely focused beam of electrons.              The complicated interactions of electrons and photons that                      determine the intensity of the emerging X-radiation are the key to              correcting raw intensity data into accurate quantitative analyses.              The staff of the electron microprobe laboratory in the Department               of Geological and Planetary Sciences at Caltech, under the                      direction of the Principal Investigator, have extensive experience              the electron microprobe technique and its application to the                    quantitative analysis of geological samples. This project will                  produce improvements in the procedures for quantitative analysis                that will be disseminated throughout the interested scientific                  research",
