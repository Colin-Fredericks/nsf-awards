 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351904  Merrill  \"Meteorological analysis\" is the process of estimating the four-  dimensional distribution of temperature, pressure, humidity, and  velocity in the atmosphere from irregularly spaced measurements.   Objective computer methods which produce gridded fields are  available, but educators agree that the underlying principles are  best learned by drawing \"weather maps\" of isopleths of the above  variables.  Manual methods are also used in both research and  prediction when the highest quality analyses are needed.  The  necessary visualization, reasoning, and graphical abilities are  learned in a series of two or more undergraduate courses.  There are three main drawbacks to manual analyses: 1) teaching and  applying it is very time consuming, 2) quantitative physical  constraints (such as balance between the pressure force and the  wind) are difficult to incorporate, and 3) the resulting analyses  (maps) are not readily usable for subsequent calculations of  physical processes, which typically require values on a grid for  finite differences.  We are developing a Computer-Aided Meteorological Analysis (CAMA)  laboratory which will overcome these limitations while retaining  the advantages of manual analysis.  Analysis students are able to  draw isopleths on a pen tablet attached to the CAMA workstation and  have them immediately recast as a gridded field. The workstations  provide immediate feedback about the accuracy and consistency of  their work, allowing the instructor to spend more time on  interpretation and less on mechanics.  CAMA also links the existing  analysis curriculum directly with theoretical meteorology by  allowing students to diagnose dynamic processes directly from their  analyses.  CAMA also is finding immediate applications in research  and eventually in weather forecasting as well, and has wider  application wherever analyses of state variables of fluids must be  made.",
