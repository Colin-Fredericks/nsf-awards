The exhibit kiosks with related career graphics                       surrounds, incorporate multimedia platforms, using MacIntosh                    authoring software to dreate information landscapes' computer                   motion programs like Quicktime, and Cd-1 or DVI videodisc                       technology.  Yound museum visitors (teens and Preteens) will be                 invited to enter into an exciting interactive exploration of thirty             self-narrated video profiles of people in science and engineering,              try our  animated/reality video simulations of a work experience in             these fields, and obtain additional information from a database of              over 200 more science and math-based professions.  The videodisc                profiles, database, and a personal interests component will also be             developed in alternative media formats (video, audio, print,                    computer disc) for broad distribution to community and youth                    education networks, schools, and libraries.                                                                                                                          Specific emphasis in this project is being placed on reaching              and attracting female, minority, and disabled youths.",
