When a neuronal circuit is activated by certain patterns of activity, there is a change in the strength of the connections between nerve cells in that circuit. The most typical change is that it subsequently requires less input to activate the circuit. This is called long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is especially prominent in brain regions that are important for learning and memory and is, therefore, believed to be involved in the mechanism for information storage in the nervous system. Because the changes induced during LTP endure for weeks or more, it has been proposed that this change results from the growth of new connections between neurons. This project will test this hypothesis directly. Quantitative electron microscopy will be used to determine if the induction of LTP leads to the formation of new connections between neurons. The results of this project will potentially offer new insights into the mechanisms of learning and memory.  ***      connected with one-another forming many complex circuits.
