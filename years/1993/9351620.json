In the case of supported materials, syntheses would be  carried out on or catalyzed by material adsorbed or bound ionically  or covalently to various supports. The supports would be similar to  silica-based or styrene-divinylbenzene HPLC bonded phases, and be  used in set-ups commonly referred to as solid phase extraction  (SPE) devices. There is a wide variety of these materials  commercially available at this time. Equivalent materials can be  prepared by the user if desired at a considerable cost saving.  A  second group of experiments would be designed as catalytic vapor  phase reactions that could be carried out in a modified injection  port of a gas chromatograph. An alternative set-up would involve a  small reactor column placed either in the column oven of the G.C.  or in an auxiliary oven and used in conjunction with multiport  valves. The gas chromatograph would then be used to analyze, and  possibly isolate, the reaction products. Experiments would  emphasize principles rather than product isolation and  characterization.",
