 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                   Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of the effect of                  corporate mergers on social solidarity among the employees of two               Silicon Valley organizations.  The investigators will collect both              qualitative and quantitative data through interviews and other                  means to develop and test a model of solidarity that integrates                 organizational structure and performance with members' role                     sufficiency, sense of belonging, affect, and attachment.                                                                                                             The research will develop a multi-dimensional understanding of             worker commitment and organizational effectiveness, during times                when a small industrial organization is taken over by a larger one,             thus contributing both to social psychology and to the sociology of             organizations.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved              by the research, this award will materially assist a highly                     promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.                          dissertation.  Thus it contributes to future scientific manpower                and the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.",
