Inaccessible to direct observation below a few  kilometers (the limit of drilling and exposure by erosion) the    Earth's crust, mantle, and core are primarily studied through their  interaction with seismic waves. Recent developments in seismic    sensor design, digital data acquisition, transmission, and storage  techniques make possible dramatic improvements in the resolving   power of seismic imaging methods.           The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology, or the  IRIS Consortium, is composed of 85 U.S. universities with research  and teaching programs in seismology. It serves as a national   facility for the development, deployment, and support of modern   digital seismic instrumentation, and its mission is organized into  three major program elements: (1) The Global Seismographic Network  (GSN) program provides the U.S. contribution to an international  network of 128 permanent, standardized, very-broad-band (VBB), wide  dynamic range digital seismic stations at a spacing of   approximately 2000 km around the globe. (2) The Program for Array   Seismic Studies of the Continental Lithosphere (PASSCAL) aims to  establish a U.S. national resource of 600 portable seismometer   systems available for field deployment in specific regional seismic  imaging experiments and for rapid response to earthquake studies.  (3) The IRIS Data Management System (DMS) aims to provide the  national and international seismic research community with timely  access to data from the GSN and PASSCAL programs. It archives and  distributes the data from these programs and facilitates the  standardization and exchange of data.          The IRIS Consortium so far has accomplished the following   speci fic tasks: (1) It developed the IRIS-1 and IRIS-2 lines of   standardized permanent station instrumentation employing VBB sensor  technology for the GSN. Two IRIS operations and maintenance   facilities for the GSN were installed at the U.S. Geological   Survey's Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory and at the University  of California, San Diego. Currently, 48 GSN VBB stations have been  installed world- wide and are returning data. (2) The PASSCAL   program has developed two instrument centers to store, repair, and  deploy its standardized portable seismographic instrument packages.  The PASSCAL instrument pool now has an inventory of over 200 units  housed at PASSCAL instrument centers located at Lamont-Doherty  Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York and at Stanford  University, California. PASSCAL instruments have been used in a  large number of planned field experiments, and were also rapidly  deployed for aftershock studies of the Armenia (1987), Loma Prieta  (1989), and Landers/Big Bear (1992) major earthquakes. (3) The DMS  has established GSN data collection nodes at the Albuquerque  Seismological Laboratory and at the University   of California, San Diego. An IRIS central data archive and   distribution center is now installed in Seattle, Washington,   operated by the University of Washington. Through Internet, U.S.  users (and European users via the ORFEUS data center in the   Netherlands) have access to the continuous data streams from most  of the existing GSN stations, to major-event waveform data in   near-real time, and to special datasets from important earthquakes,  as well as from PASSCAL field experiments.         This award provides FY-1993 funding for the participation of  the U.S. Geological Survey's Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory  in establishing the IRIS Global Seismographic Network and for   related data management activities.    ***",
