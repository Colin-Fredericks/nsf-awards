 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in the area of vortices in                    algebraic and symplectic geometry.  It is based on earlier work                 by the investigator on vortices and stable holomorphic pairs.                   Vortices are minima of Yang-Mills-Higgs energy, and holomorphic                 pairs are holomorphic vector bundles with prescribed holomorphic                sections.  This research concerns new directions in the study of                vortices and stable pairs and involves a generalization of the                  notion of a pair to that of a triple consisting of two                          holomorphic bundles together with a holomorphic bundle                          homomorphism.  This will address the way in which objects can be                obtained by a dimensional reduction of an equivariant stable                    bundle on the Cartesian product of the Riemann surface with the                 projective line.                                                                     This award is in the general area of geometry and, in                      particular, in algebraic and symplectic geometry.  This research                will aid in our understanding of 4-dimensional manifolds and are                central to the current research in 'gauge theory'.  In lay terms,               a 'manifold' plays the role of a surface.",
