 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research planning grant for women.  Follicles in the                  ovary undergo a continuous process of growth and regression; only               a small minority actually proceed to ovulation.  Substantial                    evidence suggests that atresia occurs by the process of apoptosis,              or programmed cell death.  However, the genes controlling apoptosis             are not known.  The operating hypothesis of this research is that               ovarian follicular apoptosis occurs in response to definable                    signals: either lack of a survival factor or induction by a                     cytotoxic stimulus.  Genes coding for two proteins, the fas antigen             and BCL-2, have been demonstrated to be intimately involved in                  apoptosis in other systems, inducing and suppressing the process,               respectively.  Limited data available indicate that the fas antigen             is expressed in the mouse ovary and bcl-2 is expressed in the                   chicken ovary.  The proposed preliminary research will examine the              role of these genes in ovarian follicular apoptosis by studying                 their expression in vivo in healthy and atretic follicles of rats.              Subsequent research will examine the regulation of expression of                the fas antigen and bcl-2 in rat follicular cells in vitro by                   various mediators of follicular development.  Finally, a potential              cause and effect relationship between fallicular atresia and                    expression of these genes will be examined by inhibiting the                    activity or expression of the gene products using antibodies and                antisense oligonucleotides to mRNA.                                                                                                                             Mammalian females are born with a full complement of germ cells,                the oocytes, present in the ovary.  Oocytes become surrounded by a              structure called the follicle which is comprised of granulosa and               theca cells.  Throughout life ovarian follicles are stimulated to               develop, a process involving growth and differentiation of all cell             types within the follicle.  Only a few of the follicles that enter              the growing pool actually progress to ovulation.  The vast majority             begin to degenerate, or undergo atresia at different points in the              developmental process.  Recent evidence indicates that ovarian                  follicular atresia occurs by programmed cell death, an active                   process whereby a cell mediates its own death by following a                    genetically determined developmental program.  Factors regulating               cell death in the ovary have not been identified.  This propossal               will test whether genes encoding two proteins, the fas antigen and              BCL-2, which are involved in inducing and suppressing programmed                cell death in other systems (the immune system, nervous system and              in various tumor cells) also regulate cell death in the ovary.  An              understanding of follicular degeneration is essential to allow                  development of improved methods of fertility control, treatment of              infertility and enhancement of fertility.  There is intense                     interest in programmed cell death because of its involvement in a               wide variety of normal developmental processes as well as its                   relevance to the development of cancers.  The ovary provides an                 excellent model for the study of programmed cell death.",
