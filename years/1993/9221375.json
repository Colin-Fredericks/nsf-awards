Histories of individual forest stands, recorded in the sediment,                                                                                                will identify successional communities in the fire-dominated                    forest ecosystem before hemlock invasion 3000 years ago, making                 it possible to see whether disturbances made some areas                         particularly invasible, thus influencing hemlock entry and the                  locations of hemlock patches that have occupied those sites ever                                                                                                since.  By dating hemlock arrival at a series of sites in extreme                                                                                               environments, near bogs or lakes or on coarse soils, we will test                                                                                               the alternative hypothesis that differences in the physical                     environment were responsible for the locations of hemlock                       patches.  Fine-scale analyses of sediment and time-series                       analyses of the resulting data will explore changes in                          successional pathways as the disturbance regime changed from fire                                                                                               to wind 3000 years ago.  Modeling will be used to investigate the                                                                                               dynamic changes that have occurred in the positions of boundaries                                                                                               between stands in the forest mosaic.  The results will be useful                                                                                                for demonstrating the response of forest communities to climate,                                                                                                including changes in disturbance regimes which may accompany                    Global Warming.  Understanding the origin of the mosaic pattern                 of forest communities on the landscape may help forest mangers to                                                                                               preserve this aspect of the biodiversity of old-growth forest                   stands.",
