 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives are to understand the allosteric control of                          gluconeogenesis by the enzyme, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, in                  molecular detail.  Specific aims include: (1) development of a                  system for the expression of recombinant pig kidney fructose-1,6-               bisphosphatase at high levels without contamination from the                    fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase of the host system, (2) cloning and                 overexpression of the E. coli fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase for                   comparison studies with the pig kidney enzyme, (3) use of the                   crystal structures of pig kidney fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase in the             T and R states, and functional studies employing single site                    mutants of the E. coli and pig kidney enzymes to begin to determine             the molecular basis of the switch between the allosteric states,                and (4) determination of how the regulatory effector AMP alters the             activity of the enzyme.                                                         %%%                                                                             The degradation and biosynthesis of glucose are perhaps the most                important of all metabolic pathways because glucose is the primary              energy source for the brain.  Given that the body does not store                more than a one day supply of glucose, survival depends upon the                ability to synthesize glucose via gluconeogenesis, after the stored             supply of glucose is depleted.  These studies will be aimed at                  understanding the function of the enzyme fructose-1,6-                          bisphosphatase, an enzyme that exerts metabolic control over                    gluconeogenesis.  The enzyme's structure will be selectively                    modified via site directed mutagenesis and biophysical techniques               will be utilized to characterize the resulting changes in                       structure.  These structure changes will then be correlated with                alterations in biological function.  In this way specific aspects               of the structure of the enzyme will be correlated with particular               functions.",
