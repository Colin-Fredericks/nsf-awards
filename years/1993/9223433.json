 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wayne L. Gladfelter of the Chemistry Department, University                 of Minnesota, will investigate the mechanisms of                                metal-catalyzed carbonylations of organic compounds.  Support                   for this Environmentally Benign Chemical Synthesis and                          Processing project will be provided by the Inorganic,                           Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program.  Gladfelter                 will collaborate with Dr. John Grate of Catalytica.  In situ IR                 and NMR methods will be used to monitor carbonylation reactions                 of nitroaromatics to form isocyanates.  The catalyst precursors                 will be Ru3(CO)12 and various ruthenium carbonyls having                        phosphine and phosphite ligands.  The pertinence of the work to                 Environmentally Benign Synthesis is that the reactions afford a                 method to bypass the use of phosgene (a hazardous intermediate)                 in the synthesis of isocyanates.  Additional studies will focus                 on the use of these and related catalysts in asymmetric                         synthesis and hydrogenation of polar compounds.                                 %%%                                                                             Polyurethanes are produced in great quantity in the chemical                    industry, especially in the production of insulation.  The                      present route to polyurethanes entails the conversion of                        nitroaromatic to isocyanate compounds with a highly toxic                       species, phosgene, being used in great amounts during this                      conversion.  A new catalytic method that bypasses the use of                    phosgene is to be studied.  At present the method shows great                   promise, but much needs to be learned about how it functions.                   Catalytica is a California-based company that creates and                       commercializes economic and environmentally advantageous                        catalytic technologies for the petroleum refining, energy, and                  chemical industries.",
