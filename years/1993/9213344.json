 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the millennia all the major food plants of the world have             come almost exclusively from traditional cultures.  In addition,                the majority of medicines came from the experiences of our                      ancestors, and even today, components for 25% of the prescription               drugs in the U.S. are plant derived.  Thus, it is critical to study             the plants utilized by less known indigenous groups before                      acculturation leads to the loss of the centuries of accumulated                 experience and experimentation.  Such ethnobotanical studies are                invaluable as well to the native groups studied because most have               nor poor written records, and once western customs, foods, and                  medicines are adopted, traditional practices are rapidly lost.  The             indigenous groups of eastern Nicaragua, the Miskitu, Sumu, and                  Rama, have long been protected from western incursion by lack of                access.  Recently, however, new logging roads have been built into              this area.  Thus, it is imperative for both humankind in general,               and for these groups in particular, that studies of medicinal and               food plants be initiated immediately.  One shaman in the region,                for instance, claims cures using native plants for 139 poisonous                snake bites.  This study will focus on the practices and plants                 used by the shamans, and those more likely to follow traditional                practices, i.e., older persons and those in the most remote                     regions.",
