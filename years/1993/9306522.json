 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of species, and to what degree closely related                  species are demarcated by barriers to genetics exchange, are                    perhaps less clear for bacteria than for any other major group of               organisms.  Studies of genetic exchange between the closely related             soil bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis are                  being conducted by Dr. Kathleen Duncan in order to test hypotheses              about possible mechanisms opposing free gene exchange among                     bacteria.  Knowledge of mechanisms operating in nature that might               prevent the free interchange of genes among soil bacteria would                 greatly aid in making decisions about the release of genetically                engineered microorganisms.  Investigations will focus on:  (1)                  spontaneous, natural exchange between spores germinated in                      sterilized soil; (2) protoplast fusion; and (3) transformation of               competent B. subtilis with purified DNA.  The hybrids produced will             be analyzed to determine the extent of DNA transfer using methods               of sequencing, restriction-enzyme digests, allozyme                             electrophoresis, and growth tests on selective media to identify                the origin of specific genes.  The fitness of hybrid strains will               be evaluated during growth in soil in order to estimate the                     likelihood of success in nature.                                                %%%                                                                                  New methods in molecular genetics make possible the monitoring             of gene exchange among soil bacteria, a phenomenon critical to                  concerns about genetically engineered organisms.  Dr. Kathleen                  Duncan employs sophisticated DNA analyses to evaluate the extent                and fate of gene transfer among Bacillus soil bacteria, including               the role of hybrid strains carrying blocks of DNA from closely                  related species.",
