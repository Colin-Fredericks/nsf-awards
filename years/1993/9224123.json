 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued funding is being provided to partially support specific               activities of the International Association of the Physical                     Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO) Secretariat.  IAPSO is one of seven               Associations of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics               (IUGG) which in turn is constituted within the International                    Commission of Scientific Unions (ICSU).  The United States is a                 Member of these Unions and the NSF is a Representative agency.                                                                                                  The Office of the Secretary General performs the day-to-day                     functions of IAPSO, involving communications within and external to             IAPSO, the execution of policies and directives, and it has fiscal              responsibilities for the Association's operation.  Much of the                  Secretariat's work involves preparation for, conduct of, and                    reporting on assemblies, meetings, symposia, and workshops.                                                                                                     Since its founding in 1919, the primary goal of IAPSO has been to               \"...promote the study of scientific problems relating to the oceans             and the interactions taking place at the sea floor, coastal, and                atmospheric boundaries insofar as such research is conducted by the             use of mathematics, physics, and chemistry.\"    IAPSO activities                are scientifically relevant and seek to encourage participation of              young scientists and scientists from developing countries by                    providing opportunities to develop working relationships with                   established U.S. oceanographers.  Partial support is also being                 provided by Office of Naval Research and NOAA.",
