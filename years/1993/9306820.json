 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have discovered a novel delta-12 desaturase and have begun the               biochemical characterization of this enzyme that places the second              double bond in the essential fatty acid linoleic acid.  Vertebrates             require the 18:2(n-6) acid in their diet, where it becomes a                    structural component of membranes and is a precursor for                        eicosanoids.  Until recently, all animals, including insects, were              considered unable to synthesize linoleic acid.  Only plants,                    protozoa and some fungi readily synthesize the fatty acid.  Studies             in our laboratory demonstrated, however, that a number of insect                species do possess a delta-12 desaturase and are able to produce                linoleic acid.  The discovery of the desaturase in insects presents             an opportunity to examine the evolution of a key enzyme in the                  lipid biosynthetic pathway.  One of the long term goals of our                  research is to examine the delta-12 desaturase in different                     species, and to determine if the process of delta-12 desaturation               is a primitive metabolic activity, subsequently lost by most                    animals, or whether possession of this enzyme reflects an example               of convergent evolution.  A second goal is to examine the                       regulation of desaturase expression at the transcriptional and                  translational level.  Studies are described in the present proposal             to clone the enzyme from two representative insect species.  Once               the gene coding for the enzyme in insects is isolated, future                   experiments designed to answer fundamental questions about the                  evolution and regulation of this key enzyme can begin.                          %%%                                                                             Linoleic acid is a type of lipid, or fat, that is required in the               walls of animal cells.  The lipid molecule is also required in                  animals for the synthesis of eicosanoids, which operate in                      intracellular communication.  Originally it was believed that                   linoleic acid was only synthesized by plants, protozoa and certain              fungi, and that animals had to ingest the lipid molecule in their               diet.  However, a key enzyme in the synthesis of linoleic acid, the             delta-12 desaturase, was recently found by this laboratory in                   insects.  This discovery provides an opportunity to learn more                  about the evolutionary history of the linoleic acid synthetic                   pathway.  Could it be an ancient pathway lost during the evolution              of the animal cell, or is it a property that has been acquired more             recently by the insects.  Experiments will be undertaken, first to              clone and sequence the insect delta-12 desaturase gene(s), and then             to study the synthetic regulation of the protein.",
