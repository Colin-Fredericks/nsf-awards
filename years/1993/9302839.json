The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Adam Simon                                   to work with Dr. David Bensimon at Ecole                                        Normale Superieure, CNRS in Paris, France.                                                                                                                      Their proposed research program concerns the                                    physics of DNA and proteins.  It consists of                                    two general parts.  The first one is a plan to                                  accurately characterize the physical properties                                 of DNA, including the elasticity and torsional                                  strength using laser tweezer based experiments,                                 and to study the physics and dynamics of DNA                                    replication and polymerization, including the                                   activity of the associated motor proteins                                       involved.  For the second part, they intend to                                  make precise picoNewton force measurements of                                   motor protein pairs, like actin-myosin, using                                   an enhanced magnetic feedback non-contact tip                                   on an Atomic Force Microscope.  Precise                                         interaction force measurements can be made by                                   coating the tip, for example, with a low                                        density of myosin molecules and measuring the                                   interaction force with an actin filament.  They                                 expect to reveal details of the single molecule                                 interaction, allowing understanding of the                                      elementary force generator.                                                                                                                                     The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel, a stipend for                                       twelve months and a small travel allowance for                                  in-country travel.",
