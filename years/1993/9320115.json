 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320115  Fraser   Tourism in Antarctica has been showing a steady increase since the  late 1960's. Despite rising concern that human activity may  negatively impact wildlife populations, studies designed to address  this issue have been lacking. The purpose of this Small Grant for  Exploratory Research is to examine the feasibility of coupling  research on the effects of tourism on Adelie Penguin populations on  Torgersen island, Antarctic Peninsula, with two long-term  ecosystem-oriented programs already in existence in the area. The  rationale for this approach is based on the premise that  understanding and defining the natural variability inherent in the  ecosystem is a necessary prerequisite for identifying and  interpreting the effects of human activity. By employing identical  technologies and methodologies, this study seeks to develop  identical, coincident databases at sites visited by tourists to  compare with databases developed as part of the two ecosystem  studies at sites not visited by tourists. The latter will thus  provide the background ecosystem data needed to discern and  interpret the former. This arrangement, if successful, is likely to  establish the proposed research as one of the key studies  addressing human impacts in Antarctica, and serve as a model for  future research of a similar nature. The award will help fulfill  the National Science Foundation's responsibility and obligations  for environmental protection under the Antarctic Conservation Act  of 1978.  ***",
