 "awd_abstract_narration": "Air-sea interaction studies require surface fluxes of momentum,                 heat and moisture.  This research will determine these fluxes by                using a sophisticated physical initialization procedure that                    invokes detailed \"observed\" rain which is based on a mix of SSMI                (Special Sensor Microwave Instruments), OLR (Outgoing Longwave                  Radiation), and rain-gauge data sets.  The powerful rainfall                    algorithm calibrates the rain rates for ground truth as the daily               fields are produced.  The fluxes, in turn, are obtained by using a              series of reverse physical parameterization algorithms within the               initialization of a high resolution numerical prediction model.                 This physical initialization technique is one of the most powerful              and consistent procedures for determining surface fluxes.  Fluxes               for the western Pacific warm pool region will be determined for a               five year period starting in January 1987.  In addition, this                   research will include a detailed comparison and critical evaluation             of the following fluxes obtained during the TOGA COARE observation              program:                                                                                                                                                        a)   Bulk aerodynamic fluxes,                                                                                                                                   b)   Fluxes based on surface similarity theory and corrected as                      needed for low/high wind speeds and the free convection limit,                                                                                             c)   Fluxes based on the physical initialization technique                           discussed above,                                                                                                                                           d)   Fluxes based on the NMC (National Meteorological Center)                        operation forecast model,                                                                                                                                  e)   Fluxes based on the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-range                     Weather Forecasting) operational forecast model.
