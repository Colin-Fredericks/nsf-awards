 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose the development of a new approach for teaching                       introduction to computing courses, tailored to the needs of                     students in different curricula.  This approach is based on the                 following precepts:                                                                                                                                             1.  There is a strong need for students in all curricula to                     understand the concepts of programming a computer, particularly in              the sciences and engineering fields.                                                                                                                            2.  It may no longer be necessary for students in many majors to                know how to write programs in traditional block-structured                      languages (such as Pascal).                                                                                                                                     3.  There is a wealth of software in wide use today which allows                the user to write programs in specialized built-in macro languages.                                                                                             4.  Teaching programming concepts through the use of powerful,                  user-friendly software with programmable features allows the user               to write programs immediately which produce nontrivial results.                 This provides stronger motivation to learn programming than                     traditional approaches.                                                         Moreover, the essential concepts of computer programming, (such as              variable, branching, iteration, etc.) can be readily illustrated                and implemented using the sophisticated features of a variety of                commonly available software packages, such as word processors,                  spreadsheets, and databases.  The main intention of our approach is             to teach programming concepts and techniques, not simply how to use             software.  Students will be exposed to the kinds of functionality               common to all languages, thus facilitating the learning of a                    general purpose language or new, innovative software they will need             for pursuing both their education and their careers in science,                 engineering, or teaching.                                                                                                                                       This project will focus on two courses, a general introduction to               scientific and statistical programming for science majors and an                introductory programming course for computer science majors.  It                will focus on developing a set of modules to illustrate the                     programming concepts exhibited by various pieces of software in the             Drexel \"bundle\" which each freshman obtains. In addition to the                 modules, examples and exercises will be created in the two subject              matter areas.",
