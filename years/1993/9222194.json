 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why are events with emotional significance remembered with                      particular intensity?  Current evidence suggests that the autonomic             activity that accompanies emotional experiences in a way that                   facilitates later recall.  A popular paradigm for investigating                 this phenomenon is the conditioned heart rate deceleration that                 occurs to a stimulus that has become frightening because of                     previous association with pain or suffering.  With this NSF award,              Dr. McCabe will investigate the changes that occur in neuronal                  firing as stimuli change meaning from neutral to frightening and                then as they lose their significance through desensitization.  He               will use sophisticated neurophysiological techniques to record from             single neurons in two brain areas simultaneously.  The information              he gains from studying changes in the firing patterns in these two              areas will identify the steps involved in the neuronal coding of                emotional meaning.  This kind of information is crucial for the                 development of therapies designed to reverse the effects of early               emotional trauma and also to control the abnormal autonomic                     reactivity that occurs in many cardiovascular diseases.  It will                also prove important for the design of neural nets for information              processing, storage and retrieval.***//",
