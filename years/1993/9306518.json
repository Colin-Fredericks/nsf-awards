 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306518  Petrino  This research planning grant for women examines the periodic  release of 17B-estradiol throughout the reproductive cycle of  teleosts.  It is crucial for oocyte growth (vitellogenesis) and  appears to have a programming role in the regulation of spawning  patterns.  Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the  regulation of its periodic synthesis.  The hormonal and molecular  mechanisms of induction, maintenance or regulation of enzyme  activity in the steroidogenic pathway during the cyclic spawning  activity and follicle development in teleosts are not at all  defined.  This project focuses on ovarian aromatase, the enzyme  required for the conversion of testosterone to estradiol that is  located in the follicular (granolosa) cells surrounding the oocyte.   The specific aims of this preliminary study are: 1) to construct a  cDNA library, respresentative of ovarian mRNA from the cyclic  spawner teleost Fundulus heteroclitus, and 2) to clone and sequence  the cDNA for aromatase using specific probes.  Segmants of the  sequenced enzyme can then be used in future studies for generating  radioactive probes necesaries to detect the levels of aromatase  mRNA under gonadotropic stimulation and follicle development.    Isolating F. heteroclitus aromatase cDNA will allow comparison  amoung teleosts species that show a very differant pattern in  spawning behavior, and thus it will contribute to a better  understanding of the regulatory control mechanisms operating during  cyclic reproduction in teleosts.  This inforamtion will be helpful  in an overall understanding of ovarian physiology and reproductive  endocrinology in vertebrates.  ***",
