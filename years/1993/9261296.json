 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program deals with the design, development, and                            application of novel laser diagnostic techniques for the study                  of spray/drop vaporization and combustion.  The overall                         objective is accurate determination of such parameters as                       droplet temperature and temperature gradient profiles of the                    gas media surrounding one or more interacting burning droplets                  to provide fundamental knowledge regarding their combustion.                    The specific objectives of the Phase I program are: a) Improve                  and further develop an existing test facility for burning fuel                  droplet streams; b) Develop the point-diffraction                               interferometric technique in conjunction with digital image                     processing techniques to define the gas temperature field                       around a stream of burning drops; c) Apply rainbow thermometry                  to measure instantaneous liquid droplet temperatures; d)                        Investigate the feasibility of automatically integrating all                    this information to allow full reconstruction of the                            temperature field surrounding the droplets; and, e) Perform a                   preliminary assessment of measurement errors associated with                    the technique.                                                                                                                                                  The ultimate potential product is an instrument which would                     enable acquisition of fundamental information regarding the                     structure of the thermal fields surrounding interacting                         burning fuel droplets (notably, low-grade fuels) which is of                    paramount importance in development of future combustion                        systems which could utilize these fuels.  Potential                             applications include development/use of a novel fuel injector                   system for existing internal combustion engines which would                     enable them to use low grade fuels at high efficiency and with                  minimal production of pollutants.  These applications could                     significantly reduce U.S. dependency on foreign oil imports,                    and would help ensure world competitiveness and environmental                   responsibility in the use of low grade fuels.",
