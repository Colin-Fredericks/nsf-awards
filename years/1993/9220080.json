 "awd_abstract_narration": "Auxins are a class of growth hormone found in plants that induce             cells to elongate.  They act rapidly through the mediation of a                 single receptor or multiple receptors to cause changes in cell wall             properties and gene expression.  There are now several candidate                auxin receptors in plants; however, their roles in growth and                   development have not yet been determined.  These putative receptors             are therefore designated \"auxin-binding proteins\" (ABP's).  This                project focuses on the characterization of two such ABP's,                      designated ABP1 and 65-kDa ABP.  ABP1 is an endoplasmic reticulum               (ER) protein that contains an ER-retention sequence; yet, this                  laboratory has demonstrated that a significant amount of this                   protein escapes the ER retention mechanism and uniquely migrates to             the plasma membrane / cell wall space.  This cell wall localization             is consistent with its postulated site of action.  The 65-kDa                   subunit ABP, recently identified in this laboratory using anti-                 idiotypic antibodies, is a nuclear localized protein.  Preliminary              data suggest that it binds DNA.  The hypothesis is put forward that             this putative receptors is involved in auxin-regulated gene                     transcription.                                                                  %%%                                                                             It has been known for many years that plant growth and development              is regulated by plant hormones, principally auxins (e.g., indole                acetic acid, or IAA) and cytokines.  However, despite a great deal              of effort, it is not yet understood how plant hormones exert their              effects at a molecular level.  Auxin-binding proteins, such as ABP1             and the 65-kDa ABP which are the subject of this project, have been             described, but it has not yet been established for any of these                 that they are functional \"auxin receptors,\" let alone mechanisms of             action.  This laboratory has made some very interesting and novel               findings, such as the auxin-dependent subcellular localization of               ABP1 and the nuclear localization and DNA binding characteristics               of 65-kDa ABP, which may lead to breakthroughs in this area.  An                understanding of how plant cell growth and development is normally              controlled or modulated by plant hormones is critical to this                   nation's agricultural biotechnology efforts.",
