 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuation of a project to develop and operate air                  Cherenkov telescopes at South Pole Station for the purpose of                   studying discreet astrophysical sources of very high energy (VHE)               gamma rays.  The project is called Gamma-ray Astronomy at South                 Pole (GASP).  The primary instrument consists of an array of                    parabolic mirrors, with photomultiplier tubes at their foci, which              can detect light from VHE interactions in a small volume of the                 atmosphere.  The experiment is expected to shed light on the origin             of cosmic rays and possibly on sources of exotic radiation, if such             radiation exists.                                                                                                                                               GASP complements the pre-existing South Pole Air Shower Experiment              (SPASE), which is operated by the Bartol Research Institute of the              University of Delaware and Leeds University (UK), and extends                   downward by two to three orders of magnitude the energy threshold               of SPASE.  SPASE can survey most of the southern sky, and GASP will             be able to focus on small regions of suspected activity.                                                                                                        The location at South Pole allows GASP to view a single object for              extended periods (weeks to months) through a constant thickness of              atmosphere, while mid-latitude locations allow only a few hours of              viewing at a time of a given object.  The Polar location also means             that the very interesting high declination southern sky is always               within view, which gives GASP a great advantage over any mid-                   latitude observatory.                                                                                                                                           The project is a collaboration of the University of Wisconsin,                  Purdue University and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.                It is jointly funded by NSF's Office of Polar Programs and the                  Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.",
