The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Steven T.                                    Siems to work with Dr. Peter Jonas at UMIST in                                  Manchester, UK.                                                                                                                                                 Dr. Siems and the atmospheric research group at                                 UMIST have proposed adapting a large-eddy                                       simulation model in an effort to better                                         understand the direct impact cirrus clouds have                                 on the Earth's radiation budget and the                                         coupling between cloud dynamics and radiative                                   exchange.  A large-eddy simulation should prove                                 to be effective given the microphysical                                         variability found on scales of less than 1 km.                                  This model is to include a representation of                                    primary and secondary nucleation processes.  It                                 must allow for microphysical growth processes                                   and dynamical structures to be present and                                      interactive with the radioactive fluxes.                                        Specifically, the model hopes to address issues                                 concerning the occurrence of regions with high                                  concentrations of small ice crystals.  It is                                    unclear as to whether these occurrences are                                     more strongly influenced by fluctuations in the                                 ice nucleus population or the internal dynamics                                 of the cirrus.  The model will also be used to                                  address under the conditions under which                                        regions containing liquid water can exist at                                    temperatures below -30 degrees centigrade.  The                                 model may also be used to investigate the                                       structure of contrails and how they differ from                                 natural cirrus clouds.                                                                                                                                          The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel, a stipend for                                       twelve months and a small allowance for in-                                     country travel and attendance of a meeting.",
