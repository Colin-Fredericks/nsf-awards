 "awd_abstract_narration": "The automation of classification learning is an ongoing                    concern in the machine learning, pattern recognition and statistics             communities.  People are very good at designing and collecting                  data, but less good at analyzing it and extracting useful                       generalizations.  It is necessary to improve the techniques for                 automatic data analysis.  The state of the art in inductive                     learning is that there exist several dozen inductive learning                   algorithms/concept representations, each of which is best on some               proper subset of the possible inductive learning tasks.  The                    project will develop an efficient method for selecting the best                 algorithm/concept representation for each recursive call of a                   divide-and-conquer tree induction algorithm.  The combination of                different representations into a hybrid significantly improves the              ability of the inductive learning program to find a highly accurate             generalization of the data.  The major objective of this research               will be an approach to learning that includes an efficient search               for an appropriate hybrid representation, guided by detection of                specific forms of hypothesis pathology.  The creation of systems                that search multiple representation spaces greatly increases the                autonomy of learning machine, which will make data analysis                     techniques accessible to a wider range of scientists.//",
