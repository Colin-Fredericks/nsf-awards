 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research continues earlier efforts of the PI in studying                   parallelism for image understanding and robotics as well as in                  understanding the power of reconfiguration.  There are three                    spheres of emphasis in this work:  1. design and analysis of                    efficient parallel algorithms for roblems in vision and robotics on             well-established parallel models of computation,  2. implementation             of the parallel solutions on state of the art parallel machines,                and  3. a study of the power of reconfigurable meshes in solving                fundamental problems of interest to the parallel processing                     community as well as problems arising in image processing, vision               and robotics. These problems are among the generic high and                     intermediate level problems in image understanding and robotics.                Specifically, in image understanding, design and analysis of                    algorithms for motion analysis (object tracking), image and stereo              matching, model based object recognition as well as algorithms for              several symbolic computation based approaches used in understanding             images will be investigated. In robotic applications, parallel                  solutions to a variety of practical problems in real time robot                 motion- and task-planning arising in terrain navigation and                     industrial automation will be investigated. The parallel models to              be employed include the mesh-connected processor array,                         reconfigurable mesh array, and the hypercube. The algorithms will               be implemented on Connection Machine CM-5, Maspar MP-1 and the                  Image Understanding Architecture (IUA). In the work on the                      reconfigurable mesh model, design and analysis of fast and                      processor efficient parallel solutions to several fundamental                   problems on the reconfigurable mesh will be investigated. Problems              to be considered include arithmetic problems, image problems and                geometric problems on planar points. Known techniques on other                  parallel models will be studied for possible mapping onto the                   reconfigurable mesh.",
