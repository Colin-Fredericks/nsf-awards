 "awd_abstract_narration": "The initial objective of this research is to develop techniques  that significantly reduce the performance cost incurred by  program profiling.  Compiler techniques will be developed  that exploit program semantics and  features found in existing  architectures to reduce the cost of profiling.  New  architecture  techniques will be developed that support low-cost profiling.  The  high cost of existing profiling approaches precludes on-line  profiling.  However, on-line profiling is highly desirable because  it could provide more  accurate characterization of a program's  behavior.  A specific goal of this  work is to reduce the cost of  program profiling so that on-line profiling  becomes feasible.  On-  line profiling is the enabling technology for adaptive  code-  optimizations, which will also be studied in this project.  Code  optimizations that adapt to changing patterns in program behavior  can  potentially provide significant performance improvement  compared with the  traditional static compile-time optimizations.  An additional objective of this  project is to develop new low-  cost program profiling approaches that can more  completely  characterize program behavior, including profiling of multiple-  basic-block traces and accurate characterization of data cache  behavior.",
