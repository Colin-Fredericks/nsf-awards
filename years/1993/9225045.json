 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site award supports six undergraduate researchers                 working under the supervision of the principal investigator.  It                continues a tradition of summer research programs conducted every               year (except one) since 1977 by the principal investigator who                  often recruits former students to assist with the program. The                  quality of the work is exceptionally high, Of the forty-four                    students who have been through the programs, thirty-two have gone               to graduate school, and twelve have already earned the Ph.D.                    Thirty-two papers written in the program have already been                      published, nine are in press and a dozen or more are under review               and in preparation.  The principal research theme of the program                is discrete mathematics as reflected in problems from graph                     theory, combinatorics, finite groups and coloring problems.                          Problems often build on work done in previous programs,                    through correspondence with colleagues, and by searching                        journals.  Each student is given an individual problem and a                    write-up at the end of the program is required.  Students are                   encouraged to present their work at various professional                        meetings.",
