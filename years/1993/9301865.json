 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though radioactivity is widely used in bioassays due to its high                sensitivity and convenience, safety and environmental concerns have             accelerated efforts to eliminate its use.  Firefly luciferase                   accords the most efficient production of chemical luminescence,                 which is an effective alternative to radioactivity.  Recent                     improvements in the enzymatic chemistry which yield greater                     luminescent intensity with simper reaction kinetics further improve             its commercial utility.  Examining the structure and function of                several divergent isozymes of beetles luciferases is proposed to                gain a broader perspective of their properties, and to develop one              or more isozymes which are better suited to commercial                          applications.  Phase I of this research demonstrated feasibility by             successfully developing efficient methods for a) luciferase                     expression in E. coli, b) mutagenesis and selection for novel                   phenotypes, and c) structural and enzymological analysis of                     modified enzymes.  Phase II will focus on characterizing the                    recombinant luciferases, examining their relative structural                    relationships, and employing mutagenesis to enhance their                       properties and provide a method for future rational enzyme                      development in the absence of 3 dimensional structural information.             In Phase III, specific bioassay and other commercial applications               will be developed.                                                              %%%                                                                             Radioactivity is commonly used in biochemical analysis, such as                 medical and industrial diagnostics, because it is convenient and                provides high sensitivity.   However, alternatives to radioactivity             y are being sough due to concerns for over safety and environmental             impact.  the light emitted from fireflies is an extremely efficient             signal, and the chemistry of this system has been recently advanced             to accord a viable.  In addition to efficient light production,                 however, commercial practicality requires that the components of                the system be physically robust.  The enzyme isolated from                      fireflies, luciferase, is the least stable of these components.                 Phase II research is proposed to improve this situation by two                  approaches: 1) examine luciferases from other luminous beetles for              enzymes with greater structure.  The feasibility of these                       approaches has been previously established in Phase I research.  It             is further hoped that the methods developed in the Phase II                     research will be applicable to the commercial development of other              enzymes.  In Phase III, the luciferases developed in Phase II will              be adapted to novel biochemical procedures.",
