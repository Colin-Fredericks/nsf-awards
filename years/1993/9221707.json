The fjords of southwestern New Zealand               represent a unique and scientifically important marine                          environment which contains fragile communities dominated by many                rare and unusual species. Present understanding of the                          environmental processes that support the biological communities                 in the fjords is very limited and is hindering the ability to                   manage the area. The University of Otago's Department of Marine                 Science has made a long-term commitment to participation in,                    and facilitating marine research in the fjords.  Prof.                          Philip Mladenov from Otago University will serve as the                         New Zealand collaborator.                                                                                                                                       The subtidal rock walls of the fjords provide an excellent                      opportunity to investigate the relative roles of physical and                   biotic processes in maintaining community structure due to the                  conspicuous zonation of sessile invertebrates and the highly                    stratified fjord water column. Two primary zones have been                      identified, a shallow mussel-serpulid polychaete zone and a deep                suspension feeding zone. Specifically, this collaborative                       research project will investigate if the limits of these zones                  are determined by larval supply and/or sea star predation.",
