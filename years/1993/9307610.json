 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to extend a collaborative research effort between              the Russian research group at the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg             and the U.S. laser spectroscopy group at the University of Georgia.             The current cooperation in phonon dynamics in single crystal fibers             will be broadened to include the dynamics of phonons in glasses and             into the application of high resolution laser spectroscopy to the               study of ferroelectrics.                                                                                                                                        The proposed research will match the expertise of the Russian                   investigators in phonon dynamics and spectroscopy of ferroelectrics             with the state-of-the-art facilities and expertise in laser                     spectroscopy at the University of Georgia.  These facilities                    include a system for the preparation of single crystalline fibers               using the techniques of laser-heated pedestal growth, a line                    tunable pulsed far infrared laser for monochromatic phonon                      generation and a single frequency tunable dye laser for coherent                transient and spectral hole-burning spectroscopy.                                                                                                               The anticipated results for this research effort will provide                   information on the domain structure and the possibility for optical             holeburning memories in the ferroelectric chromium doped lithium                germanate glasses using photon-gated photoionization holeburning,               information on the spatial, spectral and temporal phonon dynamics               of glasses, and a better understanding of phonon-surface                        interactions and phonon transport in crystals using the special                 geometry of single crystalline fibers.                                          %%%                                                                             This study treats three basic problems in materials science.  The               first project will be to examine the dynamics of high frequency                 phonons in disordered materials such as glasses.  This problem                  relates to the understanding of heat transport, the structure, and              the dynamics of glassy systems.  The second project will be to                  study the domain structure of ferroelectric materials using state-              of-the-art high resolution laser spectroscopy.  The results of this             exercise should provide new information on the fundamental                      properties of ferroelectric materials.  Finally, ferroelectric                  materials containing known impurities will be investigated as                   possible new candidates for high density optical computer memories              using persistent optical holeburning.  This research will be                    conducted as a collaborative effort between the U.S. laser                      spectroscopy group at the University of Georgia and the Russian                 research group at the Ioffe Institute in St. Petersburg.  It will               utilize the expertise and facilities at the University of Georgia               in high resolution laser spectroscopy, far infrared lasers and                  materials preparation capabilities using laser heated pedestal                  growth coupled with the expertise at the Ioffe Institute in the                 properties and preparation of ferroelectrics and their experience               with phonon studies in glasses.",
