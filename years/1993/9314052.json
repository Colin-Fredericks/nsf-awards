The research is aimed at gathering information on the extent of glacial deposits in the Chhonbarden Glacier valley of the eastern Dhaulagiri Himal and to establish a relative chronology of glaciation in that valley and the adjacent Hidden Valley Region.  The results are expected to provide baseline data for future research to develop a detailed regional chronology of glaciation in this area of Nepal for comparison with other proposed ice core/snow studies and tree ring studies by other investigators in the United States.  Evaluation of the weathering characteristics of clasts on moraines, soil development, and lichenometric techniques will be used to develop the record.  Scope:  This research project meets the objectives of the international collaboration with developing countries.  It provides an opportunity to a young U.S. scientist to start a cooperative activity with a foreign country where both sides will benefit from the interaction.  The proposed research also fits with a broad research being conducted by U.S. scientists in various areas of the world, especially in the North Arctic Region to learn about weather conditions during the period of formation of existing glacial deposits. ***",
