 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recurring theme of study within the hsitory of science is the                 efforts of scientists to characterize \"normalcy\" within the human               species.  Stephen Jay Gould in his regular articles in \"Natural                 History\" has detailed some of the problems in such examples as                  efforts to measure average cranial size, the \"criminal\" tendencies              of those with an xyy chromosome and efforts to explain via gender               typing of male/female variations in mathematical abilities.                     Whatever the good intentions of the scientific experts who frame                the standards of what is normal, the history of such efforts has                not been a particularly beneficent one.  The message from these                 studies is clear:  not only the scientists constructing such                    standards but the public who is \"measured\" by them should take                  great care in evaluating what these standards really mean.                                                                                                      Ms. Stephanie Kenen, with the advice of Dr. John Lesch, her                     dissertation adviser, is examining the development of psychological             personality tests between World Wars I & II.  She is examining the              efforts of Lewis M. Terman and Catharine Cox Miles to quantify sex-             based personality traits in a 14 year study whose results were                  published in 1936.  Terman, Miles, and their research team crated               a multiple-choice personality test designed to distinguish between              the sexes and to establish a range of \"normal\" scores for each sex.             The psychologists emphasized the empirical, objective and                       quantitative aspects of their methods as evidence of the scientific             status of their work.  Their claim to legitimacy of science                     underscored their authority as experts in the psychology of sex.                                                                                                Ms. Kenen's research is focusing on three sets of questions related             to the \"Male-Female\" or \"M-F test\".  First, how did the researchers             establish the legitimacy of their project in the halls of academe,              in the budgets of philanthropic organizations, and in the eyes of               the public?  Second, to what degree and in what ways was Terman and             Miles' research contingent on their historical setting?  Third, how             was the test appraised and applied in the years after its                       publication?  These questions provide a framework for historical                analysis of the M-F research project in terms of the legitimacy of              scientific expertise, the construction of social-scientific                     knowledge, and the impact of that knowledge on the society from                 which it has derived.",
