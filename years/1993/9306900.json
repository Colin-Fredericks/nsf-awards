 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry program of the                        Chemistry Division, Prof. M. Jarrold of Northwestern University                 will study the structure and chemistry of gas phase atomic                      clusters.  Geometric structures, structural isomers, and                        structural transitions will be determined with an improved                      ion-chromatography technique.  Additionally, information will                   be obtained on previously inaccessible features such as cluster                 annealing and the temperature at which clusters isomerize and                   undergo a phase transition.  Thermal desorption measurements on                 clusters will be used to unravel the chemistry that occurs on                   the nano-surfaces of atomic clusters, and to determine accurate                 dissociation energies and ligand binding energies.  Specific                    cluster systems to be studied will include large fullerene-type                 carbon clusters composed of more than 100 carbon atoms and                      semiconductor clusters.                                                         %%%                                                                             Clusters of atoms (and molecules) constitute a form of                          aggregated matter that bridges the traditional conceptual                       boundary between the condensed (solid or liquid) and gaseous                    states of aggregation.  Because the physical and chemical                       properties of clusters differ from those of the condensed or                    gaseous phases of the concerned material, the study of cluster                  properties is of fundamental interest.  In addition to the                      exploration of cluster properties for their intrinsic interest,                 there is strong coupling to the technological applications of                   clusters.  Fullerenes, or buckyballs, are clusters in which the                 constituent atoms arrange themselves to form three dimensional                  geodesic structures.  The appellation fullerene (or buckyball)                  is given to this type of cluster in recognition of Buckminster                  Fuller who is known for his designs of geodesic domes.                          Fullerenes are now recognized to constitute a new, third form                   of carbon in addition to the well known forms graphite and                      diamond.  Their physical and chemical properties                                are intensively investigated to increase our knowledge about                    them and to exploit it for technological applications.",
