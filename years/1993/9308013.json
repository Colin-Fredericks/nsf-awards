 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hwu         Speculative execution and predicated execution are two  important sources of parallelism for VLIW and superscalar  processors.  Speculative execution tentatively executes  instructions before knowing that their execution is required.   Predicated execution merges multiple possible execution paths  into a single path so that the hardware can simultaneously  process multiple paths.  Both methods allow the compiler to  extract program parallelism in the presence of conditional  branches.  With superscalar and VLIW designs becoming  increasingly popular in the microprocessor industry, these  methods have become increasingly important for future high  performance microprocessors to achieve their performance goals.         This project addresses three critical issues involved in  incorporating speculative execution and predicated execution into  future superscalar and VLIW microprocessor systems.  First, the  design complexity of increasing levels of architecture support  for speculative execution and predicated execution are being  studied.  Secondly, compiler optimizers and schedulers that  exploit each level of the architecture support are being  developed.  Thirdly, an integrated approach is being defined to  coordinate speculative execution and predicated execution to best  improve program execution performance.  The objective is to  provide architecture expertise and compiler prototypes required  for the microprocessor industry to understand the cost and  effectiveness of each level of hardware support.",
