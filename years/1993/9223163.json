 "awd_abstract_narration": "National governments long have wrestled with issues of how              to deal with differences among regions in the formulation and                   implementation of economic development policies.  While the                     general goal of promoting equality in development among various                 regions often is promoted in order to improve the wellbeing of                  all residents of a nation, differences in the human and natural                 resources and in the geographic situations among regions argue                  for differential development policies to be developed and                       implemented.  The conflicts between these different approaches to               regional development have been apparent in the People's Republic                of China in recent decades.  Under the leadership of Mao Zedong,                development policies favored regional equity in hopes that poorer               inland provinces would \"catch up\" with wealthier eastern coastal                provinces.  Regional policies under Deng Xiaoping have emphasized               regional specialization and division of labor, however, with                    export-oriented industrialization and trade in the east                         generating more rapid development than agricultural and energy-                 related activities in central provinces and animal husbandry and                mineral-related activities to the west.  This project will                      investigate the dynamics and implications of the shift in                       regional development policies through construction and analysis                 of a database containing demographic and socio-economic data for                all counties in China in 1982 and 1990.  Special attention will                 be given in the analyses to assessing the extent of spatial                     polarization in China, to measuring the degree of spatial                       inequality among different regions and changes in levels of                     inequality, and to identifying factors that explain those                       variations.                                                                             This project will contribute to new understandings in a                 number of ways.  The demographic and socio-economic database will               provide unprecedented opportunities to explore differences in                   economic development and related factors across different parts                 of China over time.  The analyses will provide new insights into                the spatial implications of different regional development                      policies, especially the degree to which differential policies                  foster unequal levels of development.  Not only will these                      insights be useful for those interested in the dynamics and                     implications of current Chinese economic policies, they also will               enhance more general understandings of the spatial implications                 of development policies and practices in other locales.",
