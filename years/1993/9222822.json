The focus is on the                       comparison of various multi-reference correlation methods and                   on the testing of combined perturbative-variational approaches.                 Applications include studies of excited states of diatomic                      molecules near avoided crossings, low-lying excited states of                   polyenes and other conjugated species, and the ground-state                     properties of both symmetrical and asymmetrical alkali halide                   dimers.                                                                         %%%                                                                             Modern computer-based computational methods are being used in                   this study to characterize the energies and shapes of a number                  of different types of molecules both in their ground and                        excited states.  These molecular types include diatomics such                   as oxygen, carbon monoxide, and aluminum hydride, various                       hydrocarbons, and such high-temperature species as that formed                  by two sodium chloride molecules bound together.",
