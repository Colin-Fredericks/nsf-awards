 "awd_abstract_narration": "One technique for achieving exceptional selectivity in the                      membrane gas separation of small molecules such as N2, H2, O2,                  CH4, and CO is to tailor the pore size of the membrane so that                  only the desired molecules can fit through the pores.  Since                    molecules such as N2, H2, and CO have diameters in the range                    of from 3-to-6 A, it is necessary to make membranes with pore                   sizes, which can be adjusted to a desired value within this                     range.  To achieve this goal, this research suggests a unique                   approach to making and tailoring the pore size of microporous                   inorganic membranes.  The starting material for the membrane                    is inexpensive Vycor glass, whose pores are approximately 40 A                  or larger in diameter.  The pore surfaces of this glass                         contain silanol groups (Si-OH).  The PI Proposes reacting                       these groups (via a CVD process) with SiCl4 to form                             -Si-O-SiCl3.  This reaction coats the surface with an atomic                    layer, which reduces the pore diameter. The chlorinated                         surface can then be hydroxylated by the reaction with H2O to                    form Si-O-SiCl2-OH, which further reduces the pore diameter.                    By successive reactions one can achieve atomic layer control                    of the pore size.  Microporous membranes with particular pore                   sizes will be made, and will be tested for their selectivity                    in various binary separations.",
