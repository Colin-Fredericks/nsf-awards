 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is an investigation of the paleoclimatic                  significance and late-Quaternary history of sand dune fields and                lunettes (dunes fringing playa basins) on the Southern High Plains.             Three principal hypotheses will be tested:  1) the sand dune                    fields on the Southern High Plains formed synchronously between                 9000 and 4500 yrs B.P., since 1000 yrs B.P., and historically; 2)               the lunettes of the Southern High Plains formed synchronously and               episodically during the late Quaternary and were derived from                   sediments in adjacent playas during droughts; 3) Holocene                       construction of the sand dunes and the lunettes occurred                        synchronously and was the result of regional drought.  There are                several significant aspects of the research.  The record of dune                construction and dune movement should provide a long-term (late                 Quaternary) record of drought and wind erosion of the High Plains               surface.  Studying the historic record of dune activity along with              historic climate data will begin to provide some estimates of the               climatic thresholds that must be crossed before desertification                 begins in the region.  Studying the lunettes is also important                  because they are the only sites of deposition on the Llano Estacado             with a demonstrated potential for a dateable paleoenvironmental                 and stratigraphic record spanning the past 30,000+ years.  The                  proposed research on the Southern High Plains complements current               dune studies on the Northern High Plains (sponsored by NSF, USGS,               and NASA) and will contribute to a subcontinental-scale view of                 late-Quaternary eolian erosion and sedimentation and attendant                  climatic implications.",
