In the first direction, emphasis will be  placed on establishing existence or nonexistence of ground  states, especially when the governing nonlinearities have   algebraic growth both in the solution variable and its gradient.  A ground state is a non-negative solution (not trivial) which  tends to zero off compact sets.  Work on holonomic oscillators,  which arise particularly in Lagrangian mechanics, concerns the  stabilizing effect of various damping modes and nonautonomous  restoring forces.  Particular attention will be paid to the  effect of intermittently applying damping mechanisms,  specifically, to determine necessary and sufficient conditions  under which such damping causes transient effects to decay.  Finally, the derivation of equations of motion from invariance  principles continues earlier work of the same nature. It is  expected that extensions to chemical mixtures and micropolar  materials will be carried out.  These are cases not well  understood.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
