 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309258   Tsuchitani     Hearing with two ears (binaural) is much better than with just one  (monaural) for detecting and locating sound sources, and  understanding speech in a noisy background.  Within the mammalian  brain, in the brainstem, there is a structure called the superior  olivary complex that is the first place in the auditory pathway  directly involved in the neural processing that underlies binaural  hearing.  This complex contains nerve cells formed into groups  called nuclei.  Two of these are the lateral superior olive nucleus  (LSO), and the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body.  Both are part  of  a neural network, the LSO network, that is specifically  involved in binaural processing of mid- to high-frequency sounds,  those above 1.5kHz.  This work is a collaboration between a sensory  neurophysiologist and a signal-processing theorist using an  interdisciplinary approach.  Responses of neurons in the LSO  network are recorded for controlled acoustic stimuli which  approximate normal \"free-field\" binaural conditions, and  computational models describe how these responses devleop the  neural representation of binaural signals.  Signal array processing  techniques also will be used to determine the consequent  contributions of the LSO network to binaural perception.  This work  will have impact beyond auditory neuroscience to sensory processing  in general, to computational modelling of networks, and to devices  for aiding or enhancing hearing capabilities.  ***",
