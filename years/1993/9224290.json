 "awd_abstract_narration": "A comprehensive theoretical study will be made of the novel                     properties of frustrated, doped, and random quantum                             antiferromagnets.  Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements             have provided us with a wealth of information on the spin dynamics              of the doped cuprates: a successful unraveling of the nature of the             spin fluctuations is clearly important to a deeper understanding of             the novel properties of these high temperature superconductors.                 With the aim of understanding these measurements, we will study the             universal properties of two-dimensional antiferromagnets in the                 vicinity of a zero temperature phase transition at which the long-              range magnetic order vanishes.  The effects of doping, quenched                 randomness, incommensurate spin fluctuations, and incipient phase               separation on this phase transition and the quantum disordered                  phase will be examined.  Other frustrated, layered antiferromagnets             have also been studied in recent years: in particular, the kagome               lattice is a strong, experimentally realizable candidate for                    displaying a disordered ground state.  We will undertake a                      theoretical study of these systems: the nature of quantum phase                 transitions and the quantum disordered phases of antiferromagnets               on frustrated two-dimensional lattices will be studied by a duality             analysis and mappings to dimer models.  Finally, the low                        temperature magnetic propoerties of the metallic and insulating                 phases of doped semiconductors will be studied: these materials are             well described by a strongly random Hubbard model which will be                 examined by numerical and analytic approaches.                                  %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted on magnetic models which are             at the core of problems related to strongly interacting physical                systems such as the high temperature superconductors.  These                    problems are at the forefront of present research in condensed                  matter physics.",
