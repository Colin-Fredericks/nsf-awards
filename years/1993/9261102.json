 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wet thermal oxidation process for direct conversion of                        Refuse Derived Fuel (residual material following separation of                  paper, cardboard, glass, plastic bottles, and steel and                         aluminum cans from raw Solid Municipal Waste) to energy,                        saving dewatering and drying expenses encountered in more                       conventional methods, under conditions highly conducive to                      destruction of gaseous pollutants will be studied.  Phase I                     efforts will center on concentration of the Refuse Derived                      Fuel slurry to a maximum pumpable solids loading of about 15%,                  followed by heating under pressure to carbonize the organic                     material, reducing its water affinity and permitting further                    concentration to approximately 45% solids loading (this level                   to be confirmed in batch carbonization tests in this study                      phase).  Following successful completion of these tasks, Phase                  II efforts will be focused on thermal oxidation of the                          carbonized slurry from Phase I at high pressure and                             temperature in a continuous process, with the liberated heat                    being used to generate and superheat steam for power                            generation.  Specific objectives of the Phase I effort are:                     (1) Establish maximum solids concentrations for a pumpable raw                  RDF/water slurry; (2) Establish optimum conditions for RDF wet                  carbonization to supply high concentration slurry for                           subsequent wet oxidation; (3) Evaluate effects of wet                           carbonization on the chemical and physical properties of the                    RDF; and, (4) Characterize gas and water effluent streams from                  wet carbonization.                                                                                                                                              Municipal Solid Waste is a growing national problem, currently                  without a good solution.  The energy contained in Municipal                     Solid Waste produced in the United States is roughly                            equivalent to a million barrels of imported oil per day.  The                   combination of wet resource recovery and wet thermal oxidation                  to be studies in this program offers a potential of neatly and                  economically disposing of Municipal Solid Waste with                            negligible pollution with recovery of significant anergy                        resources.",
