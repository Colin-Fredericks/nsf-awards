 "awd_abstract_narration": "For over two centuries, amphibians have been primary models                for embryological and developmental studies.  Much of what we                   know about early embryonic development, the techniques for the                  successful culture of embryos in vitro, and the role of hormones                in   early development have come from studies on amphibian eggs and             tadpoles.  Because amphibian eggs develop outside of the mother's               body, it is relatively easy to culture them in the laboratory and               to experimentally manipulate them.  The vast majority of what we                have learned about the developmental biology of amphibians is                   directly applicable to our understanding of human development.                  Dr. Nicoll will examine the role of hormones in early development               of amphibians, and will determine how external environmental                    variables can influence hormone production and the rate of                      development.  He is focusing on the corticotropin-releasing hormone             system since the release of this hormone may represent a                        phylogenetically ancient initiator or cue in development.  He will              determine how this neurohormone regulates the secretion of                      thyroid-stimulating hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormones, two               pituitary hormones known to be important in the metamorphic                     process.  The basic information gained from these studies will                  contribute to our understanding of the complex events which occur               within the womb during human development.  Moreover, given the                  recent global decline in amphibian populations, the findings are                directly related to the conservation of biological diversity.                   Identification of the environmental and physiological factors which             influence development, and the ways in which amphibians respond to              these variables through careful, controlled experimentation will                help in the design of effective conservation strategies.",
