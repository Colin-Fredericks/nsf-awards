The applicant received her Ph.D. from  University of California at Los Angeles.  Her Ph.D. research was in  the area of photosynthesis with a focus on membrane biochemistry.   She plans to carry out her postdoctoral fellowship research in the  laboratory of Dr. Todd Yeates also at University of California at  Los Angeles although at a different department.  The proposed  research entitled \"Crystallization and structure determination of  the photosynthetic pigment-proteins of Chromatium\" will expand the  scientific experience of this Fellow into structural biology.  This  is an area of science not many plant biologists choose to go into,  and in need of study.  The proposed plan also includes extended  foreign research experience at Max Planck Institute in Germany.  ***",
