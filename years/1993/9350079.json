 "awd_abstract_narration": "The action of regulatory components during development is a crucial             issue for biological research, but investigations of such                       components are restricted to a few well known model systems.  Dr.               Tobin will undertake a novel system for analysis of complex,                    tissue-specific regulation of developmental genes in insects by                 utilizing baculovirus vectors to carry promoter-reporter constructs             into lepidopteran larvae.  She will test application of this                    approach by investigating the elements responsible for expression               of actin in the microvillae of the intestinal brush border cells.               She will then address the ability of this system to define similar              elements of the 5C Drosophila actin gene in lepidopteran larvae.                This system will permit rapid, in vivo testing of DNA promoter                  fragments to regulate activity of the reporter gene and detect both             temporal and tissue-specific regulation.                                                                                                                        Interactive activities at the host institution include:  co-                    teaching a freshman course that is part of a Howard Hughes                      Foundation program designed to attract minorities and women into                biological sciences.  Dr. Tobin will also teach a graduate seminar              course in Insect Molecular Genetics, speak in the Entomology                    Seminar Series, and interact informally with female undergraduates,             graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows who intend to pursue                careers in academia and industry.                                                                                                                               This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
