 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307726  Majda       There are many unresolved fundamental problems about weak  solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, such as vortex  sheets, and regularizations of these weak solutions by smoothing  the initial data or adding viscosity.  Furthermore, since these  problems are extremely challenging ones to try to solve with  numerical methods, it is natural to first consider related   simpler model problems.  Recent research shows that the solutions  of the two-component Vlasov Poisson equations (2CVPE) for a  collisionless plasma of electrons and positively charged ions,  with the initial condition being an appropriate measure, have  many properties that are direct analogues of solutions of the 2-D  vorticity equation for an incompressible fluid with vortex sheet  initial data.  The 2CVPE is simpler to treat analytically and  easier to solve numerically.  It should be an extremely useful  and an important model problem for suggesting answers to the open  problems about vortex sheets.  The investigator conducts a  numerical investigation of the 2CVPE and its \"viscous\"  regularization, the two-component Fokker-Planc equation.  The  goal is to determine properties of solutions to these systems of  equations when the initial data is a measure.  Recently  discovered exact solutions of the 2CVPE will focus this work.   The investigator also conducts a numerical investigation of the  2-D incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations with  appropriate vortex sheet initial data.  He uses the insight  gained from the study of related model problems from plasma  physics to motivate and guide this work.  This work is designed  to provide answers to many of the open problems about properties  of solutions of the Euler equations with vortex sheet initial  data.       Fluid dynamics is the study of continuous media like air and  water.  Scientists formulate problems in this field by applying   the fundamental laws of physics such as the conservation of mass,  momentum and energy.  For most probl ems this procedure leads to  sets of mathematical equations that are too complicated to solve.  Based on physical or mathematical intuition, the scientist then  tries to find a simplified formulation of the original problem  that is simple enough to solve, but sufficiently complicated to  describe the essential features of the original problem.  The  mixing process between layers of fluid that have different  densities, like air and water, or layers of fluid moving at  different velocities, is very complicated and occurs in a wide  variety of important applications.  The flow of air over an  airplane is also very complicated.  In order to predict the  trailing wake behind an airplane, or the mixing process in a  fluid, scientists often use a simplified model of the fluid  called a vortex sheet.  This is the simplest realistic  description of not only these problems, but many other large  Reynold's number flows.  Unfortunately, despite the wide-spread  use of vortex sheet models in many problems in fluid dynamics,  many mathematical properties of vortex sheets remain poorly  understood.  The goal of this proposal is to provide answers to  many of the fundamental questions about the mathematical  properties of vortex sheets.  Successful completion of the  proposed work will lead to an increased understanding of the  strengths and limitations when using vortex sheets to model  complicated fluid flows.",
