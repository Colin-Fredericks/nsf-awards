 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303836  Bauer    The recently described nonsulfur purple photosynthetic bacterium  Rhodospirillum centenum exhibits several physiological traits  previously unknown among photosynthetic eubacteria.  One feature  is the existence of a life cycle involving the formation of heat  and desiccation resistant cysts.  Germination of Rsp. centenum  cysts leads to cell differentiation characterized by swarm cell  behavior on solid media.  Swarm cells grown on solid agar medium  have numerous lateral flagella and are distinct from non-swarm  cells which bear a single polar flagellum.  Swarm cell  differentiation appears to be a stage of a life cycle and to be a  specific response to an increase in medium viscosity.  A second  unusual feature of Rsp. centenum is that swarm cell colonies have  the capacity to migrate rapidly either towards or away from  light; rates as high as 45 mm/hour have been observed.  An action  spectrum has demonstrated that 585 nm light repels whereas light  over the region 800-880 nm attracts.  Major goals of this  proposal include the physiological characterization of swarm  cells as well as an analysis of phototactic behavior of Rsp.  centenum.  In addition, genetic analyses of swarm cell formation  as well as phototaxis will be undertaken to determine the number  and nature of the genetic loci involved in these processes.  These studies will also be augmented by biochemical and molecular  genetic characterization of the photoreceptor(s) involved.  It is  anticipated that the proposed research will provide significant  information on prokaryotic cell differentiation and in addition,  should provide the first molecular analysis of the mechanism of  phototaxis in eubacteria.    We also propose to extend genetic analysis of bacterial  photosynthesis to evolutionarily divers species of eubacterial  phototrophs.  The aim of this area of research is to obtain  clones of bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis genes from Chlorobium  tepidum, Heliobacterium gestii, Rhodopseudomonas viridis and   cyanobacteria for the purpose of determining the extent to which  a Photosynthesis Gene Cluster is conserved among various genera  and species of phototrophic prokaryotes.  The clones obtained  will also be used to generate sequence analyses of genetic loci  common to bacterial and plant chlorophyll biosynthetic pathways  for use in subsequent studies of chlorophyll biosynthesis in  plant systems.  ***",
