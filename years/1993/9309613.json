To facilitate this, good analyses of  the economic growth process are needed.  With this in mind, the  investigator proposes to continue his work on computational methods  in economics with a focus on problems of taxation, imperfect  competition, and finance, and their importance in fostering  economic growth.    New methods for analyzing problems in finance will be applied, and  the effects of insider trading and appropriate government policies  will be studied.  In particular, the research will focus on how  insider trading affects capital accumulation and economic growth,  and on how vigorously insider trading laws should be enforced.  New  methods will also be used to analyze the effects of new securities  on financial markets.  These methods will then be used to study  which securities should be introduced, and the results will be  compared to the securities and contracts which exchanges have  incentives to introduce.    The study of imperfect competition will focus on assessing the  likely importance of tacit collusion and on evaluating various  tests which have been used to detect collusion.  Different  government policies such as merger and antitrust rules will be  evaluated to determine which rules are best for consumers, and  which are best for economic growth.    The optimal taxation part of the research will combine earlier work  on innovation with work on factor taxation to begin a dynamic  theory of optimal taxation with public goods, patents, innovation,  and endogenous economic growth.  The appropriate sharing of the tax  burden between labor and capital will be examined in light of  interactions between profits, innovation, job creation, and wages.    ***",
