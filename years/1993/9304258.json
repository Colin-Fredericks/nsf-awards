 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Gary Feinman will                  continue his archaeological research at the site of Ejutla which is             located in Oaxaca Mexico. During his 1992 field season Dr. Feinman              discovered the corner of what he believes to be a 4-6 room                      structure. He will now excavate the entire compound, collect the                cultural materials it contains and produce a detailed map. His goal             is to reconstruct the range of activities which took place in this              family context and especially focus on the craft or manufacturing               activities represented. Prior work has indicated that a wide range              of materials including onyx and at least 80 taxa of Pacific shell               were worked at the site. Dr. Feinman believes that specialists                  produced materials for trade and that the great majority of the                 elaborate shell and stone ornaments made were not consumed locally.             Most of the shell recovered in prior excavations consisted of by-               products and defective pieces.                                                                                                                                  In the early first millennium much of central Mexico was                        incorporated into an empire which, archaeologists believe, had its              center at Monte Alban. The site with its large impressive ruins has             been extensively excavated and its importance in a broader regional             context is clear. However what is less well understood is how this              empire functioned and how outlying areas such as Ejutla were                    controlled and tied to the core. Dr. Feinman believes that the                  development of structured trade networks and the interdependencies              which thus developed may have played a central role. In this                    context Ejutla is extremely interesting because it appears to be                involved in specialized manufacturing which focussed on shell                   carving. What makes this unusual is that the site is located far                from the ocean. The proposed excavation will provide additional                 insight into how Ejutla functioned and the immediate social context             in which this work took place.                                                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase our              understanding of the processes which underlie the development of                state level societies.",
