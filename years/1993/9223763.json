 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Drs. Geoffrey Conrad and Emilio Moran, Mr.                Eduardo Neves will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.                  Through remote sensing techniques as well as on the ground survey               and excavation Mr. Neves will conduct an archaeological study in                the Uaupes river basin area of Amazonia. While in the Brazilian                 rainforest considerable archaeological research has been conducted              in floodplain regions, very little is known about more upland areas             which are not regularly inundated. The Uaupes basin was selected                because it represents such an area. Extant groups have been the                 subject of ethnographic research and Mr. Neves work will help to                set them into a deeper chronological framework.                                                                                                                 The research itself consists of three stages. The initial phase                 includes an analysis of digitalized Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper                   satellite images. The objective is to identify potential loci of                archaeological sites according to criteria derived from                         ethnographic and ethnohistoric sources. Secondly, a systematic                  archaeological survey will be carried out in selected study units.              The goal is to asses the predictive power of the spectral                       reflectance analysis and to obtain data on the culture history of               the region. Finally, further work will be performed to correlate                the data obtained in the field with the image analysis of the                   spectral data.                                                                                                                                                  This work is important for several reasons. First it will provide               data of great interest to many archaeologists and social                        anthropologists. Secondly, it will help to develop an analytic                  technique which may prove useful in many heavily vegetated parts of             the world. Finally it will assist in the training of an extremely               promising young scientist.",
