 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the study of electronic structure due to                 charge-density waves (CDWs) and spin-density waves (SDWs) in lower              dimensional metals, semimetals and semiconductors.  The research                utilizes scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force                   microscopy (AFM) to detect both the atomic and electronic structure             with resolution on the scale of individual atoms and correlates the             results with studies of the effects of high magnetic fields on the              electronic transport properties of the some materials.  The                     materials to be investigated include transition metal                           chalcogenides, as well as more complex crystals such as tantalum                nickel selenide.  This combination of the above techniques provides             a unique characterization of the electronic modifications                       associated with CDWs, SDWs and mixed density waves.  They also                  provide extremely sensitive detection of modifications in the CDW               structure as induced by impurity doping.  Doping of                             trichalcogenides produces new electronic phases, metal-insulator                transitions and modified CDWs, all of which can be detected by STM              spectroscopy, AFM scanning and high magnetic field transport.                   Results should provide a detailed understanding of the electronic               properties of materials as modified by the presence of density-                 waves in the electron gas as well as changes in the electronic                  density waves due to impurity doping.                                           %%%                                                                             The highly anisotropic metals being studied in this research and                the unusual electronic properties associated with density-waves                 provide insight into new electronic modifications of materials.                 Studies of these properties on an atomic scale by scanning                      tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM),                   combined with macroscopic measurements of the associated electronic             conduction phenomena in high magnetic fields, lead to a unique                  understanding of the overall electronic structure.  The STM and AFM             studies provide a picture of both the crystal structure and the                 electronic structure at the atomic level.  These methods are                    extremely sensitive to modifications by impurities and defects and              can be used to systematically follow impurity atom locations,                   ordering and the formation of new electronic phases in the                      crystals.  The accompanying modifications of the electronic and                 magnetotransport properties will correlate the changes in atomic                configuration and local electronic structure with the overall                   electronic response of the material.  The development of these                  methods should be extremely useful for the design and testing of                new electronic materials.",
