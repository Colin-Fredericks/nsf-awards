 "awd_abstract_narration": "We aim to establish an Undergraduate Laboratory in Polymer                  Science and Engineering to update the undergraduate engineering                 program at the University of Pennsylvania. The proposed                         laboratory will benefit undergraduate students by teaching                      important principles in polymer science and by introducing them                 to state-of-the-art equipment. The scope of the project                         involves required core courses, elective polymer courses and                    independent undergraduate research or design projects. The                      planned laboratory exercises include polymer syntheses,                         computer simulations, molecular and structural                                  characterizations, morphology investigations and mechanical                     property measurements. Upon synthesizing their own polymers,                    thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanical properties will be                        investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter and a                    dynamic mechanical analyzer. This thermal analysis equipment                    will be a major component of the undergraduate polymer                          laboratory, because of the variety of polymer characteristics                   which these instruments can probe (e.g. glass transition,                       crystallization, moduli). A unique feature of the project is                    the incorporation of molecular modeling for illustrating chain                  conformations and tacticity and for predicting macroscopic                      properties from molecular structures. A hot stage is necessary                  to study the phase transitions and crystallization of polymers                  using an existing undergraduate light microscopy facility. This                 project is significant for three reasons: undergraduate                         laboratory facilities for the study of polymer science and                      engineering currently do not exist at Penn, our undergraduate                   engineers frequently find employment in polymer or polymer-                     related fields, and finally, polymeric materials are of immense                 commercial and scientific importance.",
