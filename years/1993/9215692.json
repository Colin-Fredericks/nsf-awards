 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the travel of eight U.S. participants to                a joint U.S.-Australia seminar on gender, science and technology.               The seminar co-organizers are Dr. Joan H. Fujimura from the                     Department of Sociology at Harvard University and Dr. Ann Dugdale               from the University of Melbourne where she is a Lecturer in the                 History and Philosophy of Science. The seminar will take place                  in Melbourne between June 26 and July 1, 1993 under the auspices                of the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                              The seminar will focus on the historical and social analysis of                 interactions among gender, science and technology. Considerable                 attention will be directed toward elucidating specific case                     studies in which methodologies have been developed for                          analyzing the influence of gender on scientific and technological               knowledge and practice. Through the study of science and                        technology in their social, cultural, epistemological and                       historical contexts, highlighting the role of gender as one                     variable  shaping scientific and technical expertise, the                       participants should contribute analyses that will stimulate                     policies directed at achieving access and equity goals in                       scientific and technical fields. This seminar is being co-funded                by the Australian Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce               (DITAC).",
