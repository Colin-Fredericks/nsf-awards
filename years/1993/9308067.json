 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to increase the safety and                         reliability of real-world software systems.  The research is                    directed toward the development of practical techniques and                     the construction of automated tools for verifying properties                    of concurrent and real-time software.  Many techniques have                     been proposed for this task, but little is known about their                    performance and range of applicability in practice.  This                       research will conduct a thorough empirical evaluation of two                    promising techniques and a new technique that is a hybrid of                    the two.  The techniques will be evaluated by constructing                      tools that automate them and applying these tools to a large                    number of sample systems.  The information obtained will                        provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the                       techniques examined and will help developers choose an                          appropriate technique for their particular domain.",
