 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent evidence suggest that viruses may be very important in                   marine food webs, with some estimates suggesting they are                       responsible for the majority of bacterial mortality, and driving a              significant component of nutrient cycling.  If these estimates are              correct, the scientific community will need a major rethinking of               our conceptual models and modification of the performance and                   interpretation of many currently-accepted field measurements.                   However, the evidence to date is only from a few samples, and the               methods and results are in real need of verification before they                can be accepted with confidence.  The objectives of this project                are to use a variety of independent methods to measure from marine              samples: (1) mortality rates of bacteria from viral infection in                the context of bacterial growth and mortality from other sources                including protistan grazers, and (2)  the rates and mechanisms by               which free viruses are removed or destroy.  There are no known                  direct means to measure virus-induced bacterial mortality in                    natural mixed population, so two indirect methods will be used: (a)             electron microscopy of field populations containing mature                      intracellular viruses, and (b) native virus population size changes             and removal or decay rates in field samples.  Rates will be                     compared to estimates of bacterial growth, grazing losses, and                  size-fractionated total mortality in an attempt to assemble a                   \"source and sink\" budget for large enclosed samples.  Rates and                 mechanisms of viral decay and removal will be studied with both                 natural populations and cultured viruses.  This project includes                some laboratory work, but primarily field studies to be performed               in nearshore and offshore environments off California.  The use of              multiple methods, cross-verified with each other, should greatly                increase the confidence in any conclusion that are reached.",
