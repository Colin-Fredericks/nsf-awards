The  randomness of radioactive decay is being used to visualize  statistical quantities and distributions.  Experiments in Nuclear  Physics, such as determining the range of the three types of  radiation in various materials, are being used to familiarize  students with radiation and with shielding used in radiation  facilities.  A NaI detector, along with a computer-controlled  multichannel analyzer, are being used to introduce students to the  interfacing of equipment to computers.  A low level counting system  utilizing a HpGe detector and associated electronics, computer, and  software is being set up which will allow for environmental testing  of materials from different local sites. This detector system is  also being used in conjunction with our neutron source to perform  some neutron activation analysis related experiments.",
