 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224493  Birman    This award will support collaborative research  between Kenneth Birman and Keith Marzullo, Cornell  University, and Paulo Verissimo, Technical  University of Lisbon.  Professor Verissimo is  associated with INESC, the Institute for Systems and  Computer Engineering, and its Navigators Group,  whose research focuses on robustness of distributed  systems. Professor Birman is associated with the  Isis Project at Cornell; its central idea is to  encourage programmers to develop distributed  software using a collection of routines that  presents a simple network execution model, virtual  synchrony.    At present, the two teams hold state-of-the-art  knowledge which is in some points complementary.   Both groups have concluded that by integrating  independently developed technologies, a substantial  advance in the ease of use and power of the next  generation of distributed computing systems could  result. The investigators propose to collaborate on  an effort that will integrate a diverse collection  of high reliability distributed computing  technologies under the general framework of a new  system for group-oriented computing.   The  collaboration will deal with three subjects:  an  object-oriented methodology for integration of  varied technologies into a group computing  environment; a focus on system architecture issues  drawing on the microkernel architectures that are  gaining in importance within the operating systems  community; and such protocol and algorithmic  enhancements as are needed to realize that vision.  ***",
