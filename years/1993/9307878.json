 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307878  Hamrick       While surveys of genetic diversity in tropical tree species  are numerous enough to make some generalizations (high within  population diversity, relatively low diversity among populations,  much species-to-species variation in genetic diversity) We know  very little about the underlying mechanisms that influence the  levels and distribution of genetic diversity in tropical trees.   The relatively low levels of differentiation seen among tropical  tree populations indirectly indicates that gene movement over  rather large geographic distances (5-10km) is high, but here are  very few studies available that have made quantitative estimates  of gene movement.  Those estimates that are available are  consistent with the levels of differentiation seen among  populations.  Unfortunately, the species richness of tropical  forest and the wide array of pollen and seed dispersal agents  available to tropical trees makes generalizations based on a few  studies questionable at best.  The proposed research will  increase the number of species for which estimates of gene flow  are available under natural conditions.  The comparative nature  of this research, while based on a relatively few species will  extend our knowledge of gene movement in tropical tree species to  several pollination syndromes that have not been studied to date.   Upon its completion this research will greatly extend our  understanding of gene movement in tropical forest.%%%       By studying effective pollen immigration into isolated  forest fragments we will extend our evolutionary studies into the  realm of applied conservation biology.  Any management plan with  the goal to preserve forest tree species and their genetic  resources will need to  know the degree of gene movement among  forest fragments and the levels of inbreeding they experience.   Also our work will begin to determine the effects of isolation  distance on levels of gene flow and how these relationships vary  for species with different pollinati on syndromes.  Knowledge of  the levels of gene movement and the spatial scales at which it  occurs may ultimately allow the development of landscape level  designs that accommodate agricultural development but at the same  time preserve the biological and genetic diversity of tropical  tree species.***",
