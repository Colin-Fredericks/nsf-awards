This is enabling our students  to gain proficiency in this recently developed technique.  The  experiment which is being carried out in the Separations  Methods course has been carefully designed to illustrate the  complementary nature of CE to HPLC by demonstrating its utility  where liquid chromatography fails.  An automated unit is  permitting students to develop awareness of the greatly  increased workload achievable with a state-of-the-art  instrument.  Students also are being compelled to revise their  notions concerning the planning and design of experiments in  order to fully exploit the productive capacity of a computer-  controlled instrument.  The objectives in our ongoing research  programs and mandatory senior projects are being realized much  more expeditiously with the CE instrument.  ***",
