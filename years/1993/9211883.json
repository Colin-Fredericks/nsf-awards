 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal plans an examination of nonlinear,                            dissipative and non-equilibrium systems in the                                  magnetosphere. Recently studies have shown that a system                        with complex behavior may have a simply dynamical                               description and that experimental data can be used to                           reconstruct the system dynamics, thus gaining insight into                      the physics of complex nonlinear systems, independently of                      particular modeling assumptions. Using these techniques, the                    time series data of a single dynamical variable can be used                     to obtain the fractal dimension, Lyapunov exponents, etc. If                    the system is low dimensional and thus has a small number of                    degrees of freedom, its dynamics may be described by a                          nonlinearly coupled set of a few ordinary differential                          equations, which can be constructed from time series data.                      These equations can then be used for prediction, which                          however would be limited because of the chaotic behavior,                       and a predictability time scale can be defined by a                             comparison of the predicted and observational data. Analysis                    of magnetospheric activity using geomagnetic data has shown                     a low-dimensional chaotic behavior, and thus its dynamical                      equations can be constructed. We propose to develop                             nonlinear dynamical models using the phase space                                reconstruction techniques in the solar wind--magnetosphere                      coupling and stellar variability. The implications of such                      nonlinear dynamical techniques for the study of                                 astrophysical and space physical phenomena is the prime                         focus of the proposed research.",
