The objective of their research  is to study hadronic phenomena in the presence of very large  magnetic fields.  These fields may be connected to astrophysical  phenomena such as superconducting cosmic strings and are  associated with the early universe.    Previous collaborative efforts examined instabilities, proton  decay in large magnetic fields, and the screening of fields by  chiral symmetry breaking.  The investigators propose to extend  their collaboration to a study of quark spectroscopy in the  presence of intense magnetic fields and explore the cosmological  consequences of large magnetic fields. They hypothesize that  large magnetic fields may occur in the early universe.  Their  presence could explain how the early universe evolved. The  proposed collaboration takes advantage of complementary expertise  and will advance fundamental understanding of quantum cosmology  and particle physics.  ***",
