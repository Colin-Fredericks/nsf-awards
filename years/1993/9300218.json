 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop comprehensive dynamic and                    thermal models for high speed spindle systems.  The study addresses             the dynamic characteristics of high speed spindle-bearing systems               during operation, including the effects of bearing initial set-up               and geometry, initial preloads, thermal load, external cutting                  force, rotational speed, and bearing spacing, and attempts to                   develop models to predict dynamic compliance and thermal stability.             In addition, advanced bearing designs and materials will be tested              and analyzed, and their performance will be evaluated in comparison             with conventional bearings.  As a final outcome of the project, a               computer aided analysis system for high speed spindles will be                  developed.  This analysis package will provide prediction of                    spindle-bearing dynamic characteristics, bearing contact loads and              temperature rise, which can lead to optimal design and operation                of high speed spindles.                                                              Successful analysis and design of high speed spindles will                 enable easier implementation of high speed machining.  Spindle                  failure is currently a significant problem in high speed machining              practice.",
