 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311928  Hamilton    Darwin offered \"sexual selection\" as an explanation for a wide variety of traits having in  common the paradoxical quality of being apparently detrimental to survival.  He proposed  that such traits have evolved because they give an advantage to the bearer in competing for  or attracting mates.  Sexual selection is now widely regarded to be a major mechanism for  the evolution of differences between the sexes and a potentially important factor in the  evolution of new species.  Yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying sexual  selection, the factors constraining it, or the nature of variation in sexually selected traits.   Mr. Gregory F. Grether's doctoral-dissertation research will address several of these issues  in a model invertebrate system, the rubyspot damselfly.  Mr. Grether has obtained evidence  that the red-pigmented spots at the base of the males' wings are sexually selected.  He now  will conduct a series of experiments to (1) determine the effect of wing-spot variation on  interactions between males, (2) test for female mate preferences, (3) measure ecological costs  of the wing spot in terms of conspicuousness to predators and prey, and (4) investigate the  relationship between wing-spot variation and male quality as assessed by deviations from  bilateral asymmetry.    Mr. Grether has demonstrated outstanding depth of understanding of sexual-selection theory  and has developed an experimental system with the potential to produce unequivocal results  for tests of the theory.",
