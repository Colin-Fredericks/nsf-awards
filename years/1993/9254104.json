 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new course, Environmental Studies (ENS) 110, Methods in                       Environmental Science, is being offered to freshmen and                         sophomores of all majors at Alfred University.  The primary                     emphasis of the course is on introducing students to how                        science is performed by supervising their research as class                     projects in ozone monitoring, geotechnical evaluation , and                     evaluation of discharge and pollution of surface and ground                     waters. Upper level students in Environmental Studies are used                  as mentors in the class to encourage and prepare them for                       future teaching careers.  A graduate student in education also                  assists and receives instruction while practicing teaching in                   science.  The course is specifically designed to overcome many                  contemporary criticisms of science education by assuring that                   students are introduced to science as a process. Students are                   required to  design, conduct, analyze, and present results of                   their own experiments and field work. They learn cooperatively                  by working in groups. Emphasis is also placed on quantitative                   skills by integrating the use of mathematics and computers into                 science.",
