 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at                       Emory University to continue a successful Research                              Experiences for Undergraduates SITE in the broad area of                        Developmental Processes.  Recruitment efforts will focus on                     students at primarily undergraduate institutions and on                         women and minority students in order to encourage                               underrepresented groups to consider careers in science.                         Each year ten students will be invited to participate based                     on academic records, evidence of research potential and                         interest, and recommendations from faculty at their home                        institution.                                                                                                                                                    The program has the following objectives: (1) to provide                        formal and informal introductions to the processes of                           science; (2) To provide an intensive research experience in                     one subdiscipline; (3) To provide perspective by examining                      alternative approaches to processes of development at                           different hierarchical levels; and, (4) To maximize                             participant interaction with other undergraduate and                            graduate researchers, their specific research mentor, and                       his/her research group.                                                                                                                                         Students will select a research mentor and project from the                     following areas: genes and development, cellular                                differentiation, development of behavior, and developmental                     processes in ecology and evolution.  Students will work                         under the direct guidance of one of the 22 participating                        research mentors.  All participants will attend workshops on                    scientific methodology, research design, data analysis and                      interpretation, and scientific communication skills.                            Students will design and conduct an independent project in                      consultation with their mentor.  They will participate in                       weekly progress discussions with other student researchers                      and the project directors.  Each focal area will also have                      weekly lab meetings to discuss project progress.  Students                      will interact with their research mentor, his/her research                      group, including graduate students and technicians, and will                    attend departmental seminars. Each student will present                         his/her project at a research symposium at Emory; a written                     report will be \"published\" in the in-house journal,                             Undergraduate Research at Emory.",
