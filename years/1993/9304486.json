 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Canary's work concerns the relationship between                  the geometry and the topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  In the                past he has explored the consequences of knowing that a                         hyperbolic 3-manifold is topologically tame, i.e. homeomorphic to               the interior of a compact 3-manifold.  In particular, he studied                the spectral geometry and the dynamics of topologically tame                    hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  One application was a proof of Ahlfors'                measure conjecture for topologically tame hyperbolic 3-manifolds.               In this project he intends to study the question of which                       hyperbolic 3-manifolds are topologically tame.  The conjecture is               that every hyperbolic 3-manifold with finitely generated                        fundamental group is topologically tame.  He also intends to                    study the space of all hyperbolic structures on a given                         3-manifold.                                                                          An n-manifold is an object such that about every point there               is a neighborhood which looks like a ball in n-dimensional space.               For example, the unit sphere (in 3-dimensional space) is a                      2-manifold, since about each point there is a small neighborhood                which looks like a disk in the plane.  One natural way in which                 manifolds arise is as solution sets of equations in several                     variables.  For example, the unit sphere is the solution set of a               particularly simple equation (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1).  A metric on                a manifold M is a way of measuring distances between points on M.               A manifold may admit many different metrics.  For example, the                  unit sphere and the surface of an apple are topologically the                   same manifold, but they have different metrics.  Studying the                   types of possible metrics on a manifold has many applications in                mathematics and physics.  The investigator will study metrics on                3-manifolds such that about any point there is a small                          neighborhood which may be identified (by an identification which                preserves distances) with a ball in hyperbolic 3-space.  These                  metrics are called hyperbolic metrics.  Hyperbolic metrics on                   2-manifolds have recently been of great interest to physicists,                 in particular, to string theorists.",
