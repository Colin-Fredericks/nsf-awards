 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines why traditional Islamic schools                     (pensantren) are flourishing rather than declining in the                       face of national development efforts in West Java,                              Indonesia.  The project will test the hypothesis that                           traditional religions in Southeast Asia can both maintain                       their strength and promote development in the modern                            context.  It will also seek to determine what historical,                       economic, political, and socio-cultural factors account for                     the pensantren's ability to grow and address development                        issues without losing their religious distinctiveness.  The                     researcher hypothesizes that it is the flexibility of the                       Sufistic conceptual framework of traditional Islam, coupled                     with the centrality of the pensantren historically to                           Javanese village life, that has enabled the pensantren to                       adapt economic development goals to rural Javanese                              realities.  The project will provide important data on the                      role of religion in economic development.",
