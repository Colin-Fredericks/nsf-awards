 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gray         The rapid evolution of LSI and VLSI digital technologies has  resulted in much wider utilization of digital techniques for  signal processing and control applications than in the past.  As  the level of integration of such systems continues to increase,  it has become more and more desirable to implement the  Analog/Digital (A/D) conversion function on the VLSI control or  signal processing device itself.  Great progress has been made in  the past ten years in the implementation of analog functions of  various types of MOS LSI technology, using NMOS initially, then  CMOS as that technology matured, and most recently BiCMOS  technology.         This research is directed towards new architectures and new  approaches to monolithic A/D conversion which more closely  approach the fundamental limits imposed by the technology used to  implement them.  Topics of emphasis include self-calibration  techniques for high-speed, high resolution pipeline A/D  converters, properties of parallel pipeline, or \"systolic\" A/D  converters, micropower high speed A/D converters using charge  transfer signal processing, optimum decoding algorithms and  stability and scaling in oversampled A/D converters, approaches  to very high speed oversampled A/D converters, and performance  limits for the electromechanical sigma-delta A/D converter used  for readout purposes in sensor applications.",
