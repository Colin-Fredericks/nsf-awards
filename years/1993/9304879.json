For example, geologists are interested in                              describing quantitatively the                                                   3-D form and history of deformed rocks and structures.                          Because of the                                                                  complexities of natural systems, conventional methods for                       such endeavors require                                                          massive computer support and are generally beyond most                          investigators.  This                                                            project seeks to examine the theoretical basis and practical                    implementation of                                                               Bezier tools for structural geology.  Such tools have the                       potential of                                                                    revolutionizing this field because of their computational                       economy, i.e.,                                                                  structures can be described in simpler terms than can                           conventional techniques.                                                        Practical implementation of these tools has been slow,                          however, and has thus not                                                       reached the large pool of potential users, save for                             scientists employed by                                                          well-heeled industrial concerns.  This proposal seeks to                        examine the utility of                                                          Bezier tools for structural geology and to bring these                          methods to the mainstream                                                       through the development of public domain software.",
