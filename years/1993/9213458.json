 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is directed at the optical fiber drawing process               in an effort to improve the quality of the fiber, by reducing the               defects and irregularities generated in the process, and to                     increase the draw speed, by enhancing the cooling rate.  The                    thermal transport and material flow processes associated with the               drawing of optical fiber play a very important role in determining              the quality of the fiber obtained and the optimum draw speed.  A                detailed numerical and experimental study will be performed to                  investigate the effect of the transport phenomena on the quality                of the fiber, particularly on defect generation, and the                        enhancement of the heat transfer rate to increase draw speeds and               reduce distances needed for cooling the fiber to a desired                      temperature level.  The temperature distribution in the material,               the surface profile in the neck down region, heat transfer rates                and material distribution in the process are to be determined                   numerically, using the finite volume approach for the axisymmetric              problem under consideration and employing the experimental results              for the validation of the model and of the numerical scheme.                         The detailed results obtained are expected to contribute to                a better understanding of the basic transport processes involved                and to provide a scientific basis for improving existing                        procedures, impacting on processes such as high speed drawing, low              cost of fiber fabrication, draw induced defect generation, ultra                low loss fiber development, thermally induced phase separation and              crystallization during drawing of non-oxide glasses, residual                   stress generation, etc.",
