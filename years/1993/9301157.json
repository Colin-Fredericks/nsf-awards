 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Voloch to work               in the theory of Diophantine equations.  The study of Diophantine               equations, that is, the search for solutions in integers or                     rational numbers of polynomial equations, is a very classical topic             in number theory.  Much of the recent progress in the subject stems             from insights obtained from the analogous problem when rational                 numbers are replaced by rational functions, the so-called function              field case.  This project will study this last case.  Previous work             of the author has led to general results of a qualitative nature.               It is hoped in this project to obtain quantitative results, leading             to effective bounds that allow one to actually find the solutions               to the equations.                                                                    This is research in the field of number theory.  Number theory             starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                         divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
