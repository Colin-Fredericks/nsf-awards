 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311703  Staiger    With the use and abuse of antidumping law now a central concern  of both multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, it is  especially important to gain as full an understanding as possible  of the impact of existing antidumping laws on the free flow of  trade.  In this project, the determinants and the effects of  antidumping investigations in the United States over the period  1980-1985 are examined.  Rather than focusing primarily on  antidumping duties alone, this research considers antidumping law  more broadly, paying particular attention to the on-going  investigation effects of antidumping procedures on imports and  domestic output, and to whether such effects could be  sufficiently important to encourage filing of petitions that,  absent these effects, would not be worth pursuing.  The project  includes these broader aspects of antidumping law in an effort  both to assess more accurately the determinants and the effects  of antidumping petitions as well as to evaluate several  hypotheses suggested by recent theoretical work on antidumping  law.  A novel aspect of this research will be to disentangle the  effects on imports and domestic output of the various phases of  the antidumping investigation process along the lines suggested  by recent economic theory.    ***",
