Becker of Southern Illinois University               at Carbondale and Professor Tatsuo Miwa of the Institute for                    Applied Optics, Tokyo.  The project involves cross-cultural                     research on computer use in teaching mathematical problem solving               in schools.  The collaboration stems from a U.S.-Japan seminar on               this topic in 1991 and follows major movements in the United States             and Japan to reform mathematics education and incorporate use of                technology (computers and calculators) to enhance the teaching and              learning of mathematics in the classroom.                                                                                                                       The investigators will address the following areas of research:                 the aims of teaching mathematics, software use, curriculum                      development, development of open-ended mathematics problems,                    teacher education, and development of teaching units for cross-                 cultural use in classrooms.  The research continues earlier                     collaboration in studying students' problem solving behaviors in                mathematics.  The award is also supported by funds from the                     Research in Teaching and Learning Program, Division of Research,                Evaluation and Dissemination, Directorate for Education and Human               Resources.",
