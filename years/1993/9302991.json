 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wheeden  9302991       This award continues support for mathematical research into  problems arising in the modern theory of partial differential  equations and singular integral operators.  The form of the  analysis which takes place involves critical inequalities  measuring the power norms of functions with that of their  gradients, especially when the measures are weighted by different  functions.  Such comparisons fall under the heading of Sobolev-  Poincare inequalities.  From such results one obtains upper and  lower bounds for fundamental solutions of divergence form  degenerate parabolic equations in case the degeneracy is time-  dependent and measured in terms of the two weight functions.   Work will be done establishing similar inequalities when the  gradient is replaced by vector fields other than the gradient.  A  second line of investigation concerns Carleson-type estimates for  measuring functions (weighted) in a half-space with their  boundary value norms taken against different weights.  Good, but  incomplete, results have been obtained for harmonic functions.   Efforts will be made to determine the extent that integral  transforms generated by other than the Poisson kernel produce the  same type of inequalities - especially in cases of non-  convolution kernels.  Finally, work is to be done on  characterizing weights which give good bounds on weighted  fractional integrals when compared with the original function  norms.       The measurement of integrals plays a central role in  determining both existence and bounds on solutions of  differential equations. Many of these results involve parameter  bounds which are dependent only on the underlying dimension.   Through careful analysis of the integrals and norms of the  corresponding derivatives one obtains significant information  about the existence and regularity of solutions.  ***",
