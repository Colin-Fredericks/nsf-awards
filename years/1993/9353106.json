 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353106  Grunder  Dr. Anita Grunder will spend six months at the University of  Washington in the Department of Geological Sciences.  She will use  the radiogenic isotope facilities to obtain reconnaissance Nd, Sr,  and Pb isotope date for rhyolites from the northern margin of the  Basin and Range Province in southeastern Oregon.  In conjunction  with ongoing work, these data will provide insight into the nature  of the continental crust and the relationship between rhyolites and  contemporaneous basalts.  Geochemical and thermal/physical aspects  of magmatism will be integrated.  In particular, well-studied and  voluminous middle Tertiary volcanic rocks of eastern Nevada will be  used as a case study.  Chemical models will be refined and tested  using Ghiorso's MELTS computer program and the temporal, volume,  and compositional constraints will be used as input for a thermal  and physical model (with Bergantz) of basalt injection and  progressive melting of the middle crust.    Interactive activities at the host institution include:   teaching  a volcanology course, and organizing a workshop on graduate  education and geoscience careers for undergraduate women (with the  assistance of the Northwest Center for Research in Women).  Dr.  Grunder will also give a lecture on her research, and participate  in faculty meetings.    This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to  provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering  by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers  employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By  encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable  investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.  ***",
