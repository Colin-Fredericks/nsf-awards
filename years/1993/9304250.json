 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop methods of Bayesian statistical  analysis for mixture distributions in studies of mechanisms of  neuronal synaptic activity.  Physiological analysis of synaptic  mechanisms (such as short- or long-term potentiation) is based on  presumptions regarding activity at individual synaptic sites, yet  such individual sites can rarely be analyzed directly.  Thus, to  infer baseline activity and dynamic changes at individual sites  from physiological recordings, statistical/neurophysiological  models have been developed which include the output from multiple  sites and cater for background noise. These models assume that  the recorded cell output represents a random mixture distribution  composed of synaptic signal 'components,' where each 'component'  represents one or more synaptic sites. Bayesian mixture models  and methods of analysis using (uncertain) mixtures of (uncertain  numbers of) components will be explored in this context. This  pilot project will aim to benchmark and validate the novel  Bayesian approaches in the context of experimental data from  synapses with small numbers of neural transmitter sites.  Technically, research will formulate prior distributions for  model parameters based on available synaptic noise data,  physiological evidence, and experimental conditions;  study  simulations to examine operating characteristics and  explore the sensitivity and robustness to prior and model  specifications; derive inferences about physiological parameters;  determine methods of assessment of goodness of fit; make  comparisons with existing and traditional approaches; and develop  computer software development for implementation of the modelling  techniques.    The project represents a collaborative, cross-disciplinary  initiative to develop novel methods for analysis and statistical  inference concerning the mechanisms governing electrochemical  signal transmission at neural junctions in animal nervous  systems. Interaction between the theoretical development  and  physiological data will play a critical role in identifying  and resolving uncertainties about physiological processes and  mechanisms in nervous systems, assessing site to site variability  in neural signals, synaptic output, identifying critical synaptic  characteristics, and assessing changes under differing  experimental and physiological conditions.  The project will  involve substantial analysis of existing and forthcoming  physiological data sets in order to provide assessments of the  validity of the statistical models and the derived inferences  with respect to underlying physiology.  The immediate objective  is to validate the new statistical approaches proposed by  demonstrating their application and improvements over existing  statistical analyses in synaptic response analysis. Ultimately  these methods are expected to contribute to fundamental  understanding of signalling mechanisms in human and other  nervous systems.",
