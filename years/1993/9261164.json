 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beta-Silicon Carbide has been known for many years to have                      excellent theoretical properties for the production of high power               microwave devices.  The combination of its wide bandgap, high                   saturated electron drift velocity, high breakdown electric field,               low dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity give it a                 figure of merit for high power microwave applications that is                   1100 times better than that of silicon and 183 times better than                that of gallium arsenide.                                                                                                                                       The primary advantage of beta silicon carbide is higher carrier                 mobility which, for electrons, has been measured and calculated                 to be high.  Another advantage junction power devices is the                    lower junction barrier because of the smaller bandgap.  Also the                resistance for contacts developed to date are lower for 3 cubic                 structures than for 6 hexagonal structures.  Thus, the beta-form                is more desirable for high frequency, high power applications.                  However, a process for growing high quality boules of beta-                     silicon carbide from which to fabricate wafers and devices has                  not been developed.  It is proposed to evaluate two different                   approaches for growth of beta-silicon carbide single crystal                    boules during Phase I.  Further development of the most promising               process will be the primary Phase II objective.",
