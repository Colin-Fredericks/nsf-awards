One of these programs  is an undergraduate enrichment program in biological sciences at the University of Kentucky.   The other is a minority fellowship program in chemical catalysis at the University of Louisville.    Each program will have at least equal matching funds provided by either the Howard Hughes   Medical Institute, the University of Kentucky, or the University of Louisville.  Each of the  projects is closely related to the research clusters already supported by the NSF/EPSCoR   advanced development grant.  However, they represent a new direction for the clusters as they   are designed to encourage talented undergraduates to seek careers in biological research, and for   minority students to work in the commercially important area of chemical catalysis.",
