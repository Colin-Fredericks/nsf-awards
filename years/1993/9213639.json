 "awd_abstract_narration": "The D/H ratio of non-exchangeable Hydrogen atoms, primarily                bound as Carbon-Hydrogen, in plant materials, has been shown to                 reflect the D/H ratio of the environmental water used by the                    plants.  The D/H ratio of the environmental water, which is                     invariably that of the local precipitation, is directly related to              the temperature at the site of precipitation.  Therefore the D/H                ratio of non-exchangeable hydrogen in plant material can provide                information about past climate conditions.                                                                                                                           A simple equilibration technique that eliminates the lengthy               steps involved in the isolation of carbon bound hydrogen in                     cellulose and at the same time permits the evaluation of the                    isotope fractionation factors of exchangeable hydrogen in cellulose             at any chosen temperature has been developed.  This award will                  allow the extension of this technique to the determination of the               fractionation factors of several organic compounds of biogeologic               interest.  Knowledge of the fractionation factors will enable                   easier and speedier analysis of the D/H ratio of the non-                       exchangeable hydrogen in the compounds that can be isolated from                biologic and geologic systems.  In the geologic context, knowledge              of the D/H ratio of specific compounds will provide information on              the environmental conditions under which a certain compound  was                generated as well as the post-depositional chemistry that might                 have affected it.",
