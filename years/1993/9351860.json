The  goal of the proposed project is to shift the emphasis of the  courses from traditional microbiology toward the molecular  aspects of the discipline.  The need for the shift is clear; in the past 15 years, advances  in molecular technology have revolutionized our approaches to  the study of the biology of microorganisms and the immune  system. It is critical that basic training in microbiology and  immunology, the areas covered by his proposal, includes a well-  grounded exposure of the students to the tools and experimental  methodologies of molecular biology. Curriculum changes will  prepare the students for today's clinical and experimental  microbiology and immunology laboratory and for graduate or  medical education.  The need for curriculum improvement is particularly acute in  Hawaii because of our geographical isolation. The upper  division courses offered by this department are the only  advanced microbiology courses in the state and provide the only  opportunity for Hawaii residents to work at the cutting edge of  the discipline.  ***",
