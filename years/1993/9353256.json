A.     \"Skill Summer Science Camp for American Indian Students\"    The Skill Summer Science Camp Program of the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology  will be a 4-week residential math/science program for American Indian students.  Fifty  American Indian students per summer will be selected from South Dakota's nine Indian  reservations to participate each summer.    The goals of the Skill Summer Science Camp are to provide a foundation for a lifelong interest  in science and mathematics for all participants and to encourage the consideration of SEM as  possible career choices.  Students entering eighth grade will be selected based on their  application and teacher's recommendation/commitment to assist with a Science Fair project.    The curriculum uses a hands-on discovery approach, collaborative learning work groups and  interdisciplinary curriculum.  The disciplinary focus is on \"Mathematical Problem Solving in  Physics\" with Dr. Jack Weyland.           Basic Skills         Research             Careers        Mathematical Problem        Science Fair         Robotics    Solving in Physics        Project Development  Career Seminars  Computer Labs                                    Geology/Paleontology    Communications    Math Applications      In order to provide intensive role model/mentor experiences, the program staff/faculty includes  over 19 SDSM&T faculty and AISES students, and tribal school/college faculty to work with  the SSC students.    Evening programs will include astronomy, Project Wild (environmental activities from the  Game, Fish and Parks Dept.), field trips and cultural activities.  parents will be invited to  participate in the Family Math programs each week as well as the geology field trip, science fair  and graduation.    School year follow-up will include: bi-monthly newsletters, invitations to Saturday seminars, and  a Skill SSC Alumni Reunion during the Hi gh plains Regional Science Fair.",
