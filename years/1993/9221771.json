 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research is to                     develop a reliable and sensitive push-pull perfusion technique to               examine the physiological mechanisms of naturally-induced                       infertility in female Callitrichid Monkeys.  Many species of                    these primates are highly endangered.  In their specialized                     social system, subordinate females in groups in the wild and in                 the laboratory are kept infertile.  Ovulation in subordinate                    females is suppressed while these females remain in the presence                of a dominant female and help raise their offspring.  Dr. Abbott                has demonstrated that the physiological mechanism maintaining the               infertile state of these subordinate females resides within the                 hypothalamic region of the brain.  He will now develop a                        sophisticated technical procedure to measure neurotransmitters                  and hypothalamic hormones in the hypothalamus.  The results will                lead to a better understanding of how the social environment                    engages specific neural mechanisms to regulate female fertility.                This could provide a better foundation for the development of                   reproductive techniques to accelerate the breeding of these rare                monkeys in captivity and to improve the planning and management                 of re-introduction programs as well as improve the management of                the remaining small number of monkeys living in the wilds of                    South American.",
