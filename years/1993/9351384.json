Fission-track dating involves  determining the density of fossil tracks that have occurred  naturally over time in either zircon or apatite crystals.   Additionally, however, one needs to determine the amount of  uranium in the crystal because track density is proportional to  age and uranium concentration.  This is accomplished by placing  a mica flake over the sample and irradiating the sample to  produce spontaneous tracks; the density of spontaneous tracks  on the mica flake is proportional to the uranium concentration.   The automated stage quickly and precisely moves the microscope  stage with an absolute accuracy of  10  m.  Given this  considerable time savings and ease of use, we are introducing  fission-track dating into our Geochemistry classes with  projects in which students date prepared samples and interpret  their significance.  Additionally, the system is being used  extensively in our senior thesis program.  ***y",
