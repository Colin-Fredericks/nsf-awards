 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302057  Book  This continuing research project has investigated foundational  issues in the theory of computation with emphasis on structural  complexity theory.  The study of the structure of complexity  classes, reducibilities, and complete sets is part of the effort  to develop a theory of resource-bounded reducibilities as an  important portion of a more general theory of computational  complexity.  The research proposed here is based on the  assumption that the notion of randomness is a potentially useful  tool to learn about complexity theory.  To a large extent the  research is directed toward learning about unrelativized  complexity classes (e.g., P, NP, PSPACE) by studying  reducibilities computed in various ways and by studying  properties of complexity classes specified by resource-bounded  oracle machines.  The amount of information that an oracle set  can make available in a computation of an oracle machine appears  to depend on the amount of information encoded in the set, the  method of coding and decoding, the type of question that an  oracle machine may ask, and the amount of computational power  needed to generate the appropriate queries (e.g., does the  ability to use more time allow for the generation of more useful  queries?).    There has been a growing interest in probabilistic algorithms (or  machines) and randomness.  Probabilistic machines incorporate  randomness into their underlying logic, so that randomization is  part of the internal calculation.  Just as in the case of non  deterministic machines, there are problems which probabilistic  algorithms can solve much faster than is known to be possible by  deterministic algorithms.  Hence, these concepts have received a  great deal of attention in computational complexity theory.  The  research proposed here presupposes that randomness is a useful  tool with which to study complexity theory and is based on a  collection of results that focus on properties of complexity  classes specified by random oracles; these result s lead very  naturally to similar questions about complexity classes specified  by pseudo random oracles.  ***",
