 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many human diseases and also many biologically interesting                 and economically important traits in higher organisms and farm                  animals and plants are controlled by multiple genes.  Genetic                   dissection and mapping of these genes on chromosomes have always                been an important aim of quantitative genetics as it could lead                 to a better understanding of the structure of polygenic systems                 and also to identification of major chromosome regions for                      further genetic study, genetic engineering or selection.  To map                quantitative trait loci (QTLs) accurately, a complete linkage map               is necessary and is now made possible with the rapid advance of                 recombinant DNA technology.                                                          There have been many statistical methods proposed for                      mapping QTLs, notably the interval mapping method proposed by                   Lander and Botstein, but none of them has taken a full use of                   complete linkage map information on mapping QTLs.  This project                 proposes to study an alternative mapping strategy which combines                the interval mapping with an interval test.  This method will be                able to test for a QTL on a marker interval independent of the                  effects of QTLs at other regions of chromosomes and thus will be                asymptotically unbiased.  Also by using a general linear model,                 the whole map information will be used simultaneously in making                 statistical inferences about locations and effects of QTLs and                  the efficiency of the test will be increased.                                        This project also proposes to study a more general polygenic               mutation model for the study of evolution of quantitative traits.               With this model the expected genetic variances within and between               finite populations and the response of populations to selection                 with reference to molecular evolution will be studied.//",
