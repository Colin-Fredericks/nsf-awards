 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chaetetids, the major framebuilders of Middle                              Carboniferous reef mounds, are poorly understood                                biologically.  Recent recognition that chaetetids are                           coralline demosponges provides a sound basis for better                         understanding this simple poorly studied group.  Improving                      our knowledge of these builders of reef mounds, known                           hydrocarbon reservoirs of the Carboniferous, has useful                         economic implications, as well as basic scientific value.                            Coralline demosponges with a chaetetid-grade skeleton                      are now known to be polyphyletic.  Thus, it is necessary to                     reevaluate and revise their classification by studying                          calicle morphology.  This study will address:  (1)                              taphonomic (diagenetic) alteration, (2) \"astogeny\" (3)                          possible polymorphism, (4) ecophenotypic plasticity, and (5)                    the relationship between calicle morphology and the primary                     and secondary skeletons in the three basic growth forms.                        Other morphological features, such as the spacing and                           frequency of tabulae, will also be addressed.                                        Morphometric analysis of data obtained from strained                       and unstained thin sections and acetate peels will be the                       principal method employed, combined with available detailed                     ecological data to determine the relative importance of  the                    five points noted above.                                                             Integration of information obtained will aid in:  (1)                      establishing a viable taxonomy, (2) understanding the demise                    of chaetetid-grade demosponges at the Westphalian-Stephanian                    boundary and their pantropical distribution , (3)                               understanding the reefal occurrences of Carboniferous                           chaetetid-grade demosponges, and (4) evaluating the possible                    relationship between chaetetids and algal symbionts.",
