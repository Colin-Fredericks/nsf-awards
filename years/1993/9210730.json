Once                      established, the database will be made available to other                       investigators.  The interest in speech errors has grown                         enormously among linguists, psychologists, neuropsychologists,                  and neurologists in their attempts to understand how linguistic                 knowledge is represented in the mind, how it is accessed in                     behavior, and the neurological basis for such representation and                processing.  Many individual collections are now in existence                   consisting of over 25,000 errors.  Except for published examples,               there has been no away of sharing these data; this project hopes                to correct this problem by starting a database with the UCLA                    Speech Error Corpus of over 15,000 items and the corpora                        collected by Merrill Garrett (University of Arizona) and Stefanie               Shattuck-Hufnagel (MIT), as well as a large corpus of aphasia                   errors collected by the Principal Investigator and/or published                 in the literature.",
