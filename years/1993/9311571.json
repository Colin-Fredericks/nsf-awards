 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311571  Mitman  In the 19th century, the gun was an indispensable part of natural  history.  By the early 20th century, the careers of many young  naturalists were shaped by the camera instead.  Film rapidly and  readily became a methodological tool among scientific disciplines  that had relied primarily on field practices of observation and  description, and transported natural history disciplines, such as  animal behavior, into highly mediated spaces of 20th century  experimental life sciences.  Film served as an important bridge  between natural history and experimental biology.  On the one hand,  it could accommodate the realism so central to the practices of the  museum diorama and the study of nature in the wild.  On the other  hand, it enabled the biologist to use the more interventionist  techniques of the laboratory:  now movements and behaviors were  recorded on a medium that could be slowed down, analyzed, spliced  and edited.  However, unlike other technologies that were created  and developed specifically for scientists in labs, film had its  primary function, namely, its utility as an art and entertainment  form, defined outside the cultural domain of science.  Scientists  in using film could not escape its entertainment role.  Hollywood  had overridingly defined the terms by which the media could be  utilized, seen, and understood, and no one who partook in this  technology could evade its influence.  Research films on wildlife  behavior often incorporated elements of drama and popular  spectacle, thus highlighting the permeability of boundaries between  scientific and popular culture.    Dr. Mitman is continuing his exploration of the study and  representation of animals as scientific and popular spectacle  through a focus on natural history and animal behavior films.  The  study begins with the 1920s travelogue tradition.  An important  function of the natural history film for the spectator in cities is  the recreation of the animal's natural habitat.  However, the  importance  of film for the research scientist served different  ends.  Within the science of animal behavior, nature on screen  provided an important methodological means for the dissection and  analysis of nature in the field.  From the travelogue tradition,  this project then moves into the area of experimental practice to  examine how film helped orient and shape the filed of animal  behavior studies.  The project ends with an analysis of how animals  as scientific spectacle became appropriated and transformed by  1950s American public culture, as evidence by the success of  tourist attractions like Marineland and the popularity of  television series and films such as \"Adventure,\" \"Zoo Parade,\" and  Disney's \"True-Life Adventures,\"  seen by millions of families in  the comforts of their homes.  Throughout, the project challenges a  diffusionist model of science popularization and points  historically to the ways in which the visual aesthetic of film has  profoundly shaped public understanding and expectations of animals  in their natural environments.  ***",
