It was                                   organized by Michael Doyle, Trinity University                                  and Dr, Mark Vol'pinm Boreskov Institute of                                     Catalysis, Novosibirsk, Russia, after a                                         delegation of chemists visited Russia in the Fall                               of 1992.                                                                                                                                                        The subjects for the workshop are of critical                                   scientific significance in both countries;                                      opportunities for mutual cooperation and                                        collaboration in these areas are substantial.                                   Twelve participants from each country will                                      discuss the present status of basic research as                                 well as the future needs for industrial                                         development, linkage and cooperation.  There will                               be further contact with US chemists when the FSU                                participants attend the American Chemical Society                               meeting following the workshop.                                                                                                                                 This workshop in organometallic chemistry and                                   catalysis fulfills the program objectives of                                    advancing science by enabling leading experts in                                the US and Russia to combine complementary                                      talents and pool ideas in the areas of strong                                   mutual interest and competence.",
