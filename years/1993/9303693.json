 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant unresolved problem in cell biology is understanding             how cytoplasmically synthesized proteins are targeted to the                    various compartments of eukaryotic cells.  In plant cells,                      chloroplasts offer an excellent system for studying this problem.               Most chloroplastic proteins are encoded in the nucleus and                      synthesized in the cytoplasm as higher molecular weight precursors.             These precursors are imported postranslationally into chloroplasts              across the two envelope membranes and are subsequently directed to              the proper location within the organelle.  The long term goal of                this project is to understand how the import process occurs.  At                the present time, the major barrier to gaining a more detailed                  understanding of protein transport into chloroplasts is a lack of               information regarding the identity of transport intermediates.  The             basic strategy of the project will be to block protein transport at             specific stages, thereby generating translocation intermediates                 containing precursors at discrete points in the transport process.              Cross-linking reagents will be used to identify transport                       components that are in close physical proximity to the trapped                  intermediates.  As putative components are identified, further work             will be required to confirm their involvement in transport and to               determine their function during the transport process.  To                      accomplish these objectives, specific antibodies directed against               each putative component will be prepared and cDNA clones encoding               each component will be isolated and sequenced.  These antibodies                and CDNA clones will be valuable tools for investigating the                    functions of the putative components.                                           %%%                                                                             This work is significant for at least two reasons.  First, it adds              to the general understanding of a basic cellular process, i.e.                  intracellular protein trafficking.  Second, it has practical                    significance for efforts to alter the metabolic pathways of                     chloroplasts using genetic engineering techniques, in which foreign             proteins will need to be directed into chloroplasts.",
