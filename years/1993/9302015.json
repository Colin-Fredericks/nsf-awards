The program's                                    awards provide opportunities for joint                                          research, and the use of unique or                                              complementary facilities, expertise and                                         experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Deborah                                      Eastman to the Institute of Molecular Biology                                   and Biotechnology, Crete to work                                                with Dr. Christos Delidakis.                                                                                                                                    Their research will focus on the role of the                                    neurogenic Enhancer of Split \u0131E(spl)! gene                                      products during embryonic neurogenesis.                                         These genes code for proteins with a conserved                                  Helix-Loop-Helix motif, which makes them                                        members of a family of proteins that                                            regulate transcription.  Dr. Delidakis has                                      focused on elucidating the role of the E(spl)                                   HLH proteins in the lateral inhibition                                          during embryonic neurogenesis and in later                                      developmental events.  Dr. Eastman will focus                                   on several of the E(spl) HLH proteins.                                          Her main objective will be to biochemically                                     characterize them in order to determine their                                   function and to determine the regulation                                        of that function by other neurogenic gene                                       products in the signalling pathway.  These                                      characterization studies will begin by                                          determining whether these proteins bind DNA.                                    DNA binding activity will be assayed and                                        specific DNA binding sites will be                                              determined.  Putative DNA binding sites will be                                 sequenced and genes downstream of these sites                                   will be cloned and sequenced.  It will also be                                  determined whether other proteins are complexed                                 with specific E(spl) HLH proteins and if                                        disruption of these complexes affects DNA                                       binding.  Additionally, a genetic screen will                                   be performed to detect other gene products                                      which may interact with the E(spl) HLH                                          proteins.                                                                       The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel and a stipend for                                    twelve months.",
