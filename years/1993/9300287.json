 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to The University of Minnesota to                   continue the summer program of undergraduate research experiences               in the behavioral sciences established in 1987.  The ten-week                   program will emphasize student participation in the research                    activities of faculty affiliated with the Center for Research in                Learning Perception and Cognition.  Eleven undergraduates will                  participate, about two thirds from smaller liberal arts colleges                and universities and one-third from the University of Minnesota.                Students will: (1) assist with their faculty mentor's research,                 working as a member of their research team, (2) complete a research             project including a written report and presentation to peers and                participating faculty, and (3) participate in a multidisciplinary               seminar.  The program will therefore include opportunities for                  students to learn specific research methods, to apply these methods             in the context of their own research, and to examine broad                      conceptual and methodological issues relating to psychology and the             cognitive sciences.  Participation in special social/cultural                   events as well as common housing in a University dorm will help                 foster a strong community of students.                                                                                                                          This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to                attract talented students into careers in science through active                undergraduate research experiences.",
