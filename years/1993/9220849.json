 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine the environmentally-induced                        flexibility in the life history of the sailfin molly.  It is                    obvious that almost any animal's life history is malleable by                   environmental effects such as temperature or food level.                        However, two aspects of that malleability are not well                          understood.  First, there is increasing evidence that the pattern               of environmental sensitivity varies among different populations                 of the same species.  Second, it is unclear whether natural                     selection has molded those different patterns of sensitivity and,               if it has, how it has done so.  These two basic questions will be               addressed by this research.                                                          There are several ways in which the lessons from this study                may be applied to other problems.  First, conservation biology is               focusing increasingly on how to restore viable populations of a                 species to an area from which it has been extirpated.  This work                will help document how \"interchangeable\" are individuals from                   different populations of the same species and thereby whether it                is ever advisable to draw colonists from a population elsewhere                 in the species' range.  Second, one of the major aspects of life                history of this fish is its accrual and use of fat stores.  This                work will examine the genetic and environmental control of fat                  accrual and may lead to the use of fish models instead of mice as               a less expensive system for studying some aspects of the control                of fat metabolism.//",
