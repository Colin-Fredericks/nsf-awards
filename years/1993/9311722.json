A distributed transfer function approach is used in the analysis for prediction of system response. The passive impedance of the distributed guide is based upon an impact pair model. the coupled mechanical system, consisting of the guide and the chain, is modeled as an assembly of subsystems. An active control, strategy applied at the boundary of the guide system is used to suppress the vibration generated during high speed motion. The robustness of the active controller at different loading conditions is also investigated. The results of this research provide useful guidelines for optimization of high-speed axially moving mechanical systems in general, and guided chain systems in particular.  0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 09311722  Tan    This project deals with the dynamic response of coupled guide/chain drive systems commonly employed for transmit    C   E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        E                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                !         !
