The conference is under the auspices of the Federation of the  American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB).  The format of  this meeting will be the same as that used by the Gordon Research  Conferences.  There will be nine major sessions with 36 invited  speakers.  The chairperson of each session will give an  introductory talk on the historical background and the current  problems to acquaint all participants with the topics in that  session.  Poster sessions will be held throughout the meeting.   Informal workshops of small groups will be arranged before or at  the meeting.  Topics will cover a broad range of organisms from  mammalian cells to bacteria.  Both in vivo and in vitro approaches  will be presented.  This conference is the only regularly scheduled  meeting in the United States that is devoted exclusively to genetic  recombination and genome rearrangements.  The topics to be covered  at this meeting are current approaches to gene therapy, genome  rearrangements that lead to cancer and other diseases, problems in  linkage analysis, genetics of homologous recombination, enzymology  of homologous recombination (strand transferases, nucleases, and  resolvases), physical structure of recombination intermediates,  repair of mismatch sites in heteroduplex recombination  intermediates, site-specific recombination and regulation of gene  expression, and bacterial and eukaryotic transposition.  %%%  This meeting provides a crucial interface between scientists  interested in the basic mechanistic aspects of recombination and  those interested in practical applications, such as gene therapy,  creation of animal models of disease, and remodeling of genomes to  test functional alterations of gene regulatory sequences.  ***",
