 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brachiopods are fascinating but poorly understood bivalved                 marine animals.  They look similar to clams, at least externally,               but are only distantly related in a genealogical sense.  Even                   though brachiopods are not commonly found along seashores today,                except in parts of New Zealand and Australia, they were common and              diverse over 250 million years ago in the Paleozoic Era and were                important elements of the Paleozoic marine biota.  For this reason,             paleontologists are interested in learning about aspects of their               ecology, morphology, growth and behavior, and their temporal and                geographic distribution, in part to understand their decline and                near extinction.  Dr. Sandra Carlson of the University of                       California at Davis is studying the spire-bearing articulate                    brachiopods, those bearing distinctive structures inside their                  valves that look much like two cone-shaped springs and that are                 involved in obtaining food and oxygen and in reproductive                       behaviors.                                                                           The current classification of these organisms suggests that                these structures have evolved only once, but preliminary work by                Dr. Carlson indicates that is not likely the case.  If spire-                   bearing brachiopods have evolved several times, then placing them               together in a single taxonomic group confuses their evolutionary                history and constrains work on ecological factors responsible for               spire evolution.  Study of other morphological features of the                  fossil and extant organisms will help improve the classification                and phylogeny of brachiopods, and help in understanding their                   geological rise and fall in the Paleozoic.",
