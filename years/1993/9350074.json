 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compact objects (neutron stars and black holes) are known                       principally from the effects of mass transfer onto them, thus the               understanding of mass transfer and its consequences are fundamental             to our understanding of many aspects of the final stages of stellar             evolution.  Dr. Vrtilek will use a set of narrow spectral features              in the X-ray, ultraviolet, and visible, selected because they                   provide important diagnostics of plasma conditions, to study mass               transfer processes and accretion disk structure in X-ray binaries.              Emphasis on multiwavelength spectral analysis is important as                   binary X-ray sources are strong emitters over a broad range of the              electromagnetic spectrum with each part of the spectrum                         contributing distinct and often time-variable information.                      Recently developed theoretical models that predict the                          characteristics of line emission over the range from the Hell                   recombination line at \\4686m to the iron K-shell emission between               6-7 keV will be tested against the observations.  This work relies              on a balanced mix of existing data, approved observations with                  currently operating spacecraft, and detailed plans for the use of               future missions.                                                                                                                                                Interactive activities at the host institution include teaching a               graduate course in X-ray astronomy, a field not currently                       represented on the faculty of the host institution.  Dr. Vrtilek                will also organize a series of guest lectures, drawing upon experts             who will discuss the programs and functions of other area                       institutions, supplemented by lectures on techniques of scientific              presentation, proposal preparation, and other \"survival skills\" for             graduate students.  A workshop on careers in the physical sciences              will be held for area high school students, particularly women and              minorities.                                                                                                                                                     This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
