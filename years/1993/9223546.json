 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of the structure, growth behavior; and properties of                    selected metal surface, interfaces, overlayers, quantum wells,                  multilayers, and superlattices is proposed.  The purpose is to                  obtain a fundamental understanding of the scientific principles                 that govern the crystalline form, chemical composition, and                     electronic properties of metal epitaxial systems and quantum                    structures.  The experimental techniques to be employed include                 (angle-resolved) synchrotron photoemission, Auger spectroscopy,                 electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy and                         spectroscopy, and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction.  Samples                 will be prepared and fabricated using standard ultrahigh vacuum                 techniques as well as molecular beam epitaxy and chamical vapor                 deposition.  The work will include investigation of bulk and                    surface band structure, coherence and scattering lengths, and                   spatial distributions of electronic states; adsorption geometry,                cluster and island formation, and film growth behavior; evolution               of surface, interface, and quantum-well states as a function of                 sample structure; atomic structure of buried interfaces; coupling               between quantum wells; and phenomena pertaining to superlattices                and multilayer structures.                                                      %%%                                                                             Artificial structures made of stacks of thin layers can exhibit                 interesting and potentially useful electronic properties.  Using                state-of-the-art techniques for materials synthesis, it is now                  possible to fabricate layer configurations with layer thicknesses               approaching the atomic dimension.  In such systems, electrons can               become trapped, reflected, or refracted by the boudaries between                layers.  Because these happen on an atomic scale, substantial                   modifications of the electronic properties can be achieved by                   tailoring the structure.  This research project will employ a                   variety of experimental techniques to address the basic questions               concerning the growth and characterization of various layer                     configurations, and the relationships between the atomic structure              and the electronic properties.  Part of the work will be carried                out at the Synchrotron Radiation Center at Madison, Wisconsin                   and the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven                     National Laboratory.  This research involves a cooperation between              work supported by the National Science Foundation and the                       Department of Energy.",
