 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic summer poses a number of problems for migratory birds                that exploit the rich productivity of the tundra for reproduction.              The breeding period is so brief that the time required for the                  establishment of a territory, pair bonding and courtship may be                 truncated into a few days or even hours. Birds must arrive early to             begin nesting so that the young are produced while conditions are               still favorable for their survival. Frequently, weather conditions              in the Arctic spring are severe, resulting in serious metabolic                 problems not only for the onset of breeding but even for survival.              This research will elucidate the mechanisms by which Arctic birds               resist the rigors of the Arctic summer. Among the questions                     addressed are why there is variation in the adrenocortical                      responsiveness to stress both among and within species, whether                 this is related to behavioral effects of stress hormones such as                corticosterone and the distribution of receptors in neural tissue,              and whether the variability is regulated by photoperiod through the             action of gonadal hormones. Additionally, the hormonal basis of                 variation in breeding strategy will be explored in the                          white-crowned sparrow that shows spatial opportunism on arrival and             then defends neither a territory nor a nest site; and in the snow               bunting that shows an intermediate strategy and defends a nest site             at least during egg-laying, but does not appear to be territorial               later in the season. Comparisons of these species, and receptor                 distributions for steroid hormones in the brain will shed new light             on the diversity of hormone-behavior adaptations in Arctic birds,               and will have considerable significance for the regulation of                   reproductive processes of vertebrates in general. Both of these                 objectives are alligned with program goals for Polar Biology and                Medicine.",
