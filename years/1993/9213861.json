 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Bulgaria research project between Dr. J. Wayne Rabalais               and Dr. S. S. Todorov of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences will                 study the mechanism of low energy ion beam deposition (IBD) of                  artificially structured materials.  The focus is the fundamental ion-           surface interactions, including the influence of substrate structure,           defects, diffusion, annihilation, and temperature along with ion                energy, type, and charge.  Deposition of two-component films will               be studied by using a new, unique, pulsed, dual-beam, mass-                     selected ion beam deposition system.  The films will be                         characterized in situ by electron spectroscopy and ion scattering               and ex situ by XRD, TEM, RBS, and Raman.  The objectives are                    to determine the mechanism of ion beam synthesis of epitaxial and               ordered structures and new materials with interesting electrical                and/or mechanical properties.  The goal is to understand and                    control ion beam processes for low temperature synthesis of new                 multicomponent materials and metastable solids.  This work should               lead to an improvement of our fundamental understanding of film                 growth processes that occur during deposition of hyperthermal                   species and the resulting film structure and properties.                                                                                                        This project in materials science fulfills the program objective of             advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                       talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and               competence.",
