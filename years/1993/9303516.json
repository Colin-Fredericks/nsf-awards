 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program supports research on aromatic metallacycles by Dr. John                 R. Bleeke, Department of Chemistry, Washington University.                      Late transition metals, such as Ir, Os, Rh, and Pt, would be                    incorporated into carbon rings of various sizes to form                         compounds with aromatic character.  Other heteroatoms, such as                  oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus, would also be included                 in the rings to form a wide variety of compounds of a                           fundamentally new type.  Using methodology developed to                         synthesize \"iridabenzene\", compounds such as metallapyridine                    and metallafuran would be prepared.  The reactivity of the                      metallabenzenes would be explored, including their behavior in                  cycloaddition reactions and electrophilic and nucleophilic                      substitution reactions.  Synthesis of larger pi-systems would                   be attempted.  Calculational modeling would be used to                          interpret the degree of aromaticity in the compounds, to help                   understand their electronic and magnetic properties, and to                     predict their reactivity.                                                       %%%                                                                             Aromatic compounds predominantly formed by rings of carbon                      atoms form a large class of organic compounds.  In this study,                  Dr. Bleeke will synthesize analogous compounds in which carbon                  is replaced by a metal.  The extended bonding systems                           characteristic of aromatic compounds would be maintained, but                   altered.  Bleeke will determine the new bonding and reactivity                  characteristics of these compounds.  In addition, he will                       attempt to prepare other analogous compounds in which oxygen,                   phosphorus, and sulfur are also included in the rings, and to                   make larger aromatic compounds of this type.  The results of                    this fundamental study may be helpful to researchers attempting                 to construct conducting or semiconducting polymers which                        contain both metals and organic portions.",
