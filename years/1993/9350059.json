 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop an understanding of the growth of                    interest groups in the fifty states and how such growth differs                 across states.  This will be developed by constructing and applying             a theory of interest group formation.  The theory, developed in                 preliminary work, connects the development of interest group                    systems at the state level with the formation of individual groups              at the micro level.  An existing data base will be disaggregated                and further analyzed.  A mail survey and interviews of groups in                selected states will be conducted.  The results of these studies                will be combined with earlier results into a book.  The book will               finish a complete description of interest group proliferation at                the state level, a theoretical account of variation in group                    growth, and will address normative concerns about groups' influence             on democracy.                                                                                                                                                   Interactive activities at the host institution include teaching a               graduate course on state public policy and interest groups.  Dr.                Gray will give several public lectures on her research, including               her prior research on women and politics, and she will participate              in several campus women's organizations.                                                                                                                        This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing grater visibility for women scientists and engineers               employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging in the participation of women in science, it is a                   valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality",
