 "awd_abstract_narration": "Functional analysis is one of the most important directions                in the mathematics of the twentieth century.  Many mathematicians               in the United States and other countries are involved in research               in this area, and conferences are frequently organized on many                  aspects of functional analysis and its applications.  We propose                to organize a very special conference, entitled \"Functional                     Analysis on the Eve of the Twenty-First Century,\" at Rutgers                    University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, from October 24 to October               27, 1993.  The aim will be to focus on new directions of the                    subject, directions which can be expected to define the                         development of much of the subject for many years.                              Correspondingly, we plan to invite as speakers leading experts in               topics connected with new directions in functional analysis.  We                plan to include as an essential part of the participants young                  mathematicians who are beginning their research activity, with                  the intention of providing some guidance which will be of value                 throughout their scientific life.  We expect that the lively                    discussion of ideas among participants with many different                      orientations will prove to be one of most important features of                 the conference.  A special stimulus for planning this conference                is the eightieth birthday of Israel Moiseyevich Gelfand, who has                played a crucial role in the development of functional analysis                 during the last half-century, and who is now at Rutgers                         University.",
