 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308105  Pearson  The focus of this research is the development of new methods  for carbon-carbon bond formation using a variety of organoiron  complexes. There are four specific aspects of organoiron  chemistry that will be studied. The first aspect investigates  new protocols for the generation of free radicals from  dienyliron complexes and their intramolecular coupling with  pendant olefinic groups to form carbocyclic ring systems. This  represents the first application of organometallic free  radicals in synthetically useful processes. The second aspect  studies extensions and applications of iron-promoted  carbonylative annulation of diynes and enynes for formation of  cyclopentadienoneiron complexes and cyclopentenones. The third  area explores intramolecular carbon nucleophile additions to  cyclohexadienyliron cations to provide important new methods  for the construction of densely functionalized molecules. The  final aspect exploits the ability of an organoiron moiety to  control stereochemistry during multiple functionalization of  eight-membered rings, which are traditionally difficult to  handle; the use of organometallic chemistry provides solutions  to problems of conformational and stereochemical control.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research of Dr. Anthony J. Pearson of the Department of  Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University. Professor Pearson  will focus his work in the area of synthetic methodology  developing new methods for carbon-carbon bond formation using a  variety of organoiron complexes.  ***",
