 "awd_abstract_narration": "The colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), encoded by the               proto-oncogene c-fms, is a tyrosine kinase receptor which modulates             macrophage growth and metabolism.  This investigator is interested              in the mechanisms that regulate receptor function.  This project                focuses on the regulation of this growth factor receptor by                     phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of serines and threonines. The                goal of the planning period to be supported by this grant is to set             up an experimental system for the identification of sites of serine             phosphorylation in the C-terminus of this receptor.  The first                  objective is to construct a C-terminal truncation mutant by site-               directed mutagenesis, express the mutant receptor in myeloid 32D                cells and then confirm the presence or absence of C-terminal                    phosphorylation by 2D thin layer tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of              immunoprecipitated CSF-1R.  A complementary strategy will be to                 synthesize the C-terminal domain as a bacterial fusion protein and              to utilize the fragment in an in vitro kinase assay that contains               preparations of either candidate serine/threonine kinases or                    unfractionated cellular extracts.  Following, serine to alanine                 mutants that cover the entire C-terminus will be constructed to                 pinpoint the actual sites of phosphorylation.  The phenotypes of                these serine mutants will be studied in terms of effects on                     receptor tyrosine kinase activity, down-regulation and                          desensitization, interaction with intracellular substrates and                  growth potential.  Work will also be initiated to identify the                  responsible serine/threonine kinase.  The second objective of the               planning period is to begin studies that explore reciprocal                     mechanisms involving serine/threonine phosphorylation which may                 regulate the interactions between CSF-1R and the platelet-derived               growth factor receptor in 3T3 fibroblasts and between CSF-1R and                the interleukin-3 receptor in 32D cells.                                        %%%                                                                             The phosphorylation of the amino acids serine and threonine is                  likely to represent an important regulatory mechanism for certain               classes of growth factor receptors.  This award will provide start-             up support for a beginning investigator undertaking research in                 this important area.",
