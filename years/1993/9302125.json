 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen sulfide in oxic seawater can be found as uncomplexed                   dissolved species (\"free sulfide. H2S+HS+S2), as dissolved metal                sulfide complexes (\"complexed sulfide\"), and as particulate metal               sulfides.  The biogeochemical cycle of sulfide species in the                   surface ocean includes sea-air exchange, reactions with trace                   metals, production via carbonyl sulfide (OCS) hydrolysis and                    emissions from phytoplankton, and removal via oxidation and                     particle sinking.  In this fashion, an understanding  of the                    cycling of OCS and hydrogen sulfide species is relevant to the                  global sulfur cycle and to the cycling of trace metals.  Analytical             methods have been developed to determine OCS and hydrogen  sulfide              speciation (uncomplexed/complexed; particulate/dissolved) at                    picomolar concentrations, the rate of OCS hydrolysis in seawater                has been measured, and  phytoplankton has been identified as                    important sources of dissolved and particulate sulfide in the                   surface ocean.  This research will quantify the remaining portions              of the hydrogen sulfide cycle, with the specific objectives being               (1) to determine the formation constants of sulfide complexes with              Cd, Ni, and Zn, and use these in thermodynamic complexation models              to help elucidate the chemical speciation of dissolved sulfide; (2)             to determine the rate of oxidation of uncomplexed sulfide by                    iodate; (3) to measure the flux of particulate sulfide production               by phytoplankton; (4) to quantify the rates of total dissolved and              particulate sulfide production by phytoplankton; (5) to evaluate                whether OCS, a precursor of uncomplexed sulfide and a radiatively               important gas, can be produced during the regeneration of                       particulate organic matter.",
