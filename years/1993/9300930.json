 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300930  Wets       The unifying theme of this research is the epi-convergence  of  integral functionals as they arise in variational problems,  in particular stochastic optimization, i.e., problems involving  random integral functionals.  The P.I. has identified the  following questions that will be investigated: the preservation  of epi-convergence under addition and epi-addition, the epi-  convergence of integral functions with discontinuous integrands,  the development of a quantitative theory for the convergence of  integral functionals.  In the case of random integral  functionals, the P.I. will develop epi-consistency results for  random lower semicontinuous functions with and without the epi-  iid assumption, design implementable procedures to estimate the   reliability level of approximate solutions and exploit the theory  of large deviations to obtain convergence rates.  %%%       Optimization problems (such as the allocation of scare  resources, optimal engineering design, planning of logistic  support operations, etc.) cannot be solved without resorting to  approximations.  To validate an approximation scheme one should  demonstrate that a refinement of the approximation yields a  better solution (convergence questions) and, whenever possible,  allows for the calculation of error bounds so that one can have  an estimate of the error that may occur (convergence rate).  The  P.I. plans to investigate such questions, in particular in  connection with so-called stochastic optimization problems (that  model decision making under uncertainty) a class of problems that  is very difficult to solve, but are very important as far as  applications are concerned.  ***",
