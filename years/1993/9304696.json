 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed towards the study of infinite                     dimensional balanced realizations, both from the point of view of               improving the basic understanding of these realizations and of                  providing further tools for model reductions of infinite                        dimensional systems. The project will focus on the specific                     questions of asymptotic and exponential stability of the balanced               systems and the boundedness properties of the system operators. A               further important point which will be addressed is the issue of                 whether general Trotter-Kato type convergence results can                       be proved for the balanced approximation scheme.                                     Many engineering systems, such as highly flexible                          mechanical systems, inherently contain infinitely many degrees of               freedom and therefore any accurate mathematical description of                  such a system must necessarily be infinite dimensional. There                   are several ways to achieve such a mathematical description.                    One recent approach is based on models of finite complexity.                    This method of \"balanced realizations\" has proved very successful               in practice.",
