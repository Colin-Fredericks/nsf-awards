 "awd_abstract_narration": "True toads of the large family Bufonidae are a rich resource               for studying pattern and process in species diversification, but                the potential cannot be realized without an understanding of the                phylogenetic relationships among the family's members.  There is no             robust phylogenetic hypothesis available for Bufonidae.  While the              large size of the family prohibits the estimation of a phylogeny                resolved to the species level, this level of detail is not required             to answer many questions.  Instead what is needed is an                         understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among the major                 subclades of the family and within small clades of recently                     diverged species.                                                                    This study represents a hierarchical approach to the                       elucidation of phylogenetic relationships within Bufonidae and the              application of this information to an understanding of species                  diversification.  DNA sequence data from representative species at              two levels of divergence within the family: among distantly related             species and within one species group, will be used to estimate                  phylogenetic relationships at these levels.  With a phylogenetic                hypothesis for the distantly related taxa, two questions will be                addressed: 1) biogeographic relationships among continents and 2)               morphological innovation.  With a hypothesis of phylogenetic                    relationships within one species group, patterns and processes of               speciation will be studied.",
