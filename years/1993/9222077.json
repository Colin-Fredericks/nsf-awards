 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infants that are involuntarily separated from their mothers may                 suffer severe physiological and behavioral consequences.  Most of               what we know concerning the physiological effects has derived                   from studies using nonhuman primates.  These effects include                    increases in sympathetic activity, changes in neurotransmitter                  levels, and increased activity of the pituitary-adrenal system, a               neuroendocrine system associated with stress.  For many years, it               was only possible to study such questions in primates since                     common laboratory rodents have been thought to respond to                       separation in a fundamentally different way than to primates, and               possibly humans.  In his previous NSF support, Dr. Hennessy                     demonstrated that the responses of young guinea pigs to maternal                separation are in many ways similar to those of primates.  The                  guinea pig model provides an alternative to primate research                    which, in turn, offers many practical advantages.  Dr. Hennessy                 would continue his research to further our understanding of how                 brief periods of maternal separations alter neuroendocrine and                  behavioral function.  He will examine the role of corticotropin-                releasing factor (CRF) since this hypothalamic neurohormone is of               primary importance in the body's diverse physiological and                      behavioral responses in threatening situations.  Dr. Hennessy                   will investigate the role of centrally and peripherally                         administered corticotropin-releasing factor and its antagonists                 in mediating stress-induced behavioral changes.  These basic                    studies will contribute to our understanding of the consequences                of mother-infant separation and processes of attachment and                     elucidate the nature of the stress response in young.",
