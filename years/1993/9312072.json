The PI proposed to use  the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) techniques to grown stacked  thin film layers of feeroelectric oxides with buffers.  The  objective was to prepare thin film ferroelectrics with  controlled grain boundaries, and to study their effects on  the problem of DC ferroelectric degradation.    %%%    This is a SGER project.  The project plans to grown stacked  thin film layers of ferrorelectric oxides with buffers.  The  goal is to prepare expitaxial film with controlled grain  boundaries.  Through these grain boundaries, the project  intends to study the effects of these boundaries on the  problem of DC degradation.  This problem plagues oxide  ferroelectrics as electronic device materials.  If its cause  can be ascertained, its solution can make the oxide  ferroelectrics important electronic materials of the future,  suitable as non-volatile memory materials.  ***",
