The                           workshop, which is being organized by Dr. Philip                                Kutzko, University of Iowa and Drs. J. Soto-Andrade,                            University of Chile and J.R. Baeza, University of                               Valparaiso, involves many different fields of                                   mathematics and is of great interest, both for its                              connections with number theory via the Langlands                                program and for its relevance to general                                        representation theoretic investigations of topological                          groups.  The lectures delivered in this workshop will                           be edited into a comprehensive basic graduate text,                             which will provide an overview of concepts and                                  techniques of the field.                                                                                                                                        The representation theory is an area which has                                  attracted considerable attention in recent years.                               This workshop will provide a forum for the exchange of                          recent research among mathematicians from several                               nations working in this very important area. It will                            also serve to encourage further research collaboration                          between Chilean and U.S. mathematicians.",
