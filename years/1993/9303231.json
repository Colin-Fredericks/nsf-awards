 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sheu will continue his research on the interaction between C*-             algebras and geometry, with emphasis on the C*-algebraic                        deformation quantization.  The motivation of this research is the               recent worldwide interest in the promising new theory of quantum                groups which links together several branches of mathematics and is              closely related to mathematical physics.  The objective of this                 research is to advance the understanding of this relatively new                 area of mathematics.  The main tools to be used in this research                will be from various mathematical branches including C*-algebras,               Lie groups, differential geometry, and pseudodifferential                       operators.                                                                           The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                 being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
