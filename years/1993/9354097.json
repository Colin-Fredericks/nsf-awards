These systems  have the potential to make major contributions to what  students learn and how they learn it.  In a three-day  workshop those who develop and study GIS, those who use GIS  in research in various disciplines and educators are brought  together to obtain an understanding of GIS and its potential  uses in education.  The workshop consists of written papers  to form the basis for discussion, plenary talks, breakout  sessions and demonstrations.  The issues include technical  (the present and future state of GIS), educational  (disciplines, examples, costs teacher enhancement), and  cognitive science (what new concepts and processes students  can learn).  The conference provides a consensus of the  potential for GIS in schools and an outline of the steps to  reach that potential.    ***",
