 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of adhesive proteins have been found on the surfaces of                cells.  Understanding how these adhesive proteins work will help us             understand the basis of certain cell-cell interactions.  One of the             best studied cell adhesion molecules is the neural cell adhesion                molecule or N-CAM which is found on the surfaces of many nerve                  cells.  N-CAM was originally shown to bind directly to other N-CAM              molecules.  More recent work from this laboratory and others has                altered our picture of N-CAM-mediated adhesion by suggesting that               N-CAM can also bind to target molecules other that N-CAM.  This                 would greatly broaden the range of interactions in which this                   molecule could participate.  Other than N-CAM itself, the                       identities of the molecules that are targets for N-CAM binding are              not yet known.  The goal of this project is to identify these                   target molecules and to define the chemical and cellular properties             of adhesion to them.  The first aim of the study will be to test                whether a  particular group of molecules found on cell surfaces and             in the extracellular matrix, namely heparan sulfate proteoglycans,              can act as the target for cell adhesion brought about by N-CAM.                 These molecules have been implicated in other adhesive systems, but             their direct role as an adhesive target for N-CAM has not been                  demonstrated.  The second aim of the study will be to identify and              purify from cell surfaces as-yet undiscovered proteins that act as              targets for N-CAM binding.  This information could transform our                understanding of the normal and abnormal functions of N-CAM and of              the cellular interactions in which it is involved.***//",
