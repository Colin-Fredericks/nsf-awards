This upgrade will enhance greatly research in a number of  areas   including the following:    1)  Novel approaches to nonlinear optical polymers and new   catalytic reactions,  2)  Rhodium catalyzed silaformylation of carbonyl compounds,  3) Reactivity of complexes containing the   nitrosylcyclopentadienylruthenium core,  4)  Synthesis of cyclic peptides containing diaryl ether alpha-  amino acids via Diehls-Alder methods,  5)  New methods for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds,  6)  NMR investigations into the function of Aeromonas   aminopeptidase,  7)  Characterization of new zinc and cadmium complexes using   NMR,  8)  Reactions of organic ion radicals and doubly charged ions.    %%%       A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer is used to   obtain information about molecular structure (what types of   carbon and/or hydrogen atoms and/or hetero-atoms are present,   what are the relative number of each type of atoms and how are   they connected to one another in the molecule) and molecular   dynamics (how rapidly are the various parts of the molecule   moving).  This instrument is essential for any meaningful,   modern synthetic chemistry research program.  ***",
