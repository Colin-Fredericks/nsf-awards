 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309804  Nusbaum    The goal of this proposed work is to understand how peptidergic  neurons modulate the activity of rhythmically active neural  networks that mediate behaviors.  Rhythmically active neural  networks are strongly influenced by modulatory inputs from other  regions of the nervous system, in both vertebrates and  invertebrates.  The largest class of modulatory transmitters is the  neuropeptides, yet thus far most of our knowledge about how  neuropeptides modulate neural network activity has come from bath-  application studies.  Little information is available regarding the  ways in which neural networks respond to individual peptidergic  neurons.  Moreover, there are several reasons why bath-application  and neural-release of a neuropeptide will not necessarily produce  the same response in a neural network.  These reasons include the  observations that (1) peptidergic neurons often co-release other  transmitters, (2) neuropeptides often reach more receptors when  bath-applied than when neurally-released, and (3) different  concentrations of a peptide can cause qualitatively different  neural network responses.    The specific goals of this proposal are to (1) provide a more  realistic assessment of the utility of bath-application studies as  a model for peptidergic neurotransmission, and (2) understand how  and why a set of neurons that have the same peptide transmitter  elicit different responses from the same rhythmically active neural  networks.  The specific aims of the proposal are to determine  whether these differences are the result of these proctolin neurons  having different co-transmitters, being differentially influenced  by extracellularly- located peptidases, releasing different amount  of proctolin, and/or releasing proctolin into different domains  within the neuropil.  These aims will be attained by using a  multidisciplinary approach, including intra- and extracellular  electrophysiology, HPLC- and bioassay-focussed biochemistry, and  laser scanning confocal mi croscopy, to study the ways that three  identified proctolin neurons influence the pyloric and gastric mill  neural networks.    This proposed study will provide novel physiological, biochemical  and anatomical information about the means by which neurally-  released peptides influence neural network activity.  This study  will also provide the first in-depth understanding of the  limitations of using bath-application of neuropeptides to study  neural network responses to neurally-released peptides.***",
