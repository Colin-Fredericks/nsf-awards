 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports intermediate energy nuclear research carried                out by staff of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory at the University                of Illinois.  Activities are focused on the physics of nucleon                  and few-body nuclear structure and on the magnetic moment of the                muon.  Specifically, they involve measurements in five areas.                   First, there is the electron scattering program at the Bates/MIT                accelerator that will try to determine if the proton is spherical               or ellipsoidal.  Second, there is a program of parity-                          nonconserving electron scattering at the Bates/MIT and the CEBAF                accelerators that will try to measure new aspects of the                        structure of the proton and neutron.  Third, there is the                       experiment to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon                 at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  Fourth, there are experiments               involving proton-antiproton collisions at the Low Energy                        Antiproton Ring at CERN.  These experiments search for new,                     exotic forms of nuclear matter, such as glueballs.  And fifth,                  there are experiments using beams of photons at the Saskatchewan                Accelerator Laboratory.  These seek to study certain aspects of                 the structure of protons and neutrons as well as their                          interactions in light nuclei.  All of these experiments address                 issues in intermediate energy nuclear physics that are at the                   forefront of our knowledge.",
