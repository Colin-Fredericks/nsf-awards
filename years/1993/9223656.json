 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223656  Jafvert  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which is to determine the  aqueous concentrations of select hydrophobic  organic compounds, solubility of is enhanced  by the presence of specific co-solutes of  intermediate molecular weight.  Research is  expected to elucidate the mechanisms of  enhancement and lead to an assessment of the  environmental impact this characteristic has  on the mobility and fate of the hydrophobic  compounds selected for study.  The  investigator plans on using fluorescence  quenching methods in his research to infer  mechanistic information at and below the  solubility limits for the selected  hydrophobic organic compounds.  He expects to  formulate mechanistic and semi-empirical  models that characterize the processes  leading to solubility, determine the  constants associated with these models and  evaluate the quality of the models by  conducting laboratory experiments.    Results of this work are expected to increase  our understanding of processes that control  the movement and fate of a class of organic  chemicals of limited solubility in water when  they are subjected to environmental  conditions that enhance their solubility.   This enhanced understanding may be applied to  assessing and modeling the impacts of  hydrophobic hazardous chemicals contained in  aquatic sediments as a step design of  physical, chemical and biological remediation  processes.",
