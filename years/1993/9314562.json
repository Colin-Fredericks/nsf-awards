Industry has been responding to this by  developing environmentally acceptable products which can replace  disposable plastic articles currently in use.  The use of  biodegradable polymers for this effort has been recognized by many  companies.  An Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Polymer Biodegradation at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell  would provide a better mechanism to stimulate industrial innovation  in the development of new technologies in degradable plastic  materials.  The Center will address research topics in the areas of  the microbial production of polymeric materials, organic  transformations, plastics processing, material characterization,  and environmental engineering.   The goal of this Center is to  develop suitable materials which are inherently degradable in  natural as well as being environmentally benign.    A number of companies have committed to support this effort.   Currently, there are six sponsors for the Center committing  approximately $300,000.    The Principle Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues have  demonstrated competency in their research performance in the  proposed area and have the knowledge and facilities to run this  Center.    The proposed research projects will address:  1)Microbial synthesis  of biopolymer; 2)design and chemical synthesis of biodegradable  polymeric materials; 3)graft and block copolymer synthesis; and 4)  modification on natural polymers.    The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center has been  coordinated with Dr. Robert Wellek, Deputy Division Director of  Chemical and Thermal Systems Division at the NSF.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Massachusetts,  Lowell be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year  continuing award.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Divisi on  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
