 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science educators are faced with the dilemma that one                  cannot do computer science well without being a good                            programmer, nor can one understand the underpinnings of                         computer science without a strong background in mathematics.                    The goal of this project is to use the first three courses of                   the computer science major to make students fluent speakers of                  mathematics and programming, and to expose them to both                         functional and imperative language paradigms so that they can                   effectively learn computer science.  Computer Science I and                     Discrete Mathematics, taken in the first semester, will                         carefully articulate the strong ties between mathematics and                    programming through an integrated curriculum, a functional                      programming language and a shared laboratory.  Computer Science                 Il, taken during the second semester, will bridge the gap                       between the mathematical perspective of the first semester and                  the implementation of an algorithm as a sequence of                             instructions through an imperative language.  All courses will                  also provide a strong foundation for the computational concepts                 that are considered in advanced courses.  The approach used                     exposes students to theoretical concepts in mathematics and                     computer science without having these concepts walled off as                    abstractions unrelated to applications, and it gives students                   extensive programming experience without neglecting important                   theoretical concepts that are the foundations of correctness                    and the basis for generalization and creative work.",
