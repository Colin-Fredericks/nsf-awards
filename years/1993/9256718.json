 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new Graduate Traineeship Program in Ultrafast Optical                    Sciences will be established.  The specific focus of the five                   traineeships will be on the University of Michigan's newly                      created Center for Ultrafast Optical Science (CUOS), an NSF                     Science and Technology Center created to enhance the nation's                   competitiveness in high-speed photonics and pulsed laser                        optics.  This is a field where a well-documented demand exists                  for highly trained personnel who will lead the burgeoning                       revolution in optical science and technology.  CUOS is                          inherently interdisciplinary in scope and draws on faculty and                  resources in several departments:  Applied Physics, Electrical                  Engineering, Physics, and Chemistry.  These multidisciplinary                   components are integrated via a common emphasis on the                          utilization of high peak power lasers for new areas of                          fundamental science, and for technological applications that                    exploit the special characteristics of ultrafast light pulses.                  This comprehensive and innovative program addresses several                     crucial needs in graduate education:  it aims to increase the                   number of American undergraduates going on to PhD studies in                    areas of national importance, it actively engages and nurtures                  underrepresented groups in the research of the Center, via a                    novel outreach initiative funded by University matching funds,                  and it addresses important issues of retention and time-to-                     degree by providing pre-enrollment summer research                              internships.",
