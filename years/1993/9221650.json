 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department  of Chemistry at  Columbia University                    is requesting  funds for the  upgrade of their  departmental                    computing facilities. The  present departmental machines are                    a Convex  C210 and  a Vax   Cluster, both  of which  are now                    hopelessly outdated with regard  to computational power. The                    system proposed here will  increase CPU capabilities by more                    than   an  order   of  magnitude,   thus  facilitating  both                    theoretical  and  experimental   research  in  computational                    chemistry. The  proposal is based  on a workstation  farm in                    operation at  the Thomas J. Watson  Research Laboratories of                    IBM that has provided a stable computing environment for the                    past 1.5 years. The most important feature of a farm is that                    it can simultaneously  satisfy departmental computing needs,                    serve as a development environment for new theoretical codes                    and  algorithms,  provide  state  of  the  art  graphics and                    visualization  facilities and  support research  in state of                    the art  applications of parallel processing  for the entire                    department.  Work  which  will  be  supported  with this new                    computing facility includes:                                                                                                                                    1) Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo algorithms for quantum                    and classical systems;                                                                                                                                          2)  New algorithms  for quantum  chemistry, quantum dynamics                    and molecular spectroscopy;                                                                                                                                     3)  High performance  parallel free  energy perturbation and                    conformational searching;                                                                                                                                       4)  Ultrafast molecular mechanics.                                              %%%                                                                                     A   workstation  farm   of  fast,   modern  computer                    workstations is a new way  to satisfy the computing needs of                    chemistry departments. Such a \"computer farm\" also serves as                    a development  environment  for  new  theoretical  codes and                    algorithms,    provides   state-of-the-art    graphics   and                    visualization   facilities   and    supports   research   in                    state-of-the-art applications of parallel processing.",
