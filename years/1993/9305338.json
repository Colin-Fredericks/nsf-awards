 "awd_abstract_narration": "The distribution of subcellular organelles during cell division               is essential for the proliferation of eukaryotic cells, yet little              is known of its molecular basis or control.  Previous studies                   identified the MDM1 protein (Mdm1p) as  a central component                     mediating mitochondrial distribution during mitosis in yeast.                   Mdm1p is an intermediate filament-forming protein that defines a                cytoplasmic structural system essential for both nuclear and                    mitochondrial inheritance.  The goal of this project is to                      characterize the function and assembly of the  Mdm1p-cytoskeleton.              There are four objectives: 1,to analyze dynamics of the Mdm1p-                  structures within intact cells; 2, to generate and characterize new             mutant alleles of mdm1; 3, to characterize the interaction of Mdm1p             with mitochondria; and 4, to identify proteins that associate with              Mdm1p and play a role in the assembly or function of the Mdm1p-                 containing structures.  A long-range aim is to understand how the               function of Mdm1p is coordinated with overall cellular metabolism               and the cell division cycle.  Study of the Mdm1p-network will                   involve a combined cellular, biochemical, and genetic approach.                 Dynamics of the Mdm1p-network will be analyzed in intact cells                  harboring mutations affecting a variety of other cellular                       structures or cells treated with various chemical inhibitors.                   Indirect immunofluorescence microscopic analysis will reveal                    changes in Mdm1p distribution and allow assessment of assembly and              disassembly of the network.  New alleles will be created by in                  vitro mutagenesis of the cloned MDM1 gene, analyzed microscopically             to identify those conferring phenotypes different from the original             mdm1 allele, and identified by DNA sequence analysis. This                      component of the study should permit a detailed structure-function              analysis of Mdm1p.  The interaction of Mdm1p with mitochondria will             be studied using binding assays employing purified Mdm1p and                    isolated mitochondria.  Binding studies combined with chemical                  crosslinking procedures should lead to the identification of                    mitochondrial proteins that mediate Mdm1p-mitochondrial                         interactions.  Biochemical and genetic approaches will be developed             to identify additional cellular components that mediate Mdm1p                   function and participate in the distribution of mitochondria during             mitosis.  These studies will reveal new details of the Mdm1p-                   cytoskeletal system.  They should lead to new insights into                     cellular organization and processes basic to normal cell growth.                %%%                                                                             The appropriate partitioning of cellular components at the time of              cell division is critical to the survival of the daughter cells.                In prior NSF-supported work, this laboratory identified an                      essential gene in yeast which plays an important role in                        partitioning of mitochondria to daughter cells during yeast cell                division, and discovered that the gene product is a yeast homologue             to animal intermediate filament proteins.  This project will extend             those studies to the questions of how the yeast intermediate                    filament-like network is assembled, and how it interacts with                   mitochondria.  The results will provide fundamental and important               new knowledge concerning the organization of cytoplasm.",
