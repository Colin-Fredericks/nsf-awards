 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site award will support six undergraduate                         researchers working under the supervision of faculty advisors                   from the University of Texas at San Antonio and Hendrix College.                The project is scheduled to run for a period of ten weeks with                  emphasis on research in the newly developing field of wavelets                  and their applications.  The plans are ambitious in that the                    mathematics of wavelets is still in its developmental stage.                    However, opportunities for undergraduates to make substantive                   contributions and carry the work further along in their                         mathematical development is great.  Some training in harmonic                   analysis will be necessary and students with computational                      backgrounds will be able to visualize the results quickly.                      Applications to image processing, computer vision, stochastic                   processes, numerical methods and speech synthesis make this                     attractive program an excellent example of how mathematics can                  provide insight into the research world without the necessity of                long periods of passive lecture and study.",
