 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planing grant will lead to a proposal from Elizabeth                       State University representing schools in the northeastern                       region of North Carolina.  The PI has demonstrated that the                     students do not get an adequate education in mathematics                        creating an even greater problem since the state standards                      for college admission have been raised.  Through their                          summer work with students funded by the Department of                           Energy, the staff feels that when specific adjustments are                      made to provide support for the students, the students can                      and do learn mathematics.  With this grant, they will begin                     extending their work with the local school districts, assess                    the needs, and draft a formal proposal for funds to retrain                     the teachers in the region.                                                                                                                                     This proposal specifically addresses the needs of the                           African American students in the region and is administered                     by an HBCU.  It uses the community resources to support the                     development process and strives to involve parents in the                       homework with the students, learning along side of their                        children.",
