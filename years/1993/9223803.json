 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223803  Hodges  An animation sequence may be thought of as a series of images  (frames) sampled from a continuously changing scene.  The  temporal sampling rate is high, 24-30 frames per second, so that  any particular frame is usually very similar to the frame that  preceded and succeeded it.  This similarity is known as frame-to-  frame or temporal coherence.  The majority of computer graphics  images are generated as part of a sequence of animation frames.  The usual approach for producing these images, however, is to  render each frame in an animation as if it were a single,  isolated image.    The purpose of this research is to develop faster algorithms for  the generation of animated sequences of ray-traced images by  exploiting temporal coherence.  The idea here is that the  information gained when ray-tracing a particular frame in a  sequence may be used to speed up the ray-tracing of other nearby  frames.  the goal of this project is the development of efficient  algorithms to infer the pixel values of one or more animation  frames from a ray-traced reference frame.  The reference frame  may have been fully ray-traced or contain a combination of ray-  traced and inferred pixel values.  ***",
