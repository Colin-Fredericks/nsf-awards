 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary aim of this project is to help 60 high school                       mathematics teachers integrate technology (graphing                             calculators and computer software) into the 8-12 curriculum-                    -while at the same time strengthening their content                             background and enriching their pedagogical repertory.  In                       the first year, 30 teachers will be chosen (in pairs) from                      across the State of Connecticut, but urban areas with                           concentrations of minority students will be especially                          targeted.  The program consists of two sequential four-week                     summer institutes in which the participating teachers will                      study and explore applications of technology in the                             classroom.  As they do this, they will see that technology                      can not only help take the drudgery out of mathematics, but                     can also make a wealth of interesting and useful mathematics                    accessible to high school students.  The applications of                        technology will be studied in the context of modern                             mathematical content and modern pedagogical techniques,                         e.g., cooperative learning groups.  To help smooth the                          implementation and dissemination process, administrators                        from the participants' home schools or districts will be at                     least briefly involved in the first summer program.  In the                     second summer, groups of high school students will be                           available for participants to pilot test new lessons and                        units as they are developed.  During the first academic                         year, project staff will provide support for the teachers'                      visits, as well as two scheduled two-day workshops.  During                     the second academic year teachers will be expected to engage                    in significant staff development work in their buildings                        and/or districts, including offering extended workshops of                      30-40 hours for their peers.  The program described above                       will be repeated for a second group of 30 teachers in years                     3 and 4.  Cost sharing amounts to 68% of NSF funding.",
