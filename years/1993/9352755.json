 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Engineering at the University of Alabama has a                   student population which is more than 19% minority and just                     under 20% female students.  The Department of Aerospace                         Engineering has a curriculum designed to provide students with                  a broad-based practical education.  Accordingly, almost all of                  the aerospace engineering courses are complemented with                         experimental facilities. The one subject area which is not                      complemented by a laboratory is that of propulsion. This                        proposal hopes to obtain support for a laboratory at the                        University of Alabama which is unique to undergraduate                          propulsion education, not only due to the equipment, but also                   in the way in which the subject matter is taught. The                           laboratory will be based on a small, fully-operational turbojet                 engine, its accompanying test chamber, and a data acquisition                   and control computer. The exciting, new pedagogical approach to                 be taken to teach propulsion utilizing the proposed laboratory                  was originally developed by researchers in the field of                         secondary school science education. The structure of the new                    propulsion systems course will follow what is called a learning                 cycle strategy. This teaching approach represents a major                       departure from that used for traditional engineering courses.                   In particular, the laboratory component will have a different                   focus; by using the learning cycle, laboratory experiences                      precede lecture material. The propulsion laboratory based on                    this proposed equipment would primarily support the                             undergraduate course in propulsion systems. However, one other                  exciting use of the equipment would be in support of a new                      undergraduate course being taught in the Department of                          Aerospace Engineering. The new course will be taught to                         sophomore and junior level education majors, introducing them                   to aerospace related science and technology concepts. A                         propulsion laboratory, such as the one proposed, will highly                    complement this new science course and will expose many                         students outside of the College of Engineering to the operation                 of a gas turbine engine.",
