 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resonant-mass detectors of gravitational radiation have                    been developed that are reliably operating at liquid helium                     temperature (4.2K) with sensitivities h ~ 6x10-19, where h is                   the dimensionless strain amplitude of the waves.  At this                       sensitivity level we do not expect to detect gravitational                      wave signals from anything but the rarest astrophysical                         events.  For the past several years the Stanford group has                      been designing and constructing an ultralow temperature (50mK)                  detector.  It is expected to have an initial sensitivity of at                  least h=10-19 and eventually less than 10-20, sufficient to                     detect gravitational radiation from plausible but rare                          astrophysical events that could occur in our galaxy or its                      immediate vicinity.                                                                  Success in this endeavour could bring direct confirmation                  of an important prediction of Einstein's General Theory of                      Relativity and also open an entirely new window on our                          universe that will yield information not available from                         optical, radio, infrared, x-ray, or gamma-ray astronomy.                             The key elements of the research program during the next                        three years are                                                                 \u001a    reliable operation of the ultralow temperature                                  (50mk) detector now nearing completion,                                    \u001a    operation of this detector in coincidence with other                            gravitational wave detectors and correlate the                                  output with other electromagnetic (e.g., gamma-ray                              burst) and neutrino burst detectors,                                       \u001a    continuing research to advance the state-of-the-art                             in superconductive modulated-inductance transducers                             and SQUIDs.",
