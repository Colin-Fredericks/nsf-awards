 "awd_abstract_narration": "Direct and indirect effects of temperature and food resources              on the life history and production of the aquatic insect                        Pseudochironomus richardsoni (Diptera: Chironomidae) will be                    determined by this research.  Field studies are to be conducted in              the Eel River of northern California.  In this system, larvae of                the midge Pseudochironomus are an integral link in the trophic                  cascade by which carnivorous fish affect the abundance of algae in              the river.  Specific objectives are to: (a) compare estimates of                seasonal production by the midge in distinct river habitats that                vary in temperature and food resources, (b) determine variability               of relevant physical factors and food resources using path                      analysis, (c) by means of radioisotope techniques, identify                     physiological mechanisms involved in the interactions between                   Pseudochironomus, diatoms (Cladophora), and algal epiphytes such as             green algae (Zygnema).                                                          %%%                                                                             Prior laboratory studies have examined effects of temperature on                interactions of primary consumers, chironomids, and algal foods and             habitats but the tendency has been to perform such studies by                   rearing chironomids in isolation from other species.  This research             has the advantage of integrating larger scale investigations with               small scale enclosure experiments and laboratory studies of midge-              algae interactions.  Results should reveal whether shelter provided             by floating algal mats enhance chironomid growth and numbers.                   These small aquatic invertebrates serve as essential prey items for             fish species of the northwestern United States, such as salmonids,              whose recent numbers have declined along with the quality of                    running waters.  This research focuses on gaining a better                      understanding of interactions at the base of the aquatic food                   pyramid (the critical primary producers and consumers), and can                 provide a basis for studies at higher levels on the trophic pyramid             as well.",
