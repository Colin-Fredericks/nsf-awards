 "awd_abstract_narration": "The production of the phytotoxin rhizobitoxine by Bradyrhizobium                japonicum in soybean root nodules confers a pathogenic character to             the normally mutually beneficial symbiosis by causing a transient               foliar chlorosis, thus blurring the distinction between mutualistic             and parasitic symbiosis.  Toxin synthesis is dependent upon the                 genotype of both the host plant and bacteria.  By selecting for                 mutants that no longer synthesize rhizobitoxine in culture, several             mutants with altered symbiotic phenotypes have been identified.                 One group of mutants does not make toxin in culture or in planta.               These include mutations in structural genes in rhizobitoxine                    biosynthesis.  Interestingly, one of these genes requires a                     translation frameshift for expression.  Symbiotically, the most                 interesting group of mutants are those that fail to synthesize                  rhizobitoxine in cluture, but do produce rhizobitoxine in planta at             levels greater than wild type.  Consequently, these mutants produce             more severe chlorosis from which the plant does not recover.  In                addition, this group of mutants has altered mutualistic symbiosis.              The parental strain is restricted in its ability to nodulate                    soybeans that carry the Rj4 gene.  These mutants are able to                    nodulate Rj4 soybeans at rates similar to unrestricted strains.                 This group of mutants demonstrates a relationship between                       rhizobitoxine biosynthesis and host range functions of                          Bradyrhizobium.  The goals of this proposal are to examine the                  biochemical and genetic mechanisms controlling these parasitic and              mutualistic symbiotic functions.",
