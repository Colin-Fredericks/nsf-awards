 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311457  Hsu    Large-pore materials have been used in many chemical engineering  applications such as catalysis, chromatography, ceramic  membranes, adsorption and immobilized cell fermentation.  In  each case, the effectiveness of the material is believed to be  enhanced by intraparticle forced convection  which improves the  intraparticle mass transfer.  Several investigators have  presented models of this phenomenon which are intended to  provide methods of predicting the performance of these materials  under various operating conditions.  However, all of the models  rely on theoretical estimates of the intraparticle velocity in  determining the mass transfer rates without providing  experimental confirmation.    This project seeks to measure the intraparticle velocity versus  pressure drop relationship using a unique particle flow  apparatus.  Analysis of the results will provide a quantitative  measure of Darcy's constant for the particle.  This constant can  then be used in any pressure gradient field, including packed  and fluidized beds, to determine the corresponding intraparticle  fluid flow field.  Knowledge of this field will allow for the  development of a more comprehensive model of intraparticle mass  transfer which includes both diffusion and convection.  Such a  model should be  applicable to any type of process which uses  the large-pore materials and therefore can be used to determine  their optimum operating conditions.  ***",
