 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Memphis Educational Computer Communications Association                (MECCA) is an informal multicampus consortium newly formed for                  the purpose of promoting computer networking among Memphis                      educational institutions, as well as promoting access to the                    Internet and the NSFNET Backbone.                                                    This association will promote an interinstitutional network                of campus computer resources for all educational institutions in                Memphis metropolitan area.  The University of Tennessee at                      Memphis will closely coordinate and serve as a technological                    catalyst for local networking and nationwide collaborations.  It                will coordinate with all the educational institutions in the area               interested in video conferencing and distance learning, as well                 as collaborative research projects across the state.                                 A primary goal of MECCA is to facilitate collaborative                     projects and sharing of resources between institution, including                those outside the state.  IT will provide management and                        information services to all Memphis area institutions.                               The universities need greater functionality and network                    speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make                  file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable               mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the                link.  This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to                     explore innovative educational resources.",
