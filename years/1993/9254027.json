 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are further developing and disseminating a remarkably simple                 and effective instructional technique -- ConcepTests coupled                    with Peer Instruction -- which has shown to be very effective                   in revitalizing instruction and improving student learning in                   science courses.  The technique has two primary goals:                          1.  to expose students' common misconceptions about fundamental                 principles via the use of ConcepTests, and                                      2.  to rectify these notions, and promote understanding of                      basic concepts, through Peer Instruction.  Greater                              understanding, in turn, leads to a greater appreciation of the                  material, and is ultimately expected to result in an increased                  interest in the sciences.                                                       Initial application of this method in introductory physics                      classes indicates that our program achieves both of these                       objectives.  We are extending our initial research to other                     disciplines, fine-tuning our procedure, and systematizing its                   application so it can be widely applied in undergraduate                        science, mathematics and engineering education.",
