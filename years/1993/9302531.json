 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports work on the fundamental group of a                     smooth quasiprojective variety defined over the field of complex                numbers.  If such a variety maps properly onto a hyperbolic                     curve, its fundamental group surjects onto a nonabelian free                    group.  The principal investigator will determine to what extent                the converse holds.  The problem will be attacked by a variety of               methods.  These include a generalization of the Castenuovo-De                   Franchis lemma, the construction of L2 harmonic 1-forms on the                  universal cover, and a study of certain homologically defined                   subsets of the groups of 1-dimensional characters of the                        fundamental group.                                                                   This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                 makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
