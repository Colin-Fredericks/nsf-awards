Erik Trinkaus/Robert Franciscus   SBR-9312567    A major controversy in anthropology surrounds the relationship (if any) of modern Europeans to Neanderthals, who lived in Europe from about 100,000 to 30,000 years ago.  Some claim the Neanderthals were ancestors of Europeans, while others say the Neanderthals were exerminated by the invading ancestors of Europeans. Recently, this old controversy has once again been energized by a similar argument about the origins of modern people everywhere - whether there was a world-wide replacement of earlier, more primitive sorts of humans by modern invaders out of Africa, or whether there was a gradual shift towards modernity everywhere (the \"replacement\" vs. \"regional continuity\" theories).     This dissertation project provides for a detailed comparison of nasal anatomy among fossil and modern human crania, which will aid in resolving this issue.  The face and nose are widely recognized as being key indicators of population relationships, and this study will utilize the major extant examples.  It is a very well conceived project, and the graduate student to be supported is already known as an interesting figure in the field.   ***  P\\anthro\\jfried\\9312567.abs       W       ^_        WV+  F  F  v        u     v  ~ W      F   u     v j       F  V  v  F  P     V F  P     V F  P      F   u^ v         V   tM F &         ^  F & G & W     &              &9 u &9O u  ^ & G` t & G` t  N   F   t0W F  Pj      RP |   P      F  P  \"  P  \"  P     W v  v  v  v      W F   P F   P      F t t= v j W F + RP         t4 N  Q V   R V   R     W F  PV         v j Wj j       v j Wj  j       v j  2       _                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       9   >           _                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          !         !         !
