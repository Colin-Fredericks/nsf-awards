 "awd_abstract_narration": "Certain Fourier integral operators which are not associated                with local canonical graphs arise naturally in harmonic analysis,               integral geometry and partial differential equations.  This                     project will formulate classes of canonical relations and find                  composition calculi and sharp estimates for Fourier integral                    operators associated with these classes.  The simplest example                  arises when one seeks to determine whether the composition of                   operators is again a Fourier integral operator without the                      transverse intersection hypothesis of Hormander or the clean                    intersection calculus developed by Duistermaat and Guillemin.  In               particular work will be done on the case of degenerate operators.               Emphasis will be placed on those modelled on oscillatory                        integrals with cubic degeneracies in the phase with the goal of                 obtaining estimates and composition properties.  Applications                   include estimates and nonlocal inversion formulae for restricted                two-plane (and, possibly, k-plane) transforms.  In connection                   with classes of generalized Fourier integral distributions                      associated with singular Lagrangians, the backscattering by a                   singular conformal metric on real n-dimensional space will be                   analyzed.                                                                            The underlying objectives of this research are                             to understand complex differential and integral operators through               fundamental techniques of inversion plus decomposition.  The                    work combines powerful abstract methods in analysis and geometry                to develop underlying structures within which properties of                     the operator scan be established.",
