 "awd_abstract_narration": "Daggett Surveying Inc. will use a controlled archaeological context             to develop remote sensing techniques. Using a commercially                      available thermographic scanner they will image the variations in               ground surface temperature differences caused by differential                   evaporation rates of vadose water. Variation, they believe is                   affected by subsurface disturbances such as soil compaction and                 buried structures that comprise an archaeological site. They will               scan in the middle to far-infrared wavelengths in the range from 2              to 14 micrometers. In addition to real-time display, data will be               captured on diskette for computer analysis, enhancement and                     interpretation. In this first stage the team will work at a known               archaeological site which will then be excavated after                          thermographic scanning. Thus ground truth will be obtained.                                                                                                     This technique is important because it will allow archaeologists                both to locate sites more efficiently and to plan excavation in a               more effective manner. Location of archaeological sites is                      necessary for mitigation work related to highway, pipeline and                  other construction.",
