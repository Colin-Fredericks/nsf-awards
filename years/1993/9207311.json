 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bactris is one of the largest neotropical palm genera, and                 one of the most poorly known taxonomically.  The aim of the                     research proposed here is to provide a taxonomic treatment of                   three sections, containing approximately 40 species, as a                       preliminary to a revision of the whole genus for Flora                          Neotropica.  Bactris is widespread throughout the neotropics,                   from Mexico south to Bolivia, and also in the Caribbean.  The                   Amazon basin contains the greatest concentration of species.                    Approximately 350 names exist, but there are probably nearer 120                actual species.  The genus is important for several reasons.  It                contains the economically important B. gasipaes, the source of                  edible fruits which are grown and consumed throughout the humid                 Neotropics.  The ancestors of this cultivated species are                       unknown, and yet are of great interest to agronomists.  Other                   species provide a host of minor products.  The genus is important               in the lowland tropical forest ecosystems, and is a conspicuous                 component of the understory.  Despite its large size and economic               importance, the genus is very poorly understood.  A recent                      phylogenetic analysis has divided the genus into four sections,                 three of which will be revised in the project proposed here.  The               methods used for this revision will include field collecting in                 critical areas and analysis of morphology, pollen morphology,                   stigma morphology and leaf anatomy from herbarium specimens and                 pickled material.",
