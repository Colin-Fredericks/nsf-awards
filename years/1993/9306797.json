 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work to be done on this project concerns the time evolution                of solutions to partial differential equations, especially                      nonlinear wave equations.  The basic question which arises in                   these studies is the possibility of breakdown or blow-up of                     solutions.  For some equations one has global existence of                      solutions whereas for others the solution will fail to exist                    after some finite time.  One focus of the work is in the study of               low regularity solutions, that is, solutions with low regularity                data.  The motivation is from equations in physics in which                     energy is conserved.  If local existence can be established, the                conserved energy will guarantee existence in the energy norm                    indefinitely.  Present results require that a large number of                   derivatives be small, leaving no sense of what can go wrong. In                 addition to studying the period of existence of solutions, work                 will also be done in trying to describe the behavior of solutions               at the onset of blow-up, perhaps one of the most challenging                    problems facing researchers in this area today.                                      Many important equations in physics can be written as                      systems of nonlinear wave equations.  These include classical                   field theory in a fixed gauge, continuum mechanics and the                      classical equations of Einstein, Yang Mills and equations of                    nonlinear elasticity.  The mathematical study of how the                        solutions to these systems progress with time centers on some of                the most important questions under investigation in mathematical                analysis.",
