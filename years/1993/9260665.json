The Multiple-Rod Anode                                                    Neutron Source (MRANS) uses a                                                   simple coldcathode plasma                                                       generator combined with a                                                       multipole magnetic field and a                                                  distributed ion extraction                                                      geometry to deliver a high                                                      fraction of atomic  deuterium                                                   ions at energies of 200 keV to                                                  a tritium-loaded target.

The proposed  ion                                                               source/extraction                                                               configuration, which is                                                         fundamentally different from                                                    that used in existing neutron                                                   sources, is expected to                                                         facilitate greatly  increased                                                   performance. The objective of                                                   the Phase I project is to                                                       experimentally demonstrate the                                                  basic technical feasibility of                                                  the MRANS  concept. This will                                                   be accomplished by performing                                                   the following three  tasks:                                                     (1) design and assemble an                                                      MRANS-type hydrogen ion                                                         source; (2)  perform pulsed                                                     experiments to demonstrate and                                                  characterize high-efficiency                                                    atomic ion extraction; and (3)                                                  develop the conceptual design                                                   for a fullscale Phase II                                                        experiment which will deliver                                                   neutron fluxes in the range                                                     of 10 2 to 103 n/s.
