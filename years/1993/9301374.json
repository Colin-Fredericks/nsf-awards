 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301374  CHILDRESS         The animals associated with deep-sea hydrothermal vents  represent an ancient fauna of global distribution within the  oceans. The very existence of these communities depends upon the  ability of a few invertebrate/bacterial symbiotic associations to  oxidize the reduced chemical species (sulfide or methane) from the  hydrothermal vents using oxidants (such as oxygen or nitrate) from  the surrounding deep-sea water to power primary production in this  environment. The capacity for interaction of the symbiotic  association with the chemical properties of the vent environments  is fundamental to the primary production which supports these  ecosystems.        The central objective of this project is the determination of  the importance of the concentration of carbon dioxide (PCO2) as an  environmental factor affecting the rates of primary production by  hydrothermal vent chemoautotrophic symbioses. This project is  composed of there components, each with its own objectives: 1. A  survey of diverse vent and seep environments to determine the  extent to which chemoautotrophic symbioses in these habitats are  exposed to elevated carbon dioxide and have high concentrations of  carbon dioxide in their bodies. 2. Shipboard studies of the  physiology supporting primary productivity in symbiotic vent  animals in order to evaluate whether the concentration of carbon  dioxided is a variable which limits primary production by the  symbiotic associations. 3. The observation and measurement of  temporal changes at a station located at 13oN in order to describe  the niches of the symbioses over long time scales to assess long  term rates of primary productivity in these environments.        This project will greatly increase our understanding of the  nature of the interactions between the vent animals and their  chemical environment, in particular the interactions with pH and  inorganic carbon, contributing to our understanding of the  functioning of the vent and other chemoautotrophic ally supported  ecosystems.        ***",
