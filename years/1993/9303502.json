 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303502  Keener       The investigator studies propagation of waves in one, two  and three dimensional excitable media, with a special emphasis on  cardiac tissue.  The goal of this study is to understand the  dynamics of spatial patterns, especially the formation and  evolution of spiral and scroll waves, taking into account  specific features of cardiac tissue such as discreteness,  anisotropy, inhomogeneity, geometry, and ionic kinetics.  The  study involves the construction of mathematical models for the  dynamics of wave patterns, the mathematical analysis of model  equations, development and implementation of suitable numerical  algorithms for their simulation in large scale contexts,  including but not limited to eikonal-curvature methods, and  comparison of results with available experimental results.       While there are many complementary and supplementary  problems to address, the overriding goal of this research is to  develop a quantitatively reliable whole heart model with which to  vizualize the heartbeat.  While this is an achievable goal, it is  impossible with present day computers and mathematical models.   The emphasis of this research is to develop improved mathematical  models, rather than await the development of machines of  sufficient size and speed.  Such a model would be of great value  in extending the diagnostic usefulness of the EKG, or in  understanding the role of infarctions and clinical procedures in  inducing life threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  ***",
