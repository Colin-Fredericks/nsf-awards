 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small-scale citizen action movements have become more                      common in the political arena in the last 20 years and most                     research on them has been done at a very broad level.  This                     project uses an ethnographic approach to observe first-hand                     the organization, level of citizen participation, and the                       history of one such group in Britain: women tenants of                          public sector housing developments (council estates).                           Through the use of consensus modeling and other                                 sophisticated research methods, the researcher will                             determine what new knowledge activists learn about the                          social order through their participation in local-level                         political campaigns and the degree to which participants'                       values and attitudes are transformed.  This work will result                    in one of the few thorough studies of citizen action in                         Western Europe, and will contribute to the growing corpus of                    anthropological literature on contemporary social movements                     and on women's forms of political action.",
