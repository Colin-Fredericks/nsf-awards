 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports a two-year collaborative research project                  between Professor Ken-Ichi Nishikawa of the University of Iowa                  and Professor Jun-ichi Sakai of Toyama University, Japan.  Also                 involved in the project are Professor Torsten Neubert of the                    University of Michigan and Shinji Koide of Toyama University.                                                                                                   Recently the Japan-U.S. satellite \"Yohkoh\" has obtained new                     observations of solar flare plasmas.  In particular, the                        coalescences of current loops have been observed in the active                  regions on the Sun, which were proposed by Sakai et al since                    1982.  This observation has pointed out the importance of their                 idea that the solar flare is generated by the coaslescence of                   current loops.  This research project will model the dynamics of                the coalescence of current loops by means of a 3-D                              electromagnetic (E-M) particle simulation code associated with                  theories and MHD simulations.  The main topic is to investigate                 the kinetic processes such as energy transfer, acceleration of                  high-energy particles, and electromagnetic emissions associated                 with the current loop coalescence that cannot be studied by MHD                 simulations.",
