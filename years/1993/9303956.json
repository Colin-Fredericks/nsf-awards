 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303956  Guilfoyle    The plant hormone, auxin, plays roles in cell division, extension,  and differentiation. Dr. Guillfoyle has cloned a number of auxin  responsive genes (GH1, GH2/4, GH3, and SAURs) from soybean, pea and  Arabidopsis that are expressed in meristems, epidermal and cortical  cells within elongation zones, vascular tissues, and/or developing  xylem elements. Each of these gene families shows distinct tissue,  organ, and developmental specific patterns of expression. The  functions of the auxin responsive gene products are under  investigation. The GH2/4 gene encodes a putative glutathione S-  transferase. The promoters for these genes are being analyzed in  transgenic plants and by particle gun bombardment of soybean and  transient expression in carrot cells. Putative auxin responsive  elements (AuxREs) have been identified and transcription factors  that bind to the AuxREs are being cloned. The auxin responsive  promoters have been used to monitor auxin regulated gene expression  during tropisms, xylogenesis, rooting, flowering, and seed  formation. These promoters have also been used to drive expression  of auxin and cytokinin biosynthetic genes and a gene encoding an  auxin conjugating enzyme in transgenic plants. The tissue and organ  specific expression of these hormone modifying genes produces a  number of changes in plant growth and development, as well as  changes in cell fate. The transgenic plants with altered hormone  levels are being used along with Arabidopsis gravitropic mutants to  study alterations in expression of auxin responsive genes. Dr.  Guilfoyle is proposing to 1) determine precisely what sequence  elements make a gene auxin responsive; to determine if more than  one type of AuxRE exists in different auxin responsive genes and to  clone and analyze the transcription factors that interact with the  AuxREs; 2) to use the AuxREs or auxin responsive promoters as  molecular probes to study gene expression during auxin regulated  growth and development; to  use transgenic plants that overproduce  or conjugate auxin or overproduce cytokinins as tools to study  auxin regulated gene expression; 3) to gain insight into the  functions of the auxin responsive gene products and their possible  roles in auxin action; and 4) to take advantage of the chimeric  constructs to identify auxin responsive mutants; to search for  mutants in the auxin signal transduction pathway(s). The long range  goals of this research are to understand how auxin regulates gene  expression and how signals are transduced from the auxin receptor  to events such as cell expansion, cell division, and plant  development; to manipulate auxin responsive promoters, auxin  responsive gene products and/or auxin or cytokinin biosynthetic  genes to modify plant growth and development in beneficial ways.  ***",
