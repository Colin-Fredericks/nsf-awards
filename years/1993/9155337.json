During the following school year, the teachers will be given the  time and support necessary for them to assume leadership in the  incorporation of the new curriculum in their schools.  In  subsequent years additional teachers will be brought from the  targeted schools will be brought into the program, with preceding  participants serving as mentors for the new participants.
