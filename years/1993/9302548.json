 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most amazing feats that the nervous system performs is               stabilization of the perceived visual world when the retinal                    display is continually shifting because of eye, head and body                   movements.  If our neural representation of the world did not                   remain steady, we would be subjected to continual nauseating                    displacements.  We do not understand how the nervous system                     transforms and coordinates all the incoming signals about body                  position in order to perform this feat.  Dr. Berkley has                        discovered a fascinating phenomenon that offers a new paradigm                  for understanding this question which he will explore with this                 small grant for exploratory research.  Unexpectedly, in the midst               of experiments designed to answer another problem, he discovered                that paralyzing the muscles that move one eye causes paralysis in               the muscles that move the other eye, even though anesthetic used                for the immobilization was confined to one eye.  He will                        investigate how feedback from the muscles of the paralyzed eye is               used to control the actions of the intact eye.  The information                 obtained in this investigation will be helpful to physicians                    treating eye movement disorders as well as to the designers of                  robot systems for visually guided reaching.***//",
