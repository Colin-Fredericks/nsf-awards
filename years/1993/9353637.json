 "awd_abstract_narration": "PMSA-9353637  McAdoos, Eugene, Adenika-Morrow, Jean and Jackson, Charles  Los Angeles Unified School District  Los Angeles, CA    \"Region C Partnership for Minority Achievement\"    Los Angeles unified School District Administrative Region \"C\" has  a well established partnership with the School of Education at  California State University, Los Angeles.  The proposed project  will build upon that partnership and marshal the professional  expertise of the Science and Mathematics faculty, in the school of  Natural and Social Science and the School of Education, to expand  the capability of teachers in 40 targeted schools so that they can  more effectively meet the needs of African American and Latino  American pupils.  Currently the two groups of students that have  been targeted are averaging a 48% drop-out rate.  The Project will  serve a specific geographical area within Region C. It is designed  to improve science and mathematics instruction in elementary,  middle and senior high schools.  The Project will actively address  student interest, motivation to study, and excitement about and  involvement in science and math activities.  At the same time self-  concept issues related to the project will also focus on student  academics and college possibilities.    Project activities include in-school activities at the University,  and field work, plus visits to participating technological  organizations and industries.  The Project Staff has planned  intervention activities for students primarily in the 4th through  10th grades, their teachers, parents, and all school site  administrators in the targeted schools.  The direction is one of  systemic change of current practices; interventions that have been  shown through research to produce more African American and Latino  American students who take college preparatory courses and who  subsequently enter the sciences at the University will be used.    The PMSA Partnership Project is designed so that as desired  outcomes are associated with practices,  old, new or in combination,  the practices will be integrated into the culture and financial  fabric of the school in efforts to institutionalize strategy,  attitude and group behavior.  The project concentrates its services  on approximately 1500 elementary pupils, 600 middle and 300 senior  high students, but upward to 8000 students each year will receive  services.",
