 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353787  Krane    We propose to develop a model program for an annual symposium for undergraduate women  majoring in science.  This symposium will provide them with information related to graduate  study in various disciplines of science, and it will also bring them into close contact with women  scientists.  We expect to be able to demonstrate that the knowledge and encouragement gained  from this experience not only increases the number of women who undertake graduate study in  science , but also will make them better prepared for graduate study and therefore more likely  to see it through to an advanced degree.    A pilot program along these lines was successfully held for 120 undergraduate women in April  1992.  This program revealed several needed areas of development which require that the  symposium be repeated before an exportable model can be finalized.  This proposal requests  funding to continue the symposium for three years, which will permit us to accomplish the  following:  (1) The continuation will allow us to evaluate the success of the program over  several years and track the participants through a few years of graduate study.  (2) We will  develop a package of materials that the participants can take with them to enable them to stage  a similar event on their home campuses.  (3) We will design and disseminate this model to other  regions of the U.S. to enable them to establish similar programs.  ***",
