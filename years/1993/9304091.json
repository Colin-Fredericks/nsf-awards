The infrastructure                      establishes a common technical vocabulary, identifies specific data             modeling and query language needs arising from potential temporal               DBMS users, identifies concepts and technologies from other data                handling areas that could be profitably applied to temporal                     databases, specifies a single temporal relational data model, lists             the specific language features that should be included in a                     temporal query language, specifies a database schema and example                queries that will aid in comparing query language proposals,                    outlines and populates a DBMS architecture with established query               processing approaches, storage structures, and access methods,                  states the features that should be present in next-generation                   temporal data models and query languages, characterizes the                     research questions that are most pressing, and includes                         recommendations for funding and for building additional                         infrastructure in the temporal DBMS community. The workshop                     participants will communicate this infrastructure through a                     consensus document that will be widely circulated to the research,              development, management and planning communities and funding                    agencies.  This document will contain technical results and                     recommendations and will provide a foundation for implementation,               standardization and future research.",
