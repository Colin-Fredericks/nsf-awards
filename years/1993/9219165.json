 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines theoretical modeling with laboratory                      experiments of the freezing of ice floes in a wave field.  Wave and             sea ice interaction is a little known area of research with however             strong implications for both the large-scale ice dynamics, and                  local-scale physical and biological processes in the marginal ice               zone.                                                                           The proposed work consists of parallel investigations of                        computer-simulated data to determine the the relation between wave              characteristics and the rate and duration of floe interactions on               the one hand, and a series of wave tank experiments on the other                hand.  These experiments will evolve from a simple one-dimensional              wave propagating into a field of simulated ice floes to examine                 floe movement and clustering, to two-dimensional experiments in a               refrigerated wave tank to study the actual freezing process which               is believed to involve the compaction of newly generated frazil ice             and the welding together of individual so-called \"pancakes\" into                successively larger ice floes.                                                                                                                                  When the surface layers of the ocean are close to the freezing                  point of sea water, such a process operating on the 10 cm to 1 m                scale, can extend the ice edge seaward extremely rapidly, with                  significant effects on antarctic meteorological and biological                  processes.",
