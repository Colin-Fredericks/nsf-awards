 "awd_abstract_narration": "ATM-9302475  Finlayson-Pitts         The reactions of alkali halide particles in the atmosphere to  form photochemically reactive species is currently of great  interest.  Such particles, particularly sodium chloride, are not  only ubiquitous in the marine boundary layer, but also have been  found in the plumes from burning oil wells in Kuwait, in the  exhaust from solid rocket propellants, and in emissions from the El  Chichon volcano.  In this project studies of the kinetics and  mechanisms of the reactions of alkali halide with various nitrogen  oxides and ozone will be undertaken.  This will be accomplished  through the use of the relatively new but potentially very valuable  technique of diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT),  which allows one to follow both the gases and the surfaces of the  salt in real time as the reactions are occurring.  The emphasis  will be on understanding the fundamental chemical processes,  especially how the nature of the surface controls reactions of  atmospheric importance.",
