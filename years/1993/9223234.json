 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, a hybrid sliding isolation system employing                           computer-controllable friction bearings has been developed                      and proven to be more effective in controlling the seismic                      response of a single-degree-of-freedom system than the                          corresponding conventional passive sliding system.  This                        proposed research intends to extend the applicability of                        this hybrid isolation system to multistory buildings by                         conducting a series of analytical and experimental                              investigations to develop an improved isolation system                          design.  Analytical work will involve development of two                        control algorithms and computer simulation studies with                         different structural and isolation system parameters and                        different input motions.  The experimental work will involve                    shaking table laboratory test on the proposed computer                          controllable isolation devices.                                                                                                                                 The hybrid sliding isolation systems are more advantageous                      over the conventional passive systems in that they are more                     effective for earthquakes with a broad intensity range, and                     tend to be more robust.  However, to fully implement such a                     system with confidence in practice, there appear to exist                       several major technical and practical problems that are yet                     to be overcome.  The proposed research will develop:  (1)                       improved friction controllable bearings with proper                             consideration of the problems of the possibility of                             uplifting and its prevention, choice of the proper materials                    for sliding interface, chamber pressure control, energy                         supply, and system maintenance, (2) robust control                              algorithms to satisfy requirements for simultaneously                           controlling three-dimensional multitudinous responses, such                     as floor acceleration, interstory deformation, and sliding                      displacement, and to prevent excessive overturning moment                       and uplifting problems associated with buildings, and (3) a                     unified computer codes package to conduct simulation studies                    of isolation performance on various building models under                       different earthquake excitations.  The laboratory tests for                     component performance and scaled building model tests using                     a shaking table as well as the redesign of systems                              incorporating the changes suggested by the experimental                         results will also be performed in this study.                                                                                                                   The proposed research will resolve the remaining technical                      as well as practical problems existing with the innovative                      hybrid sliding isolation system - thus paving the way for                       its broad applications in building structures constructed in                    active seismic areas.",
