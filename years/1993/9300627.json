 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300627  Davidson    This three-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research  between Cliff I. Davidson, of Carnegie-Mellon University and Mats  Oblad of the Chalmers University of Technology.  The objectives  of the research are (1) to measure and model dry deposition of  atmospheric acids and trace elements in the Gardsjon Lake forest  canopy in central Sweden as part of a large international  watershed study; and (2) to develop models and interpret data on  dry deposition in the Artic region.  The investigators will study  sulfate and nitrate acidic compounds known to cause ecosystem  damage, and certain trace elements that are known to neutralize  acids.  The proposed work will focus on field measurements and  computer modeling of dry deposition processes.    Atmospheric acids are transported to surfaces by wet and dry  deposition.  Dry deposition is an important mechanism of removal  of acidic compounds from the atmosphere; however, its processes  are not well understood.  The forest deposition work and the work  in the Artic will provide better estimates and understanding of  the physical and chemical processes by which atmospheric  particles interact with vegetated and snow surfaces.  The  researchers at Carnegie Mellon have developed unique, symmetric  airfoil devices for measuring dry deposition.  These will be set  up in the forest canopy at Gardsjon Lake. The models on dry  deposition in the Artic, also developed by the Carnegie-Mellon  group, will be tested utilizing new datasets available at  Chalmers University.  The proposed collaboration takes advantage  of Swedish expertise in modeling methods and experience in  monitoring the deposition of acidic compounds in a forest canopy.   It also allows comparision of results at American sites with  those from Swedish sites.  ***",
