In previous research, an approach to the formal             study of language, Harmonic Grammar, relies on a novel means of                 integrating connectionist and symbolic computation.  The current                research studies extensions of this approach, concerning formal                 grammars of natural languages and grammars of formal languages.                 Specifically, the previous work is extended:  to encompass                      recursive, fully distributed connectionist representations; to                  develop an explicit symbolic programming language to characterize               the computations over these representations carried out by a new                class of connectionist networks; to study the expressive power of               Harmonic Grammar to describe formal languages, starting with a                  study of context-free languages; to analyze the properties of                   connectionist networks that lead to a recursive, embedding-                     invariant well-formedness (Harmony) function; to test the ability               of Harmonic Grammar to deal with linguistic problems crucially                  involving embedding; to assess the effectiveness of our fully                   distributed representations for encoding the features of                        syntactic/semantic structural roles in linguistic representations;              to extend the theory to incorporate the symbolic computational                  notion of unification, and to apply it to unification-based                     approaches to natural language grammar; to study the effectiveness              and temporal behavior of connectionist parsers that implement both              the numerical and nonnumerical formalizations of Harmonic Grammar;              and to extend recent work on connectionist learning of symbolic                 rule systems to the particular case of Harmonic Grammar.//",
