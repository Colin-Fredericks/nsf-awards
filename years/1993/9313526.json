 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313526  Buchsbaum       This award allows the University of Pennsylvania to  renovate and modernize research space in order to enhance  it's Neuroengineering Research Laboratories.  By modernizing  these facilities, this university will be able to integrate  research and training in engineering technology with the  study of brain function.  While emphasizing vision, the  integration of psychology, physiology, computer science and  engineering technology can lead to tremendous advances in  research in such areas as machine vision at this  institution.  The research is lead by 15 highly regarded  faculty, while 4 postdoctoral fellows, 43 graduate students  and 42 undergraduate students will take advantage of the  renovated facility.    The University of Pennsylvania has a  unique environment for this activity since it has an NSF  Science and Technology Center in Cognitive Science along  with the department of neuroengineering and an Institute in  Neurological Sciences.  The Neuroengineering Research  Laboratories will provide a central facility for  collaborative research, and will offer the capability for  advanced training in state-of-the-art simulation methods in  neural networks.  Finally, this department interacts with  Lincoln University (an HBCU) in order to include more  minority participation in the engineering activities at the  University of Pennsylvania.  ***",
