 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbocationic polymerizations are used extensively in large                     volume industrial processes (for example, butyl rubbers and                     isobutylene-based industries).  These polymerizations are                       commonly carried out in toxic chlorinated hydrocarbon                           solvents, many thousands of pounds of which end up yearly in                    the atmosphere.  This project is an investigation into the                      possibility of replacing these polluting solvents with the                      environmentally neutral, inexpensive carbon dioxide as the                      all-purpose solvents for Friedel-Crafts acids mediated                          polymerizations, and beyond these, to Friedel-Crafts acid                       catalyzed reactions in general.                                                                                                                                 The first specific thrust will be the demonstration that the                    toxic solvents can be replaced with supercritical carbon                        dioxide in carbocationic polymerizations and                                    copolymerizations, and to elucidate the scope and fundamentals                  of these processes.  This will be followed by explorations                      into Friedel-Crafts acid catalyzed reactions, such as                           alkylation, sulfonation, acetylation, etc.  The effects of                      pressure, temperature, and reagent concentrations in                            supercritical carbon dioxide will be explored.  The initial                     phase of the polymerization studies will concern common                         monomers (isobutylene, styrene and its derivatives, and                         conjugated dienes such as isoprene), coinitiators, and small                    amounts of additives (cosolvents, proton traps, electron                        donors, and salts).",
