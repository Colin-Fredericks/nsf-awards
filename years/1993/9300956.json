 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate memory in young children and their               mothers for events related to a major hurricane as a function of                stress, operationalized as level of hurricane exposure.  Ninety-six             three- and four-year-old children and their mothers will be                     interviewed two months and again one year following the devastation             of Hurricane Andrew in Miami, Florida.  Thirty-six additional three             and four year olds and their mothers will be interviewed at the                 one-year interval only, as a control group.  Participants will be               selected so as to represent equally low, moderate, and severe                   hurricane exposure conditions, defined by the extent of damage to               their homes.  All participants will be asked to recount events that             fall into three time periods, 1) the prehurricane preparations, 2)              the hurricane itself, and 3) the posthurricane recovery period.                 The memory interview will consist of open-ended questions, followed             by specific category prompts for each period.  The research will                assess the amount of rehearsal of the information from the period               before, during, and after the hurricane, as well as the degree of               child and adult well being.  Accuracy, amount, and content of                   recall will be coded, using a propositional analysis.  Of primary               concern is how these retention measures differ as a function of                 stress level and retention interval.  The research will assess the              effects of the first interview on retention at one year, using                  comparisons against the control group for the three stress levels.              The research will also explore relations between content and amount             of recall for children and adults.  Of secondary concern will be                relations between measures of memory and well being, and between                adult and child well being.  Findings of this study may improve our             understanding of the relation between memory and stress in children             and provide us with important information about the amount,                     accuracy and nature of recall for a traumatic event.  In contrast               with most research on traumatic events (e.g., physical, emotional,              or sexual child abuse), this research is unique in that stress is               so easily operationalized and memories can be corroborated.",
