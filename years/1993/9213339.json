 "awd_abstract_narration": "Floral development will be compared in representative taxa of              the monophyletic, morphologically diverse and unique flowering                  plant family Proteaceae.  The proposed study will determine the                 relationship between flower development and hypothesized                        phylogenetic patterns of Proteaceae.  This will be done by                      establishing a robust phylogenetic tree of the family using                     principles of systematic theory.  Using the phylogeny, important                morphological trends in the flowers will be identified and studied              ontogenetically.  The ontogenetic study will utilize scanning                   electron microscopy and anatomical techniques.  Comparative                     ontogenetic analyses among proteaceous taxa will provide an                     invaluable data base to test putative intra-familial relationships,             by establishing homologies of characters from early developmental               stages, which in flowers tend to be conserved and phyletically                  informative (cladogenic) compared to later developmental events,                which are generally associated with functional limitations like                 seed dispersal and pollination.  The combination of ontogenetics                and phylogenetics will elucidate the peculiar floral morphologies               of Proteaceae which contribute to its isolated position among                   angiosperms.  Preliminary results contradict the established                    classification of Proteaceae.  The study will also provide evidence             to clarify the taxonomic position of Proteaceae among other                     angiosperms.",
