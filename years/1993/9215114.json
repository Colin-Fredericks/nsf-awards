 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S. participants' travel to a U.S.-Sweden                  seminar on urban and regional infrastructure and development                    planning to take place in Stockholm, Sweden, July 1-3, 1993.                    The principal objective is to bring together twenty-four prominent              experts from the USA and Sweden who are currently conducting                    leading-edge research into the role of infrastructure networks                  (transportation and communication) in urban and regional                        development.  The participants will develop a research agenda                   and exchange information on research methods, results and                       policy conclusions on how infrastructure networks grow and                      change and how interacting networks influence urban and                         regional development patterns in the long-term.  The                            coordinators are Tschangho J. Kim at the University of Illinois                 and D. F. Batten and Lars Lundqvist of the Royal Institute of                   Technology in Stockholm.                                                                                                                                        This is a very timely seminar.  The problem of infrastructure and               its relation to economic and social planning is a high priority for             industrialized countries as cities continue to age and deteriorate.             The Swedes have long been known as innovative thinkers on                       transportation and communication networks in the urban and                      regional context.  The U.S. participants bring to the collaboration             their expertise on transportation modeling, network analysis,                   economic in-put, out-put analysis and urban economics.",
