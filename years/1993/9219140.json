 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one year program of determing the electronic properties of                    macroscopic and mesoscopic systems composed of the group IV                     elements will be carried out.  Having determined the properties of              Si in such configurations, and having done some preliminary work of             Ge MOSFETs as well, concentration will first be on investigations               of the Ge:Si alloys in the Ge rich end of the phase diagram and                 then proceed to further studies of the Ge surface.  If time allows              the SiC system will be studied, which is unique in having many                  different stacking orders and band-gaps.  A physical construct that             will aid the testing of surface conduction with no lithography                  needed on the surface of the sample is being developed; it will all             be on the probe.  The properties in a MOSFET, quantum well or                   pristine surface configuration will be tested.                                  %%%                                                                             Advanced materials (that is those materials which have not been                 studied before or previously known materials that are studied in                new configurations and hence their behavior is governed by this                 configuration), their properties the phenomena  that occur in them              will be studied.  One often learns to understand these two                      important aspects by comparing two similar events or materials and              determining what causes the difference.  This study compares and                contrasts many similar materials that have been the foundation of               modern electronics or will be in the future.  Alloys and elemental              forms of carbon (diamond), silicon, and germanium will be looked at             with standard tools and a new one invented that allow a quick                   determination of the surface conductance properties.",
