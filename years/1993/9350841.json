 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the manufactured products of the future will be                         computer controlled by real-time software embedded in                           microchips as we have already seen, for example, with microwave                 ovens, refrigerators, and fuel-injected automobiles. In                         addition, real-time industrial control systems are becoming one                 of the fastest growing fields within computer science.                          Automated manufacturing is leading the advanced technology                      revolution as companies vie for the competitive edge utilizing                  real-time robotic automation systems. It is crucial for today's                 computer science and engineering graduates to be exposed to                     these complex real-time programming techniques and experiment                   with them in a laboratory, so that they may develop the skills                  necessary to write the software embedded in microchips in these                 sophisticated products and control systems.                                     A Real-Time Systems course is seldom incorporated in a typical                  computer science program at a liberal arts college. At the                      nation's larger engineering schools this is addressed. As we                    compete with the Japanese and other industrialized nations                      developing the products and control systems of the future, all                  computer science and engineering students will benefit from                     exposure to these skills.This project improves the quality of                   instruction in computer science by providing students with a                    powerful computer workstation and a laboratory of three real-                   time platforms from which to study and experiment with the                      techniques of real-time systems: (1) a real-time model railroad                 switching yard system, (2) real-time robotic automation, and                    (3) real-time ROMable microchip code development. With this                     equipment, students majoring in computer science, computer                      engineering, and physics will be able to develop advanced real-                 time software projects. Also, students in senior research                       projects, independent study projects, and in the honors program                 will be able to develop sophisticated real-time engineering                     software using this laboratory.  This laboratory project will                   give students who wish to pursue careers in industry, exposure                  to skills that are in high demand as we compete in a world                      marketplace developing the products and control systems of the                  future. The laboratory will also provide better preparation for                 students who wish to go on to graduate school because of the                    opportunity to engage in advanced software projects. The                        grantee will provide funds for this project that are an equal                   amount for this NSF proposal.",
