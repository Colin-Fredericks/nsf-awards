 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309486  Acar  As part of this proposal, an  optimal controller based on  artificial neural networks will be  developed for a class of nonlinear  systems. The Proposed controller  will be capable of adapting and  optimizing a receding horizon  quadratic cost function in real  time for a system which has unknown  nonlinearities in its state   variables.  The complete controller  design will consist of various  stages of modeling the  nonlinearities, estimating future  values of the system states,  designing a critic for the cost,  and learning the optimal control in  real time.  All these stages of the  controller design will involve  various types of neural networks  which may utilize different forms  of supervised learning methods  integrated with the control  problem.  Briefly the objectives of  this work are as follows.   developing and simulating a real-  time optimal controller based on  neural networks.  Comparing its  performance with the (off-line)  optimal controller and two other  neural network based variations.   Obtaining some stability bounds (or  attraction regions) of the neural  network controlled system  experimentally and analytically.   Implementing the controller on the  two hardware experiments in the  Neuro-Controller Laboratory at the  University of Missouri-Rolla.  ***",
