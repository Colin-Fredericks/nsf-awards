Femtosecond of ultrafast and optical techniques have been used with great success to study a variety of ultrafast processes in optical materials.  Most of these experiments are, however, performed with the Rh6G dye laser around 630 nm in the visible.  There is a clear need to extend the femtosecond sources to the uv and to the ir and to achieve wid tunability.  We have recently succeeded in demonstrating for the first time a broadly tunable femtosecond optical parametric oscillator (fs OPO) at high pulse repetition rate.  A program of research has been proposed to extend the tuning range to cover the entire spectrum from approximately 400 nm to 5 um, to thoroughly characterize the devices, to evaluate new nonlinear optical crystals for applications in fs OPO, and to apply the variety of tunable fs sources developed to the study of ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hot carriers in various semiconductor materials and structures.  A key piece of equipment for such a project is the Argon Ion Laser.  The particular Ar-laser currentyl is use is out dated.  An problems originated in the Ar-laser, which is the first in a chain of laser sources, are propagated down-stream to the Ti-sapphire laser, the femtosecond opticl parametric oscillator, and finally to the experiments on ultrafast processes. To asses and to fully realize the potential of this new development, it is vitally important that the possible pump  laser source, which ia an Argon ion laser, be used.   v       s  t   &   F  ^ &  + ^_MM \u00d5  M      $                       *               $       ^           w       x   D   z       {   I                                                                                                                                                                                                                      9311164  Tang  The School of Electrial Engineering at Cornell University will purchase an Argon ion laser to be used for the NSF    $   3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   _           $                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                $           $           $           $           $                                  (                  F                    /                                                                                                          $                         3         $     /  1 Courier    Symbol  & Arial  5 Courier New                     ( (         9   \"             h        e   e                        I   R:\\WW20USER\\ABSTRACT.DOT     Cassandra Queen Cassandra Queen",
