 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to exploit some of the developing ideas                 in harmonic analysis which relate to important ideas in                         self-similarity.  Self-similarity is a subject of intense                       interest today because of its relationship with fractal geometry                and wavelet analysis.  However, these relationships can be traced               to work in the early 30's by Wiener and Wintner on Fourier                      transforms of Cantor measures.  Work to be done includes the                    computation of dimensions of classes of self-similar measures.                  There are two directions in which the concept will be expanded.                 The first involves replacing strictly contractive transformations               in their definition and replacing this with average                             contractivity.  One can no longer guarantee compact support in                  this case.  The growth rate of such measures and the smoothness                 of their Fourier transform are subjects for investigation.  The                 second direction replaces the convex combinations with variable                 weights.  Here one is interested in existence and uniqueness of                 the measures as well as their Lp and pointwise dimensions.  Work                will also be done in analyzing the Radon transform of                           self-similar measures.  The two natural questions to be                         considered are whether or not the Radon transform is invertible                 and whether one can characterize the range of the transform.  The               transform is known to preserve the class of distributions if and                only if the transform of the measure is not slowly decreasing.                  For self-similar measures this is not the case, leaving open the                question of what the proper spaces ought to be.                                      Harmonic analysis combines those elements of mathematics                   best exemplifying the ideas of synthesis.  One seeks to decompose               complex problems into fundamental components.  These                            components are then analyzed for their basic characteristics.                   Finally, the solution is reconstructed through a recombination of               the components.  The Fourier series and Fourier transform are                   examples of tools used in this context; one discrete , the                      other representing a continuous decomposition. More recently                    the wavelet theory added new dimensions to some of the more                     classical approaches to harmonic analysis.",
