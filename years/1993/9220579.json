 "awd_abstract_narration": "Green lacewings are beneficial predatory insects that eat aphids,               scales, and other serious pests of crop plants.  They are often                 raised artificially for mass release in agricultural areas where                they can serve as important agents of biological control.  Henry                et. al. have found that several distinct North American species                 of green lacewings exist which can be told apart only by their                  unique courtship songs.  Similar-looking lacewings are found in                 Europe, but these have songs that differ greatly from North                     American ones and vary from region to region.  In the past, all                 of these European and North American lacewings have been thought                of interchangeably as a single species, Chrysoperla carnea, and                 have been freely exported and imported across the Atlantic for                  biological control purposes.  However, since different species                  can show strong prey preferences and other individualistic                      behaviors, it is feasible that some mass reared and released                    green lacewings might be relatively ineffective against certain                 targeted pest species.  Efforts at biological control should be                 enhanced by recognizing the hidden biodiversity within this                     lacewing species complex and beginning to use the most                          appropriate \"song species\" in each continent, area or habitat.                  %%%                                                                             This project will investigate the hidden species diversity in                   European green lacewings using song analysis, just as has been                  done for the North American ones.  Thus, the investigators will                 determine how many true species exist in this economically                      important insect group and which are appropriate for use in                     biological pest control programs in different areas of the world.               Perhaps, even more importantly, this project will serve as a                    model of the importance of song or other behavioral traits in                   investigating biodiversity in insects and other groups of                       organisms.",
