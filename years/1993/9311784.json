 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fiber damage is a major problem in injection molding and                   extrusion.  The full benefit of fibers as a reinforcement is not                attained in these processes because the fibers are reduced to a                 fraction of their original length.  Prior research have examined                the damage mechanisms with the aim of understanding how the process             can be changed to maintain longer fibers.  It is clear that it is               the exposure of the fibers to the melt, machinery and other fibers              that cause fiber damage, although the extent of each process has                not been investigated thoroughly.  Tailored experiments will be                 performed to reveal the mechanisms of fiber damage.  Experiments                will be performed to examine addition of the initial material in                different forms, such as powder resin/fibers, encapsulated pellets              with different aspect ratios; addition of the fibers separate from              the resin in different zones and the processing conditions in the               resulting fiber degradation.                                                         The potential impact if this research is large since it will               directly impact injection molding and extrusion which are high                  volume processes.  Reduced fiber damage implies that the strength,              stiffness and impact properties of components made with these                   processes will be considerably higher than the present state of the             art.//",
