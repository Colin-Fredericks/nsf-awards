 "awd_abstract_narration": "A cross disciplinary team from the University of Massachusetts                  at Boston is developing a new approach to the introductory                      college algebra course.  This course has a large enrollment                     nationally, including a disproportionately large number of                      women and underrepresented minorities.  It is often the first                   and only mathematics course taken by many undergraduates,                       including prospective teachers. Rather than encouraging, it too                 often serves to discourage students from pursuing paths that                    emphasize quantitative skills.  Thus it is a critical target                    for reform, identified by the National Research Council (NRC)                   as the linchpin of national mathematics education reform                        efforts.                                                                        This project will develop, implement, evaluate, and start                       dissemination of a new approach to introductory college                         algebra, designed to increase enthusiasm for and competence in                  quantitative reasoning.  It will cover approximately 80% of the                 traditional material and fully prepare students for subsequent                  mathematics courses.  It will, however, approach the topics in                  a nontraditional way, with a particular focus on mathematical                   reasoning, problem solving, and communication, as recommended                   by the NRC and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.                 The course is computer based and requires access to a                           spreadsheet and function graphing program.  The materials                       themselves are machine and software independent.  Students work                 in small groups, using algebraic and technological tools to                     work on open-ended questions based on real world data and                       physical phenomena.  Half the course will be from a social                      science point of view, half from a \"hard\" science viewpoint,                    using topics in astronomy, physics, and the life sciences.                      Formative evaluation will be accomplished by using teams to                     simultaneously co-teach and develop the course, by student                      responses and writings, by tracking students through subsequent                 placement tests and quantitative courses, and by feedback by                    outside reviewers.  An outside evaluator will provide a                         summative evaluation.                                                           UMass/Boston is an urban, commuter, comprehensive university                    with the highest percentage of minority students of any college                 or university in New England.  Collaborating institutions are                   Roxbury Community College, an historically black college,                       Bridgewater State College, a suburban college with a large                      teacher preparation program, and Wentworth Institute of                         Technology, a private college that focuses on educating                         students for technical careers.                                                 This project is designed to aid in the revitalization of                        undergraduate mathematics teaching by providing a successful                    national model for introductory algebra.",
