 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a new interdisciplinary control systems                   laboratory in the Schools of Electrical and Computer                            Engineering and Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at                         Oklahoma State University. This laboratory will consist of five                 test benches networked to five workstations supporting real-                    time computer aided software engineering (CASE) tools. Each                     test bench will have an experimental control system and an                      embedded processor.                                                             There are several features of the proposed lab which make it                    very interesting and unique.                                                    . It is interdisciplinary, bringing together a significant                      amount of experience in control and real-time systems from two                  different departments.                                                          . The equipment in the lab will be state of the art, including                  real-time kernels, computer-aided-design tools, and networking.                 An industrial advisory board will assist the principal                          investigators in insuring that the lab maintains high standards                 in this area. We want the laboratory experience to be                           consistent with the latest industrial practice.                                 . There will be a wide variety of challenging and visually                      interesting systems to be controlled. Five such systems will be                 in the lab in any one semester, but new systems will be rotated                 through the lab from one semester to the next.                                  . All of the systems to be controlled will be designed and                      built by student teams from the undergraduate capstone design                   course. There will be an on-going relationship between this lab                 and the capstone design course, as new systems will be created                  each semester for the foreseeable future. A test of this                        concept was conducted last semester, when a very successful                     system was created by a capstone design team.                                   The main idea will be to get students excited about the design                  of control systems by giving them interesting and challenging                   problems to solve, with the latest technology equipment.",
