 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the most voluminous, deepest and longest continually                    existing freshwater lake on the surface of the earth, Baikal                    presents unparalleled opportunity for paleo-climate reconstruction              at a key continental site in southeastern Siberia.  Here, it is                 proposed to complete our investigations of the fundamental mixing               and biogeochemical characteristics of the modern lake and its                   tributaries.  This study will provide groundwork essential for                  deciphering Baikal sedimentary paleo-climate records.  In addition,             baseline data needed to establish the nature and magnitude of                   perturbations caused by expanding human activities in the Baikal                watershed will be contributed and the chemical conditioning of the              source waters of the Yenisei, one of the most important rivers                  emptying into the Arctic, will be defined.                                           Findings from our June, 1988 expedition include:  1) Deduction             of a unique mechanism, related to thermobaric instabilities, by                 which mixing of this deepest of lakes occurs \u0131Carmack and Weiss,                1991!;  2) Determination, based on CFC, O2 and nutrient                         distributions, of an 8 to 10 year average rate of ventilation for               the lake and confirmation that Baikal is highly oligotrophic with               nitrate as the limiting nutrient \u0131Weiss et al., 1991!; 3) Cycling               of major elements in the lake is dominated by riverine throughout;              hydrothermal activity known by temperature anomalies and                        subsequently observed by submersible, does not impact the chemistry             of the modern lake; lake waters are undersaturated with respect to              calcite phases, consistent with lack of their occurrence in lake                sediments; lake waters are also undersaturated with respect to                  opal, however, high diatom productivity assures a sufficient rain               rate to result in the preservation of siliceous materials in                    sediments which constitute a sink for Si; of the minor elements,                only Ba showed non-conservative behavior in the lake \u0131Falkner et                al, 1991!.                                                                           A second expedition to the lake was undertaken in July, 1991               during which a method by which to use deep water temperature and                oxygen profiles to adequately constrain the extent of ventilation               was established.  Sampling, by trace-metal clean techniques was                 extended to rivers and land-based hot-springs surrounding the lake              in order to better constrain elemental budgets and to allow                     analyses of trace elements which tend to be more sensitive                      indicators of impact by human activities.  Funds are being                      requested from NSF to complete chemical and isotopic analyses of                this sample suite and to extend our observations through                        intercalibration and coordination with ongoing efforts by Russian               scientist.  In addition, a workshop to collate, discuss and publish             the findings of our interdisciplinary group will be held in order               to provide the most complete understanding of mixing and                        biogeochemistry of the modern lake possible.",
