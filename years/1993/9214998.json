 "awd_abstract_narration": "9214998  Minehart  This award supports Professors Ralph Minehart and Klaus Ziock of   the University of Virginia, plus two of their postdoctoral   associates, to collaborate in research with Dr. Reinhart Frosch   of the Particle and Nuclear Physics Department  of the Paul   Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Villagen, Switzerland.   Using an   experimental method proposed and developed by the U.S. group,   these investigators plus five other research groups are engaged   in a multinational cooperative effort to study the rate of   charged pion beta decay to neutral pion.  Each of the seven   groups, including the two from the former Soviet Union,  is   responsible for the detailed design and construction (and cost)   of a specific component of a novel and highly specialized Cesium   Iodide-based detector to be installed at PSI.  This apparatus   will make it possible to obtain measurements of pion beta decay   to an accuracy of .5 percent by 1995; the previous limit of   accuracy was around 3%.  The experiment will determine elements   of the fundamental mixing matrix which relates transitions   between different quark generations.    Pion beta decay is one of the fundamental semileptonic weak   interaction processes.  It provides the theoretically least   ambiguous means to study weak  quark mixing.  Achieving the   greatly improved accuracy of measurement hoped for in this   project will enable the participants  to test quark-lepton   universality.  The resulting accurate measurements will have an   impact on weak interaction theory and on the standard model of   hadronic structure at a fundamental level.  This multinational   experiment is far more than any one or two of the participating   groups could accomplish alone.  The combination of the many   groups will also make mutually beneficial use of special   resources that can be provided by the groups from the former   Soviet Union.  ***",
