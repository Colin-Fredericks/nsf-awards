 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303427  Light    The ability of animal cells to regulate their volume is one of the  most fundamental properties of living cells.  When cells are  exposed to hypotonic solutions there is an initial increase in the  volume of the cell followed by a regulatory volume decrease (RVD)  back to the original size.  The mechanism by which this process  occurs is not known.  This research will characterize the ion  channels involved in the RVD using the red blood cells of the mud  puppy, Necturus, which have been found to regulate their volume  with the involvement of potassium, calcium and chloride channels.  %%%  The ability of animal cells to regulate their volume is one of the  most fundamental properties of living cells.  The goal of this  research is to characterize the role of specific ion channels in  the process of cell volume regulation.  The results will not only  increase our understanding of the role of ion channels in the  process of cell volume regulation, but this research at an  undergraduate institution will provide an opportunity  for  undergraduates to participate in original research as a part of  their science education.  ***",
