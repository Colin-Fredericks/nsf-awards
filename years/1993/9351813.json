The telemetric data gathering system  requested in this grant will allow undergraduate students to  perform ergonomic and physiological experiments on-site, in local  industries. Typical projects that students will work on with the  portable equipment will include:  1.                                 Energy expenditure measurement                                     for physically demanding jobs.  2.                                 Cardiac measurement and                                     evaluation of alternative                                     ergonomic task designs.  3.                                 Biomechanical and                                     physiological job analysis of                                     industrial operations.  4.                                 Job stress analysis of                                     different tool and machine                                     designs.  5.                                 Job evaluation of work task                                     for improvements in enabling                                     technologies and assistance                                     with conformance with the                                     Americans with Disabilities                                     Act (ADA).  Expanding laboratory experiments to include data collection from  actual work sites will enhance students' educational experiences  and provide a stronger foundation for them to become practicing  engineers. Giving students multiple opportunities to work on-site  throughout their undergraduate engineering program will allow them  to gain the perspective of real world problem solving. We believe  this will greatly strengthen the undergraduate engineering  curricula.",
