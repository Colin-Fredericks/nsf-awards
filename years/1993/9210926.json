 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates the three dimensional (3D)                           perception of a dynamic scene from multisensory image sequences.                The results should greatly enhance the design and operation of                  intelligent robotic systems (IRS) capable of predicting,                        detecting and recovering from dynamic failures.  The objective is               to identify and locate each object present in the work-space of                 the IRS over a vast dynamic range of 3-D scene conditions.  The                 major problems occur due to:  i) self-occlusion of 3-D opaque                   objects; ii) inherent loss of depth (3-D) information introduced                by the video imaging process; iii) inevitability of secondary                   occlusions when there is more than one object in the scene.  Two                observations are necessary to counter self-occlusion and                        compensate the loss of depth information.  However, three images                are necessary to uniquely solve a similar set of nonlinear                      equations in 3-D motion analysis of a monocular image sequence.                 Thus, the IRS must use three or more image sensors from                         distinctly different vantage (view) points.  The span of these                  vantage point is called the spatial aperture of the vision                      system.  A major bottleneck lies with the registration of images                over the spatial aperture.  It can be simplified by:  i)                        spatially fusing the temporal (dynamic) information contained in                each image sequences; ii) introducing additional constraints                    using a laser beam when option (ii) is not feasible.  A                         theoretical framework will be developed for bilateral propogation               of geometric constraints over the spatial aperture and temporal                 window to enhance the operational capabilities of the vision                    system.  A hybrid range-intensity image sequence sensor has                     already been designed to provide a test environment required to                 experimentally validate the results.",
