 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303877  Jones    The objectives of this research are to localize the receptors for  gibberellins (GAs) and abscisic acid (ABA) in the aleurone layer of  barley and to identify and test the roles of the molecules that  transduce hormonal signals in this cell.  Alpha amylase secretion  can be visualized when single, secreting protoplasts are embedded  in an agarose matrix containing starch.  This secretory response  provides a rapid assay for the effects of GA and ABA.  Preliminary  experiments show that cells microinjected with GA or ABA do not  respond to these hormones by changing their rate of secretion, but  when GA or ABA are presented to the cell surface, GA stimulates  alpha-amylase secretion and ABA inhibits it.  The cellular location  of the receptors for these hormones will be determined.  Aleurone  protoplasts will also be used to examine the events that lead from  hormone perception to cellular responses.  One of the first  detectable responses to GA in the aleurone cells is proton  extrusion.  Since proton extrusion via the plasma membrane proton  pump is associated with hyperpolarization of plant cells, the  hypothesis that membrane potential measurements can be used as an  assay for the early response of aleurone cells to GA and ABA will  be tested.  The pH of the cytosol will be mapped and quantitated  fluorescent dyes and confocal microscopy to determine whether pH  plays a role in signal transduction.  The possibility that protons  and membrane potential act to gate ion channels in the plasma  membrane will be explored using patch clamp.  Calmodulin has been  implicated in signal transduction in the aleurone cell.  The  relationship between calmodulin and GA and ABA will be studied, and  the distribution of activated calmodulin in aleurone cells will be  mapped using a new fluorescent probe.  These experiments should  establish whether the calmodulin gene, like the genes for secretory  proteins, are regulated by GA and ABA at the transcriptional level  in aleurone cells.  The m apping of calmodulin activity should  clarify the relationship between calmodulin and membrane  transporters whose activities are regulated by calmodulin.  The  roles that molecules such as calcium, calmodulin, and protons play  in signal transduction will be tested by asking whether the signal  transduction pathway from GA or ABA can be mimicked in aleurone  cells by the introduction of components of the signaling pathway  that act as agonists or antagonists of the hormones.    %%%  The goals of this research are to understand the perception and  transduction of hormonal signals in plants.  Techniques have been  developed to test the hypothesis that some hormones are perceived  at the cell membrane, and perception generates signals that affect  the activity of proteins within the cell. The roles that molecules  such as calcium, calmodulin, and protons play in signal  transduction will be tested using a variety of biochemical and  biophysical techniques. The results will provide fundamental new  knowledge about the nature of the receptors and signal transduction  pathways linking GA and ABA to the response of the cereal aleurone  cell.  ***",
