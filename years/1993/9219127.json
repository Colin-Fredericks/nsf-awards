 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304102  White  This is a collaborative project between Cornell and Brown  Universities.  We propose to study magma genesis and  evolution in St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada through a  multi-disciplinary approach that will include field work,  petrographic study, major element, trace element, Sr, Nd, Pb  and O isotope determination, and K-Ar dating.  Petrographic  study will include both micro probe and laser-ablation-  inductively-coupled-plasma-mass-spectrometry studies.  The  immediate objectives of this study are to:  (1) determine  the contribution of arc crust to the evolution of mantle-  derived magmas in Grenada and St. Lucia, (2) use the most  magnesian of these magmas, some of which are only slightly  evolved since production in the mantle wedge, to investigate  degree of melting and source enrichment, and (3) determine  how magma composition has changed through time on these  islands.  Achieving these objectives allows us to address  several broader objectives.  These are:  enhanced  understanding of (1) magma generation and evolution  processes in island arcs, (2) tectonic evolution of the  Caribbean region, (3) the conditions necessary for crustal  assimilation to occur or not to occur, (4) mass transport  from the subducting slab to island arc magmas, and (5) mass  fluxes of incompatible elements to the deep mantle from  subduction zones.  By focusing on a few localities with an  improved experimental knowledge base, and having a wide  range of data, we believe we can substantially improve  earlier models.  ***",
