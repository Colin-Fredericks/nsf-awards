 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of a coherent                program to determine the stabilizability of nonlinear control                   systems. Understanding stabilizability is important; almost all                 issues in both systems theory and systems practice eventually                   reduce to some version of the stabilization problem.  The                       importance of linear systems theory rests more on the ease of                   testing a linear systems for stabilization than on its linearity                per se.  Earlier work concentrated on the question of short time                local controllability, a necessary condition for stabilizability.               viewed as stabilization by open loop controls while the latter                  is stabilization by closed loop controls. As a result of the                    prior work, one now has computational criteria for deciding STLC.               Work has turned to approximations of nonlinear systems by simpler               ones such as nilpotent systems and systems which are homogeneous                with respect to a dilation.  This work holds promise for a                      relatively comprehensive theory of nonlinear stabilizability.  In               the present project, a new concept of vector fields which are                   stable with respect to measurement are introduced.  The concept                 is closely related to the shadowing ideas of nonlinear dynamics.                It has been shown already that if Brockett's locally onto                       conditions not satisfied then a nonlinear system is not                         locally stabilizable to a vector field which is stable with                     respect to measurement.  Work will also be done using homogeneous               approximations and homogeneous Lagrangians to construct                         dynamic asymptotically stabilizing feedbacks for systems which                  don't satisfy Brockett's locally onto condition using                           approximate feedback linearization and optimal control.                              The combination of mathematical power and                                  engineering applications has long made control theory one of the                healthiest sources of new mathematical themes.  The bridges built               between mathematicians and engineers have provided for                          dynamic interchanges leading to the advancement of both fields.                 This project takes up the problem of what one can do when some of               the traditional tests for stabilizing state feedback control are                not present.  In many important problems, including                             mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints and the inverted               pendulum in a gravity free environment, efforts are to be made                  to construct discontinuous state feedback controls.",
