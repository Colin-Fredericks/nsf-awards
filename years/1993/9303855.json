 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the properties of matter at low temperatures.             Advantage is taken of the well-established properties of He-4 at                low temperatures to illuminate a number of problems in condensed                maatter physics.  One sub-project addresses the influence of                    controlled defects on the critical phenomena of a pure system.  The             introduction of a low density structural impurity into liquid                   helium can produce a striking alteration in the critical pehnomena.             An understanding of this problem will enhance our understanding of              the role of defects for a wider range of phase transitions.  A                  second area is the study of boson localization in He-4 films                    adsorbed on a heterogeneous substrate.  The study of the physics of             a boson system, such a a helium film in the random potential of                 aheterogeneous substrate, offers an interesting complement to                   studies of the metal-insulator transition and the superconductor-               insulator transition in dirty superconductors.  A third topic will              be the study of a dissipative flow of superfluid helium through a               porous medium.  This is a boson analog to the technologically                   important problem of the vortex liquid and flux-flow regimes of                 high Tc superconductors.                                                        %%%                                                                             This project explores the properties of matter at very low                      temperatures--below minus 450 degrees Fahrenheit.  The project                  deals with a superfluid, helium, which exhibits behavior which, by              analogy, can be related to phenomena in other materials,                        particularly high Tc superconductors.  In addition, the research                deals with phase transitions and provides fundamental information               bearing on solid-liquid melting (and other transformations) that                occurs in all materials.",
