 "awd_abstract_narration": "To aid in the implementation of the Environmental Protection                    Agency's priorities for source reduction and recycling, the PI                  plans to develop a systematic procedure for identifying the                     source of treatment problems in terms of the design decisions                   that are the cause of that problem (such as the addition of                     steam as a reactor diluent).  By identifying the design                         decision as the cause, an alternative decision, that will                       avoid the necessity for treatment or disposal, can be                           identified.  This approach is applicable to both continuous                     and batch processes, but since the stream flows are much                        larger in continuous processes, much larger reductions in                       emissions should be possible.                                                                                                                                   A hierarchical decision procedure will be implemented that                      provides a simple way of identifying potential pollution                        problems early in the development stages of a new process.                      The procedure focuses on the decisions required to complete a                   design.  If alternative decisions are made, process                             alternatives are generated.  Some of the decisions affect the                   exit streams from (and the feeds to) the process, and in some                   cases these exit streams can have an adverse environmental                      impact.  Hence, of one  can make decisions, i.e. find                           alternatives, that do not lead to pollution problems, one can                   develop cleaner processes.  The hierarchical decision                           procedure can also be used to decompose existing designs;                       then, process alternatives that eleminate existing pollution                    sources can be identified. ***",
