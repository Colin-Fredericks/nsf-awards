 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns far infrared and microwave magneto-optical               studies of type II superconductors and semiconductor                            heterostructures.  A systematic investigation of vortex core                    excitation resonance and the magneto-optical activity of type II                superconductors will be made.  The goal is to gain an understanding             of high temperature superconductors and vortex dynamics in general.             The magneto-optical studies will look for direct evidence for                   cyclotron resonance and optical activity and search for helicon                 propagation and the ac Hall effect in superconductors.  These                   investigations will break new ground in superconductivity research              and hold the promise of opening new paths for the science and                   technology of superconductors.                                                                                                                                  The work on semiconductor heterostructures will be directed toward              the study of the low lying collective excitations in low                        dimensional electron systems.  The goal of these studies is to                  elucidate electron correlation effects in these strongly                        interacting systems.  Magneto-optical and magneto-transport studies             will be carried out.  These studies may lead to the discovery of                novel condensed phases such as the Wigner crystal or new correlated             liquid phases in 3D or quasi 3D electron systems.  The infrared                 techniques will also be used to study magneto plasmons in 2                     dimensional electron systems.  In this case the interest is the                 observation and study of the magneto-rotons associated with the                 fractional quantum Hall effect.                                                 %%%                                                                             This research concerns fundamental studies of superconductors and               semiconductor heterostructures in high magnetic fields.  The                    studies on superconductors are directed toward improving the                    understanding of the electrodynamics of these materials at                      microwave and infrared frequencies.  They are based on the recent               observation of new magneto-optical effects in these materials and               will be systematically studied in both high temperature                         superconductors and in conventional superconductors.  These studies             are likely to break new ground in superconductivity research and                they hold the promise of opening new paths for the science and                  technology of superconductors.  The work on semiconductor                       heterostructures will be directed toward the investigation of                   collective excitations in low dimensional electron systems.  The                goal of these studies is to elucidate electron correlation effects              in these strongly interacting electron systems.  Magneto-optical                and magneto-transport studies will be carried out and may lead to               the discovery of novel condensed pahses in electron systems.  The               program involves collaboration with both industrial and government              laboratories.",
