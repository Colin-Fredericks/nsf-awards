We know from prior research that heavy escalation is usually accompanied by changes in perceptions of self (or own group) and of the other party, leading to progressive worsening of relations between the parties and further escalation in the next conflict.  But the details of the conditions and processes that produce escalation are as yet unknown.    This project will develop a new, ecologically valid laboratory method for studying the escalation of social conflict and will test some hypotheses derived from a preliminary theory of escalation.  The new method, which has been successfully used in a preliminary study, corrects serious defects in past procedures for studying conflict.  The research is designed to reveal the structure of escalation, its immediate psychological antecedents, and some of the conditions producing it.    Two experiments will examine the effects of blaming the other party for persistent annoyance and relationships with that party.  The rest of the work will involve the development of measures.  New measures of escalation will be devised by having subjects rate the major tactics used to cope with the annoyance.  Subjects will also rate these tactics on three dimensions that are believed to influence choices among them:  effectiveness, normativeness, and likelihood of being resented.  A multiple regression analysis will assess the importance of the dimensions under various conditions.  Many psychological states wi ll also be measured.    The research will advance knowledge of one of the most destructive forces in human experience, helping to interpret -- and hopefully eventually to control -- such phenomena as spouse battering, urban riots, and armed conflict between nations.  om            ` `    Baerwald          3.
