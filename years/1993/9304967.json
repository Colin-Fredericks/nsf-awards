The relative ecological impact of  indigenous and early colonial land use has been a matter of  controversial discussion in recent years, with special attention  having focused on the degree to which native people altered the  environment and the nature of the impact that early European  settlers had on natural systems.  This doctoral dissertation  research project will examine landscape changes over the last  millennium in the Texcoco region of central Mexico, with emphasis  given to the land-use changes and environmental impacts from late  prehistoric times through the period of Spanish conquest and  colonization.  A major goal of the project is explanation of the  causes and antiquity of eroded landscapes and evaluation of  changes in stream networks.  Through archival and field work,  data will be gathered from a variety of different sources,  including historical written and pictorial documents; field  surveys; interpretation of aerial photography; and  sedimentological, stratigraphic, chemical, palynological, and  radiocarbon analyses of soil samples.  A primary hypotheses being  tested by the investigator is the conjecture that the main causes  of landscape evolution, soil erosion in piedmont areas, and  alluvial accumulation in lake margins were rapid increases in  population levels and the intensity of land use during Aztec  dominance followed by the abandonment of lands and introduction  of new forms of land use during Spanish colonial times.       This project will use an integrated methodology to explain  the relative environmental implications of both indigenous and  colonial land-use systems.  In addition to enhancing  understandings of the historical evolution of land-use change  under differe nt cultural and economic regimes, thereby expanding  general knowledge about the human dimensions of global  environmental change, the project will record human and natural  features in the landscape that are being destroyed by  contemporary urbanization and mechanized agriculture.  As a  doctoral dissertation improvement award, this award also will  provide support to enable a promising student to establish a  strong independent research career.  ***",
