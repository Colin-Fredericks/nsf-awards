 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department is using an FTIR to catalyze a major                   revision of laboratory and lecture courses in chemistry. This                   instrument is being used to introduce basic spectrometry to                     students in teacher education programs, to underclass liberal                   arts majors and to bachelor of science majors (including                        chemistry and pre-professional majors) who in the past received                 no exposure to this type of analysis.  Students and faculty at                  the three private colleges and three community colleges allied                  with Kansas Newman also have access to the FTIR.  Its                           application is being further expanded via workshops and                         advanced laboratory experiences for secondary teachers and for                  high school students enrolled in the Junior Academy of Science                  or in the Investigative Summer Science Program.  The FTIR is                    making possible major changes in upper level laboratory courses                 by allowing fast, simple, and highly accurate analysis of all                   types of processes and compounds.",
