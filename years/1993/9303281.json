 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitochondrial DNA sequences from four prosobranch gastropod                genera (Lavigeria, Limnotrochus, Reymondia, Cleopatra) will be used             to examine the effect of explosive speciation on molecular                      variation.  This addresses a current controversy over the question              of whether cladogenesis increases the rate of molecular evolution.              From this data a phylogeny (to be constructed) will be used to test             two competing hypotheses of allopatric speciation; the hypotheses               have been proposed to explain the extreme diversity of endemic                  fauna in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa.  One hypothesis relies on                separation of the lake into distinct basins while the other                     maintains that existing habitat differences are sufficient to drive             speciation.  Sequence divergence from two genes of a highly diverse             endemic clade, its nondiverse sister group, a related sympatric                 genus, and a fluvial outgroup.  Results will show: (a) how                      morphological and molecular divergence are correlated with relative             ages of the clades, and (b) whether morphological and molecular                 divergence are correlated within the diverse clade.  Another goal               is to compare patterns of mitochondrial sequence variation in the               diverse gastropod clade with those from a diverse sympatric cichlid             fish to derive a general lacustrine speciation model and to                     identify conservation priorities.                                               %%%                                                                             The molecular data set to be obtained will be used to test                      phylogenetic conclusions that emerged from previous morphometric                studies of shell, soft anatomy, and electrophoretic characters.                 These molluscs are not particularly well known with regard to                   number of species, life histories, and ecology, so this study will              provide the opportunity to learn details of fundamental biology.                Past studies of Lake Tanganyika focussed on cichlid fish and the                intended studies promise to yield a sort of comparative \"yardstick\"             for those investigations by placing them in a broader context.  In              addition this will be the first molecular genetic study of                      Tanganyikan aquatic invertebrates, despite the fact they are major              components of the benthic ecosystem.",
