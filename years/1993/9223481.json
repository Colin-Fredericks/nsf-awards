 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop systematically new organic              semiconductors, metals, and superconductors through a detailed                  understanding and chemical control of the electronic properties.                The research will initially focus on the synthesis of                           tetramethyltetratellurafulvalene and its charge-transfer and                    complex radical cation salts; preparation of a series of                        dicyclobutenotetrachalcogenafulvalenes and their corresponding                  salts; and the synthesis of a number of tetraoxafulvalenes and                  their salts.  To guide the synthetic program, studies will be                   conducted on physical properties, electrical conductivity,                      themoelectric power, magnetic susceptibility, and scanning                      tunneling microscopy on these salts as well as on new charge-                   transfer and complex radical cation salts from known donors.                                                                                                    The next generation of microelectronic devices is likely to depend              on the development of new organic, organometallic, and inorganic                materials.  Thus, the aim of this research is to develop                        systematically new organic semiconductors, metal, and                           superconductors through a detailed understanding and chemical                   control of the electronic properties.  The research will initially              focus on the synthesis of selected compounds and their charge-                  transfer and complex radical cation salts.  To guide the synthetic              program, studies will be conducted on physical properties,                      electrical conductivity, thermoelectric power, magnetic                         susceptibility, and scanning tunneling microscopy on these salts                and on new charge-transfer and complex radical cation salts from                known donors.  A number of new chemical and physical studies are                designed to help elucidate the switching and memory mechanism in                metal-organic charge transfer salts.",
