 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hormone insulin binds to its specific receptor at the plasma                membrane of the cell. This binding initiates two processes. In the              first, the receptor itself is chemically modified by the addition               of phosphate functions to signal the cell to the presence of                    insulin. The cell then modifies its metabolism in response to this              signal. In the second process, insulin binding causes the insulin-              receptor complex to be taken into the cell itself. In the past,                 these two processes have been studied as independent, unrelated                 events. However, preliminary data indicate that these two processes             are inter-dependent, related events. The receptor acquires more                 phosphate as it moves from the plasma membrane into the cell. In                addition, the highly phosphorylated receptor also is a better                   signal-mediator than the less phosphorylated receptor at the plasma             membrane. The goals of this project are to understand  how these                phosphate groups are added to and removed from the insulin                      receptor, and if, in the intact cell, the highly phosphorylated                 internal receptor is involved in the generation of the insulin                  signal.",
