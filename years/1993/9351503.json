This is being accomplished by introducing microcomputer-based  experiments into our physics laboratories and the physics  elective courses, Astronomy and Energy and the Environment.   Students are employing the computers to collect, analyze and  graph experimental data.  The immediate feedback students  receive encourages participation and innovation.  Support was  obtained for software and hardware for six, networked Macintosh  Si color computers each equipped with a Universal Lab Interface  and a variety of probes and sensors and a networked printer.   A modem is used to obtain software from remote locations.  A  CD-ROM drive improves the curriculum of the elective courses.   Software, including a spreadsheet, physics and astronomy  simulations, and utilities, has also been purchased.  This  project is stimulating the teaching of physics related courses  at the College.  It exposes students to modern apparatus and  data collection techniques.  It will prepares and encourages  students, especially women, minorities, and mature students, to  consider careers in science.  Without this grant,  implementation would have taken many years to accomplish.  ***",
