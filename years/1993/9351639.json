 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351639  Burke         This project is improving the quality of instruction in the  Minot State University Psychology curriculum. Psychology's  previous affiliation with the Education Department necessitated  a curriculum centered on supporting the goal of teacher  training. As a separate department, Psychology has now  diversified its curriculum to include core courses in which a  laboratory experience for our students is essential.  Minot  State's students primarily come from rural areas, where  exposure to psychology is limited and experience with  laboratory facilities is nil. The majority of our psychology  majors are female (71%), and ten percent of their majors are  Native Americans who have had little educational opportunity to  work with laboratory equipment. This project is allowing Minot  State's Psychology Department to establish a psychological  laboratory with computers providing the major experiential  base. With modern technology, students are simulating  experiments, equipment, and physiological dissecting at a great  cost savings to the university and with adaptability for the  future. This project is giving students the opportunity to  dramatically increase their understanding of Psychology as a  science.  ***",
