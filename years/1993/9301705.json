The program's                                    awards provide opportunities for joint                                          research, and the use of unique or                                              complementary facilities, expertise and                                         experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Judith C.                                    Yang to work with Dr. Manfred Ruhle at the Max                                  Planck Institute for Metals Research in                                         Stuttgart, Germany.                                                                                                                                             Dr. Yang proposes to do two experiments for the                                 fundamental study of the atomic structure,                                      chemistry and electronic structure of two                                       similar model metal-ceramic systems, Pt-NiO and                                 Ni-NiO, by electron microscopy techniques.  For                                 the NiO-Pt system, an intermetallic interlayer,                                 NiPt, is expected to form at the interface by                                   heat treatment at suitable temperature, time                                    and oxygen activity as suggested by phase                                       diagrams and previous work.  The chemistry and                                  the electronic structure due to formation of                                    the intermetallic compound will be studied                                      using electron energy loss spectroscopy.  For a                                 more fundamental study of fine changes in the                                   electronic structure due to the presence of an                                  interface, a simpler system, Ni-NiO, will be                                    studied with energy loss near edge                                              spectroscopy.                                                                                                                                                   The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel and a stipend for                                    twelve months.",
