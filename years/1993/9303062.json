 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diffusion of molecular species on solid surfaces is an                      important step in most heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. The                   detailed investigation of surface diffusion is the subject of                   this research project supported by the Analytical and Surface                   Chemistry Program.  A pulsed molecular beam-surface infrared                    spectrometer system has been constructed to investigate the                     transport of CO, NO, and substituted isonitriles on stepped                     palladium and nickel surfaces.  Step and terrace populations                    will be characterized, low and high coverage diffusion                          measurements made, and transient mobility studies carried out                   during the course of this project.  This work will provide a                    very comprehensive picture of molecular transport on well                       characterized surfaces.                                                         %%%                                                                             The transport of molecules across surfaces is an important step                 in reactions which are mediated by these surfaces.  In order to                 develop a detailed understanding of surface reactions such as                   corrosion and catalysis, information about the mechanism and                    rate of surface diffusion must be obtained.  This research                      project combines molecular beam dosing methods with surface                     infrared spectroscopy to directly measure the diffusion of                      small molecules on catalytically important surfaces.",
