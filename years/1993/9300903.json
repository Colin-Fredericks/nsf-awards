 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Microbiology Department of                     the University of Texas at Austin to continue their                             successful REU Site program designed to introduce gifted                        undergraduates to productive molecular biology laboratory                       research. A ten-week summer program, involving ten students                     each year, will provide to each participant a stipend, room                     & board and tuition for an independent research course.                         Participants will be actively recruited nationwide, but                         emphasis in recruitment and selection will be given to                          undergraduates who would not otherwise have the opportunity                     for original research, especially minority students.                            Students will work in well-funded and equipped labs in which                    the research covers both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems                     and deals with membrane transport, DNA replication and                          recombination, gene expression and developmental control,                       immunological mechanisms, and viral transformation.                             Participants will work individually with faculty mentors but                    have access to all faculty through seminars and informal                        discussions, in a format similar to that of our successful                      earlier programs. New aspects in this year's program                            include discussion of scientific ethics issues and emphasis                     on opportunities in biotechnology. Follow-up activities will                    promote interest in research careers and encourage students                     to apply to graduate schools in molecular biology. UT Austin                    makes a strong commitment to this program, including support                    for a dedicated program coordinator.",
