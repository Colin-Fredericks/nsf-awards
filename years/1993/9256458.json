A group of 9 faculty in physical, inorganic, and  chemical toxicology, will join in a coordinated study of the  production, dispersion, and removal of chemical species in the  natural environment, and their interactions with biological  systems.  Among the topics to be addressed are chemical  processes in the stratosphere; detection of trace atomospheric  pollutants; spectroscopy of hydrocarbon free radicals found in  combustion; synthesis of improved materials for fuel cells and  catalytic converters; biochemical studies of methanotrophic  bacteria; molecular biology of environmental carcinogens; and  theoretical analyses of pollutant diffusion in the atmosphere.  New classroom subjects and seminars on the relations between  chemistry, technology, and environmental policy will be offered  as part of the program.  %%%  Chemical processes involving trace gases in the atmosphere,  such as catalytic ozone destruction, gobal warming due to  methane and carbon dioxide, and tropospheric pollution by  nitrogen and sulfur oxides are now widely recognized as  critical environmental threats.  A principal focus of the MIT  graduate traineeship program will be on the kinetics and  spectroscopy of atmospheric molecules and radicals.  The goal  of this effort is to train a new generation of chemists better  equipped to understand and deal with these important  environmental issues.  ***",
