 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricanes disrupt forest canopies, resulting in increased                 light levels both in gaps and beneath overstory trees.  Because                 such increases are likely to be transient in forests in which                   advance recruits and resprouting trees grow rapidly, study of the               responses of vegetation to hurricanes must occur within a short                 period of time following impact.  On August 24, 1992, the south                 eyewall of Hurricane Andrew impacted patches of subtropical                     hardwood forests (hammocks) imbedded in slash pine savannas on Long             Pine Key in Everglades National Park, Florida.  Mapped plots in                 which all tress > 2 cm dbh had been tagged and measured had been                established at the time of the hurricane in both burned and                     unburned hammocks.  First, the project will measure damage and                  mortality of trees in burned and unburned subtropical hammocks and              examine patterns of recovery of trees in burned and unburned                    subtropical hammocks and examine patterns of recovery of trees over             the year following the hurricane.  Second, it will assess effects               of the hurricane on epiphytes by censusing plants in plots located              in both burned and unburned hammocks.  These data will be used to               explore whether the trees and epiphytes respond similarly (and in               what ways) to the large-scale disturbances of fires and hurricanes.             %%%                                                                             Ecological systems must constantly respond to stresses on several               temporal & spatial scales.  This study provides quantitative                    assessment if the damage & patterns of recovery of populations of               tropical trees in subtropical hammocks.  Results of this study will             be directly comparable to others in the impacts of severe                       hurricanes on subtropical forests.  In addition, by comparing the               impact of Hurricane Andrew on trees in burned & unburned hammocks,              this study provides a rare opportunity to compare the effects of                two major disturbances.",
