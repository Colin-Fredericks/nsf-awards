 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenetic studies of genera restricted to the Andean paramo             and puna provide a unique opportunity to explore evolutionary                   processes in tropical, high elevation environments.  Dr. Ayers is               studying the Andean plant genus Lysipomia of the Campanulaceae                  family, currently thought to comprise about 30 species of \"cushion\"             plants.  Two species are widespread and have many named,                        geographically restricted subspecies and varieties.  The remaining              species show little or no infraspecific variation and have                      extremely narrow ranges, with many endemic to a single ridge top or             volcanic cone.  These endemics occur throughout the Andes, but the              greatest species diversity is found in Ecuador and Peru on both                 sides of a major geologic division of the northern Andes known as               the Piura Divide or the Huancabamba Depression.  Phylogenetic                   studies employing modern molecular and traditional morphological                characters will test whether this geologic barrier and recent                   climatic changes associated with it have played an important role               in the evolutionary history of Lysipomia.                                       %%%                                                                                  Mechanisms or processes of evolutionary change can be studied              only against the background of known patterns of change, in the                 origin and extinction of species.  Dr. Ayers in a research planning             grant begins a molecular (DNA-based) and morphological study of the             patterns of diversification in a group of high-elevation \"cushion\"              plants, in relation to their geographical distribution in the                   northern Andes.  Field work to make plant collections combined with             laboratory study of chloroplast DNA mutations and herbarium study               of morphological features will provide insight into patterns of                 species divergence and the role of geographical barriers and                    dispersal routes.",
