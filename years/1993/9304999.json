 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304999  Biel  The ultimate objective of this research is to elucidate the  mechanism by which oxygen regulates tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in  Rhodobacter capsulatus.  Recent evidence has suggested that the  condensation of two aminolevulinate molecules to form the first  pyrrolic intermediate, porphobilinogen, is regulated by oxygen.   This step is catalyzed by the enzyme prophobilinogen synthase, the  product of the hemB gene.  The research described in this proposal  seeks to determine whether oxygen regulates transcription of the  hemB gene, which encodes porphobilinogen synthase, or the activity  of this enzyme, or both.  Transcriptional regulation of the hemB  gene will be investigated by measuring hemB mRNA production and  degradation in cultures grown under high and low oxygen.  Oxygen-  mediated regulation of porphobilinogen synthase activity will be  measured by following the kinetics of protoporphyrin formation  during a shift-up in oxygen tension.  If oxygen regulates  porphobilinogen synthase activity, protoporphyrin accumulation  should stop immediately upon oxygenation of the culture.   Antibodies against porphobilinogen synthase will be used to  determine if oxygen causes increased degradation of the enzyme.  %%%  In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, a single  branched pathway is used to make heme and bacteriochlorophyll.   Oxygen greatly reduced the expression of this pathway.  The step at  which oxygen regulates this pathway has been located, and the  research described in this proposal seeks to determine whether  oxygen regulates the synthesis of the enzyme porphobilinogen  synthase, the activity of the enzyme, or both.  ***",
