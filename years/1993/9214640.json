 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests fund for renovation of                              laboratory facilities in Krieger Hall, a primary                                research laboratory building.  The renovation and                               remodeling will provide the resources to locate                                 more members of the Department of Biomedical                                    Engineering in proximity to other engineering                                   departments with a greater opportunity for joint                                research in areas including biomedical sensors,                                 biomaterial and biomedical imaging systems.  Funds                              will also be used for renovating an                                             interdisciplinary, interdepartmental                                            microfabrication facility for researchers in the                                G.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering.  The                                      development of such a facility will require major                               renovation or replacement of an existing clean room                             to add exhaust systems for safe use of chemicals                                and gases needed in microfabrication, and an                                    improved air filtration systems to reduce particle                              counts.                                                                              The facility will be used by faculty                                       throughout the engineering school including faculty                             in biomedical, electrical, chemical engineering,                                and materials science in the conduct of sponsored                               research. Ongoing projects in diverse areas such as                             microfabricated biomedical sensors, compound                                    semiconductors lasers, microwave devices, analog                                integrated circuits, electoractive polymers, porous                             silicon studies, barrier properties of polyamide                                layers, would benefit from this facility.  Use of                               this common facility by the participants and their                              trainees (postdocs, graduate and undergraduate                                  students) will improve the interdisciplinary                                    interactions in this technical area.",
