 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to investigate scent production in Clarkia, a               genus of annual plants native to California.  Clarkia breweri is                the only species in the genus with scented flowers.  C. breweri                 flowers are visited mostly by hawkmoths.  The odorless flowers of               C. concinna, a closely related species, are visited mostly by                   butterflies and flies, whereas all other outcrossing Clarkia                    species are pollinated by bees.  We have identified four major                  components of the scent of C. breweri flowers.  They are linalool,              linalool oxide, benzyl acetate, and methyl salicylate, all                      important ingredients in manufactured perfumes.  We propose to                  conduct a formal genetic study of the genes controlling the                     production of these compounds in C. breweri, and to use molecular               biological techniques to isolate the gene encoding the enzyme                   linalool synthase (LS) that catalyzed the synthesis of linalool.                The genetic changes underlying the ability of C. breweri to make                linalool, while its close relatives do not, will be examined.                   %%%                                                                             Flower scents have profound effects on the reproduction of plants               and are also important in many man-made products.  However, the                 synthesis of flower scents has been scarcely investigated on the                genetic and molecular level and the results obtained from this work             will produce significant insights into this process.",
