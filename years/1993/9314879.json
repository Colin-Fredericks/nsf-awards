 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to fund a workshop composed of NSF grantees whose              awards were made in the two years of competitions under the                     Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology (CTCT) Initiative              and grantees of subsequent awards in these fields. The total number             of grants involved is thirty-three, an increase of eight from last              year.  This year, awardees whose research is in robotic                         coordination will also participate.  Those awards made from the                 Robotics and Machine Intelligence Program constitute evidence of                the growth of the field into other program funding domains.  The                purposes of the workshop are:  First, to provide a forum for the                exchange of knowledge in the form of perspectives, findings,                    methods and theory for this young, interdisciplinary field.                     Second, to provide an opportunity for the field to coalesce and                 grow.  While certain subsets of the community of researchers mingle             at various professional meetings, as a whole, these investigators               do not have regular contact.  The workshop provides an opportunity              to establish an identity for the area of work and to plan                       subsequent activities.  Third, this provides an opportunity for the             research from these projects to be made more visible to the                     Washington-based research funding and policy community.  This                   workshop represents a planning opportunity for the IT&O Program.                The future research agenda for CTCT funding and community-building              is an important part of the workshop program.  The workshop will be             held on July 8-10, 1993 in Arlington, Virginia.  A workshop report              will be prepared and made available. //",
