 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study plasma turbulance in the solar corona              and solar wind using radio propagation techniques.  The sources of              the radio waves are extragalactic radio sources which emit                      partially linearly polarized radiation over a wide frequency range.             The sources are observed with standard radioastronomical                        instruments such as the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long                    Baseline Array (VLBA).  When these sources are viewed through the               turbulent plasma medium of the corona and solar wind, various                   distortion or \"blurring\" effects may be observed.  From                         measurements of these effects, information about the intensity,                 spatial power spectrum, and physical nature of the turbulence can               be deduced.  During the proposed grant period information on                    coronal turbulence will be obtained from two types of observation.              The first is a measurement of angular broadening or \"blurring\" of               a radio source viewed through a turbulent medium.  These                        observations will be carried out with the VLA and VLBA.  The second             type of observation consists of measurement of Faraday Rotation of              the plane of polarization of alinearly polarized radio source.                  These observations will be made with the VLA and will provide                   information on variations in the magnetic field in the corona as                well as density variations.  Finally, theoretical work will be made             which relates radioastronomical observables to properties of                    coronal plasma waves.                                                           #",
