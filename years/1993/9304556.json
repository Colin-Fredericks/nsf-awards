PIP and PIP2 levels are relatively low in  higher plants.  This laboratory has isolated a 49 kDa protein from  carrot cells that activates phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4-kinase, the  enzyme that synthesizes PIP.  The 49 kDa PI kinase activator,  designated PIK-A49, is a multifunctional protein.  It binds and  bundles actin and has translational elongation factor-1-alpha  activity.  This research is based on the working hypothesis that  PIK-A49 plays an important role in coordinating the status of PIP  metabolism, the actin cytoskeleton, and protein synthesis within  the cell. PIK-A49 and PI kinase are present in the plasma membrane,  actin cytoskeleton and soluble fractions of carrot cells.  Changes  in the membrane and cytoskeletal PI kinase activity have been  observed within seconds of exposing carrot cells to external  stimuli.  Whether PIP and PIP2 serve as precursors of second  messengers or as direct membrane effectors, understanding the  mechanism of regulation of PIP and PIP2 biosynthesis is essential  in order to understand their roles in signal transduction.  The  goals of this research are to understand the mechanism of  regulation of PIP biosynthesis in response to environmental stimuli  and to understand how these changes in PIP metabolism might affect  cell physiology.  For these studies, carrot suspension culture  cells will be used as a model system and two stimuli, one that  increases PI 4-kinase activity and one that decreases PI 4-kinase  activity.  Specific questions to be addressed are:  What is the  mechanism of activation of PI 4-kinase by PIK-A49?  Is there a  change in the distribution of PIK-A49, PI kinase or F-actin in  response to stimuli, and if so, what causes the change in  distribution?  This work provides a different perspective  of PIP  metabolism--one focused on PIP synthesis.  In addition, the fact  that the PIK-A49 activates PI 4-kinase, binds and bundles actin,  and has elongation factor activity adds a new dimension to the  potential for cross-talk among the plasma membrane, cytoskeleton,  and protein synthesis machinery within plant cells during responses  to environmental stimuli.  %%%  Little is known about the mechanisms used by plants to sense  environmental signals.  This investigator has shown that a subset  of very negatively charged lipids in the outer membranes of plant  cells undergo chemical changes in response to environmental  stimuli.  The biosynthesis of these lipids is regulated by an  activator protein that can also regulate the structure of the  cytoskeleton and protein synthesis within the cell.  This finding  suggested that the activator protein may serve to communicate the  changes in the plant's environment from the outer membrane to the  rest of the cell.  The goals of this research are to understand how  biosynthesis of these lipids is regulated and to determine whether  the activator protein acts as a sensor to communicate environmental  signals to the interior of the plant cell.***",
