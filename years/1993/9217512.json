 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                   in massively parallel computer systems between Milos Ercegovac                  of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Jean                   Michel Muller of the Ecole Normale Superieure, Lyon, France.                    The research focuses on theory, design and applications of an on-               line arithmetic approach with the ultimate goal of implementing                 a class of fast and cost-effective algorithms suitable for specific             parallel computer systems.  The UCLA group brings to this                       collaboration their expertise on theory and design of an on-line                arithmetic approach and implementation of arithmetic algorithms                 and structures in field programmable arrays.  This is                           complemented by the French investigator's extensive experience                  in custom VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) and its                           application to massively parallel computers.                                                                                                                    Fast implementations for basic arithmetic operations have been                  of major interest since the development of the first generation of              computers.  Most current designs have been used in general-                     purpose and multiple processor systems, so that solutions that are              suitable for more specialized situations have not been fully                    explored.  The proposed cooperative research explores possible                  solutions and will enhance the development of specialized                       systems which require both high speed and the capability for                    executing algorithms composed of a large number of arithmetic                   operations.",
