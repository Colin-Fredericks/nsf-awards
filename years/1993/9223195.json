 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project Profs. W.R. Gentry and C.F. Giese of the                        University of Minnesota will conduct basic research on the                      dynamics of molecular energy transfer at temperatures in the                    range from 1K to less than 1 mK, and will perform crossed beam                  studies of reactions involving hydrogen atoms with methane and                  silane molecules, as well as study reactions on weakly bound                    clusters.                                                                       %%%                                                                             Previous studies at extremely low temperatures have been                        conducted nearly exclusively in condensed phase systems.  The                   present research at ultra low temperatures is devoted to                        theinvestigation of phenomena of bimolecular collisions in the                  gas phase.  The extremely low kinetic energies are expected to                  reveal the highly quantum mechanical nature of the                              translational, as well as internal, motions under such                          conditions.  The isotopic exchange and substitution reactions                   involving hydrogen atoms with methane of silane molecules or                    their isotopic variants at elevated temperatures has revealed                   unexpected behavior.  The present research under low                            temperature beam conditions will provide critical data to                       assist in the understanding of these processes.  The work on                    cluster reactions is directed toward the understanding of the                   elementary dynamics of cluster growth, exchange and metathesis                  reactions as function of cluster size, composition, and energy                  available.",
