 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on electronic devices fabricated in thin films of                      amorphous silicon (a-Si) or polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) has                  recently gained momentum due to a variety of new applications                   for these devices.  For example, the efficiency of                              experimental solar cells produced using a-Si films currently                    exceeds 12%.  These efficiencies make such devices attractive                   for the realization of large area, low cost photovoltaic                        energy conversion systems.  Another example is a-Si and p-Si                    thin film transistors (TFTs) which have made possible the                       fabrication of full color, flat panel displays.  Such displays                  can be used in laptop computers and in future high definition                   TV.  In addition to flat panel displays, TFTs fabricated in a-                  Si or p-Si can be used as switching elements in other large                     area electronic systems such as lenseless contact-type image                    sensors and position sensitive detectors.  All of these                         devices (flat panel displays, image sensors and position                        sensitive detectors) are fabricated on low cost glass                           substrates; therefore the manufacturing temperatures must be                    kept below 600 C to avoid glass distortion.  In the case of                     hydrogenated a-Si devices, the process temperatures should be                   below 450 C to avoid deterioration of the electronic                            properties of the a-Si.                                                                                                                                         Oxidation of single crystal silicon (c-Si) has been used in                     the successful development and manufacture of integrated                        circuits.  The importance of silicon oxidation is that thermal                  oxidation of silicon results in the growth of a high quality                    insulator and passivation layer with an interface to silicon                    that has relatively few surface traps which alter device                        properties and affect device stability.  Oxidation                              temperatures used in the production of silicon integrated                       circuits is in the range of 800 to 1100 C.                                      An alternative method will be tested in this research, the                      plasma oxidation or anodization process, in which the grown                     film is exposed to reactive ions, electron, atomic oxygen, and                  ultra violet (UV) photons during oxidation.  This exposure                      leads to enhancement of the oxidation rates at low                              temperatures.  Electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasmas will                  be used to oxidize or anodize a-Si and p-Si films.  The                         oxidation kinetics of these processes will be studied as                        functions of the substrate temperature and plasma process                       conditions.  Electronic devices will be fabricated and their                    characteristics correlated with growth conditions.  This                        technology could impact the manufacture of low cost, high                       reliability, flat panel displays and solar cells.***//",
