This response involves the  action of two regulatory proteins: LexA, which represses about 20  SOS genes during normal growth, and RecA, which is activated by  inducing treatments to a form that catalyzes the specific cleavage  of LexA repressor, inactivating it and leading to induction of the  SOS genes.  Hence, specific cleavage plays a crucial role in the  SOS response.  In addition to this central regulatory role of LexA  cleavage, this reaction is of considerable biochemical interest.   Its mechanism is unusual, in that LedA cleaves itself in an  intramolecular reaction termed autodigestion, and activated RecA  acts to stimulate LexA self-cleavage under physiological  conditions.  In these conditions, LexA cleavage is designed to  proceed slowly, but at the same time to be capable of large rate  increases.  This view raises two related questions: What is the  mechanism of LexA autodigestion, and how can RecA protein  facilitate this reaction? Three complementary approaches are  proposed to address these questions.  The first is to continue to  isolate and characterize mutations that influence the rate of LexA  cleavage.  The second approach is to continue to develop the  bimolecular LexA cleavage reaction, in which one molecule of LexA   or lambda repressor acts as an enzyme to cleave other molecules of  LexA.  The third approach is to look for physical evidence that  LexA can exist in two different conformational states.    %%%  An increasingly large number of biologically important reactions  are being discovered that are intramolecular.  These include self-  splicing RNA introns, autophosphorylation and autophosphatase  activity of chemotaxis proteins, and autophosphorylation of  oncogeny proteins, growth factor receptors, and other important  proteins. The proposed work is of general significance for the  ins ights it is expected to yield regarding the properties of  intramolecular self-processing reactions, and the means by which  the rated of these reactions can be regulated by interactions with  other effector molecules.  ***",
