 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to characterize a series of silver                 halide chalcogenide compounds for the purpose of deducing transport             mechanisms from the patterns and trends observed.  The effect of                chemical substitution on ionic motion also is examined.  Several                solid mixtures are prepared by mixing silver halides and silver                 chalcogenides.  Techniques such as x-ray diffraction, calorimetry,              and electrical conductivity are used to characterize the prepared               solid mixtures.                                                                                                                                                 Solid-state electrolytes are being investigated for their potential             use in high-power, light-weight batteries.  Among the array of                  possible electrolytic materials, those containing silver typically              are found to be good conductors, and thus they are of interest as               potential battery electrolytes.  In this work, fast ion conductors              are prepared from silver halides and silver calcogenides.  In a                 systematic survey, crystal structure, thermal properties, and                   electrical properties of the cited class of ionic materials are                 determined to access their suitability for eventual use in                      batteries.",
