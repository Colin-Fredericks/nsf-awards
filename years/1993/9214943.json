 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the Kagome lattices will be studied              for quantum spins at large spin values and for classical spins at               low temperature.  Starting from the spin-wave approximation with                anharmonic terms, effective Hamiltonians will be found expressing               selection of (1) coplanar states, out of a continuum of degenerate              classical ground states, and, (2) a particular ordered state, out               of the discrete infinity of coplanar ground states.  This ongoing               work will be extended to study dilution disorder, spin tunneling,               and (in the Kagome case) interlayer couplings.  Certain discrete                spin models in two dimensions can be mapped to solid-on-solid                   models in higher dimensions.  Monte Carlo will be used to study the             constrained Potts model, a new family of this type in higher                    dimension.  The degree of order in the ground state of the spin                 one-half triangular antiferromagnet near the Ising limit will also              be studied.                                                                     %%%                                                                             This theoretical research will focus on properties of frustrated                antiferromagnets.  The PI is a former Presidential Young                        Investigator.  Frustrated antiferromagnets are of interest for a                variety of reasons.  The new high temperature superconductors are               antiferromagnets in their normal state and this antiferromagnetism              is thought to possibly play a role in producing their unique                    superconducting properties.  The role played by the competition                 between disorder and magnetism in determining the properties of                 magnetic materials is a basic one which has eluded explanation.                 Finally, the statistical mechanics of novel lattice systems is also             of basic interest.",
