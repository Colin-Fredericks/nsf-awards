 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research in              chemical engineering between Peter A. Monson of the University                  of Massachusetts and Martin L. Rosinberg of the Pierre and Marie                Curie University in Paris.  The investigators propose theoretical               molecular studies on the adsorption of fluids in porous materials.              They will examine mixtures where significant nonideal behavior                  occurs in the bulk fluid state in order to understand how the                   behavior of the fluids are modified by confinement in porous                    materials.                                                                                                                                                      Both the U.S. and French research groups have longstanding                      research programs in the statistical mechanics of adsorption.  Dr.              Monson and his research team bring to this collaboration expertise              in Monte Carlo simulations of adsorption.  This is complemented                 by Dr. Rosinberg's innovative theoretical approach based on                     density functional theory.  The work will be supplemented by                    integral equation theories and analytic solutions of one dimensional            models.  Their combined efforts are aimed at validating the                     potential of this theoretical approach through comparisons with the             results of Monte Carlo calculations.  The topic is timely and has               important technological applications ranging from adsorption                    separations to heterogeneous catalysis to modeling reservoir fluids             in enhanced oil recovery.",
