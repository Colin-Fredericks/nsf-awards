 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to                develop preliminary data for a critical test of the hypothesis that             carotenoids function as blue light photoreceptors in the                        phototropic response of corn coleoptiles.  Current thinking in the              field ascribes the role of blue light photoreceptor to flavins or               flavoproteins.  Recent work in this laboratory, however, has                    provided tantalizing evidence for a role of the carotenoid,                     zeaxanthin in blue light photoreception.  The research proposed                 here addresses the question of whether this molecule serves as the              photoreceptor for coleoptile phototropism, a well characterized                 blue light response.  Pilot studies with corn coleoptiles have                  shown that they operate the xanthophyll cycle and have zeanthin                 concentrations that track their light environment.  Proposed                    experiments are designed to correlate the extent of the phototropic             response with prevailing zeaxanthin concentrations in the                       coleoptile, and to establish whether coleoptile chloroplasts show               a blue light response.  Other experiments with corn mutants having              an altered pigment composition will seek to correlate changes in                phototropic sensitivity with their pigment content.                             Characterization of the blue light sensing mechanism in the                     coleoptile system would significantly enhance our understanding of              blue light sensory transduction in plants.                                      %%%                                                                             One of the most fundamental responses of a plant to its environment             is that the growing tip of a young plant shoot turns and grows                  toward light.  Blue light is most effective in eliciting this                   response, but the mechanism by which plant tips sense blue light is             not yet understood.  As the first step in the response blue light               must be absorbed by a specific chemical compound, but the chemical              photoreceptor has not yet been identified with certainty.                       Establishing the nature of the blue light photoreceptor would be an             important contribution to understanding of this fundamental plant               response.  Circumstantial evidence has led most investigators in                the field to believe that the photoreceptor is probably a type of               organic molecule known as a \"flavin\".  Dr. Zeiger, however, has                 obtained some results suggesting that a different class of organic              molecule, a \"carotenoid\" may be the real blue light receptor. If a              carotenoid is, indeed, the blue light photoreceptor this would be               a very important advance, but the evidence at present is too                    incomplete to justify launching a full scale research program on                the subject.  This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will permit             Dr. Zeiger to develop sufficient preliminary data to determine                  whether a full scale project should be undertaken to study the                  function of carotenoids as blue light photoreceptors.",
