 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to improve the teaching of                          biomechanics in undergraduate physical education courses, and                   to improve the quality of independent studies completed by                      undergraduate physical education students. The grant assisted                   in purchasing a Video Analysis System that allows the                           quantitative kinematic analysis of movement, and the graphical                  presentation of data superimposed over a video image of skill                   performance. Classroom instruction is being improved by the                     system since mechanical principles such as the work-energy                      relationship can be graphically presented in relation to skill                  acquisition, pathological movement patterns, injury mechanisms,                 and errors in skill performance. The video system supplements                   existing laboratory equipment for the measurement of force and                  muscle activity, and it allows undergraduate students to                        conduct independent projects quantifying both kinematic                         (movement patterns) and kinetic (forces affecting movement)                     aspects of human movement.",
