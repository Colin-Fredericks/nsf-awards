 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308917  Smith  This work addresses the problem of modeling systems in a robust  control framework.  Analysis and synthesis in this framework are  relatively well developed.  However, the lack of a compatible  modeling and identification theory is slowing the practical  application of robust control.      The problem to be addressed is the following: How accurately must  a system, or component of a system, be modeled in order to  maintain stability and achieve a specified closed loop  performance objective?  This problem is generalized to the case  where other system components themselves are uncertain (to within  known bounds).  This immediately leads to the problem of  connecting the required accuracy with the taking of experimental  data.  An iterative identification/modeling approach is proposed  for both experimental and theoretical study.      The models considered are standard in the robust control  framework: linear, time-invariant with Hoo norm bounded  perturbations.  Closed loop performance is specified as a general  weighted Hoo criterion.    Progress on these problems will provide a more direct connection  between the rich theoretical area of Hoo robust control and its  application to practical problems.  This will also lead to a  better understanding of what types of physical uncertainties can  be usefully modeled as linear fractional perturbations.  ***",
