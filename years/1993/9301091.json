 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the 1993 Gordon Research                Conference on Temperature Stress in Plants, which will be held at               the Casa Sirena MarinaHotel, Oxnard, California on February 1-5,                1993.  Funds will be used to partially defray the travel expenses               of invited speakers, session chairs, and junior scientists                      (graduate students and postdoctoral researchers).                                                                                                               This is the fifth meeting of the Gordon Research Conference on                  Temperature Stress in Plants, which began in 1984 and has met                   biennially since 1989. Sessions are scheduled in the areas of                   freezing, chilling and high temperature stress and will include                 presentations ranging from whole plant responses to gene                        regulation.  In addition, a session on global climate change will               be featured at the 1993 Conference.  A goal of these sessions will              be to delineate the crucial interations of temperature stress and               other environmental variables that are needed to predict likely                 responses of natural ecosystems and crop species at regional/global             scales and to identify realistic goals that can be achieved in                  modifying plant species to improve their tolerance to temperature               stresses.  Such assessments, which require input of scientists                  working at all levels within thecontinuum of research on                        temperature stress, are crucial to policy-makers who seek                       information about the future of natural ecosystems and agricultural             productivity.",
