The specific goals of LaCEPT              are to 1) establish a statewide consortium of key partners; 2)                  deepen understanding of reform issues; 3) develop a statewide                   strategic plan; 4) establish partnerships between school and                    college sectors; 5) reorder campus priorities and faculty rewards               systems; 6) redesign preservice courses in mathematics, science and             methods; 7) revise instructional materials; 8) increase the number              of certified teachers in science and mathematics, focusing on                   underrepresented groups; 9) expand the boundaries of research and               practice; 10) maintain national standards for teacher performance               as students progress from preservice to certification to extended               service.  The signature program of LaCEPT will be sponsorship of                campus-based renewal projects at Louisiana's public and private                 colleges and universities. Each campus will develop a plan for                  long-term systemic renewal and will fashion a distinctive proposal              engaging mathematics, science and education faculty in the redesign             of curriculum, instructional materials, assessment; mentorships and             internships, partnerships with schools; research and technology                 centers; precollege recruiting of potential teachers; revision of               certification standards.",
