 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304763        Rimoldi       We are approaching the era of personal communication which  requires an infrastructure capable of providing untethered access  to a global network from any point on (and above) the surface of  the earth. Implementation of this scenario requires efficient  communication via a wireless network. One major component of a  wireless network is the Gaussian multiple-access channel.       The objective of the proposed research is to extend recent  results of the principal investigator leading to a novel procedure  to construct codes for this channel.       The following two steps have led to the proposed procedure.  Step 1  A simpler channel model called G-adder channel was  considered and multiple-access codes for this channel were studied.  The G-adder channel associated to some finite group G has inputs  that are elements of G and output that is the sum (over G) of the  inputs. To start on a more familiar ground it was assumed that G is  the additive group of a finite field F. It was shown that  multiple-access codes for such G-adder channels can be studied and  constructed in a framework that is akin to the algebraic theory  of error control codes. Two simple procedures to construct  multiple-access codes with desirable properties via maximum  distance separable codes were given. A G-adder channel does not  arise naturally. It can be created on a local area network by means  of \"smart\" nodes that add information symbols according to the  arithmetic in G.  A stronger motivation for the study or G-adder  channels came from step two.  Step 2:  It has been shown that it is  possible to decompose the Gaussian multiple-access channel into a  number of independent G-adder channels provided that each such  channel is then used to transmit multiple-access codewords over G  considered in step one. The decomposition is obtained via T  \"modulators\" (one for each channel input node) and a \"demodulator.\"  The modulator outputs are lattice-type signal-space codewords for  the Gaussian  channel.  ***      Compared to spread spectrum (the common practice) the codes  resulting from  steps 1 and 2 above have the following advantages: (l) They are  designed  keeping in mind that interference and noise are two distinct  problems that  need different solutions. In particular, active users do not  contribute to  the noise level of other users; (2) Decoding is simple and  algebraic;  (3)  There is no bandwidth expansion. in the sense that while taking  care of the  problem of assigning the channel to busy users. the codes allow  transmission of the same amount of information that would be  possible via  time-division multiple-access (or frequency-division  multiple-access).  (4)  They support transmission of several bits per dimension which is an  important attribute for codes designed to operate in a bandlimited  environment. (5) They are natural offspring of the powerful coding  and  shaping techniques that have revolutionized the design of  signal-space  codes for the (single-user) bandlimited Gaussian channel. (6) They  have the  properties that are needed for the codes assumed in recently  proposed  random-access protocols with multiple reception capability. These  protocols  can achieve throughputs arbitrarily close to 1.",
