 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first part of this project is concerned with two types                 of stochastic differential equations: equations with                            discontinuous paths and reflecting boundary conditions, and                     forward-backward equations, possibly with discontinuous paths.                  Properties of such stochastic differential equations, such as                   existence and uniqueness of solutions, solvability properties and               continuous, or measurable, dependence of solutions on the data,                 will be investigated. This study will provide the fundamental                   tools for the second part of this project, which is concerned                   with singular-regular stochastic control problems for nonlinear                 diffusions. The singular-regular model is distinguished by                      involving both measurable controls and measure-type controls. In                some cases, constraints on the state process are imposed, which                 leads to so-called reflecting type models. The focus of this part               of the research is on issues which are of fundamental interest in               control theory and applications, such as characterizing the value               function and optimal policy and deriving sufficient and/or                      necessary conditions on the optimal control.                                          This research project will develop a unified framework for                a broad class of stochastic control problems by combining                       classical stochastic control theory with the newly developed                    singular stochastic control theory. The latter is a rapidly                     expanding area of research and poses many challenging theoretical               issues related to partial differential equations and stochastic                 analysis. The principal applications of this research are to                    optimal control problems for dissipative dynamical systems under                uncertainty. Specific anticipated applications are to                           position/speed control policies for an aircraft operating under                 uncertain weather disturbances; to financial economics problems                 such as option pricing, consumption/investment optimization with                transaction costs, optimal control of storage or inventory type                 systems, among others.",
