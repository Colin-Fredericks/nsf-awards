 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will produce current information on the                            demographic and employment characteristics of doctoral                          scientists, engineers, and humanists in the United States.                      To accomplish this, the National Academy of Sciences will                       conduct the 1993 Survey of Doctorate Recipients, develop a                      longitudinal file of information (the Doctorate Work History                    File), and prepare a variety of cross-tabulations from the                      1993 survey.  The survey response rate will be greatly                          enhanced by extensive use of computer assisted telephone                        interviews (CATI).                                                              The Foundation is responsible for developing and maintaining                    a data base of demographic, educational, and employment                         information on scientists and engineers.  This data base,                       the Scientific and Technical Personnel Data System, requires                    input from three survey series:  The National Survey of                         Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers, The Survey of                      Natural and Social Scientist and Engineering Graduates, and                     the Survey of Doctorate Recipients.  Data from the Survey of                    Doctorate Recipients are frequently used to determine the                       status of various aspects of U. S. science and engineering,                     e.g., changes in research and development activities, and                       are also used in conjunction with data from the other                           surveys for analytical and policy purposes.  Co-sponsoring                      agencies are the National Endowment for the Humanities,                         National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy.",
