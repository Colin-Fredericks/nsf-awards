The system chosen for study is the                  yeast transcriptional activator ADR1 in its control of glucose                  repressible alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2).  Particular emphasis will             be placed on defining the mechanisms by which ADR1 is regulated,                the functional regions of ADr1, the factors which mediate or                    influence ADr1 functions, and the means by which these factors and              ADR1 control ADH2 transcription.  A combination of biochemical,                 recombinant DNA, and genetic analyses will be used.  The                        activation/repression domains of ADR1 will be precisely identified              and their interactions will be analyzed.  The mechanism by which an             ADR1 mutation enhances the function of ADR1 activation domains will             be examined by determining its effect on dimerization, ADR1                     conformation, and binding of other proteins.  The proteins which                co-immuneprecipitate with ADR1 will be purified and characterized.              %%%%                                                                            The goal of this research is to understand how cells respond to the             environment and control when and which genes the expression will                be characterized by identifying their important regions.  These                 regions include segments that respond to the environmental signals,             that contact other proteins, and that turn on or off the express of             genes.  A combination of genetic, recombinant DNA, and                          biochemical techniques will be used.",
