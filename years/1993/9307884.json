 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Thirumalai is supported by a grant from the                           Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop                      general theoretical methods for studying glassy states of                       chemical systems.  The two major aims of the research are to :                  1) investigate the efficacy of density functional theory (DFT)                  in describing the nature of glassy states; and 2) to develop                    generalized ergodic measures to ascertain the onset of                          activated transitions and to estimate the average free energy                   of activation separating various glassy minima.  Thirumalai                     will develop methodologies based on the properties of                           eigenvectors of the instantaneous dynamical matrix to describe                  the optimal reaction pathway for structural relaxation.  These                  methodologies will be applied to \"soft\" colloidal glasses such                  as O-terphenyl and glycerol as test cases.                                      %%%                                                                             Glasses are non-crystalline states of matter which have unique                  materials properties of significant commercial importance.                      Glassy states exist in many chemical systems including                          polymeric materials and biological systems such as  DNA and                     RNA.  Thirumalai's research employs statistical mechanical                      methods to the study of glassy materials in an attempt to                       obtain a molecular level understanding of the physical                          properties which are unique to this class of materials.",
