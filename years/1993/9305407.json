 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305407  Hille    Gene expression is regulated by translational control in  oocytes  and eggs. Immature oocytes store inactive mRNAs, translational  initiation factors, and ribosomes, to be used during maturation of  the oocyte and during the early cleavage stages of embryogenesis.  On hormonal stimulation, immature oocytes undergo meiosis,  translational rates increase, and the translational specificity  switches from mRNAs that support growth to those that undergo rapid  cell divisions. In many animals, including mammals, frogs, and  starfish, meiosis and fertilization are coordinated with  fertilization occurring in meiosis II, after the first polar body  is extruded. Dr. Hille's previous research focused on elucidating  mechanisms that activate the translational apparatus during  maturation. She has shown that initiation factor eIF-4E is  phosphorylated 20 minutes after addition of the maturation hormone  to starfish oocytes, at the same time that the translation rate  increases. She now proposes to clone starfish eIF-4E so she can  determine the amino acid site that is phosphorylated. With the  cloned substrate in hand, she will move backward in the cascade of  meiotic events, searching for kinases that phosphorylate this  initiation factor. This search will have two prongs: purifying  starfish cytoplasm in collaboration with Dr. Steven Pelech and  testing for eIF-4E kinase activity, and trying to screen expression  libraries for a kinase that phosphorylates the starfish eIF-4E. The  cloning of the starfish eIF-4E kinase is of general interest since  the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of eIF-4E in vivo is not  known for any organism. This proposal is a prototype of a signal  transduction pathway that initiates growth and development of cells  and will increase our basic understanding of how translation is  activated through eIF-4E after environmental stimulation, and our  general understanding of hormone activation of animal oocytes.  ***",
