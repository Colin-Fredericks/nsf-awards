 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350772  Jenkins  A series of laboratory experiments, based on the use of a  microcomputer, is being developed for a one-year, introductory  physics course.  The experiments are using a Macintosh  microcomputer in a traditional two-hour period supervised by  graduate teaching assistants.  The computer allows real-time  acquisition of data and, by simplifying data collection, it permits  the study of phenomena with different experimental situations in  the two-hour lab period.  In addition, the computer simplifies data  analysis through the use of spread sheets and graphics packages.   Interactive tutorials with graphics and animations illustrate  concepts and show their relationship to real life experiences.  The experiments make use of the Authorware software to provide an  interactive experiment for students performing the laboratory  experiments.  Authorware is a software developmental tool for  creating instructional presentations including tutorials and  simulations.  Virginia Tech has acquired a site license for this  software allowing free access to the software by both faculty and  students.  The experiments incorporate materials developed for the  program Tools for Scientific Thinking from Tufts University as well  as concepts from Workshop Physics from Dickinson College.  With an annual enrollment of over 500 students, good statistics are  being obtained of measurements of changes in performance by pre-  and post- testing.",
