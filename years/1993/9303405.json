 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are investigation of chaotic                or unpredictable behavior in manufacturing systems and development              of methods for controlling variations in system performance due to              nonlinear interactions.  The novel approach identifies if a                     manufacturing systems is under control and prescribes control                   actions for systems not under control.  Experimental evidence of                chaotic or unpredictable behavior in manufacturing systems for                  certain scheduling rules is presented, and the transition in system             behavior, from chaotic to periodic, due to change in scheduling                 disciplines is explained using theoretical results.  Other system               parameters influencing predictability of system performance are                 identified.  Improvements in classical system performance measures,             such as sojourn times, throughput rate, conformance to due dates,               due to enhanced predictability are measured.  Control schemes for               manufacturing systems are presented that do not require explicit                analytical models of the system.                                                     The research opens new directions for analyzing and                        controlling manufacturing systems, or in general any complicated                system.  The research is essential for developing an understanding              of dynamic behavior of integrated manufacturing systems.",
