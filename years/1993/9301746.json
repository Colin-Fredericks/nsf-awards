The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Daniel L.                                    Ruderman to work with Dr. David J. Tolhurst at                                  the Physiological Laboratory at Cambridge.                                                                                                                      Their research proposes to apply natural scene                                  statistics to basic problems in vision.  Dr.                                    Ruderman's graduate work measured the                                           properties of images in nature.  He found a                                     very robust scaling in the statistics, meaning                                  the character of natural scenes is invariant to                                 scale.  They now hope to answer the question                                    \"What does this scaling imply about the design                                  of image processing systems in nature?\"  A                                      long-held belief is that detecting edges is                                     fundamental to image analysis.  The optimal                                     edge detector for biological vision is                                          determined by the structure of edges in natural                                 images.  Similarly, the problem of constructing                                 complete borders around objects can be phrased                                  relative to the statistical properties of                                       borders in nature.  Do the optimal algorithms                                   for edge and border finding need access to the                                  complete image, or is local information enough?                                 This is a crucial question for biology since                                    neurons in the early stages of vision respond                                   only to local image features.  Does this fact                                   limit the processing ability?  Finally, optimal                                 reconstruction of an image from noisy neural                                    responses requires statistical knowledge of the                                 images and the noise.  Comparing this                                           reconstruction ability with the performance of                                  humans in psychophysical tasks represents a                                     measure of inaccuracy in visual computations.                                   Using natural scene statistics in answering                                     these questions provides a novel framework for                                  understanding vision in biology.                                                                                                                                The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel and a stipend for                                    twelve months.",
