 "awd_abstract_narration": "The depinning of density waves and the concomitant elastic                      softening in quasi-one dimensional metals is of current interest                due to their non-linear behavior. In particular, it is not                      understood if the softening is intrinsic to the density wave or is              due to relaxation of defects or domains in the density wave.  This              proposal deals with experiments that are specifically designed to               address this phenomena.  The central experiment is to measure                   changes in the static shear modulus of tantalum trisulfide when its             charge-density-wave becomes depinned.  The measurements will                    utilize a recently developed sensitive position detector. Changes               in the static twist angle of a fiber of tantalum trisulfide will be             measured with a frequency modulated helical resonator (400 MHz)                 cavity.  Torque will be applied with a magnetic wire \"flag\"                     attached to the sample.                                                                                                                                         Experiments to measure the temperature dependence of the specific               heat at the different phase transitions exhibited by quasi-one                  dimensional metals; the goal is to provide a basis for a better                 understanding of the role of fluctuations at these transitions.                 Phase transformations to be investigated include                                charge-density-wave, spin-density-wave, anion-ordering, and                     spin-Peierls transitions.  Specific heat on small crystals                      (typically less than 1 mg) will be measured using ac calorimetry                and can be applied to crystals as small as 0.01mg.  Complimentary               measurements will include Young's modulus and magnetic                          susceptibility.  Results will be fit to various fluctuation models.             %%%                                                                             Quasi-one-dimensional metals conduct along only one                             crystallographic direction and, as a consequence, exhibit some                  unusual and unexplained phenomena. Many are inherently non-linear               and/or involve strong fluctuation effects and this proposal                     describes some experiments using new, sensitive probes, which                   address long-standing problems in our understanding of these                    materials.                                                                                                                                                      Many quasi-one dimensional metals exhibit electron density wave                 distortions, in which the charge or spin density becomes                        periodically modulated, at low temperature.  In some of these                   materials, the density wave can be depinned (forced to move) with               extremely small electric fields; this effect has become a paradigm              for non-linear dynamics in solids.  When the density wave is                    depinned, the materials become elastically softer; it is not                    understood if this softening is only a dynamic effect, caused by                the motion of density wave defects, or intrinsic due to the sliding             density wave. This proposal studies changes in the static shear                 modulus of tantalum trisulfide, a prototypical charge-density-wave              material, that directly addresses this question. The investigators              have recently developed a radio-frequency helical resonator cavity              operating at 400 MHz as an extremely sensitive probe that can                   detect sample motion of less than 1 Angstrom; this apparatus will               be adapted to measure the static properties of these novel                      materials.  If successful, the technique may be applicable for                  related studies, such as torque magnetometry.                                                                                                                   In addition quasi-one dimensional metals exhibit an wide array of               low temperature phase transitions. There has been considerable                  theoretical interest in these transitions because fluctuation                   effects are enhanced by their one-dimensionality.  However, high                quality thermodynamic measurements, which probe these fluctuation               effects have been lacking. The investigators will continue using ac             calorimetry to study the specific heat of these materials. In                   particular charge-density wave, spin-density wave, order-disorder,              and spin-Peierls transitions will be studied. Complementary                     thermodynamic measurements will include Young's modulus and                     magnetic susceptibility. The results will be analyzed in the                    context of current theoretical investigations to understand the                 role of fluctuations at these transitions.",
