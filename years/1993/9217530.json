 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is to study the developmental changes                 that occur in structure and function of hemocyanin, the blue copper             containing protein that is found dissolved in the blood of                      arthropods and molluscs.  Respiratory proteins, hemoglobins,                    hemocyanins and hemerythrins, are excellent models for unique                   insights into the structure of oxygen transport molecules and how               the molecules combine reversibly with oxygen.  We have already                  found that hemocyanin expression in the locally abundant Dungeness              crab, Cancer magister, is developmentally regulated.  The changes               in hemocyanin structure and function that occur during the                      transition from larval to juvenile to adult crab are especially                 striking.  Furthermore, the changes operate in synchrony with                   simultaneous changes in salt and water balance - which in turn                  affect hemocyanin oxygen affinities.  Most proteins are regulated               at the level of transcription of DNA into messenger RNA.                        Therefore, Dungeness crab hemocyanin is an appropriate system in                which to study the molecular basis of stage and tissue specific                 gene activation and repression as well as the environmental and/or              physiological cues that prompt the changes in gene expression.                  Accordingly, we will ask when and where changes in hemocyanin                   messenger RNA occur and will investigate the stage-specific sites               and manner of hemocyanin synthesis.  We will also determine the                 effects of daylength and hormonal regulation on timing of                       hemocyanin biosynthesis.  In addition, we will characterize an                  unusual molt-related protein in the blood of the Dungeness crab and             explore its relationship to the oxygen-binding hemocyanins and to               insect blood storage proteins.                                                                                                                                  The successful completion of this project should significantly                  increase our knowledge about the structure, function and                        development of hemocyanin and other large copper containing                     proteins.  Through an integration of approaches including                       ecological physiology, developmental biology, biochemistry and                  molecular biology, it will be possible to make major contributions              to our understanding of how the changing structure of hemocyanin                during development of the crab is related to changes in function of             the molecule, physiology of the crab and interaction of the crab                with its environment.  Information about the crab's development and             the role hemocyanin plays in its tolerance to environmental                     conditions will enhance management of the commercially important                Dungeness crab fishery in the Pacific Northwest.",
