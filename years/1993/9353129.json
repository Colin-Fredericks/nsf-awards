 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9353129  Blackman, David and Gilmore, Maurice  Northeastern University  Boston, MA      \"Northeastern University Comprehensive Regional Center For  Minorities\"    This proposal describes a plan to establish the Northeastern  University Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities in science,  engineering, and mathematics, bringing together academic,  community, and industry resources in a coalition committed to  increasing the number of minorities in technical and scientific  professions, by providing students with the continuity and support  they need as they progress through the pipeline from grades K-12.   The Center will serve both as a sponsor of its own activities and  as a coordinating body for external projects, providing funding,  resources, and access to expertise.  The initial consortium will  consist of Northeastern University, the Boston Public School System  then adding Cambridge schools and other area institutions, and  business and community groups; the initial target population will  be elementary school children participating in after-school and  summer math and science enrichment programs, and middle and high  schools students and teachers from selected Boston schools.  The  number of schools, students, parents, and teachers will be  increased each year.  The NUCRCM's goal is to at least triple the  number of minority students taking and successfully completing SEM  courses in the first 5 years.  Long-term objectives are to  establish working coalitions among existing programs, develop and  implement new programs and curriculum, coordinate efforts to ensure  that students successfully complete algebra by the end of 8th grade  and pre-calculus by the end of high school, provided teachers with  extensive in-service training, and get parents involved in the  education of their children.  Our strategy is to funnel more and  more students into already-existing programs such as the Explorers  Club and MassPEP, new programs such as SteppingStones and COSMOS  II, and programs to b e developed.  Over time the evaluation process  will identify those programs which are successful and should be  expanded and those that need to be modified or even dropped from  Center sponsorship.  The Center Staff will consist of a full-time  Director, a full-time Program Coordinator; a Senior Co-Investigator  and Math Coordinator; Co-Investigators in chemistry, physics, and  biology; a Senior Evaluator; Advisory Board; and Industry Pane.",
