 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353199  Young    American Indians are the least represented of all minorities in  Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM).  The overall goal of  this project is to develop a cohesive interactive American Indian  Alliance and network to increase substantially the quality and  quantity of American Indians receiving baccalaureate degrees and  graduate degrees in SEM.  The initial step in achieving this goal  will be to sponsor a special conference to seek input from both the  Indian community and the SEM community.  A major goal of the  conference will be to identify and select specific options to build  a cohesive alliance.  A key aspect will be the agreed upon  selection of a lead institution or institutions to administratively  manage the American Indian Alliance.  In addition, conference  attendees will provide valuable input regarding innovative programs  to enhance matriculation of American Indian students at the  following three critical transition points:  (1) high school to  college (tribal/community/four-year); (2) from two-year college  (tribal/community) to four-year SEM degree-granting institutions;  and (3) from four-year institutions to doctoral degree granting  programs in SEM fields.  Invitations to the conference will be sent  to no less than 45 participating post-secondary institutions in 14  western states with significant American Indian population.  Of the  45 post-secondary institutions, 23 are tribally controlled  community colleges.  A major goal of the alliance will be to  empower the network of tribal colleges to establish a central  office to administer SEM programs for Indian students.  Examples of  some of the project activities that will be considered to be  implemented by participating institutions in the alliance are as  follows:  pre-college summer bridge programs; summer research  enrichment experiences; faculty exchange programs between two-year  (i.e., tribal/community) college and four-year SEM institutions;  curriculum development; graduate school prepar ation; tribal college  adopt-a-school programs; and telecommunications networking.  Future  activities of the American Indian AMP project will impact American  Indians at the levels of pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate  education.  The American Indian Alliance is designed to capitalize  on the strengths of existing Indian programs, SEM education and  research programs, and NSF funded programs in the western states.",
