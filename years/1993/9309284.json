 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, from the American Astronomical                                   Society \u0131AAS!, for \"Astrophysical Research in the                               Countries of the Former Soviet Union \u0131FSU!, led                                 by principal investigators Dr. S.E. Woosley, Dr.                                S. Wolff, Dr. J. Bahcall, and Dr. P. Boyce,                                     follows up on a collaborative program of support                                for the beleaguered astronomy community in the                                  FSU which began in 1991.  This program consisted                                of small, $100 grants which eventually were                                     awarded to 377 individuals, and astronomical                                    journal subscriptions sent to 30 institutions.                                  The 1992 program was supported entirely by AAS                                  member contributions of $55,000.  During 1993,                                  the AAS proposes to continue this program -- and                                possibly for several years thereafter -- at an                                  expanded level.  Approximately the same number of                               journal subscriptions would be provided, but                                    grants would be, on the average, four times                                     larger.  The AAS would also provide 25 to 30                                    personal computers of the PC-486 class.                                         Donations from AAS members alone would be                                       inadequate to support such a program in 1993.                                                                                                                   The goal of this AAS program is to keep a core of                               young, productive research astronomers and                                      astrophysicists functioning within the FSU, and                                 fulfills the NSF program objectives of advancing                                science by preserving the opportunity for leading                               experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine                                       complementary talents and pool research resources                               in areas of strong mutual interest and                                          competence.",
