 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in three areas of commutative                 algebra.  The first part of this work is directed at studying                   linkage.  The principal investigator will study a numerical                     condition on the graded resolution that might imply that an ideal               is licci.  He also will study the relation between several                      possible definitions for a local ring to be licci.  The second                  part of his work is concerned with symmetric algebras of modules                and Vasconcelos' Factorial Conjecture.  The third part of his                   work is aimed at understanding reduced and irreducible projective               curves in terms of their general hyperplane sections.                                This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                 makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
