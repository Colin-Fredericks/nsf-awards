Selected middle school teachers of Native Americans would be                    trained in the implementation of these materials in the                         classroom bringing 20 teachers to the University of                             Washington campus for each of two summers.  A follow-up                         program of in-service workshops will also be held during the                    academic year.  In addition the teachers will be in contact                     with each other and with the University of Washington                           faculty via an electronic network.  The laboratory materials                    will focus upon areas of tribal concerns such as                                fisheries/forestry, soil analysis, museum conservation, and                     rediscovery of artistic techniques.  The project will                           utilize the tribal leaders and others who are experts in the                    traditions of the Native American tribes to make sure that                      the materials developed will be appropriate for their                           culture.",
