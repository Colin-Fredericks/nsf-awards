 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305058  L'Hernault    Motile cells can move toward a target site, where they interact  with other cells found at this new location.  Sperm migration and  subsequent sperm-egg interactions in the nematode Caenorhabditis  elegans offers an attractive model system in which to study the  genetic control of these phenomena.  There are mutations in seven  known genes which result in motile spermatozoa that are incapable  of fertilization.  Mutations in three of these spermatogenesis-  defective genes are known to produce cytologically normal sperm  that are motile, but defective in sperm migration toward the normal  site of fertilization and in sperm-egg interactions at that site.   These genes will be subjected to detailed cell biological, genetic,  and molecular analyses.  Specifically, mutants will be analyzed by  electron microscopic and other cell biological techniques to reveal  any obvious alterations in either sperm structure or sperm  interactions with oocytes.  Additional alleles will be recovered  and the null phenotype will be defined for these three genes.   Alleles that will aid in the molecular cloning of these genes will  also be sought.  Cosmid transgenic rescue will be employed to  localize one of these genes on the available C. elegans physical  map and permit its molecular cloning.  These studies should reveal  how sperm recognize their location in the reproductive tract, move  towards oocytes, and subsequently fertilize them.  ***",
