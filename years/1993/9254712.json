 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brooklyn Children's Museum (BCM) is requesting $242,753 from                the National Science Foundation to introduce a traveling version of             the Museum's award-winning, interactive science exhibit, ANIMALS                EAT:  DIFFERENT FEASTS FOR DIFFERENT BEASTS.                                                                                                                    ANIMALS EAT was designed to assist children in the formation of                 their concept of a living thing.  The exhibition specifically                   focuses on familiar animals, and on eating in order to illustrate               this complex idea.  Throughout the exhibit, where appropriate,                  human parallels demonstrate the interrelatedness of all living                  things.                                                                                                                                                         The touring exhibit will incorporate the in-depth research,                     development and extensive evaluation that went into the                         installation at BCM.  It will encompass approximately 2,000 square              feet and will travel to at least ten locations over a perior of                 two-and-one-half years, offering hundreds of thousands of children              and families a unique and exciting way to learn important natural               science concepts.  As part of the touring package, the Museum will              also circulate Evi\"Dents,\" a science curriculum kit developed for               grades 3-5.  Using activity books, natural science specimens and                investigation tools, Evi\"Dents\" provides an interactive seven-week              study of teeth for teachers and students that develops students'                scientific and research skills.  Through loans to local schools at              the tour sites, Evi\"Dents\" will complement and extend the                       educational potential of the exhibition.",
