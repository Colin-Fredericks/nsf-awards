 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many existing senior integrated systems labs typically focus on                 control of single-input/single-output processes that are no                     longer representative of modern multivariable processes in                      manufacturing, robotics, and aerospace applications. By                         performing practical control/robotic experiments which utilize                  floating point processors, the student engineer can obtain the                  training for coping with multi-input/multi-output systems such                  as a two-link robot manipulator or an inverted pendulum. To                     simplify the use of floating point processors, the Robotics and                 Machine Automation Laboratory (RAMAL) Development group at the                  Clemson University Center for Advanced Manufacturing (CAM) has                  developed a WINDOWS MATLAB software interface which allows the                  user to program control algorithms for a high speed, floating                   point processor (i.e. the TYS320C30) in a straightforward                       manner.In this project, an Undergraduate Integrated Systems                     Laboratory (USIL) is developed in which seniors  perform a                      sequence of laboratory experiments involving mechanical design,                 power amplification design, control design, and computer                        interface design. After the initial set of experiments, the                     students are required to integrate these various subsystem                      designs for experiments such as the inverted pendulum and a                     two-link robot manipulator. This project promulgates the                        transfer of the WINDOWS MATLAB software into the undergraduate                  curriculum through the use of six C30 workstations and the                      necessary supporting hardware.",
