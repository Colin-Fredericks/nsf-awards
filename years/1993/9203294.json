 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Biomedical Image Processing Laboratory at the University                    of Minnesota is a         computational resource that will                      provide image analysis for basic research projects employing                    transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron                             microscopy, and confocal and conventional light microscopy.                     The resource is devoted to research and development in                          methods that can be used to elucidate biological structure                      by means of computational analysis and reconstruction of                        images of macromolecular assemblies, organelles and cells                       obtained by different microscopic techniques.  In addition,                     the center will provide hardware and software to aid in the                     three-dimensional representation of the structures that are                     being studied.  Collaborative projects, such as the study of                    bacteriophage morphogenesis and microtubule-tektin                              interactions, will take advantage of the facilities and the                     methods being developed.  Further, the center will provide                      image analysis services to a large core of users at the                         University of Minnesota Medical School.                                                                                                                         The center will develop a second-generation on-line image                       analysis system for the transmission electron microscope, as                    well as a novel image analysis system for a low-voltage                         field-emission scanning electron microscope.  The center                        will also take advantage of the fact that many different                        forms of microscopy and imaging generate similar problems                       and similar solutions. Thus, the research on methods within                     one of these areas may be easily applied to other areas                         within this center.",
