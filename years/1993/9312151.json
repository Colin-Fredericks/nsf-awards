 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312151  Booton    This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year  continuing award for the \"Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research\"  Program and support of the evaluator at the University of Colorado,  Boulder Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Microwave and Millimeter Wave Computer-Aided Design.  The Center  continues to meet the renewal criteria requirements of the I/UCRC  Program.    Additional funding is provided for a woman undergraduate student to  aid the Center in its ongoing research activities.    Funding is also provided by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)  to obtain a membership in the Center and to augment ongoing  research.  The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and  Waste Management Office is providing funding to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Colorado, Boulder  be awarded:  $57,242 for the first year of a three-year continuing  award; $5,000 for one year with funds provided by the Women,  Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program;  $50,000 for one year with funds provided by the CIA; and $10,000  for one year with funds provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which the  university-industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
