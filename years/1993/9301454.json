 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301454  Neiger  Models of distributed systems fall into two main classes:  systems using message passing and those using shared  memory. Early research on message-passing systems focused  on two system models:  completely asynchronous (in which  there is not timing information available about the  system) and completely synchronous (in which perfect  timing information is available). More recent research has  also considered partially synchronous  systems (in which imperfect timing information is  available), and these intermediate systems more accurately  capture the properties of many real systems.  In contrast,  research on shared-memory systems has been restricted almost  exclusively to completely asynchronous systems (completely  synchronous systems are not realistic).  While such a  restriction permits the development of very general  algorithms, it excludes consideration of more efficient  algorithms that would be correct for many real systems. In  many cases, a partially synchronous model is more realistic  for shared-memory systems, just as it is for message-passing  systems.  Such a model admits a much wider class of  algorithms, and these algorithms can be analyzed with  respect to their realtime performance.  The objective of  this project is to provide a comprehensive study of  partially synchronous shared-memory systems and to develop  and analyze a wide range of algorithms for these systems.    The project is developing formal models for partially  synchronous shared-memory systems, taking into account  timing behavior and failures; an exploration of several  paradigms for algorithm design and analysis in these system,  including real-time analyses; the study of a variety of  specific problems in distributed computing (such as  consensus and atomic snapshot) and the development of  algorithms to solve them in these systems; the application  of processor knowledge; and the use of translations between  models with different types of faulty behavior.  ***",
