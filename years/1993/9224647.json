 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Balansieae are widespread fungal associates of grass                   plants.  All grass communities are likely to contain at least some              individuals that are infected by members of the Balansieae group,               and many communities in North America are composed of predominantly             Balansieae-infected plants.  Some of these fungi have been shown to             enhance insect resistance, drought tolerance, and in some cases                 vegetative growth of host plants.  Endophytic Balansieae are now                routinely employed in turfgrass breeding programs to improve                    hardiness of commercial varieties and reduce turf requirements for              water and pesticides.  Balansieae also have major impacts on the                livestock industry worldwide.  Toxic syndromes affecting cattle                 grazed on endophyte-infected tall fescue frequently occur in the                United States, while sheep grazed on endophyte-infected perennial               ryegrass experience toxic syndromes in New Zealand.                             %%%                                                                                  Taxonomic knowledge of the ascomycetous fungi grouped in                   Balansieae is rudimentary, and classification schemes are based                 upon very few and potentially unreliable morphological features.                Representative samples of species of the genera Balansia and                    Epichloe are being collected from North and South America, in order             to determine more reliable morphological markers of the species and             to correlate these with mating patterns in the laboratory.                      Reproductive compatibility groups, where correlated with                        morphological features, provide the basis for discriminating                    species.  These basic taxonomic studies will prepare for future                 determination of phylogenetic relationships among the fungal taxa               and the analysis of possible coevolution with host grasses.",
