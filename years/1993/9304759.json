 "awd_abstract_narration": "In orogenic zones affected by multiple deformation                         events, it is common for structural features such as faults                     to be reactivated, although documenting multiple movements,                     of the same or different displacement styles has proven to                      be difficult.  This project will address this classic                           problem by looking at spatial variations in facies and                          thickness of syn-deformational sedimentary units in                             proximity to faults of the Bisbee Group (Early Cretaceous)                      in two key areas where the section appears to be anomalously                    thick.  These rocks subsequently were deformed by Late                          Cretaceous to Paleogene age were deformed by Late Cretaceous                    to Paleogene age (Laramide) compression.  If the Laramide                       structure was previously a major normal fault in early                          Cretaceous time, characteristics of the Lower Cretaceous                        strata (paleocurrents, thickness variations etc) should                         record proximity to the fault.  Results have the potential                      to unambiguously separate the effects of the two tectonic                       events superimposed on this area, and by extension may                          provide sedimentologic and structural criteria to resolve                       multiple fault reactivations elsewhere.",
