 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the formation of policies that affect                      international trade and the global environment.  While the trade                literature has devoted much attention to identifying policies that              maximize aggregate welfare, relatively little effort has been made              to understand what policies will emerge from a realistic political              process in which policy makers must respond to the demands of both              special interests and the general electorate.  A political economy              model has been developed in which elected officials respond to                  political incentives.  This model will be extended and applied to               consider such problems as the equilibrium structure of protection,              the government's choice of trade policy instrument, the interaction             between trade and environmental policies (and between the interest              groups that support these two types of interventions), and the                  interaction between governments of different countries in both                  cooperative and noncooperative settings.                                                                                                                        The ultimate aim of the research is to evaluate alternative                     institutional \"rules of the game\" for the world trading system.  It             is hoped that rules will be identified that will facilitate a                   liberal trading regime with greatest mutual benefits from trade and             with efficient cooperation on international environmental matters.              In order to accomplish this, the theoretical framework must first               be developed and refined so that emerging policy outcomes can be                predicted under different possible institutional constraints.",
