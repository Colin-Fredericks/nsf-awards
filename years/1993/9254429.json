Collaboration between                              elementary and secondary teachers will be promoted; each                        local team will consist of three elementary teachers, a                         Native American teacher-aide, and one high school teacher.                      The project, which includes an annual three-week summer                         workshop, four inservices, a two-day Leadership Seminar, and                    classroom observations and visits, will address the stated                      and identified needs of teachers of Native American students                    as determined through several needs assessments conducted by                    AISES over the past six years; these include the need for                       hands-on strategies, increased content knowledge, more                          American Indian culture in teaching math/science, and more                      training in cooperative and discovery learning strategies.                                                                                                      This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher                             enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science                       knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills of                        teams of teachers from particularly needy population.
