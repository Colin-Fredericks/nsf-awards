 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of               Professor William J. le Noble at the State University of New York               at Stony Brook to study the electronic origins of pi-                           diastereofacial selectivity by using various substituted                        adamantan-2-ones and related compounds. The specific projects                   are: (1) addition reactions, including dihydroxylation, Grob                    fragmentation, Michael addition, and Claisen rearrangement; (2)                 studies directed to differentiate between the theoretical models                of Ahn, Cieplak, and Felkin; (3) changes in skeleton and                        substitution patterns by expanding/reducing adamantane by one                   methylene unit at C6, by studying more powerful 5-substituent                   effects (N-oxides and boron and ammonium compounds), by studying                the 4,9-disubstitution effect, by studying the 5,7-disubstitution               effect, and by modifying the trigonal center at C2.                             %%%                                                                             In this project Professor William K. le Noble will study the                    electronic effects that govern pi-diastereofacial selectivities                 in bond making (and breaking) to (and from) ketones, imines, and                olefins. The adamantane frame is selected to eliminate                          interfering steric and conformational effects. The study                        concentrates on standard addition reaction, differentiating                     between theoretical models, and will explore the influence of                   powerful substituents and structural rigidity.",
