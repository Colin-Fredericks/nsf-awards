 "awd_abstract_narration": "The XVIIth International Congress of Genetics provides a                   major opportunity for a unique, broadly based, large group of                   scientists who work on all aspects of genetics to meet.  The                    remarkable technical explosion that has occurred in genetics in                 the last few years has had an enormous impact on both basic and                 applied aspects of the field.  Tremendous strides have been made                in understanding the structure of genomes from the level of DNA                 sequence and topology through chromosome organization and nuclear               architecture.  The roles genes play in whole organisms to produce               unique patterns, determine sex and organize and regulate function               in neural systems will be explored.  The explosion in information               concerning mechanisms has been paralleled by a geometric rise in                the number of known genes.  In a similar fashion, areas of                      understanding in population genetics and evolution have                         dramatically increased often by the application of molecular                    techniques to classical problems and the use of computer modeling               systems.  Finally, the new industry of biotechnology has been                   spawned by the advances in basic genetics.                                      %%%                                                                             The theme of the Congress will be \"Genetics and the Understanding               of Life\".  Papers will be presented on the structure, behavior,                 evolution, pathology and engineering of genomes al all levels of                biological and phylogenetic organization.  There will also be                   sessions on the historical, philosophical and social aspects of                 genetics.  This meeting , the first in five years, will provide a               unique setting for the synthesis of general concepts arrived at                 in a broad set of diverse organisms and systems.",
