 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal involves the controlled use of competitive               vulcanization to develop blended elastomeric systems with enhanced              physical and mechanical properties.  The only presently viable                  technique which offers the opportunity to study the chemical                    structure and distribution of crosslinks between the components of              the rubber blend is solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy.  It is now                possible to obtain high resolution NMR spectra of these insoluble               networks and to use these spectra to determine the microstructures              and the chemical nature and number of the crosslinks in accelerated             vulcanized elastomeric systems.  The role of differential                       solubility and reactivity of vulcanizing agents, coupled with their             diffusion from one polymer phase to another, in determining the                 nature and extent of crosslinking in the individual phases of the               blend has not been determined.  Our present knowledge of the                    specific chemical reactions during vulcanization of rubber blends               is insufficient to permit the design of optimum accelerator                     systems, mixing processes and the appropriate cure cycles for                   rubber blends which will lead to products with specific                         improvements in the physical or mechanical properties.                                                                                                          Competitive covulcanization of polymer blends is playing an                     increasing role in rubber production.  To optimize the                          vulcanization process they must understand the microstructures and              crosslinks developed separately in the components of the blends                 during the vulcanization process.  Techniques have been developed               for the study of the blend composition, blend microstructure and                distribution of fillers between the phases of a blend, but no                   technique has been developed for estimating the chemical nature and             extent of crosslinking in the different rubber phases of the blend.             Without a knowledge of how to control the competitive crosslinking              process, competitive vulcanization will continue to be empirical in             its applications to rubber.",
