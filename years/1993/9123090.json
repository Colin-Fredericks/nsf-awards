 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this multidisciplinary project is to develop                   software that provides the mechanisms and methods that enable and               encourage scientists to exchange data, ideas, and results across                geographically distributed research sites.  The motivation is                   twofold:  the need for better methods of processing and                         visualizing data in environmental research; and the need for                    collaboration across and within disciplines.  The work, which                   will extend the Khoros 1.0 software, will provide a working                     environment that will motivate scientists from different                        locations to interact over a computer network.  When combined                   with the data base and management capabilities now in place at                  many research sites (e.g. Long Term Ecological Research sites)                  the proposed technology can lead to network-wide data analysis,                 interpretation, and even manuscript preparation in ways not                     currently possible.  Standard audio communication will augment                  the computer interaction to provide an environment similar to a                 workshop conference. Scientists in different geographical                       location will be able to use their workstations to cooperatively                examine, interpret, and change each others data, figure, text, or               visual program in real time as if sitting around a table in the                 same room.  This technology will lead to a level of network                     interaction that is unprecedented in environmental science.  In                 addition, the combined research teams in Biology and Computer                   Engineering will train scientists to use the collaboration                      software.  Feedback from the training process will identify new                 ways to apply the technology and improvements in the existing                   applications.",
