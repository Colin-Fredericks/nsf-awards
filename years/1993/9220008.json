 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evidence  exits from several parts of Gondwana for at least one                 major, continental ice  sheet during the Late Ordovician and Early              Silurian.  Yet various sources of geological evidence suggest high              atmospheric  pCO2 at this time, and Berner's (1990,1991)                        Geochemical                                                                     cycling model indicates that the amount may have been as high or                higher than 13 times the present atmospheric level.  To resolve                 this apparent paradox (high pCO2 would be expected to imply an ice-             free  Earth) the following approach will be followed:                                1) Two periods will be studied: the Middle Ordovician, which               lacks evidence for polar ice, and the Ashgill (Late Ordovician)                 which has evidence for the largest ice extend.                                       2) An atmospheric general circulation model GCM will be                    applied to the study of Ordovician climates, and the results of                 this will then be used to drive a spatially resolved geochemical                cycling model (which   considers geographical variations in climate             and paleolithology).                                                            We will first model the climates of both periods with a CO2 level               of 13xPAL.  If differences in geography cannot account for the                  climate difference then we will progressively lover the Late                    Ordovician CO2 levels until we find that snow remains throughout                the year where the geological evidence indicates   an ice cap.  In              this way we can determine the range of  pCO2 values  which is                   climatically compatible with the glaciological evidence .  We will              then run a global geochemical cycling model, in part to provide an              additional means of estimating/confirming pCO2  by seeing which                 climate, i.e., weathering regime, generates a CO2 consumption rate              that is consistent with the inferred   rate of production via                   volcanism and metamorphism.  In particular we will examine the                  hypothesis that increased (terrestrial) volcanism in the Middle                 Ordovician led to increased (terrestrial) silicate weathering in                the Late Ordovician.  Increased weathering would mean that the                  carbon cycle was in balance at a lower pCO2  level than current                 model indicate, and thus allow glaciation.  This study of the                   Middle and Late Ordovician will allow us to look at the evolution               to a glaciated state, and will be a test of the importance of                   atmospheric CO2 as a prime governor of climate on Earth.",
