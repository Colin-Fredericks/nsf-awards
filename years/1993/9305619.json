 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed studies involve the theoretical characterization of                the relationship between structure, spectra, and function of heme               proteins- focusing on peroxidases, a family of metabolizing heme                enzymes that catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of substrates by              hydrogen peroxide.  Specifically, a variety of techniques of                    computational chemistry will be used to continue to address three               major themes: (1) elucidation of the common steps and key                       intermediates in the enzymatic cycle of all peroxidases, leading                from the resting state to the biologically active species.                      Although the bioactive species formed is common to all peroxidases,             it is subsequently involved in two different types of oxidations.               These differences will be probed by: characterization of                        substrate/enzyme interactions using lignin peroxidase (LiP), an                 isozyme typical of the family of peroxidases that oxidizes surface-             bound substrates by long range electron transfer and by                         characterization of substrate/enzyme interactions using horse                   radish peroxidase (HRP), an isozyme belonging to the second type of             peroxidase that oxidizes substrates near the heme unit by chemical              transformations.  Since no X-ray crystal structure has been                     reported for any member of this family, a 3D model of this enzyme               will be created by completing the homology modeling of HRP begun                during the current grant period.                                                %%%                                                                             Peroxidases are ubiquitous in many living species including                     bacteria, fungae, plants, and mammals.  They are involved in                    transforming and eliminating potentially toxic species as well as               of potential use in biodegradation.  Understanding the underlying               mechanisms of their two types of oxidations will lead to the                    identification of the stereoelectronic properties that modulate the             efficacy of substrates that undergo long range electron transfer as             well as those that are chemically transformed.  Moreover, key                   residues of the enzymes that are involved in both of these types of             catalytic oxidation will be identified and mutations suggested that             will increase enzyme efficacy.  These combined results can then be              used to guide in protein engineering of optimum mutant enzymes for              use in biodegradation of specific products as well as in enhancing              the understanding of the role that peroxidases play in regulating               toxicity.",
