 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I research addresses the feasibility of a web                   optical scanner for manufacturing process control.  The concept                 uses on-line diffuse reflectance and transmittance measurements.                A fiber optic coupler, which is an essential modular component of               such an on-line reflectance/transmittance, system will be                       designed and fabricated in Phase I.  This will be the basis for                 coupling ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared illumination to                a sheet and from a high density, 200-per-meter, linear pixel                    array, to a single photodetector.                                                                                                                               The fiber optic coupler will be integrated with a shutter                       mechanism to provide serial readout in a line across the web.                   The cross web scan of commercial devices will be 100 milliseconds               for an entire sheet width.  A reflectance scanner assembly can be               compact, noncontacting, and adaptable to a range of illumination                and detection angles.  High resolution (1 millimeter) machine and               cross directional profiles will be possible on constituent                      concentrations and variations over a range of machine-direction                 surface lengths from 10 meters to 1 millimeter.                                                                                                                 Reflectance/transmittance spectroscopy permits measurement of                   average coatweight and high spatial resolution variance of                      coatweight, as well as similar determination such as color,                     moisture, binder concentration, gloss, and fluorescence factors.                This scanner technology is thought to hold advantages in                        coatweight measurements over the widely applied technology of                   traversing, beta-ray measurements, with its use of radioisotopes.",
