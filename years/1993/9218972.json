 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the problem of the dynamics and evolution                of the freshwater - saltwater interface in ground water along the               forest - marsh boundary in South Carolina.  The position and                    expression (i.e. clarity versus diffuseness) of this interface is               governed by short-term forcings (diurnal tides, daily ET cycles and             rain events), episodic storm surges and long-term sea level rise.               Prediction of the fate of contaminants released on land and their               impact on adjacent marshes depends on a clear and quantitative                  understanding of the movement of ground water at and near this                  interface.  Because of the complex forcings and boundary                        conditions, presently available models for coastal aquifers are too             simple to adequately simulate such systems.  In addition, adequate              field measurements of head and salinity are not available to test               complex numerical models that might be used.                                    As a remedy to this problem, the objectives of this project are to              collect long-term measurements of head and salinity along transects             across the forest-marsh boundary and to use the data to develop,                calibrate and validate a numerical model of the system.  A                      spatially dense network of piezometer along each transect will be               equipped with recording pressure transducers (assembled in house)               that will gather data on the effects of short-term forcing.  Based              on geomorphic and stratigraphic criteria and C-14 dating of tree                roots found in high marsh soils, transects will be selected to                  represent stages in the conversion of a forested, pleistocene beach             ridge terrain into a Holocene salt marsh under a regime of rising               sea level.  This will provide a unique opportunity to test our                  numerical model against truly long-term data.  The results of this              project could be used by regulatory agencies for environmental                  impact assessment and planning and by ecologists interested in                  interactions between forest and marsh ecosystems.",
