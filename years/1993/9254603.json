 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will involve about 60% the 200 chemistry                            teachers of the state of Montana in a series of intensive                       concept workshops over the next three years.  The concepts                      which will be studied are determined by looking at the                          performance of the students on the ACS Chemistry Olympiad                       Examination items and coupling this with the teachers                           expectation.  Thirty 'lead' teachers will study the topics                      in depth at Montana State during two week workshops in the                      summer for each of three years.  These teachers will then                       hold regional workshops for teachers in their area (at least                    30/year) over the course of the next academic year.  During                     the next summer, they may study different topics and repeat                     the process.  At each of these regional workshops will be a                     faculty member from the main campus to assist in the                            teaching.  They will be highly interactive using the best of                    modern pedagogy to teach the students in the coming year.                       The cost share is 26% of the awarded Foundation funds.",
