 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on several areas of mathematical                   research in the area of several complex variables.  Work will                   continue on the problem of embeddability of three dimensional                   CR-manifolds, exploring connections between this problem and the                Kuranishi construction of versal deformations for surface                       singularities. An integral part of this investigation is the                    development of computer software which facilitates the                          computation of these spaces.  The ultimate goal is the                          construction of normal forms for CR-structures on three                         dimensional manifolds and the characteristics of embeddable                     structures.  In addition, work will be done to apply                            pseudodifferential and blow-up methods to study the d-bar                       operator on domains with singular metrics.  The applications                    include index theorems for Bergman type metrics and infinitesimal               versions of the Runge theorem.                                                       Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the                    century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one                   complex variable.  It became clear early on that the theory                     differed widely from it predecessor.  The underlying geometry was               far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far more                affinity with partial differential operators of first order.  It                thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics                    of differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of                   the fundamental structures were defined in the last three                       decades. Current studies still concentrate on understanding these               basic mathematical forms.",
