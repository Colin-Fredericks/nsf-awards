 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an effort to increase the number of women entering graduate             school in CISE disciplines, the Computing Research Association                  (CRA) is proposing a distributed mentoring project where 20-                    30 female undergraduate students will be matched with a number of               female professors in CISE research areas each year, to participate              in summer of research at the mentor's institution. The students                 will most likely be computer science or computer engineering majors             although this is not required.                                                                                                                                       The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic                    departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering and                    Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. The               mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research                community and to support and promote its interests. Dr. Weingarten              is the Executive Director of CRA. Dr. O'Rourke, the academic leader             of this project, is the Department Chair of Computer Science at                 Smith College, Massachusetts.",
