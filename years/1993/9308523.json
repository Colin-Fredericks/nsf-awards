 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neural network technology has the potential to solve an                    impressive variety of today's technological problems which                      conventional computers are quite powerless to deal with.  The first             applications of neural networks technology have been limited to                 relatively small problems, and therefore systems scaling was not a              primary issue.  Neural networks for real-life problems usually                  consist of a large numbers of interconnected processors working in              parallel.  The objective of this proposal is a deeper investigation             into the computational and learning abilities of neural networks                for such large scale problems.  In particular, the computational                models and topologies best suited for large scale problems, and                 efficient and accurate learning techniques for such resource-                   bounded parallel machine will be investigated.  The results will be             evaluated on two challenging real-life problems from electrical                 engineering and molecular biology (mixed-signal integrated circuits             testing and protein structure prediction).  The proposed work is                based on recent results:  (1) a discrete multivalued neural                     networks model that can be used as a tool for reasoning about the               computational scaling abilities of various neural network                       architectures; (2) efficient neural network learning algorithms                 that generalize well starting with pre-existing symbolic knowledge              and incorporating additional constructive learning from examples.//",
