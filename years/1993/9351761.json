 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351761  Dye  Western Connecticut State University, through the acquisition  of new instrumentation for the isolation, culturing,  observation and manipulation of living cells, tissues and  organs, will increase the quality of laboratory instruction for  undergraduate students in formal class work (Cell Biology;  Developmental Biology; Methods of Cell, Tissue and Organ  Culture; and Immunology) and in research which is required of  all majors.  Specifically, students will have access to modern techniques in  cell culture, in microscopy, in micromanipulation of cultured  material. They will be able to use state-of-the-art technology  in courses and have expanded opportunities for individual  research.  Students will benefit by being better prepared for  graduate school, for professional school (medical, dental,  veterinary, physician's assistant), for teaching, and for work  in clinical, commercial or industrial laboratories.  The funding we are requesting will match funds from the State  of Connecticut's High Technology Program to support efforts to  improve undergraduate laboratory facilities.  ***",
