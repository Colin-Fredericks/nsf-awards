 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352584  Ciardullo  Experimental astronomy provides a unique platform for  laboratory instruction. The nature of modern astronomical  observations requires sophisticated technology applied at its  limits. In addition, the field itself is perceived as exciting  by many students. These facts have led the Pennsylvania State  University's Eberly College of Science to upgrade its under-  graduate facilities in astronomy by renovating its telescopes,  providing new instrumentation for its laboratories, and  improving the quality of its undergraduate laboratory  instruction. The work will be continued by acquiring a science  grade CCD system to go on an existing 24-in telescope located  on the roof of Davey Lab, the home of the Department of  Astronomy and Astrophysics. This CCD gives undergraduate  students hands-on experience in observational astronomy and  helps provide them with a sense of participation in a  scientific enterprise. In addition, this new CCD allows the  small CCD now on the telescope to be moved to the classroom,  and thus upgrades the quality of instrument labs. By providing  access to the very latest astronomical instrumentation and data  analysis techniques, these improvements serve to encourage  students to pursue careers in science and engineering.  ***",
