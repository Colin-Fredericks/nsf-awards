 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gray         Tree-structured vector quantization is an approach to image  compression that applies ideas from statistical clustering  algorithms and tree-structured classification and regression  algorithms to produce compression codes that trade off bit rate  and average distortion in a near optimal fashion.  This research  is examining the explicit combination of these two forms of  signal processing, compression and classification, into single  tree-structured algorithms that permit a trade off between  traditional distortion measures, such as squared error, with  measures of classification accuracy such as Bayes risk.  The  intent is to produce codes with implicit classification  information, that is, for which the stored or communicated  compressed image incorporates classification information without  further signal processing.  Such systems can provide direct low  level classification or provide an efficient front end to more  sophisticated full-frame recognition algorithms.  Vector quanitization algorithms for relatively large block sizes  are also being developed with an emphasis on multiresolution  compression algorithms.  In order to improve the promising  performance found in preliminary studies or combined compression  and classification, it will be necessary to use larger block  sizes or, equivalently, more context.  Multiresolution or  hierarchial quantizers provide a simple and effective means of  accomplishing this.  Other related issues are being explored,  including improved prediction methods for predictive vector  quantization and image sequence coding.",
