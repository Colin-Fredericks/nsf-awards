 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Anne Pyburn and her                collaborators will conduct one season of archaeological research at             the site of Chau Hiix. This site, located in the lowlands of                    Belize, was only brought to archaeological attention in 1990 and is             extremely unusual because villagers who live in the region have                 protected it from looting. Preliminary research suggests that Chau              Hiix served as a major regional center because it contains a number             of mounds and associated courtyards. In this first season of work               Dr. Pyburn and her colleagues will map and survey the site. They                will conduct limited excavations on visible structures and also                 carry out a program of coring to determine whether less obvious                 archaeological features are also present. On this basis they should             be able to provide more exact dates for the span of occupation and              obtain a better idea of its internal organization. These data will              provide the basis to design a second, more extensive project.                                                                                                   The Maya constitute a central focus of archaeological interest                  because they developed a civilization with monumental architecture,             writing and large population concentrations in a difficult lowland              tropical environment. Just as mysteriously as it arose, the Maya                civilization then declined as large centers were abandoned and                  large scale construction ceased. Dr. Pyburn wishes to gain insight              into this process. In the last decade Belize has been the scene of              much archaeological research and a number of Mayan sites have been              studied. It is unclear to what extent each functioned as an                     independent center and it is not known whether sites were grouped               into larger functional units. Through excavation of Chau Hiix and               comparison with other sites known from the area Dr. Pyburn wishes               to examine this question.                                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 insight into how complex societies arise, are maintained and                    decline. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists                and assist in the training of undergraduate students.",
