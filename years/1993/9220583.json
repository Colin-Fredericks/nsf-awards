 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small strongly flying insects need not fly at high, narrow                 body temperatures, in terms of the balance of their heat gain or                loss. Yet in fact they do so, and even have a variety of complex                adaptations for actively regulating body temperature to high and                narrow ranges. We will complete the study of how this thermal                   regulation works during flight itself, and how body temperature                 variation affects actual flight performance. To do this, we will                first complete the construction of a computerized wind tunnel in                which to carry out our experiments. Experimental use of this tool               to examine a variety of specific issues in the heat-transfer                    biophysics and the temperature-dependence of flight lift and thrust             will follow. We will also test an entirely new concept of  why it               is that intense animal activity, such as insect flight, is so                   invariably limited in its range of effective temperatures.                           This work will be important to a number of issues in basic                 biology, all revolving around the reasons why animals regulate                  their body temperatures, the range of ways in which they can do so,             and their adaptations for making strenuous and demanding activity               more efficient. It may also be extremely important to considering               the possible damaging effects of global climate change, especially              global warming, which may alter the thermal environments of such                sensitive animals on a time scale much shorter than that of their               ability to adjust.",
