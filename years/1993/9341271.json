 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will carry out modeling and diagnostic studies to                   investigate the interannual variability and predictability of the               monthly and seasonal average circulation of the atmosphere.  The                long term goal is to investigate the predictability of the coupled              ocean-atmosphere-land system.  To accomplish this objective, the                strategy is to utilize realistic models of the individual                       components (atmosphere, ocean, and land surface processes) to carry             out sensitivity and predictability studies first to examine the                 predictability of each component separately, and ultimately to                  examine the predictability of the coupled interactive system.  The              PI and his group will continue their ongoing research on the                    predictability of space-time averaged atmospheric circulation to                establish a physical basis for, and demonstrate and the feasibility             of dynamic extended range forecasting.                                               To accomplish the above objective the PI will continue to                  improve the NMC-derived atmospheric general circulation model so                that its ability to simulate the annual cycle and interannual                   variability including space-time fluctuations is further improved.              He will also use this model in conjunction with real conditions at              the earth's surface to investigate the predictability of the                    regional space-to,e averaged circulation of the atmosphere.                          This research is important because it will provide a readily               applied basis for improvements in operational weather and climate               prediction models.",
