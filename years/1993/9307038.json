 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307038  Philbrick       Underwater pollination (hydrophily) is one of the most  enigmatic pollination systems in flowering plants.  Hydrophily  requires the abandonment or modification of a suite of characters  intimately tied to the dry, aerial flowering condition, and  represents a shift in floral biology with profound consequences for  flower and pollen morphology.  The mechanical and biochemical  modifications entailed in achieving wettability (underwater release  and capture of pollen) raise significant adaptive obstacles not  encountered during evolutionary shifts from one aerial pollination  system to another.  The goals of Dr. Philbrick's project are to  probe questions concerning the evolution of water pollination using  the genus Callitriche as an experimental system.  Callitriche is  the most appropriate group to conduct these studies because it is  the only genus of angiosperms that includes both aerial and  underwater pollination systems.  Phylogenetic analysis using  morphological and new DNA characters will provide an understanding  of the direction of change in floral and pollen features across the  species in the genus, and thereby help determine models of change  in adaptation to underwater pollination.  %%%       Underwater pollination is one of the more bizarre adaptations  found in certain groups of flowering plants.  Dr. Philbrick is  studying this phenomenon in an explicit phylogenetic framework for  the ca. 50 species of the genus Callitriche that includes both  underwater and aerial pollination systems.  The direction of change  in floral and pollen features can be determined, and in turn this  knowledge will allow analysis of cellular and biochemical  mechanisms responsible for new floral structure.",
