 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315537  Morari  This award of $200,000 is for curriculum development in control  systems.  Traditional introductory undergraduate courses in control  theory do not capture the recent developments in research and still  tend to be a collection of tricks without a coherent theme.   Moreover, control theory has become very interdisciplinary and now  has no natural home within the traditional engineering disciplines.   Yet because of the increasingly important role that the design of  control into engineered devices and processes that modern advances  in computers and communications is making possible, it is now very  important to introduce modern control theory and techniques to  undergraduates.  This proposal will develop modular curricula for  two control courses at the senior level, involving both theory and  experimentation.  Two experiments that can be run remotely will be  developed for the courses, control in buildings and control of a  ducted fan engine.",
