 "awd_abstract_narration": "The eventual goal of this project is to develop a theory of                discourse representation for generating narrative texts.  A                     discourse representation for text generation (in contrast to                    understanding) must not only account for phenomena such as                      anaphoric reference and rhetorical relations among constituents, it             must also address the problem of how the text is constructed from               an underlying semantic representation.  Furthermore, the                        representation should account for textual variation and constrain               the decision making of the text planner.  An essential aspect of                the project will be to implement the theory in a generation system.             Implementing not only strengthens the theory, since it must address             a wider range of problems more concretely, but also provides a                  means of evaluating the results.  Evaluation in the context of text             generation can be done relatively easily, since the output is                   English text, which can be read and easily judged by people outside             the project.",
