 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workability is often defined as the degree of deformation that             can be achieved in a particular deformation processing operation                without failure.  Failure may be the basic material related                     phenomena of cracking or fracture, but it could also be any other               undesirable condition, for example lack of die fill or poor surface             finish.  The major factors which influence the workability of a                 material are: (1) the external process variables of stress,                     temperature, strain, strain rate, frictional and heat transfer                  boundary conditions, and their evolution; and (2) the internal                  microstructural variables, for example porosity, crystallographic               texture, deformation localization and their evolution culminating               in ductile failure.  While considerable attention has been paid to              developing a capability for predicting defects associated with the              growth of porosity in deformation processing operations, much                   remains to be done with regard to incorporating the evolution of                other important microstructural features in macroscopic                         mathematical models.  Specifically there is need for incorporating              the effects due to crystallographic texture and deformation                     localization and failure.                                                            This project is to develop accurate anisotropic thermo-                    elastic-viscoplastic constitutive equations and computational                   procedures for modeling and simulation of inelastic deformations                due to both crystallographic slip and twinning in face-centered                 cubic and hexagonal-closed packed alloys.  The computational                    capability will be useful in simulating the development of                      anisotropy due to the evolution of crystallographic texture, and                the development of material processing defects associated with                  localized shear bands at large deformations at both low and high                homologous temperatures.  The mathematical models should be useful              in the design and analysis of a variety of cold and hot deformation             processing operations.  Such models will allow the faster and more              accurate design of tools and procedures for forming metal parts.",
