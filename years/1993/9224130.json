 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general problems presented by terrestrial environments are                  carried to extremes by subtropical deserts, which are notable for               their high temperatures and their capacity to desiccate organisms.              Traditional views suggest that small insectivorous birds encounter              little difficulty in maintaining water balance because of the high              fractional hydration of their prey.  There is remarkably little                 direct evidence to support this view; water balance in small                    insectivorous birds exposed to environmental conditions normally                prevailing in subtropical deserts is essentially unknown.  Recent               analyses, however, suggest that even under cool conditions, small               birds may show either a water deficit or barely balance their water             budgets over the daily cycle.  This research focuses on (a) the                 physiological and ecological bases of the suppression of vital                  activities by a very small, diurnal bird, the Verdin, during the                hottest portions of the summer day in the Sonoran Desert, and (b)               dissecting the physiological foundation for occupancy of this most              extreme terrestrial habitat by developing a complete water budget               for animals exposed to ecologically realistic conditions.  This                 project will examine Verdin daily activity patterns, microclimate               selection, avenues and rates of water intake and loss, field                    metabolic rates, patterns of resource utilization and resource                  availability and abundance.",
