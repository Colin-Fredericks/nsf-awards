 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lin will work to obtain an extension of the Weyl-von Neumann               theorem which will be used to give a complete classification of C*-             algebra extensions of C(X), X a compact subset of the plane, by a               sigma unital simple C*-algebra.  He will also investigate whether               every C*-algebra of real rank zero has weak (FN), as has been shown             by Lin in many cases.  A final problem to be studied is that of                 classifying certain equivalence classes of homomorphisms from one               C*-algebra to another.                                                               The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in non-commutative geometry, which is                    becoming increasingly important in physics.",
