 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in material development have brought us a full                  class of \"smart materials.\"  Active noise and vibration control                 is one application for which these materials are well suited.  In               fact, for actuators, terfenol-D is the smart material that we                   believe holds the most promise for many future applications                     because of its large displacement capabilities.  Terfenol-D can                 also produce large forces compared to other actuator materials                  The major disadvantage of a terfenol-D actuator, however, is high               distortion.                                                                                                                                                     A method to linearize this type of nonlinear device will be                     developed by integrating a nonlinear inverse filter based on a                  Volterra expansion into a linear type feedback control system.                  Phase I work will strive to prove that this concept will work by                measuring the uncontrolled response of an actuator, designing the               control system in real-time on the actuator.                                                                                                                    Proof of the effectiveness of this type of control approach will                be beneficial in controlling any nonlinear system that is                       stationary.  The particular application of the terfenol-D                       actuator was chosen because of the investigators familiarity with               the type of nonlinearities in actuators.",
