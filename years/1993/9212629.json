 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary project will be devoted to the study                of effective numerical methods for large-scale solutions and                    parallel computations of several fundamental linear algebra                     problems arising in the design and analysis of linear control                   systems. Specific attention will be paid to the development and                 implementation of computationally viable algorithms for: feedback               stabilization of the large second-order model; computing the                    frequency response and the H-infinity norm of a large and sparse                matrix; and parallel and high performance computing of important                matrix equations such as the Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati and               the eigenvalue assignment problems. Some numerical analysis                     aspects such as conditioning of the problems and stability of the               algorithms will be considered, as well. The use of                              state-of-the-art techniques in matrix computations such as the                  GMRES and QMR algorithms, Rank Revealing QR factorizations,                     condition estimations schemes such as SPICE, ICE, ACE, etc., and                the associated software packages (e.g. LAPACK) will be                          emphasized.  The algorithms to be developed in this project and                 their implementations on vector supercomputer and massive                       parallel architectures will permit fast, accurate, and reliable                 solutions of large-scale control problems arising in practical                  situations such as the design of large space structures, control                of power systems, and for other problems that otherwise could not               be handled in a reasonable time, if at all. The proposed research               will thus address some of the critical needs for research in the                area of large-scale and parallel computations in control theory                 outlined in the recent panel report \"Future Directions in Control               Theory: A Mathematical Perspective\". The project is timely and                  benefit both applied mathematicians and control theorists and                   engineers.",
