 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the number of jobs in which shared rather than individual                    work continues to grow, the way people work must be re-                         examined. This proposal suggests that in today's workplace,                     computer scientists must be adept at both technical as well as                  communication skills. Educators must prepare students to work                   in the collaborative environments found in today's industry.                    The individual programmer is rapidly becoming extinct. This                     proposal is to adapt an existing computer-supported cooperative                 problem solving environment and use it in software development                  courses. By doing this, the problem solving skills of students                  will be expanded and thus release into the computer science                     community graduates who are more effective programmers. The                     environment will encourage cooperative work and yet provide                     instructors with some ability to monitor individual as well as                  group performance. This proposal is to network the requested                    machines, configure them with the cooperative problem solving                   environment, and dedicate them to this project. With a student                  machine ratio of 3.5, students will be able to learn software                   engineering techniques and, at the same time, gain valuable                     experience in working together on large team projects.",
