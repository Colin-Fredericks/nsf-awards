 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot project, co-funded by Occidental Petroleum and the                   University of Kansas, will inventory terrestrial vertebrates,                   insects and woody vegetation and measure abiotic/physical data in               the Amazon rainforest of northern Peru.  The inventory will serve               as the basis for a biological master plan for the Peruvian                      government to survey, monitor and reclaim areas being developed by              Occidental and other concerns for petroleum extraction.  The pilot              project will survey plotted quadrats at two sites.  Voucher                     specimens will be divided between KU and the Museo de Historia                  Natural in Lima.  Permits will be issued by the Peruvian Government             under the auspices of the Associacion de Ecologia y Conservacion                (ECCO) in Lima.  CITES threatened and endangered species will not               be collected.  The NSF funds will support the vertebrate component              of the survey, with OXY supporting the woody vegetation, insect and             physical parameters component.  KU has already funded the                       development of this project and will support travel by KU                       personnel.  The quadrats will be permanently marked for future                  work, which OXY promises to support. This collaboration promises                to become a long-term partnership between KU and OXY in                         conservation and restoration projects in Peru.                                  %%%                                                                             This pilot project is a uniquely opportunistic and fruitful                     collaboration between US industry, US basic academic science,                   Peruvian government agencies and NSF to establish the responsible               monitoring, conservation and reclamation of biodiversity on lands               impacted by extractive industries.  The study, funded with                      Occidental Petroleum and the University of Kansas, will inventory               terrestrial plants and animals and measure relevant climatic,                   physical and chemical data on lands in the Amazon rainforest of                 northern Peru being developed by Occidental and other concerns for              petroleum extraction .  The inventory will serve as the basis for               a biological master plan for the Peruvian government to survey,                 monitor and reclaim such areas throughout the country.",
