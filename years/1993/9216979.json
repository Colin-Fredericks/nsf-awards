 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in materials science between Randolph S. Duran of the University                of Florida and J. Le Moigne of the Institute of Physics and                     Chemistry of Materials in Strasbourg, France.  The objective of                 the research is to develop thin films of new, conjugated polyenic               polymers with enhanced non-linear optical (NLO) properties. While               materials with NLO properties have been known since the sixties                 and applied in integrated optics and photonics, there is a need                 to study the structure-property correlation of these materials in               order to optimize their design.                                                                                                                                 The French group will synthesize a series of polymers having high               planar content, thus allowing for high NLO properties.                          Subsequently, the Florida group will prepare thin films with                    controlled molecular conformation and ordering from the                         synthesized polymers.  The structure of the resulting thin films                will be characterized by both groups.  The proposal takes                       advantage of the expertise of an outstanding French polymer                     research group in synthesis and characterization techniques.  The               collaboration will advance the basic understanding of the NLO                   properties of polymers and their potential for optoelectric and                 photonic applications.",
