 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351550  Jones       The College has acquired new astronomical instrumentation for  the school's Boller & Chivens 16\" research grade cassegrain  telescope to be used by the undergraduate students for  instruction and research. A Star I CCD (Charge Coupled Device)  from Photometrics along with an IBM-XT controlling computer and  software, a wide-band filter set (UBVRI) and filter wheel for  stellar photometry, and a spectrograph for astronomical  spectroscopy are being used. An upper division project oriented  observational astronomy course is being implemented using this  equipment and an existing SUN workstation network with the IRAF  data reduction package. A partial objective of the  observational course is to supply observational data for  integration into the introductory astronomy labs. The  introductory astronomy students have the opportunity to see how  these observations are obtained at the telescope, enhancing the  educational value of the labs which use the locally obtained  data. The general public also has the chance to see modern  observing techniques demonstrated on public viewing nights.  Finally, the equipment is being used in student research, and  there is the possibility of joint projects with other schools  with similar facilities.  ***",
