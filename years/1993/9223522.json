 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve the reliability and accuracy of financial             reporting by helping auditors, regulators, and corporate management             to better assess an organization's control environment (CE).  The               CE is made up of various abstract, non-financial factors such as                management's integrity, attitudes, and practices.  Specifically,                this project investigates how the experienced auditor represents                and processes information about the CE.                                                                                                                         The project blends theory and practice by incorporating a cognitive             science approach into the assessment of an audit judgment task.                 The project will improve CE evaluations by:  (a) accumulating a                 database of expert knowledge regarding factors critical to CE                   evaluation; (b) creating structured representations of the                      auditor's mental model of relations among CE factors and audit risk             factors; (c) relating information-gathering techniques to relevant              CE factors; (d) elucidating how information framing and the                     auditor's perspective influence CE evaluation and memory; and (e)               developing a CE decision aid for systematic assessment and                      documentation of the CE.                                                                                                                                        Improving the assessment of the CE will not only increase the                   reliability of the financial reporting process, but will also                   improve the validity and accuracy of financial reports.  This, in               turn, will promote increased confidence in the securities markets,              benefiting not only corporations and their investors, but the                   economy and society as well.",
