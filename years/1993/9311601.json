 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311601  Haynes  Current federal legislation regulating the treatment of animals in  research incorporates a requirement that the physical environment  in research facilities be \"adequate to promote the psychological  well-being of nonhuman primates.\"  The purpose of this study is to  identify and examine the different and competing conceptions of  welfare that various professional and lay groups bring to the  discussion of this requirement.  The goal is to clarify the issues  about which the discussants disagree.  This can help to provide a  framework for conflict resolution, especially in considering the  role of expert knowledge in regulating the humane use of laboratory  animals.  With assistance from a primatology graduate student, the  investigator will collect and analyse relevant information  indicating how different groups conceive of psychological well  being and of the enrichment plans intended to promote it.  Besides  examining written materials, the investigator will attend a wide  range of conferences and meetings and visit a variety of agencies  and organizations, including selected regional primate centers, in  order to gather information and interview representatives of  different professional and lay groups on the topic.  The analysis  of materials and conversations will allow the investigator to  develop a prelininary report to summarize findings and to consider  whether a more formal survey would be useful.  Telephone interviews  will be conducted during the last several months of the project, to  pretest questions for a potential survey, to provide a basis for  revising and evaluating the preliminary report, and to develop  dissemination plans.  Results from project will be disseminated in  the form of a book and articles, as presentations to interested  groups, and in symposia.  This project, by generating insight into  the ways professional and lay people think about the psychological  well being of primates, will provide assistance in improving  communication and resolvin g policy disputes.  ***",
