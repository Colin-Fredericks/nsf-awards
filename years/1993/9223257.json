 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most interesting questions in macroeconomics concern the behavior               of unobservables; they become answerable only if they are couched               in terms of structural models.  To use data to evaluate the                     model, researchers require identifying assumptions which come                   from outside the model.  The recent direction taken in                          macroeconomics has been to develop a structural model and ignore                many observed relationships among US macroeconomic variables or                 to analyze macroeconomic data with little regard for economic                   theory.  In many cases, the necessary identifying assumptions are               never made explicit.  This project develops a new methodology for               estimating and analyzing dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium               macroeconomic models.  The methodology involves expanding the                   stochastic rank of the model and imposing enough restrictions on                the model so that is just-identified.  The technique permits the                analysis of models which fit all statistical relationships in the               data set.  Models with a limited number of shocks cannot do this.               Unlike most current analyses of macroeconomic models, it does not               require unnecessary ad hoc restrictions in the model.  The                      questions studied using this new methodology include:  Is the                   slowdown in the growth rate of measured productivity since 1973                 due to changes in actual productivity or due to an increase in                  the growth rate of (unobservable) quality of goods?  Is there a                 stable money demand function?  How does the presence of an                      underground economy affect the choice of optimal monetary                       policies?                                                                                                                                                       The productivity slowdown of the past two decades has been well-                documented.  Productivity growth declines from 2.9% over the                    period 1957 to 1973 to an average of 0.5% since 1973.  This has                 been explained as due to the rise in oil prices in the early                    1970s, a decline in technological progress, or a measurement                    error caused by a failure to adjust adequately for the higher                   quality of outputs.  The methodology developed in this project                  can be used to distinguish among these explanations.  The                       importance of the oil price shock is analyzed by examining the                  obsolescence of the capital stock and the 1973 price hike, the                  later, lesser increase in 1979, and the disintegration of OPEC                  during the 1980s.",
