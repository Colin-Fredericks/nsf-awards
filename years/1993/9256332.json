 "awd_abstract_narration": "While politics and economics were contained in a single                         discipline over much aof the period of modern scholarship, these                fields were split during the 20th century.  It is now apparent                  that this split, while advantageous for certain scientific                      developments, places artificial constraints on the study of many                important social issues.  The separate development of the                       disciplines has worked to make communication and joint training                 across disciplinary boundaries generally difficult.  The                        rejoining of political science and economics into political                     economy has been underway for a couple of decades now.  The                     fruits of this research are numerous, and its promise is greater                than ever.  The political scientist's emphasis on institutions                  affects economic performance, while the economist's individual                  choice viewpoint has made political scientists examine more                     critically their theories about the formation, evolution and                    maintenance of institutions.  The improved understanding that                   results from such interdisciplinary exchange improves the way we                address important policy problems ranging from the management of                firms to the design of constitutions.  This grant provides funds                to develop the associated graduate training which accompanies the               on-going research activities at the University of Rochester in                  political economy.                                                                                                                                              The University of Rochester has made a major commitment toward                  developing the perspective of political economy, the study of how               individual behavior is affected by and in turn determines                       institutional and political structures.  During the Spring of                   1991 the University created the Wallis Institute of Political                   Economy, provided it with a $3.5 million endowment for base                     support, and moved to develop both research and ultimately,                     training in the area, a project made possible by the current,                   broad based research of the faculties of the underlying                         Departments and by their historically close working and                         intellectual relationships.  Graduate Research Traineeships allow               the development of a Ph.D. Program in Political Economy,                        something that is not possible with the current Institute                       funding.  The other activities of the Wallis Institute will                     provide a rich environment for the new training program.  The                   program also develops innovative instructional methods having                   spillovers for other activities of the Department.",
