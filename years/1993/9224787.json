 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the relationships between campaign                    spending, incumbency and electoral outcomes in U.S. Congressional               elections.  The approach combines formal political/economic                     methodologies, statistical modelling, and analysis of empirical                 data during the period 1970-1990.  The theoretical models are aimed             at understanding the strategic factors underlying spending races                between challengers and incumbents.  The game-theoretic approach                employed emphasizes the importance of looking at both causal                    directions in the vote-spending connection.  In one direction,                  campaign finance/spending activities affect margins of victory and              can be a deciding factor in who wins an election; in the other                  direction, candidate and contributor expectations of how close the              election is likely to be affect campaign finance/spending                       decisions.  Both directons are important, and the jointness or                  simultaneity of spending decisions and voting outcomes leads to                 difficult statistical problems of measurement and estimation, as                well as raising a number of challenging theoretical issues.                                                                                                     Most previous research focuses primarily on one direction (the                  first one mentioned above), and attempts to fit a \"vote equation\"               to measure the effect of spending on electoral outcomes.  The                   current approach explicitly combines this with an estimation of                 \"spending equations,\" where the reciprocal effect of anticipated                closeness is simultaneously estimated with the effect of spending               on the final outcome.  This enables the investigators to                        disentangle some complex interactions between the variables of                  primary interest:  incumbent spending, challenger spending, and the             vote share of the incumbent.                                                                                                                                    Preliminary results of this investigation suggest substantial                   revisions to the central findings of several prior studies, and                 point to interesting new directions for investigation within the                framework of this game-theoretic approach.  Those new directions,               both theoretical and empirical, form the agenda of this research                project.",
