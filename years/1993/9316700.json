However,  comparison of critical-wedge models to geologic examples has  been limited to static analysis of modern accretionary  wedges and fold-thrust belts and with only partial success  in ancient foreland fold-thrust belts.  Present models  remain largely untested in four area:  wedge shape through  time, internal wedge structure, effect of erosion and  foreland basin subsidence, and link between material  properties and the discrete internal structures such as  foreland-younging fold-thrusts.  This project will address  these issues by focusing on quantitative incremental  retrodeformation of wedge shape and internal thrust geometry  for a 36 million year period of hinterland basement uplift  and foreland thin-skinned thrust slip in the well-known  Wyoming-Utah Sevier Thrust Belt.  Results are expected to  test several important correlaries of the critical-wedge  theory, as well as help resolve regional questions  concerning the geometric and kinematic relationships between  faults in this thrust belt.",
