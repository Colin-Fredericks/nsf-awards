 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306912  Glickman    Siblicide, the killing of one sibling by another, has been well studied in a number  of bird species, but has only recently been described in a mammal.  Integrating  data from a long-term field study with observations made in a research colony,  Dr. Laurence Frank has found that newborn spotted hyenas fight violently at  birth, have an array of adaptations for winning the fight, and that one usually  dies in the first weeks of life when both sibs are the same sex.  This aggression is  associated with massive prenatal exposure to androgens, which are presumably  responsible for the unique syndrome of genital masculinization, enhanced  aggressiveness, and dominance over males that characterizes the female spotted  hyena.  Reproductive records from a long-term field study show that female  hyenas appear to adjust the sex ratio of their offspring according to their own  social rank and current demographic conditions.    Through intensive study of wild female hyenas and their offspring in the critical  first month of life, Dr. Frank will test the hypothesis that female spotted hyenas  are able to influence the outcome of neonatal aggression to concentrate parental  investment in a singleton of the favored sex.  Behavioral observations will  commence at birth, and will include detailed observations of maternal behavior at  the natal den and regular inspection of the den hole with a fiber-optic video  camera to monitor number and condition of the young.  To assess costs of offspring  of both sexes, Dr. Frank will regularly assess dominance relations within the litter  and weight gain by cubs.  In addition, he will continue to maintain genealogical,  demographic, and dominance records that date back to 1979.    This research addresses basic questions in three fields of behavioral biology:  sibling aggression and parent-offspring conflict, sex-ratio adjustment, and  hormonal influences on aggression.  Siblicide poses an array of questions that  challenge our understanding of kin sele ction and the costs of reproduction.  Under  what circumstances is it evolutionarily advantageous for a young animal to kill its  nearest relative?  Does this behavior also benefit the parents' fitness, or does the  surviving sibling benefit at the cost of both its dead sib and its parents?  Should  the primary hypothesis be proven, it will demonstrate that maternal behavior is  capable of influencing the sex ratio of offspring after birth, and will lead to  important questions about the cognitive processes involved, since the  demonstrated pattern of adjustment apparently responds to changing ecological  and social variables.  This work is coordinated with a major study of hyena  endocrinology and development in Berkeley, one goal of which is to identify the  role of prenatal androgens in shaping neonatal aggression.  Because humans  produce the same hormones that appear to influence physical and behavioral  development of the spotted hyena, insights into their role in hyena aggression may  help focus questions about their role in human behavior.",
