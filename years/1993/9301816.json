 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the analysis and development of an                      innovative sensing system that combines conventional remote                     sensors and signal processing techniques that extract the                       corrupted portion of signals. Typically, in diagnostic systems                  the sensor output is corrupted by the machine itself since the                  sensor cannot be generally placed at the site where the signal to               be measured is generated. For example, in machine tools, some                   cutting  force sensors depend upon the measurement of strain in                 the outer race of the machine tools, others depend upon the load                measured at the base of the tool turret, and still others depend                on the current consumed by the feed or spindle motor. A                         monitorability index (MI) is developed in this research which not               only improves the sensor reliability and performance, but also                  provides a means of systematically optimizing the design of a                   particular sensing system. The design procedure yields a simple                 rational method to determine the most appropriate signals to                    measure and the type of transducers to use. The technique of                    using a model to correct the corrupted signal belongs to the                    class of techniques known as model-based estimators. This sensing               system, which is based on MI and is called Model Based Sensing                  (MBS) is implemented for tool force and spindle bearing                         monitoring on existing machine tools and its performance is                     compared with traditional model-based estimation strategies.***                  //",
