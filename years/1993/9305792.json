 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports mathematical research focusing on                      analytic and geometric problems associated with functions and                   domains defined in the complex plane.  The work combines methods                of harmonic analysis, quasiconformal mapping and geometric                      function theory.  Certain domains which have been identified as                 being particularly suited to questions of extensions of analytic                maps to quasiconformal maps, chord-arc domains, form a class                    whose generic properties will be analyzed.  This will include the               question of whether the class is connected.  In addition,                       work will be done on the problem of factorizing                                 bi-Lipschitz planar maps, using the boundedness of a the Cauchy                 integral to obtain geometric information about domains                          and obtaining distortion estimates for quasiconformal maps in                   higher dimensions.  Included in the research will be work to                    extend the recent results of Bishop-Jones on quasicircles to the                problem of determining which quasiconformal maps send the line                  onto a chord-arc curve.                                                              The theories of geometric function theory and quasiconformal               mapping have contributed significantly to the understanding of                  geometric transformations of plane domains and domains in                       higher dimensions where the transformations are constrained by                  the amount of twisting or shrinking that is permitted                           (bounded dilatation).   This project continues this tradition by                taking up the study of several new concepts which have arisen in                the past few years.",
