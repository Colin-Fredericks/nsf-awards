There are  six areas under investigation.  They include asymptotics and  painleve transcendents involving solutions obtained by inverse  scattering, shooting methods applied to the study of chaos,  specially in the analysis of Lorenz equations, and self-similar  solutions of Barenblatt's fourth order model for the decay of  turbulent bursts.  Work will also be done expanding recent  studies of stability in modeling solid state diffusion  in semiconductors, asymptotics beyond all orders in fifth  order equations and on the smoothing of Stokes discontinuities in  the asymptotic expansions of analytic functions.       Differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
