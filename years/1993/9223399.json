 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to improve scientific knowledge                about the key factors contributing to the performance and                       productivity of information systems (I/S) in U.S. corporations.                 The research is funded under the Joint NSF/Private Sector                       Initiative and will be conducted through collaborative work with                a Cooperating Organization.  The Cooperating Organization will                  provide scientific and practical input, access to study sites,                  assistance in data collection, and leadership in dissemination of               the results of the research to other corporations.                              The research involves five activities: 1) development of models                 of information services as a production process, 2) collection of               data to provide empirical estimates for the social,                             organizational and performance variables in the models, 3)                      analysis aimed at determining the relationships between these                   variables in computer operations and systems development as                     separate processes, 4) application of the models in the                         operations of at least one organization, and 5) conduct of a                    workshop aimed at disseminating the results of the project to                   other corporations.                                                             The research will advance knowledge in the information systems                  field by developing and applying models of the production of                    information services.  The models will identify the key variables               in I/S production and their inter-relationships, and thereby                    provide a means of greater understanding and operational control.               The results of the research will be generalizable to the private                sector, and are expected to improve performance of the I/S                      function in U.S. corporations from \"common practice\" towards                    \"best practice.\"",
