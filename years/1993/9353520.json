The first project was a two county alliance  and 50 school districts.  The new project will involve four new  counties.  The project will do the following:         o    recruit and preprogram train of local            scientists/engineers and teachers.         o    pairing of scientists/engineers and teachers based on            appropriate areas of expertise and interest.         o    development of industry/teacher/student networks that            will bring practicing scientists and engineers into the            classroom to provide appropriate role models and provide            teachers and students opportunities to hear about up to            date  science from those actually doing the work.         o    development of a program of science modules by teams of            scientists/engineers and teachers, complete with            appropriate supplies, which focus on consumer relevant            issues, including technological advances in the physical            sciences, environmental science, product chemistry and            product use biology, that teachers can use in the K - 12            classroom.         o    provision for the implementation and            expansion/dissemination of the program through extensive            teacher training by their peers in the modules developed            in the section described above.    The training of the teachers to be lead teachers in the training of  their peers is critical to this project and has been successful in  the previous project.    The cost share is 89% of the face value of the award from the  Foundation.  ***",
