 "awd_abstract_narration": "The origin of the continental crust is fundamental to                           understanding the evolution of the Earth as a whole.  Recent                    work has shown the bimodal behavior of certain siderophile                      and chalcophile mobile elements (e.g. Pb, As, Sb) in terms                      of their greater than expected enrichments in volcanic arcs                     and the continental crust, compared to their geochemical                        behavior during igneous fractionation.  This project will                       extend our studies to additional elements (e.g. Pb, Zn, Cd,                     Sn, Hg, and Bi) in suites we have analyzed for other                            elements.  Characterizing and quantifying the affected                          elements and their enrichments will allow a better                              understanding of the location and geochemical conditions                        under which the enrichments occurred, for example, ridge                        versus subduction zone environments.  We will analyze new                       samples for our complete set of siderophile elements, from                      additional arcs and from samples that extend our across-arc                     data.  The compositional data from the volcanic arcs from                       additional samples of the ancient continental crust will be                     important for  improving estimates of the composition of the                    continental crust.  The modelling efforts will use a more                       sophisticated transport model that will also allow                              evaluation of isotopic constraints.",
