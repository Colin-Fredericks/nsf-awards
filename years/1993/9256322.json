 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Graduate Research Traineeship will enable Lehigh                           University to support five trainees, initiate two new                           research thrusts and expand two existing research areas in                      the Materials Science and Engineering (MS&E) Department at                      Lehigh University.  Since 1988, four new and experienced                        faculty have entered the Department and two more start in                       1992-93, thus creating the need for more graduates.  The                        trainees will work in materials processing,                                     characterization, and theory/modeling, which comprise a 1992                    Presidential Initiative:-the Advanced Materials and                             Processing Program.                                                             %%%                                                                             This initiative highlights the importance of MS&E to the                        industrial and economic growth of the USA.  To enhance the                      trainees' experience, they will participate in an internship                    at a major US research laboratory.  Letters of commitment                       have been obtained from nine companies and two National                         Laboratories.  The trainees will have the opportunity for                       research at one of six European Universities and will teach                     in an undergraduate laboratory course at Lehigh.  To                            overcome barriers that dissuade US undergraduates from                          entering Ph. D. programs, the NSF stipends will be increased                    and, where possible, the time to complete the Ph. D. will be                    reduced through an intensive precursor Master of Science                        level program.",
