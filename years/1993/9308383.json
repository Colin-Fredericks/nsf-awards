 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308383  Kardes    In decision making and everyday judgment, people must frequently  draw conclusions and make decisions on the basis of limited or  incomplete information.  Rarely is complete information available  about all relevant dimensions or aspects of a target object or  issue.  Consequently, it is important to understand how people  respond to limited information.  This collaborative research is  designed to investigate the psychological processes involved in  decision making based on limited or incomplete evidence.  It is  guided by the omission detection model, which prior research has  shown to be useful for integrating many seemingly unrelated  findings and for generating many new hypotheses concerning the  judgmental effects of previously neglected decision relevant  variables.  The research investigates several different judgmental  processes (i.e., sensitivity to missing information, attributional  processes, and inference processes), several different dimensions  of judgment (i.e., judgmental extremity, confidence, and  uncertainty), and several different types of judgments (i.e.,  attitudinal judgments, preference judgments, likelihood judgments,  and judgments of category membership).  The goal of this research  is to extend prior theory and research on the omission detection  model, and to develop debiasing applications based on this model.   The research will assess the utility of these procedures for  improving judgment and decision making based on limited evidence.  ***",
