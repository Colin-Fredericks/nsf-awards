 "awd_abstract_narration": "The feeding ecology and energetics of two common surface-nesting                petrels that breed in the high Antarctic, the Cape Pigeon  and                  the Snow Petrel will be addressed through a variety of field and                laboratory techniques.  Both the diet and energy requirements of                adults and their offspring will be quantified.  By conducting                   measurements over three consecutive breeding seasons, interannual               variation in feeding ecology and reproductive performance will be               assessed.  The field metabolic rate of adult petrels will be                    determined during the incubation and chick-rearing stages of the                breeding cycle using the doubly labeled water technique.  Basal                 metabolic rates of adults will be determined from laboratory                    measurements of oxygen consumption and their reproductive effort                expressed as the ratio of field metabolic rate to basal                         metabolism.  Foraging trip length of adults will be partitioned                 into time spent resting on water and in flight and foraging                     energy cost will be estimated.  Nestling growth will be assessed                from measurements of body mass, size and composition as functions               of nestling age and nestling energy budgets will be constructed.                Diet of nestlings and their parents will be determined from                     parental food deliveries and stable isotope analysis of prey and                feces.  Diet information combined with doubly labeled water                     measurements will allow calculation of rates of food consumption,               and, hence, the trophic impact of these breeding fulmarine                      petrels on the surrounding marine ecosystem.",
