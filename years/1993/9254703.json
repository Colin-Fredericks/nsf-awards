 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Smithsonian Institution's Office of Environmental                      Awareness, National Museum of Natural History, and Traveling                    Exhibition Service are developing a major traveling                             exhibition, Ocean Planet, that will heighten public awareness                   of the need for ocean conservation.  Ocean Planet will show                     how our lives are connected to the seas, illustrate the                         rapidly mounting problems threatening coastlines and open                       oceans, and feature promising efforts to manage oceans and                      oceanic resources in a sustainable manner.  The exhibition and                  its accompanying programs will introduce the American public                    to the science underlying ocean conservation, including the                     fields of biogeochemistry, economics, fisheries biology,                        geology, marine anthropology, marine biology, and                               oceanography.  Evaluation studies conducted before, during,                     and after exhibition development will help make the exhibition                  and programs more responsive to its audience.  Following a                      six-month showing in the National Museum of Natural History,                    and modifications based on visitor studies, Ocean Planet will                   visit eight American cities, introducing millions of museum,                    aquarium, and science center visitors to environmental issues                   affecting oceans.  The exhibition will be accompanied by an                     extensive program of  educational materials and activities                      outside of the host site.  A program of education grants to                     the venues on the national tour will encourage collaboration                    with local educational institutions and community groups.                                                                                                            We request $951,050 from the National Science                              Foundation's Informal Science Education Program to Support                      exhibition research, designs, evaluation, fabrication, and the                  development of accompanying educational materials.  The                         additional $3,000,000 needed complete the project will be                       raised from corporate sources, private foundations, and the                     Smithsonian Institution.",
