 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is a determination of the three-                       dimensional structure of the hydroxylase component of the enzyme                methane monooxygenase (MMO, EC 1.14.13.25).  MMO catalyzes the                  conversion of methane into methanol.  High quality crystals of                  MMO hydroxylase which diffract to 2 A resolution have been                      obtained.  The crystal structure will be solved using multiple                  isomorphous replacement techniques.  The resulting model will be                refined used XPLOR and PROFFT to maximize the agreement with the                observed diffraction data.  The refined structure will be                       analyzed in light of continuing spectroscopic and kinetic                       analyses by our collaborator, Dr. John Lipscomb, to provide a                   framework for understanding how this enzyme functions.                          %%%                                                                             Dr. Ohlendorf proposes to determine the structure of the                        catalytic portion of methane monoxygnease (MMO) to understand to                better understand how it works.  There are several reasons why                  this enzyme is being studied.  One is that MMO plays a key                      ecological role in recapturing of billions of tons of the                       greenhouse gas, methane, into biomass.  If this enzyme suddenly                 disappeared from the face of the earth, all that methane would be               released into the atmosphere.  Second, the reaction catalyzed by                MMO is important in the production of clean burning fuels.  An                  understanding of how MMO functions could assist in the design of                improved catalysts for this process.  Third, MMO produces an                    extremely reactive species that is capable of inserting an oxygen               into virtually any C-H bond.  The ability to control and modulate               this activity has tremendous potential in developing new                        processes for the synthesis and breakdown of difficult molecules.",
