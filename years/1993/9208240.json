 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to develop and study randomized, fault-                      tolerant, fast, self-routing algorithms for Clos networks.                      These algorithms are suitable for synchronous as well as                        asynchronous routing, and apply to the buffered packet-                         switching mode as well as to the unbuffered circuit-switching                   mode.  The algorithms are based on the idea that setting the                    first column of a Clos network results in a self-routable                       network.  The algorithm sets the first column randomly.                         Several new randomization approaches will be developed                          yielding various routing algorithms of constant time control                    and very small routing delay.                                                                                                                                   The performance of each of the algorithms in fault-free and                     faulty Clos networks will be studied using both probabilistic                   analysis and simulation.  The performance metrics, measured as                  a function of the switch size and the number of faulty                          switches, are the number of network cycles per permutation in                   synchronous routing, and the message delay and network                          throughput in asynchronous routing.  Performance comparisons                    will be made between the algorithms to identify the best                        algorithm(s), and between the buffered packet-switching mode                    and the unbuffered circuit-switching mode to determine whether                  the added cost of buffers is justifiable in randomized                          routing.                                                                                                                                                        The universality, high fault tolerance, self-routedness, and                    the expected small routing delays of our novel randomized                       routing algorithms make Clos networks not only superior to                      other networks, but also so fast and fault tolerant that they                   greatly improve the speed, throughput and reliability of                        parallel computer systems.",
