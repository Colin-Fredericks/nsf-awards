 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a coordinated team research project to be conducted in             ten large American cities to analyze the circumstances and dynamics             by which cities organize efforts to achieve significant educational             reform and further related human capital development opportunities.             The primary goals are to analyze the origins, progress, and extent              of education reform efforts; to map out the coalitions and                      political interactions and structures that form the context for                 effective or ineffective policymaking; to determine empirically the             success of different types of civic arrangements in initiating and              sustaining education reform; and to provide information about the               factors that activate sociopolitical support for education and                  related programs.  The concept of \"civic capacity\" as a dynamic                 win/win construct for all important civic actors is the central                 theoretical notion.  The cities to be studied are: Atlanta,                     Baltimore, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami,                        Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington.  The research teams                will use a common set of instruments and procedures and analyze the             results using a common framework.  Fieldwork, analysis, and initial             reporting will take approximately two and a half years.  The                    project should not only illuminate the process of systemic reform,              but should provide independent information useful in interpreting               the progress and results of NSF's Urban Systemic Initiative.",
