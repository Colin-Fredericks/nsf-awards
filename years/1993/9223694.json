 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two major foundations of modern microeconomic theory are the                    concepts of efficiency and that of equilibria.  These concepts                  are of practical significance as well, for efficiency is a                      frequent objective of policy analysis, and an equilibrium is                    taken as a close approximation to what would happen under various               policy alternatives.  This project is based on a new approach to                the study of competitive equilibria, using two new optimization                 principles  These principles lead very naturally to algorithms to               actually compute economic equilibria, and these algorithms offer                advantages over existing methods in terms of execution time and                 reliability.  This project extends the theory, mainly in the area               of economies with externalities, and continues the development of               algorithms.                                                                                                                                                     The work in this project is based on two optimization principles                that characterize economic equilibria and efficiency.  These                    principles lead to a new proof of the existence of a general                    competitive equilibrium, to new characterizations of economic                   efficiency in the presence of externalities, and to new                         algorithms for computing equilibria.  Underlying this work is a                 new microeconomic construct termed the benefit function.  This                  function measures an individual's preferences and has the                       property that it can be meaningfully summed across individuals to               obtain a total benefit for the economy.  The first optimization                 principle, the zero-maximum principle, states that an allocation                of resources is efficient if and only if it maximizes the total                 benefit and makes that benefit equal to zero.  The second                       optimization principle, the zero-minimum principle, is the dual                 to the first.  It states that the total surplus of income, equal                to the total value of profit plus endowment minus the total                     consumer expenditure required to achieve fixed preference levels,               is minimized the rendered equal to zero by an efficient price                   vector.",
