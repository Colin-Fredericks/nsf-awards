 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312195  Ruden  Future electronics technology will rely on electronics devices whose principles of operation are very different from those of current devices.  As the critical dimensions shrink into the so-called mesoscopic range, phenomena such as quantum coherence and tunneling will dominate the characteristics of  structures which may contain only few electrons.  It is the underlying vision of this proposal that the transfer of electrons between nanostructures and the coupling of the electrons within these structures via Coulomb interactions are of crucial importance for possible future applications, e.g. high speed random access memory.  One coupling mechanism of the electrons within closely spaced nanostructures, and specifically quantum wires, is due to wavefunction overlap, i.e. tunneling.  A second coupling mechanism involving the Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the associated exchange interaction.   Our primary goals are   -to demonstrate and anayze new phenomena that occur when two  quantum wires are placed in close proximity so that there is  strong coupling.   -to explore new concepts for computation or data storage  based on instabilities in coupled quantum wires that were  recently predicted independently by Wu and Ruden and by  Gold.  The reseach proposed includes work on the theory of quantum structures, on materials growth, nanoscale device fabrication, and extensive characterization.  In particular, we will explore experimentally and theoretically the electronic structure and transport properties of quantum wires in III-V semiconductor heterostructures.  ***",
