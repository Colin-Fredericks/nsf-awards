The conference is                             scheduled for July 26-30, 1993 in Zhaoqing, Qixinghu, China.                    The theme of the conference is curriculum reform in physics.                    The work of the conference will be done by seven working                        groups with balanced membership from the three countries.                       In the United States, dissemination of conference                               recommendations derived from working group reports is                           facilitated by the American Associations of Physics                             Teachers, the submitting agency, in their journals and at                       their national and state meetings.  This conference is the                      third in a series of three such tri-partite conferences on                      physics education.",
