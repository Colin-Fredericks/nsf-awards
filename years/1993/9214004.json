 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Joseph W. Kloepper and a graduate student of            Auburn University to collaborate in biological research with Dr. Jim            W. L. van Vuurde of the Bacteriology Department of the Research                 Institute for Plant Protection in Wageningen, the Netherlands.  Their           goal in working with the Dutch group is to acquire state of the art             experience in research related to detecting and monitoring bacteria             in complex ecosystems, and to apply these techniques to future                  research in the U.S.   In particular, the objectives of their work              are to learn and evaluate advanced immunological techniques to                  quantify and differentiate introduced wild-type plant-associated                bacteria.  They will evaluate selected immunological methods and                compare them with model genetic marking systems for assessing overall           bacterial colonization of plants.  The project links two research               groups with complementary expertise: the Dutch have been innovators             in immunological approaches to bacterial detection and the U.S. group           has particular expertise in the microbial ecology of beneficial                 plant-associated bacteria.  The U.S. graduate student will gain                 research experience at a European center of excellence which will               contribute to his dissertation project.                                                                                                                         In situ detection of and monitoring the population dynamics of                  specific bacteria in complex ecosystems has historically been an                important aspect of microbial ecology with natural populations of               bacteria.  These processes have recently received renewed emphasis              for studying introductions of genetically engineered microorganisms.            The principal limiting factor in such ecological investigations has             been the difficulty of differentiating the target strain from                   indigenous or other background microflora.  Genetic markers are                 currently used to provide such differentiation, but marking may cause           other genetic changes which alter the strain's behavior in natural              environments.  Immunological techniques such as those to be studied             in this collaboration offer a promising alternative for marking                 strains without causing genetic alterations.",
