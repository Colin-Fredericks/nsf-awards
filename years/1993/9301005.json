 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to research the earthquake-                    caused hazardous materials incidents that Japan has experienced,                the root cause of those problems, and the solutions developed as                a result.  The data obtained will be analyzed and compared to                   information that is available on U.S. earthquakes, especially the               Loma Prieta Earthquake.  Japanese codes and regulations that are                specifically aimed at reducing earthquake-caused hazardous                      materials incidents will be identified.  Organizations and                      regulatory bodies that are responsible for overseeing                           implementation of hazard reduction measures will be identified,                 and their specific role examined.  The detailed information that                is available in Japan, combined with the information on the                     technical solutions developed in Japan, will be of value to U.S.                researchers and safety professionals interested in hazardous                    materials issues.  Based on the analysis, recommendations for                   hazard reduction efforts and future research will be formulated.                An annotated bibliography and a computerized data base of                       Japanese earthquake-caused hazardous materials incidents, a                     compilation of solutions developed, and a final report will be                  published.",
