 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on the structure and reactivity of soot (black                    carbon) continues.  Although topics related to the role of the                  solid phase and studies of carbonaceous atmospheric particulate are             receiving attention, the emphasis of the work continues to be on                heterogeneous photochemical reactions involving soot and reaction               schemes in more complex systems.                                                     The photochemical behavior of reaction systems involving soot              being studied under conditions of simulated solar radiation                     include:                                                                             (i) soot/sulfur dioxide/oxygen/water vapor                                          The role of the surface, through selected surface reaction                      and incorporation of trace metal constituents, is included                      in this study.                                                              (ii) soot/oxides of nitrogen                                                    (iii) soot/ozone                                                                The kinetics and mechanisms of the latter two reaction                     systems, previously determined in this laboratory, provide a solid              basis for this group of studies.  Several surface-sensitive                     vibrational and ultraviolet spectroscopies are employed as                      analytical tools in this work.                                                       Reactions of soot are being studied in more complex systems                than previously.  Specific focus currently is on the effect of                  certain reactions on the subsequent catalytic activity and                      reactivity of soot, and the determination of kinetics and                       mechanisms of soot reactions in multireactant systems.                          Investigations of both the photochemical reactions and                          multireactant system are being carried out at low concentration                 levels in a specially-designed, optical path, reaction cell                     interfaced simultaneously with an a fourier transform - infrared                spectrometer and Cahn electrobalance.",
