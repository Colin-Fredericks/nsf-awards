 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  an  award under the Research Planning  Grant                    program  for women scientists and engineers.  The researcher                    will  study  the  relationship  between  labor  unrest   and                    industrial  restructuring  in the automobile,  textile,  and                    mining industries in the twentieth century.  She will extend                    her  previous  work  on this topic to  a  broader  range  of                    industries, construct a world-wide data base, and  formulate                    additional  hypotheses  as  preparation  for  a  subsequent,                    larger  project  that  will attempt to  test  a  variety  of                    hypotheses  about the forces behind industrial restructuring                    and relocation.                                                                       This  award  will initiate research which should  shed                    important   light  on  the  forces  that  are   transforming                    manufacturing and employment in the modern world.   As  such                    this project has potential policy importance in that it  may                    help us understand under what conditions companies do or  do                    not  decide to relocate or restructure.  In addition to  the                    scientific  gains  and social importance of  this  research,                    this  award  will  materially assist a young  researcher  to                    prepare  for a larger project, thereby contributing  to  the                    strengthening  of the national base of women scientists  and                    engineers.",
