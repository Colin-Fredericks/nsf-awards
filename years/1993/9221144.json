 "awd_abstract_narration": "9221144  DasSarma       Gas vesicles are buoyant intracellular organelles found in  many aquatic bacteria including halobacteria, cyanobacteria, and  methanogens.  The vesicles are filled with ambient gas and  surrounded by a membrane composed only of protein (no lipids).  Gas  vesicles come in a variety of shapes but generally contain a  cylindrical mid-section with conical ends.  Although their exact  function is controversial, their buoyancy induces cells to float  and thereby increases the availability of light for photosynthesis  and oxygen for respiration.  Biosynthesis of gas vesicles proceeds  bidirectionally starting from the apicies of the cones with  incorporation of additional subunits in the central region.  The  vesicle membrane is impermeable to water and accumulation of gases  in the vesicle interior is thought to occur only as a result of  passive diffusion of dissolved gases in the medium.  Our analysis  of high-frequency gas vesicle-deficient mutants of the halophilic  archaebacterium, Halobacterium halobium, resulted in the  identification of a cluster of thirteen genes, gvpMLKJIHGREDACN,  involved in gas vesicle synthesis.  We are studying the function of  these genes in gas vesicle synthesis using a combinaton of  molecular genetic methodology that we have recently developed for  H. halobium and immunocytochemical localization techniques.  We  will utilize an E. coli-H.halobium shuttle plasmid containing the  gvp gene cluster and specifying gas vesicle synthesis in H.  halobium for genetic analysis by linker scanning and cassette  insertion mutagenesis.  The effects of mutations on gas vesicle  synthesis will be analyzed by electron microscopy of vesicles and  vesicle fragments.  Antibody probes will be used for localization  of gvp products by Western blotting analysis and electron  microscopic analysis after immunogold staining vesicles, vesicle  fragments and ultrathin frozen sections of cells.  These studies  should provide definitive information on the function of gvp  gene  products and a detailed picture of gas vesicle structure and  synthesis.  %%%  These studies should lay the groundwork for genetically engineering  bacteria to float, a process with significant potential for  applications in biotechnology.  ***",
