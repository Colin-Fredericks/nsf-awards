 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop a deeper understanding                of technical change by examining the patterns in the location of                invention in the U.S. manufacturing sector between 1870 and 1929,               a period of integration of national product markets as well as of               radical changes in technology and in industrial structure.  The                 issue of the location of invention will be explored in two                      different senses of the term.  First, the basic quantitative                    record of the geographic distribution of patenting over the                     period, as well as a better understanding of the basis for, and                 prevalence of, the phenomenon of geographic clustering in                       inventive activity will be established.  Although there has been                much interest by scholars and policy makers in the importance of                local externalities in invention, and many anecdotal references                 to cases such as Silicon Valley, there has to date been only                    limited systematic empirical investigation of the subject.                      Second, the study will analyze the extent to which inventive                    activity was located within the firms that actually used the                    technology.  It is conventional to think of invention as an                     activity that occurs within the boundaries of the firms, but at                 various times firms have bought or licensed much of their                       technology from outside suppliers.  This research is important                  because it will shed new light on the processes of innovation and               the diffusion of new technology.",
