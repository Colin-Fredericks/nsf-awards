A basic question in number theory is to determine  the p-adic values of the zeros and poles of zeta functions over  finite fields.  Professor Wan proposes to give a systematic  investigation of this question for families of zeta functions and  L-functions.  One method is to use Dwork's p-adic theory.  A new  key ingredient is the introduction of some maximizing functions  from linear programming.  Professor Wan expects to resolve the  Adolphson-Sperber conjecture about the generic Newton polygon of L-  functions of exponential sums and prove a strong version of the  Dwork-Mazur conjecture about the generic Newton polygon of zeta  functions of hypersurfaces.        This is research in the field of number theory.   Number  theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the  oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,  it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for  computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.   ***",
