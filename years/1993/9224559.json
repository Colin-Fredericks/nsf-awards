The objective of this research is to develop a distributed  knowledge-based multimedia database system for biomedical  applications with cooperative query answering capabilities.  The  system will be able to access data in image databases by content  (features, objects, etc.).  In particular, the proposed data model  captures spatial and evolutionary semantics and thus greatly  enhances high-level query capabilities.  The image objects and  their features are obtained from segmentation software and are  stored in the database.  Using rules derived from domain knowledge,  approximate and conceptual queries may be answered.  Additional  information relevant to a query cay be provided by associating  different hierarchies of subjects.  Type abstraction hierarchies  (TAHs) generalize a query's scope while the relaxation control,  based on user profiles and query context, trims the TAHs and keeps  the generalizations manageable and appropriate.  An explanation  system tracks the relaxation path and provides a measure of the  nearness of the approximate answer to the exact one.  These  concepts are validated in a testbed linked with radiology image  databases.  The joint research between the UCLA Computer Science  Department and the School of Medicine assures that the prototype  systems are of direct interest to radiology research and practice.   The results of this research are extensible to other multimedia  database applications.   ***",
