 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czechoslovakia Joint Fund Research on \"Energetic                      Particles Inside and Outside the Magnetosphere\" is between Dr.                  Karel Kudela of the Institute of Experimental Physics, Slovak                   Academy of Sciences, and Drs. David Sibeck and A.T.Y. Lui of                    the Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University.  The                  Czechoslovak Institute of Experimental Physics \u0131IEP! will prepare               measurements of energetic particles in space on the high apogee                 satellites of the Prognoz type in the frame of international space              physics projects.  IEP has measurements from Prognoz-8 and 10                   satellites and it is preparing the devices and the program of                   measurements for the satellites Interball and Relict-2.  The Johns              Hopkins University participants, very experienced in the study of               the magnetosphere, will provide the energetic particle data from the            existing satellites IMP, CCE, IRM and the GEOTAIL project now                   in preparation.  The researchers will (1) compare IMP-8 and CCE                 particle data with those of Prognoz-10 (for 1992 and partly 1993);              and (2) compare measurements of energetic particles in GEOTAIL                  and on Interball (1993 and 1994).  The results should contribute to             understanding dynamic processes in the magnetosphere of the Earth               and beyond.                                                                                                                                                     This research in experimental physics fulfills the program objective            of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the United                  States and Czechoslovakia to combine complementary talents and                  pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                  competence.",
