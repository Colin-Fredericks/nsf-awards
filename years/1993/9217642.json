 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are provided to upgrade the image processing facility used in             the 0.9m Spacewatch Telescope of the University of Arizona at Kitt              Peak.  Currently, a Solbourne computer is used to analyze images of             the sky collected in drift-scan mode by a TK2048 charge-coupled                 device (CCD) mounted at one of the Newtonian ports of the                       telescope.  The system processes the images in near real-time, i.e.             at the rate with which the images are collected.  Since September               1990, earth-approachers have been found at a rate of approximately              1.5 per month, including the first observations of asteroids in the             5 to 10 m size range.  It has been found that asteroids smaller                 than 10 m are more numerous by two orders of magnitude than is                  expected by extrapolation from the frequency of larger asteroids.               These enhancements to the existing computer system will double the              discovery rate.  Results could yield information on the origin of               asteroids near the Earth.  Observations made possible by this                   upgrade will be a key to establishing the dynamical origin of the               smallest asteroids (meteorites) and their physical relation to                  comets and asteroids.",
