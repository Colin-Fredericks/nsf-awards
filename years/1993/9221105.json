 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to augment the Infrared Spatial Interferometer which             has been built and is operating on Mount Wilson  so that it can do              interferometry on spectral lines.  Since the system uses heterodyne             detection, it can provide very sensitive detection at narrow                    bandwidths and hence can be conveniently adapted to spectral work.              Prominent molecular spectral lines of gases recently emitted by                 stars and in their surrounding dust shells have already been                    studied by heterodyne detection in the 10 micron region.  It is                 proposed here to enhance the ISI so that it can carry out spatial               interferometry at high angular resolutions on these and other                   spectral lines as well as on continuum radiation, with which it now             works.  The work involves installation of two sets of carefully                 matched IF filters for the two telescopes, IF switching, and IF                 chopping between filters.  It will also involve field work in                   testing the system and its use, so that techniques can be checked               and perfected, and initial results of high quality obtained.  This              work can open up a new aspect of spatial interferometry and provide             new, highly specific information on molecular formation and                     excitation, as well as distribution of gas densities, temperatures,             and accelerations.",
