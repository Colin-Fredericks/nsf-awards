 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wake Technical Community College of Raleigh, North Carolina, is                 establishing a curriculum to provide education and training to                  area adults and non-traditional students (minority adults,                      women in transition and re-entry, and employed or unemployed                    adults seeking retraining) who wish to learn the techniques and                 applications of scientific visualization computer graphics.                     This program, designed by the originator and several of the                     teachers of the highly successful Parkland College of Illinois                  program, blends mathematics, physical and computer sciences                     with art and humanities in a unique and powerful new way. It is                 necessary to revise and upgrade the first program's structure                   and curriculum to take into account the greater and more                        diverse local employment needs of the four area universities                    (UNC, NC State, Duke, and NC Central) and the major high                        technology firms in the Research Triangle Park area counties.                   A recent feasibility study in this tri-county area found over                   225 potential positions that employers would create if                          graduates of such a associate degree program were available to                  hire. By all accounts, this is a conservative estimate of the                   growing demand in this field. In designing the new curriculum,                  consideration is being given to area demographics, the                          availability of local and non-local expertise, recent updates                   in available graphic software and hardware technology, and the                  fact that no formal undergraduate training now exists in North                  Carolina for scientific computer visualization graphics. This                   is a new field where, in most states, the demand for trained                    people far exceeds the number of qualified candidates. Thus,                    Wake Tech's curriculum development will focus or creating an                    effective educational model for establishing similar degree                     programs in other states by fostering col laborative efforts                    among local academic, industrial, and private sector resources.                 Funding for this proposal will assist in the establishment of                   a state-of-the-art computer visualization laboratory crucial to                 the success of this program.",
