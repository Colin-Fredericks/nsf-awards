 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tree-indexed processes are a way of studying classical                     tree-related probability models in a unified and more powerful                  way.  Examples of such models are: branching random walk,                       branching Markov chains, first passage percolation on a tree,                   parallel searches, random and non-random Cantor sets and                        hyperbolic manifolds.  Current work on tree-indexed processes is                focused on extending some results on Hausdorff dimensions of                    random sets and on determining exact capacity criteria for                      subsets of the range space to be polar for a given tree-indexed                 process.                                                                             Probability models with branching or tree structure arise in               many areas of science.  Much of the classical work on branching                 processes was motivated by random family trees that arise in                    population genetics; the theory of cascades encompasses atomic                  chain reactions and rainfall models; more recently, random trees                have been used to study self-similarity (fractal behavior) in                   spatial models.  By abstracting the common structure of these                   models into \"tree-indexed processes\", we have been able to prove                many new results about this class of models, as well as                         strengthening previously known results.",
