 "awd_abstract_narration": "The retina of the eye contains may classes of nerve cells besides               just the photoreceptors.  These cells participate in networks that              utilize a variety of neurotransmitter compounds for communication               and modulation of the cellular responses.  An important transmitter             is dopamine, and goldfish provide a retina where one class of cells             produces dopamine.   Other important neuroactive compounds are the              peptides, which often in other networks are modulators of neural                activity.  This project uses biochemistry, pharmacology, and                    microscopic anatomy on the goldfish retina as a model to examine                the circuits formed by the cells utilizing these compounds.  The                goldfish retina has provided extensive data on the presence of                  these compounds, but their functions are largely unknown; this                  study will clarify their functional role in transmission and                    modulation of signals in the visual pathway.   Because of the                   widespread occurrence of these compounds elsewhere in the brain,                this work on the goldfish retina not only provides a useful model               system for increasing our understanding of visual processing, but               also will have impact on neuroscience in general.",
