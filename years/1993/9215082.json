Both the supermolecule                 method and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory are being                       employed.  A wide variety of types of systems are being                         studied, including nonpolar systems, polar systems, and mixed                   polar-nonpolar systems (such as rare gas - water aggregates).                   Analytic potentials are being obtained which explicitly include                 multibody effects and which are thus suitable for simulations                   of the behavior of both condensed phases and clusters.                          %%%                                                                             The energies of very large molecules and solids are often                       assumed to be approximated well by the sum of the energies of                   the smaller molecules, or even the atoms, making up the system.                 In this project theoretical methods are being used to assess                    the accuracy of such assumptions and to develop more accurate                   energies of large systems.",
