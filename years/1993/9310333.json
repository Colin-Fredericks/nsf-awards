 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a request for support for seven students and postdocs to                attend the Bat Sheva Seminar on \"Neurons and Neuronal Networks in               the Motor System\" at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, from                 March 14-15, 1993.  The motor system controls the position of                   organisms and their movement in the external world by a complex                 assembly of neuronal networks.  Intricate motor paradigms of                    movements and postural adjustments constitute almost all the                    behavioral patterns expressed in our daily life.  Understanding of              the motor system and its neural control mechanisms are therefore                one of the most important aspects of modern neurobiology.  This                 seminar is aimed at studying the motor system using an                          interdisciplinary research approach, starting from structural and               functional aspects of single cells in the motor system, continuing              with central neuronal networks, and ending with combined                        physiological and artificial intelligence studies.  This approach               will provide us better understanding of mechanisms involved in the              execution of motor behavior.  This seminar is an outstanding                    opportunity to facilitate advances in interdisciplinary training in             basic neuroscience and motor control, and to bring together                     students and top-scientists from all over the world for a period of             two weeks.  Previous experience with Bat-Sheva seminars shows that              it was very fruitful with good interactions among the participants              and students, and this coming seminar seems to be more popular than             the previous ones.***//",
