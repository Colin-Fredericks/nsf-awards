 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal intends to study the recently found important                role of hole trapping in perovskite structure titanates.    As a                result of hole trapping and its consequences, insulating material               may be obtained after equilibrium at lower partial oxygen pressure              than previously considered possible.    This proposed program will              focaus on undoped and acceptor-doped BaTiO3  and SrTiO3, and will               conduct experiments to further the understanding of the equilibrium             defect chemistry of the perovskite titanates and its rel;ationship              to properties of technological interest.  Second part of the                    proposed program will be focussed on the defect chemistry and                   charge transport of perovskite-related oxides, specifically of the              brownmillerite A2B2O5 structure and based on indium, gallium, and               related elements.                                                               %%%                                                                                  This proposed study pursues the recently found important role              of hole trapping in perovskite related oxides.  It has significant              implications with respect to the multilayer ceramic capacitor                   market.  This study aims to pursue the investigation into to the                defect chemistry and its relationship to properties of                          technological interest.  Second part of this study will investigate             the origin of the high levels of ionic conductivity in oxygen-                  deficient variants of the perovskite structure such as the                      brownmillerite structure of A2B2O5.  This study will have important             contributions to the understanding of materials used in devices of              technological importance.",
