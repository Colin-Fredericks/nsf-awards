 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering                     (NISEE) was established to facilitate the collection,                           organization, and dissemination of information related to                       earthquake engineering to various user groups including                         researchers, practicing engineers, educators, public officials,                 and the general public.  There are presently two branches of                    NISEE; one located at Caltech and one located at U.C. Berkeley.                 In addition to its national role, the Caltech Branch is a                       resource for the large and active community of earthquake                       engineering and seismic safety related specialists in the                       Southern California region.  The Branch has undertaken an                       initiative in the area of strong-motion studies.  A special                     Strong-Motion Center has been established to meet the growing                   needs of individuals involved in strong-motion data acquisition                 and analysis and those in such fields as risk assessment, seismic               hazard determination, structural performance analysis, and code                 development.  The Caltech Branch also has a library collection                  and resources that are useful to those in the areas of public                   policy and earthquake preparedness.",
