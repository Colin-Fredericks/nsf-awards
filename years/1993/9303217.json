 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research area of this project is set theory, in                        particular, large cardinals and forcing.  Set theory contains                   classical mathematics in the sense that every theorem of                        classical mathematics can be formulated as a statement about                    sets, and then formally derived from the standard collection ZFC                of axioms for set theory.  Beginning with the work of Godel                     (1936) and Cohen (1963), set theorists have shown that some                     problems on which mathematicians have worked are independent,                   i.e. neither provable nor disprovable from ZFC.  Some of these                  independent statements are nevertheless known to be provable when               ZFC is augmented by axioms asserting the existence of large                     infinite cardinal numbers.  The instant project has three parts:                first, to continue the study of a class of very large cardinals;                second, to continue the study of the relation of these cardinals                to problems in groups and finite combinatorics; and third, to                   study some unrelated open questions in forcing and infinite                     combinatorics.                                                                        The main subject of this project is connected both to set                 theory and to algebra and topology.  On the algebra/topology                    side, one of the topics to be studied is the classical braid                    groups, which arise in many contexts, including statistical                     mechanics (see for instance Kauffman, New invariants in the                     theory of knots, AMS Monthly, March 1988, 195-241).  The                        connection of this area with the algebras studied in this project               has led to new results about the braid groups.  Moreover, results               on the set theory side of the project have opened the question                  whether some properties of knots and braids will require the                    large cardinal tools of set theory for their solution.",
