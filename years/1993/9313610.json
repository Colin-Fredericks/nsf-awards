This  exploratory proposal is directed at fabricating tips for the BEEM  to perform spectroscopy on quantum semiconductor heterostructures  and superlattices. Properly prepared, heavily doped, semiconductor  tips should cause a sharply focused and monoenergetic beam of  electrons or holes to be injected into the sample under study. The  ability to perform variable temperature UHV studies using BEEM  spectroscopy could lead to the observation of quantum mechanical  tunneling and interface reflection effects, local determination of  dopant density, minority carrier mean free paths, and single  particle charging effects (Coulomb blockade regime) with possibly  the first studies of discrete light emission from the dimensionally  confined pn junction. Development of this technique will be  particularly important for the spectroscopic study of dimensionally  small systems such as nano-scale wires, quantum dots, resonant  tunneling devices and narrow bandgap infrared detectors.   %%%  A unique variable temperature, ultra high vacuum (UHV) compatible  Ballistic Electron Emission Microscope (BEEM) apparatus is  currently under development in the PI's laboratory.  This  exploratory proposal is directed at fabricating probes for the BEEM  to perform spectroscopy on complex semiconductor structures.  Properly prepared, heavily doped, semiconductor probes should cause  a sharply focused and monoenergetic beam of electrons or holes to  be injected into the sample under study. The ability to perform  variable temperature UHV studies using BEEM spectroscopy would  provide valuable physical measurements and could lead to a better  understanding of the electronic states in so-called quantum dots  and semiconductor heterostructures and superlattices. It is clear  that such studies become increasingly important as  characteristic  dimensions of semiconductor devices approach the nano-meter scale  regime.  ***",
