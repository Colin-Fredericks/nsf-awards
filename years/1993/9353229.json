The objective of the                      conference is to encourage undergraduate science students to enter              graduate school in order to obtain the Ph.D. degree necessary for               careers in research and science education.  The Symposia will                   describe the exciting opportunities in Math, Engineering and                    Biology and provide strong role models for these fields.  The                   conference will contain workshops, panel discussions and organized              small group discussions designed to provide students with career                counseling as well as information on research opportunities.                    Undergraduate students will have ample opportunity to interact with             faculty of their own ethnic and racial background; in addition,                 there will be one graduate student mentor for every four                        undergraduate students.  The conference will have a \"Community                  Science Lecture\", a science presentation that is aimed not only at              all the conference participants, but also at the local scientific               and lay community.  An outreach effort to local high school                     teachers and students is planned as part of the conference on                   Friday January 15.  The exhibitors associated with the conferences              will be graduate schools of science, and federal agencies and                   corporations that offer research careers.  The many aspects of the              conference are evaluated for effectiveness leading to continual                 improvements that are partially responsible for the phenomenal                  increase in attendance that these Conferences have had in the last              three years.  A summary of the conference proceedings are published             and widely disseminated through the SACNAS Newsletter and other                 national publications.",
