 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of molecular biology techniques - including                     the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - has increased                             dramatically the rate at which new proteins are identified,                     characterized, sequenced, and expressed in milligram                            amounts.  However, further progress in many of the systems                      created by these new technologies is being hampered by the                      lack of  3-D structural information.  Multidimensional NMR                      methods have helped to release this bottleneck, but for many                    systems, especially those involving proteins of 18KD or                         larger, x-ray diffraction analysis is still the best                            technique available for atomic structure determination.  Our                    Department is in the process of expanding and the addition                      of new faculty is placing excessive demand on our x-ray data                    collection equipment.  We must therefor expand our data                         collection capabilities in order to provide adequate access                     to all members of our department.  In this application we                       propose to purchase a new data collection system consisting                     of a rotating anode, an image plate system and a cooling                        device.  This system, in addition to effectively doubling                       our present data collection throughput, will allow us to                        collect better high resolution data and to improve the                          accuracy of anomalous dispersion measurements.",
