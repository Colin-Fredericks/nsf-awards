The exact mechanism by  which there is a conversion of sound into light (first observed in  air bubbles in water) is not understood, although there is some  evidence that the compressional heating of the gas is enough to  yield appreciable black-body radiation. However, it is not clear  whether there are also chemical or atomic processes occurring in  the hot gas or plasma which may control the emission. The work in  this proposal is composed of three main thrusts: The study of the  oscillation properties of a single bubble trapped at the center of  a spherical continuous wave acoustic resonator. The investigation  of the intensity of the light emitted by the bubbles as a function  of the applied acoustic fields. The measurement of the spectrum of  the emitted light in the visible to ultra-violet wavelength range.   The SSL research will be undertaken in cryogenic liquids as these  fluids have several advantages over water. They have high chemical  purity and the spectroscopic studies can be carried out over a  wider wavelength range.  %%%  This exploratory proposal is to study the properties of synchronous  sonoluminescence (SSL) in fluids in order to gain some fundamental  insights into the nature of the phenomenon.
