 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding of the evolution of alpine topography in                     many mountain chains represents an unresolved problem.  A                       region like the northwestern Himalaya provides a                                particularly intriguing site for the study of evolving                          topography, because it is characterized by rapid Quaternary                     denudation, differential uplift, rivers showing some of the                     highest gradients and largest sediments loads in the world,                     a breadth of climatic regimes, active tectonicsm, and                           extreme topographic relief.  In the absence of knowledge of                     rates of denudation, bedrock uplift, and surface uplift,                        reconstructions or models of topographic development are                        forced to rely on untested assumptions concerning the                           absolute magnitude and relative importance of each of these                     factors.  In the northwestern Himalaya and Karakoram, it                        appears possible however, to combine digital elevation data                     sets with chronologic and geomorphic data on timing and                         magnitude of incision, erosion, and uplift in order to                          provide a calibrated perspective on topographic evolution of                    this dynamic region.  The goals of this study are to define                     the timing and rates of incision and bedrock cooling in this                    part of the Himalayan orogen; to make volumetric                                approximations of regional denudation, reconstruct base-                        level changes along this part of the Indus River; and to                        reconstruct the interactions among tectonically generated                       localized uplift, regional uplift (tectonic or isostatic),                      and erosion and denudation.  The approaches that will be                        used include:  exposure-age dating of strath surfaces using                     cosmogenic nuclides; development of cooling ages histories                      using multi-mineral dating of vertical relief sections;                         reconstruction of river profiles based on temporal and                          geometric constraints; and analysis of slopes, altitudinal                      distributions, gradients, and volumes based on digital                          elevation data set for the NW Himalaya.",
