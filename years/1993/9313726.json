 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313726  Chandrasekhar    This is an experimental research program focused on low temperature  electron transport in nanofabricated systems in which strong  electrostatic interactions between electrons lead to Coulomb  blockade and single electron charging phenomena.  The experiments  are designed to increase fundamental understanding of the  microscopic mechanism of electron transport in this regime, with  emphasis on modifications introduced by quantum effects.  The  structures consist of short insulating wires placed between  metallic contact electrodes.  The goal is to understand the origin  of the single electron charging effects that have been observed in  this novel system.  With an eye to potential device applications,  different methods of increasing the temperature range over which  the Coulomb blockade effects can be observed will be investigated  by exploiting some unique properties of insulators.  The project  involves graduate students in research that is at the cutting edge  of nanolithographic fabrication techniques.  %%%  This experimental project deals with the motion of individual  electrons among ultrasmall structures that are fabricated by  tracing patterns only a few atoms in width using a finely focused  electron beam.  The resulting structures show remarkable responses  at low temperatures to applied electric and magnetic fields.  The  response arises from quantum effects that are only poorly  understood in the structures under study.  The ability of detection  motion of a single electron has fundamental interest and is  technologically significant as a route to the smallest  microelectronics device currently envisioned.  The project will  employ insulating nanostructures which have potential for allowing  operation of the microdevices at higher temperatures.  ***",
