 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352146  Hirshfeld  The goals of this project are to (i) expand research  opportunities in observational astronomy for undergraduates;  (ii) identify and carry out specific educational research  projects that would be transferable to similar institutions  with small observatories, and (iii) produce written guidelines  and materials that would help faculty at these institutions  initiate their own undergraduate research programs in  astronomy. The primary instruments for the project are a CCD  imaging camera to supplement an existing telescope and  photoelectric photometer plus computers for data acquisition  and image analysis. The camera will be used by undergraduates  to obtain images of planets and extended celestial objects,  such as star clusters, nebulae and galaxies, and to do long-  term aperture photometry of bright eclipsing binary stars,  variable stars, and selected program stars in the Harvard  Center for Astrophysics radial velocity study. The significance  of this project, beyond its local impact on the education of  students, is its potential to improve undergraduate science  training by identifying ways to help faculty at other  institutions set up their own observational astronomy research  programs for students. The university is providing release time  for the principal investigator to carry out the project.  ***",
