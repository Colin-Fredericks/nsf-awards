 "awd_abstract_narration": "Material and structural damping is required in many applications                wherein suppression of unwanted dynamic displacements can be                    critical.  While active control can provide such suppression, the               complexity and cost penalties associated with active systems                    reduce their attractiveness.  Passive material and structural                   damping can provide significant benefits.  The research is aimed                at identifying the potentials of an innovative mechanism for                    inducing passive damping.                                                                                                                                       A classical method for inducing damping in a structural element                 is the use of patches of constrained visco-elastic material                     (VEM).  The VEM dissipates energy as it is dynamically stressed.                In the conventional approach, both the VEM and the structure                    added to induce stresses therein are parasitic additions.  The                  innovation addressed is in the method for inducing stress within                the constrained VEM while retaining high structural efficiency.                 By tailoring the elastic properties of composite structural                     materials, stress can be induced within the VEM to enhance system               damping while maintaining required stiffness properties.  The                   innovation also allows for multiple VEM layers within a                         structural element allowing for damping over extended frequency                 and temperature ranges.  The initial phase of the research will                 address materials for use in truss type structures, but the                     innovation can be applied to a range of structural elements                     creating opportunities for competitive advances in noise and                    vibration control; e.g., for machinery, transportation vehicles,                civil structures, etc.",
