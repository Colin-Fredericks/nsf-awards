 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transposable element, Mu, found in maize is unique in several               ways.  The element was first cloned by this laboratory, but                     subsequent studies by several laboratories demonstrated that all of             the cloned elements identified as Mu were imperfect in that they                could not in themselves induce transposition.  The \"master\" element             was finally cloned and characterized by this laboratory, as well as             two other laboratories in 1991, and the proposed work is a                      continuation of those studies.  The element encodes two messages                when in an active chromosomal position.  Differences in chromosomal             position and mode of sexual transmission can effect the rate of                 MuR1 transposition.  We have also shown that the element can and                will automutate, and we will use these automutants along with other             more conventionally derived mutants to describe the mechanism of                transposition and functions of the two transcripts and their                    proteins.  A long term goal will be to attempt to utilize this                  element to transposon tag cereal crops that are so important to                 world nutrition.                                                                %%%                                                                             Transposons, or \"jumping genes\" have proven to be of intellectual               interest in understanding fundamental genetic mechanisms and of                 practical importance, in that they can be engineered as gene                    vectors.  Both  of those interests are best served in the complete              characterization and understanding of the characteristics of such               DNA sequences.  Mu is extremely important to characterize in that               it has already been found to have properties which are unique among             the hundreds of transposable elements so far characterized.  The                detection of the fragments of the element in barley offers the                  long-range hope that genetic engineering might provide an extremely             important tool for improving cereal crops throughout the world.",
