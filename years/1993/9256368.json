 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent economic and social changes have accentuated the role of                 education in determining earnings, family structure, health                     status and other outcomes.  There is also growing concern that                  the US workforce is lagging behind other countries in both the                  quantity and quality of education.  In response to these                        challenges, state, local, and Federal authorities have                          implemented a variety of education reforms, including school                    choice programs, magnet schools, bilingual education, and teacher               certification.  This proliferation of programs offers a unique                  opportunity to study what works and to influence the course of                  education policy.                                                                                                                                               To exploit this opportunity and guide policy-makers in the design               of future reforms, the nation requires a highly-trained force of                Ph.D. professionals with knowledge of education-related issues                  and expertise in program evaluation.  This grant adds a total of                5 Graduate Traineeships to the Princeton graduate economics                     program, concentrating in the economics of education, training,                 and human resource development.  The trainees will enter the                    existing Ph.D. program and receive rigorous training in                         microeconomic theory, econometrics, and labor economics.  In                    addition, through a series of new and existing programs, the                    trainees will receive intensive training and hands-on experience                in primary data collection, econometric modelling, and program                  evaluation.  The trainees will be uniquely qualified to evaluate                the education programs of the past decade and address the                       education issues of the next century.",
