 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this grant is to explore midlatitude seasonal             cycle and subseasonal interactions, especially during spring and                fall.  Hypothesis:  seasonal transitions are analogous to                       laboratory flow regime transitions, i.e., they involve                          instabilities and intermittencies, and the exhibit hysteresis.                                                                                                  The methodology involves using EOF and harmonic analysis The PI                 will compare the seasonal cycle in ECMWF global analyses for the                1980's with decade-long simulations computed by NCAR Community                  Climate Model version 2 (CCM2) and by a quasigeostrophic model. One             CCM2 simulation will be forced by interannually varying sea surface             temperatures.  The PI will track the time-varying position of the               midlatitude jet during spring and fall to document seasonal                     transition time scales, intermittencies, and winter to summer                   versus summer to winter hysteresis.                                                                                                                             The expected significance of this research is validation of the                 seasonal cycle in the CCM2.  If the CCM2 does not realistically                 model the \"climate change\" that occurs during the seasonal cycle,               its reliability in simulating climate change in other contexts will             be open to question.  Also it is expected that we will gain                     increased understanding of seasonal transition processes.",
