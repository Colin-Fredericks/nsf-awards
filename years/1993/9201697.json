 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to promote the integration and                reuse of engineering software components and systems by developing              pertinent approaches, notations, and tools.  Such capabilities are              needed to remain competitive in the engineering and construction                marketplace with the growing need for multi-disciplinary analyses               and simulations, design-for- construction and -manufacturing, and               the integration of analysis, design, and decision-support tools.                To enable integration and reuse, software components must be                    characterized by their functional properties, i.e., a description               of the services they provide.  Otherwise, one can only examine the              program text itself, attempt to characterize its behavior, and try              putting the pieces together.  Even object-oriented languages are                inadequate for promoting integration since they cannot be used to               state what a component does, only how it is implemented.                        Declarative descriptions of functional properties offer the                     potential to characterize the interaction of complex software                   components and systems, thus enabling software integration and                  reuse.  This study will develop formal notations for specifying                 engineering software components, and apply them by developing a                 handbook of reusable specifications.  By using formal methods, the              resulting specifications are independent of a particular                        programming language and may be manipulated and combined using                  ordinary mathematics.",
