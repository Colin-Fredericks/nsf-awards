 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of the thermomechanical behavior of fiber                 reinforced composite parts will be conducted.  The objective of the             project is to continue research in modeling, analysis and process               simulation of the thermomechanical behavior of fiber reinforced                 thermoset parts.  Such a study will increase the understanding of               the phenomena and the physics behind shrinkage, warpage and surface             waviness of reinforced plastic parts.  The project will be divided              into two portions:  and experimental and a computer modeling                    portion.  The experimental aspect of the research deals with                    thermomechanical material properties characterization.  Here, the               effect that degree of cure has on the elastic constants and on                  shrinkage during solidification will be studied.  In the second                 portion of the project the shrinkage due to cure will be introduced             and a constitutive model for the material tensor will be developed              and implemented into existing finite element computer simulations               of the thermomechanical processes that take place during molding                of thin and thick fiber reinforced thermoset parts.  The simulation             considers parts of complex geometry molded under realistic                      industrial processing conditions.                                                    Understanding the thermomechanical behavior of plastics and                being able to predict filling patterns, fiber orientation,                      temperature fields during cure, residual stresses, voids and                    cracks, shrinkage, warpage and surface waviness before a part is                actually manufactured leads to higher part quality and eliminates               some of the expensive and time consuming tasks done in the early                stages of part and mold design.",
