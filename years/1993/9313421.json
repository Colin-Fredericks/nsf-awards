Applied research projects in the areas of  transportation, aeronautics, computer workstation design,  and other engineering disciplines are constrained by their  current facilities.  Research and research training are  housed in a metal airplane hangar built in 1946, an annex  that has been renovated in stages, and a variety of small  temporary buildings in the immediate area.  The University  plans to complete the renovation of the annex and  consolidate all other activities in a single new facility  next to the annex, replacing the hangar and temporary  buildings.  The annex renovations include asbestos  abatement, building modifications that will provide access  for persons with disabilities, modernize the heating,  ventilating, and cooling systems, and other small  improvements.  The construction of a building to replace the  hangar and out-buildings will consolidate the research and  research training activities in one site, and will provide  an adaptable environment for a diverse array of engineering  projects.       The modernization of engineering research facilities at  California Polytechnic State University will have a  significant impact by 1) creating suitable environments for  research instrumentation, 2) bringing together a critical  mass of engineering faculty and students, 3) enabling a wide  range of research projects, 4) providing an outstanding  atmosphere for research training, and 5) attracting  undergraduate students to careers in science and  engineering.  ***",
