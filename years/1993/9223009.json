 "awd_abstract_narration": "A 3D digital audio signal processing system, a 3D tracking                 system, adapters for wireless network technologies capable of                   position location (radio, infrared), six notepad computers, one                 workstation, and bus expansion boxes to connect peripherals to                  the requested workstation and existing computers shall be                       obtained in this project.  This equipment will be dedicated to                  support research in the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces                   Laboratory and the Mobile Computing Laboratory, both within the                 Department of Computer Science at Columbia University. The                      equipment will be used for several research projects, including                 in particular: development of \"hybrid user interfaces'' that                    merge 2D and 3D displays and interaction devices; design of                     \"augmented realities'' in which the surrounding physical world is               annotated with knowledge-based 3D graphics; development of                      virtual worlds for multivariate data visualization; invention of                methods for ``bandwidth aggregation'' achieved by combining                     distinct wireless network channels into a single high-speed                     channel; and development of means by which application programs                 can sense their location and ``localize,'' customizing themselves               to their physical surroundings.",
