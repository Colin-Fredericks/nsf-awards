 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to study a number of topics in                    controlled topology and differential geometry.  The most pressing               of these concern the nonresolvable homology manifolds discovered                by the investigator, J. Bryant, W. Mio, and S. Weinberger.                      Simply put, he wishes to study these spaces and see to what                     extent the classical theory of manifolds carries over to this new               category of spaces.  This study is closely related to the                       well-known Borel and Bing-Borsuk Conjectures.  Other problems                   involved include applications of controlled Gamma-surgery to the                study of topological embeddings in codimension two, the Borel and               integral Novikov Conjectures for certain classes of groups, and                 applications of controlled topology to differential geometry.                        There are a number of potential applications for this work.                The new spaces being studied have the global properties of                      manifolds modelled on euclidean space, but have very different                  small-scale properties.  Such spaces could be of interest to                    workers trying to reconcile large-scale and small-scale models of               the universe.  The Borel and Novikov Conjectures are conjectures                involving the rigidity of certain classes of manifolds.  Typical                results say that manifolds which are \"close together\" in some                   topological sense are the same.  This appears to be a naturally                 occurring instance of quantization in geometry and topology.",
