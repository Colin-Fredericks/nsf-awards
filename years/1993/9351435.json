The laboratory centered  approach to teaching chemistry and physics is intended to  attract students who have avoided traditional science  instruction and to retain students who would otherwise be  turned off by such instruction by making learning  individualized, interactive, participatory, exploratory and  visual.  This approach has been tested and proven to improve  the learning, retention, and application of physics and  chemistry principles by promoting conceptual understanding and  relating the laboratory experience to the real world.  At each  workstation the student determines strategies for solving a  problem, chooses the initial conditions and predicts the result  of the experiment, and the microcomputer will perform data  collection, analysis, and graphing functions and/or perform  simulations of real experiments through interactive software  and videodisc technology.  Because this approach is more  efficient, students are motivated to learn more by trial and  error probing.  ***",
