Dahl of the Chemistry Department, University of   Wisconsin-Madison.  A major goal is to provide a unified   correlation between molecular geometries and electronic   configuration for various kinds of metal clusters, many of   which gain or lose electrons without rupture of their atomic   frameworks.  Research will be focused in two areas:  1)   isolation, structural determination, and physical-chemical   characterization of high nuclearity platinum, nickel, and   mixed-metal carbonyl clusters; and 2) synthesis,   stereochemical-bonding analysis, and electrochemical reactivity   of small electron-rich metal clusters.  Rational methods for   preparing large clusters and appropriate separation techniques   to isolate and crystallize pure species for characterization   remain to be developed.  In addition to determining the   structure of these complexes, their magnetic properties and   modes of carbon monoxide adsoption will be investigated.  The   reactivity of metal clusters with main group reagents, which   may be able to stabilize the species, will also be studied.    Attempts will be made to isolate metal phosphide and metal   arsenic clusters with novel bonding features.  %%%  Large metal clusters that can be characterized using standard   chemical methods may be useful models for understanding the   behavior of solid metal surfaces or lattice fragments, which   are often used in catalysis.  Of particular interest are    reactivity characteristics and electronic features.  The work   may result in materials that are effective as catalysts or in   the improvement of reaction conditions or surface preparation   of catalytic materials currently in industrial use.  ***",
