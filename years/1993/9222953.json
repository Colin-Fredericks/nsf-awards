 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate                         alternative theories of alliance behavior, and to apply the                     theory of alliances and spillovers to the study of global                       collective action, including treaty formulation and adherence.                  In particular, the noncooperative behavior among nations                        confronted with common pollution problems is analyzed.  Various                 strategic behavioral alternatives and their impact on resource                  allocation are examined.  In addition, institutional arrangements               to elicit cooperation are examined, while accounting for                        transaction costs of a fixed and variable nature.  Alliance                     models will be applied to analyze the determinants of                           participation in the 1987 Montreal Protocol on CFC emission                     reductions.  Further, the degree to which cooperative behavior                  was practiced by the signatories' actions after the agreement                   will also be studied.  This research on cooperative behavior for                mitigating pollution is extremely important and timely given the                heightened concern about attaining better global cooperation for                reducing atmospheric pollution and the possibility for                          catastrophic global warming.",
