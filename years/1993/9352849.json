These calculus problems  are based on applications in science and engineering and offer an  opportunity to use computers as part of the problem-solving  strategy.  These technology-based problems are interdisciplinary in  nature and integrate concepts from calculus, engineering, and  physics.  During the academic year, faculty are locating resources and  developing significant problems, testing them in courses,  summarizing student reactions and solution strategies, and  modifying and extending problems. Student developers are assisting  in evaluating solutions submitted by student solvers, assessing  prerequisite knowledge needed for attempting these problems, and  determining the level of effort and time needed for success.  In the summer, teams of faculty, students, and associate high  school mathematics teachers are developing new problems, polishing  established problems, preparing standard formats for problem  presentation, loading the materials for electronic access through  anonymous \"ftp\" site facilities (Bitnet and Internet) at Rose-  Hulman, producing Mathematica resources to accompany problems, and  writing up guidelines for using problems in high school and college  calculus settings. Suggestions for non-Mathematica users are being  offered in each situation as well as guides on how to use the  materials. About 50 problem sets are being developed. Faculty from  Rose-Hulman are conducting short courses in problem use and  development at local, regional, and national meetings.",
