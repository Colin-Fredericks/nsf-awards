Exposure of blood to                                              an artificial surface usually leads                                             to the activation of the intrinsic                                              pathway of the plasma coagulation                                               cascade and to the activation of                                                platelets which are often                                                       accompanied by the formation of a                                               thrombus or blood clot.  A popular                                              technique for imparting                                                         thromboresistance to biomaterials                                               has involved the endothelialization                                             (\"endothelial seeding\") of                                                      biomaterial surfaces.  Successful                                               endothelialization of biomedical                                                implants may improve                                                            biocompatibility and aid in reducing                                            antigenicity and thromboginicity of                                             vascular grafts.                                                                                                                                                The techniques of producing                                                     precultured endothelialized surfaces                                            and seeding material with blood                                                 containing endothelial cells may                                                require a specialized biomaterial                                               surface to support cell adhesion.                                               This research will use plasma                                                   surface modification technology to                                              incorporate hydroxyl functional                                                 groups onto the polymeric bioimplant                                            surface.  The cell-binding peptides                                             will be immobilized to the                                                      previously modified bioimplant                                                  surface with tresyl chloride                                                    chemistry.",
