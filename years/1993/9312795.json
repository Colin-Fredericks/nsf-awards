The investigators' joint analyses should contribute  to an assessment of energy intensity trends and potential  reductions in Polish energy demand by sector, and structural  changes in the Polish economy and associate implications for  energy demand.  Poland offers unique opportunities to examine a  variety of energy conservation regimes and technologies tailored  to the transition from a command to market economy, with  potential applicability to the entire region.  The United States,  concerned about unstable energy prices, uncertain oil supply, and  adverse impacts on the environment from fossil fuel use, has also  been compelled to reexamine its energy and environmental  policies.",
