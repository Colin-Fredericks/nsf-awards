The                                   workshop will take place in Curacao,                                            Netherlands Antilles, August 4 - 13, 1993.  Dr.                                 Jorge Martinez, University of Florida,                                          Gainesville,  is the organizer, with Dr.                                        Geoffrey R. Robinson, University of Florida as                                  coorganizer. The workshop will consist of                                       survey lectures, presenting an introduction to                                  Representation Theory of Groups and Finite                                      Dimensional Algebras.  The main objective of                                    the workshop is to contribute to the                                            development of mathematics in the region by                                     adding to the knowledge and background of the                                   participating young researchers and students.                                   The proceedings of this workshop/conference                                     will be published, and several volumes of the                                   work will be made available, free of charge, to                                 individuals and libraries in the Region.                                                                                                                        The program will bring together mathematicians                                  from the developed mathematical community and                                   their colleagues from the Caribbean region and                                  Latin America.  Among the speakers are several                                  eminent mathematicians who are at the cutting                                   edge of research in the field.  From the                                        international perspective, benefits will                                        include establishment of dialogue and                                           communication for future research collaboration                                 between mathematicians from different                                           countries; promotion of the international                                       exchange of scientific knowledge; and                                           strengthening of the mathematical                                               infrastructure of the countries of the region                                   through linkages to prominent researchers and                                   mathematical institutes in developed countries.",
