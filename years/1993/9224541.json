 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224541  Wang       This project addresses the problem of pole assignment by  output feedback with dynamic compensation. Its goals are to find  the minimal order among real dynamic compensators needed for  arbitrary pole assignability and to derive a formula for the  degree of the Rosenthal compactification of dynamic compensator  space. Techniques involving the Schubert calculus developed by  the principal investigator in solving the static output feedback  pole assignment problem are expected to be important in the study  of the minimal order dynamic compensator problem.        The poles of a linear system determine its frequencies and  amplitudes of vibration, and their locations determine whether or  not the system is stable. Therefore, in control design for a  physical system such as an airplane or robot arm, a major  objective is to move the poles of the plant into its stability  region, i.e., a region where the principle modes of vibration die  out at a prescribed rate, using output feedback. Output feedback  usually involves a dynamic compensator and the higher the order  of that compensator, the more complicated the controller needed  to shift the poles becomes.Therefore, it is important to be able  to design minimal order dynamic compensators. This project will  brings the method of algebraic geometry to bear on this problem.  ***",
