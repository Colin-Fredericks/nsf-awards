 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357093  Kiessling  In general, oligosaccharide-protein interactions that play a   critical role in cell-cell recognition in the immune system   and structure/function relationships of RNA and RNA-protein   complexes will be studied. Cell adhesion at the molecular   level, where a specific complex between the tetrasaccharide   sialyl Lewis x and the E-selectin receptor has been   implicated as a mediator, will be studied.   This will lead to an understanding of how: (1) the   carbohydrate sequence determines conformation and   conformational rigidity of the sialyl Lewis x and (2) the   molecular details of complexation. This will allow the   development of new methods to modulate carbohydrate-mediated   adhesion. A new analytical technique for determining binding   of proteins to RNA will be applied with the IRE-binding   protein, which controls levels of iron regulatory proteins.   In addition, the mechanism of selective cleavage of   oligoribonucleotides at bulges and loops by a Cu(II) complex   will be studied as well as cleavage of DNA at hairpins.   %%%  This grant from the Organic Synthesis Program supports the   work of Professor Laura L. Kiessling at the University of   Wisconsin, Madison. Interactions between carbohydrates and   proteins play a critical role in cell-cell recogition in the   immune system and these important interactions will be   studied. Understanding this complexation will be important   to the design of new drugs for the treatment of inflammatory   diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple   sclerosis. A new analytical technique for determining the   binding of proteins to RNA will be implemented to increase   the understanding of RNA-mediated gene regulation, which can   lead to new strategies to control cancer, viral infections,   and other genetic diseases.  ***",
