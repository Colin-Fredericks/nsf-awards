 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307247  Cook    The goal of this research is to understand how animals, including humans, rapidly  see and recognize visual objects.  Dr. Cook's new research elaborates on his prior  NSF-supported research looking at the perception and processing of textured  stimuli by pigeons.  These birds are ideal for comparative visual studies because  the demands for accurate and rapid perception during flight, in conjunction with  the need to minimize body weight, have caused them to evolve very small, but  powerful, visual systems.  This makes them a rich source of comparative  information about how small nervous systems solve the very complex problems of  perception.  In conjunction with research investigating humans and other animals,  the results will help to identify those general rules and mechanisms shared by  many species and those that are unique.  One implication of the prior work was  that the early stages of visual processing in pigeons and humans share many  common characteristics.  The new research continues to examine this issue by  investigating the contributions of stimulus-driven and subject-driven processes in  the discrimination of multi-element stimuli by pigeons, and by humans when  appropriate.  Besides its psychological implications, information from this research  will have potential practical applications in the engineering of small, self-  sufficient, intelligent robots and the development of compact visual prostheses for  the visually impaired.",
