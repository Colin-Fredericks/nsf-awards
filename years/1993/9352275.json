 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352275  Lester  A new laboratory course in cellular and molecular neuroscience  has been established that is specifically tailored to  undergraduate instruction, and uses the latest techniques and  concepts in the molecular biology of excitable cells.  The  course emphasizes (1) the molecular biological and fine-  structure function of the \"excitability proteins\" of neuronal  and other membranes, (2) the nature of the intracellular  signaling pathways that are activated by cell-surface  receptors, and (3) the nature of the intracellular signaling  pathways that are activated by cell-surface receptors.  Most  experiments take place in 2 sessions. In the first session,  students begin with a cDNA clone encoding an ion channel or  receptor.  The students use PCR to generate an optimal DNA,  suitable for in vitro cRNA synthesis, and carry out the cRNA  synthesis reaction.  The students inject the cRNA into Xenopus  oocytes.  In the second session, the students perform  electrophysiological and pharmacological measurements on the  injected oocytes.  The initial sessions concentrate on  relatively simple manipulations such as intracellular  recording; then advance to 2-electrode voltage clamp and,  finally, to patch-clamp experiments.  Provisions are made for  maximal utilization of the requested equipment in undergraduate  research projects during the terms when the course is not  offered formally.     ***",
