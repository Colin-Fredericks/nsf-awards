 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351495  Jasinski  A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) is serving as  a cornerstone of our new laboratory teaching effort.  The  instrument is being used in laboratories at all levels.   Beginning with demonstration in a project-oriented introductory  chemistry lab, the instrument is being used in increasingly  sophisticated ways in higher level courses.  Introduction of  FTIR into the introductory organic laboratory is enhancing the  ability of students to accurately analyze the small amounts of  compounds that result from microscale experiments.  In  addition, students are being introduced to a wider variety of  sampling techniques, including diffuse reflectance.  Judicious  choice of detectors (DTGS or MCT) allows for more sensitivity  to low light throughput at a faster scan rate than dispersive  IR spectrometers.  FTIR techniques are enhancing our  capabilities in the instrumental course as well as the  polymers, pharmaceutical and medicinal applications in the  industrial chemistry laboratory and in undergraduate research.   Students are being introduced to modern spectral manipulation  and database searching techniques as well as essential  parameters of FTIR spectroscopy including signal averaging,  repetitive scanning, resolution comparison and standards  collections.  ***",
