 "awd_abstract_narration": "In ciliated cells, basal bodies are contained within separate,               filamentous cages connected to basal body microtubules.  A recent               study showed that actin is a component of the basal body cage                   complex in Tetrahymena and may be part of an actomyosin system                  associated with these organelles (Hoey and Gavin, J. Cell. Sci.,                103, November 1992).  There are three main objectives to this                   project.  The first is to identify the myosin component of the                  putative actomyosin system in the Tetrahumena basal body cage                   complex; the second is to localize myosin within the complex; and               the third is to determine whether basal body cage myosin mediates               actin filament motility.  An anti-oral apparatus anti-serum will be             screened for cross-reactivity with myosins I and II on immunoblots.             Antibodies that cross-react with myosin polypeptides will be                    affinity-purified and used to localize myosin-like components of                the Tetrahymena basal body cage complex using immunogold labeling.              To show actin filament interactions, in vitro assembled actin                   filaments will be mixed with purified basal body cage myosin and                applied directly to a carbon-coated grid, negatively stained, and               viewed by electron microscopy.                                                  %%%                                                                             One of the most important forms of eukaryotic cellular motility is              that mediated by axonemal beating: i.e., the highly regulated back-             and-forth movement of slender, microtubule-containing cellular                  extensions (cilia or flagella).  Depending on circumstances, such               movements enable a cell to either swim in a regulated manner or to              create local currents in its vicinity resulting in the movement of              the immediate environment with respect to the cell.  Specific cases             of ciliary or flagellar motility include such diverse examples as:              swimming of mammalian sperm toward the ovum, a process critical to              mammalian reproduction; swimming of unicellular algae or protozoans             in pondwater; feeding of protozoans by sweepinging food-containing              pondwater into their oral cavities; and clearance of respiratory                mucus from the lungs by the ciliary beat of epithelial cells lining             the trachea and bronchi.  The axonemes of such cells are rooted in              cellular structures called basal bodies, which are homologous to                centrosomes, structures in which intracellular microtubular arrays              (such as mitotic spindles) are rooted.  Although basal bodies have              been studied for more than a century, important questions about                 their structure, chemistry, formation, and function remain                      unanswered.  These organelles form definite structural associations             with various fibrillar complexes in the cell, one of which is the               cage.  The structure-function relationship of these fibrillar                   complexes has not received much attention from investigators.                   Recent work has shown actin to be present in the basal body cage                complex of a ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena (a useful model system             for studying ciliary function), and on the basis of the presence of             actin it was proposed that there is an actomyosin contractile                   machinery involved in the regulation of basal body position (and by             implication, the direction of the movement).  This proposal focuses             on the identification of the putative myosin component.  The                    implications of such a model go well beyond motility in protozoans.",
