These                                   laboratories serve as training and central                                      facilities for researchers, students, and                                       collaborators.  This modernization will enhance                                 training programs at all levels.  On the                                        undergraduate level, Lehman college is striving to                              establish first rate training programs for bright                               minority students through active participation in                               federally funded programs designed to propel them                               into scientific research careers.  The improved                                 facilities should enable the Department to attract                              more such students and, especially, to keep                                     minority students in the pipeline leading to                                    advanced degrees.                                                                    On the graduate level, Master's and Doctoral                               programs in biology, particularly the plant                                     sciences program, will benefit from up-to-date                                  facilities.  With a dwindling group of botanically                              oriented departments nationwide, CUNY's plant                                   sciences doctoral program, in collaboration with                                the New York Botanical Garden will have the                                     capacity to engage in more sophisticated                                        experimental research.",
