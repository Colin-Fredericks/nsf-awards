 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scott H. Elder has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                         Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Elder's doctoral dcegree was from                  Cornell University under the supervision of Professor Frank                     DiSalvo. Dr. Elder will continue his research at the University                 of California at Berkeley under the sponsorship of Professor                    Neil Bartlett. Dr. Elder's postdoctoral training will provide                   him with skills in preparing solid state fluorides including                    handling and manipulation of HF and elemental fluorine as well                  as advanced characterization methods. Longer term, he plans to                  develop new synthetic strategies for preparing new solid state                  nitridofluorides and sulfidofluorides. These little-studied                     compounds are expected to show a high degree of covalency and                   tunable electronic and magnetic properties.                                     %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                   viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                      broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                  and teaching.",
