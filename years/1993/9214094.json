Co-                                       organizers of the meeting are H.P. Dikshit,                                     pro-vice chancellor of Indira Gandhi National                                   Open University and Charles Micchelli, IBM T.J.                                 Watson Research Center.  Most Indian                                            participants come from a wide spectrum of                                       Indian researchers in Applied Mathematics.  The                                 main purpose of the meeting is to foster the                                    development of research in Computational                                        Mathematics in India through the exchange of                                    the latest developments in this field.                                          The technical subjects that will be highlighted                                 include: wavelet analysis, solution of                                          nonlinear equations, information based                                          complexity, finite element analysis for the                                     solution of partial differential equations,                                     computational complex approximation,                                            applications of orthogonal polynomials,                                         multivariate data fitting and spline functions,                                 and computer aided geometric design.  These are                                 among the most active fields in numerical                                       computation.                                                                                                                                                    Scope:  This proposal will support the cost of                                  airfare for eight distinguished research                                        mathematicians and computer scientists from the                                 United States.  This is one of the most active                                  fields in Indian science.  As the attendance of                                 Ph.D. students and young faculty members will                                   be encouraged explicitly, this conference                                       should make an important contribution to the                                    training of young Indian scientists in                                          computation.  Applied Mathematics offers a                                      developing country, particularly India, the                                     tools to address some of their important                                        technological problems.  It also provides a                                     natural context to make best use of their                                       scientific and mathematical talents.  This                                      meeting should contribute to this process and                                   encourage  US-Indo collaborative research.",
