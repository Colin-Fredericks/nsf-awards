 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop an approach and the                necessary methodologies and tools to allow circuit card assembly                manufacturers to determine the optimal strategy for circuit card                assembly, and to rapidly generate optimal or near-optimal plans.                The objective is to maximize total production rate over a desired               product mix.  The constraints are the equipment capabilities,                   including material handling, the products' bills of materials,                  component, technologies, and the production plan (quantities and                lot sizes required) for some planning horizon.  The research                    challenge is to find enough that is generic about each problem so               that a useful generic solution method can be derived.                                Two types of results are anticipated from the research.                    First, models and algorithms will be developed for the process                  optimization for a range of assembly equipment types.  These                    algorithms will be demonstrated using case study data from actual               circuit card assembly operations.  Ultimately, these algorithms                 should provide the basis for automated or semi-automated process                planning tools.  Such tools would enable process planners to create             higher quality process plans, with much shorter lead times than is              currently possible.  The potential benefit to manufacturing is                  faster response to changing requirements and continuous improvement             of the assembly process.  Second, given a particular setup                      management strategy, models and algorithms will be developed for                optimizing the assignment of components among assembly equipment                and the grouping and sequencing of card types within the assembly               system material flow.  In addition, the research will explore                   methods for comparing alternative setup management strategies and               for selecting the best strategy for a given situation.",
