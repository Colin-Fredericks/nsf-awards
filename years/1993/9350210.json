Other techniques for making  thin films, such as Langmuir-Blodgett deposition and spin  coating, yield films that have poor physical properties, are  inhomogeneous, or are difficult to make.  The issues to be  considered in this proposal are how the final film quality is  related to the interface and the polymerization mechanism and  kinetics, and the characterization of the gas phase reactions.   As  a part of a long-term goal to design novel nonlinear optical  techniques to study polymer processing, this research will  develop surface second harmonic generation to characterize the  dynamics at the metal/polymer interface.  Using surface second  harmonic generation (SSHG), issues that have not been resolvable  in the past including rate laws and the dependence of the film   properties on interfacial characteristics, can be effectively  examined in a continuous, real-time manner.  This research has  two important deliverables: i) the development of an improved,  generally applicable, analytical nonlinear optical technique for  studying reactions at surfaces in real time, and ii) the  resolution of important processing and characterization issues  in a technologically useful polymerization method.  The project  is supported under the Presidential Faculty Fellow program.  ***",
