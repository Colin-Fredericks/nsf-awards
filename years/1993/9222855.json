 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the investigation of a new king of                       reactor system which employs a bed of coal char (pyrolytic                      carbon) and microwave (radio frequency - RF) energy to cause a                  variety of gas phase reactions to occur catalytically at low                    temperatures.  In preliminary work, it has been demonstrated                    that such a reactor will produce high purity hydrogen from                      methane, isopropyl alcohol from methane and steam, and can                      decompose NO, SO2, and H2S.  The system thus shows potential                    to produce high-value products from natural gas, and to clean                   up hot combustion flue gases and synfuel process gases before                   their discharge to the environment.                                                                                                                             The overall objective is to understand the phenomena involved                   in gas phase chemical reactions in the presence of microwave                    and pyrolytic carbon.  A series of experiments will be                          performed to determine reaction products, reaction mechanisms,                  reaction rates, and energy effects (absorption and heating)                     when a variety of reactions occur in the presence of microwave                  energy.  This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research and is                  meant to determine the feasibility of the process before funds                  are committed for an extensive, in-depth study.",
