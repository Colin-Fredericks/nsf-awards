 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Berkeley Automated Supernova Search has passed its proof of                 concept.  This award will build a powerful, new scientific tool by              locating the search at a remote site with a darker sky, better                  seeing, and better weather than the present location.  Combining                this with a new CCD and a faster computer, will increase the                    sensitivity for finding supernovae to 20th magnitude and decrease               the processing time per image from seventy to thirty seconds.                   Funding for a telescope, a CCD camera, a building, and the                      necessary computers has already been obtained.  This award will                 cover the deployment and testing of the new remote search.                                                                                                      The scientific goals of the search are to find supernovae at the                earliest possible time and to find a large number of supernovae for             statistical purposes.  Finding supernovae early and following them              up with light curves and spectra will aid theorists who study the               mechanism of supernova explosions and aid in the study of                       supernovae as distance indicators.  Supernova statistics (in                    particular the supernova rate in galaxies) provides information                 about galaxy composition and evolution as well as the structure,                kinematics, and composition of the interstellar medium.",
