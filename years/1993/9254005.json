The tapes will use a combination                   of live-action video to illustrate important applications of                    thermodynamics and computer-generated graphics to illustrate                    fundamental concepts.  Historical background on important                       people and events in the development of thermodynamics will                     also be presented.  Topics covered in the programs will include                 energy, heat and work concepts, thermodynamic properties and                    processes in gases, liquids and mixtures, energy                                transformations and First Law analysis of closed and open                       systems, reversibility and irreversibility, Second law analysis                 and entropy, isentropic processes and component efficiency,                     Carnot and thermodynamic cycle performance, and principles and                  applications of various power and refrigeration cycles.  The                    tapes will be used in several core thermodynamics courses at                    the University of Texas at Austin with a total enrollment of                    800 students annually.  They will also be made available for                    use in a pilot evaluation at five other universities, and                       subsequently will be distributed nationally on a low cost                       basis.  When used nationally, these materials could impact more                 than 25,000 engineering students per year in introductory                       thermodynamics courses.",
