 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313387  Hutzler       The Environmental Engineering programs at Michigan  Technological University have grown substantially over the past ten  years.  To accommodate this growth, the university has assigned  research space that has been vacated by the Department of  Metallurgical Engineering.  While some of the space is adequate for  environmental engineering research, much of the existing facility  is either outdated or unsuitable for research activities.  Those  laboratories that are adequate for research were equipped in 1968  when the building was constructed, and thus are severely limited  for modernized research use.  Much of the present research is  conducted at several locations on and off campus.       This ARI award will provide funding for the renovation of this  space to bring it to the standards necessary for the increasing  volume of research being conducted by the environmental engineering  faculty and students.  This includes the renovation of laboratory  space, installation of laboratory utilities, and the acquisition  and installation of fixed equipment.  Once the renovations are  completed, faculty, students, and staff will be capable of  performing research that they are presently committed to as well as  conduct research that they would like to do but cannot within the  existing infrastructure.  The facility will be able to accommodate  additional faculty and students in the renovated area, allowing for  continued growth and increased productivity within the  Environmental Engineering program.  ***",
