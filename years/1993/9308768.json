 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308768  Baldwin       Baldwin intends to investigate stable structures derived as  the homogeneous universal model for classes of finite structures  with dimension functions.  These structures have significantly  broadened the class of stable structures in recent years.  In  particular, he asks whether structures of this sort can possibly  satisfy the Vaught or Lachlan conjectures, i.e. whether the  theory of such a structure can have finitely many or aleph-one  countable models.  He will also study the relation between  `generic' models for classes of finite structures and recent  advances in the study of `random' models by Spencer.  During the  last twenty years stability theory has developed a technical  apparatus for detailed investigation of a large class of  mathematical structures.  Zil'ber suggested that in fact all  the structures involved were tied very closely to classical  structures.  Hrushovski provided a counterexample to this  conjecture.  Baldwin refined his construction to find a new  non-Desarguesian projective plane.  Baldwin also discovered a  close connection between these structures and the theory of  random graphs.  Baldwin intends to study this new class of  structures: to see whether they provide counterexamples to some  other long standing conjectures and to explore further the  connection with random graphs.  ***",
