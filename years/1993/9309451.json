 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309451     Renner    Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) is a central  neurotransmitter.  This neurotransmitter has been implicated in the  control of an extremely diverse group of physiological and behavior  functions including aggression, sleep, renal regulation, pain  perception, hormone secretion, thermoregulation, motor activity,  food intake, cardiovascular function and reproduction.  For  example, serotonin is shown to influence female estrous behavior  possibly through its interaction with the gonadal steroids.   Indeed, Dr. Renner has demonstrated that sequential administration  of estrogen and progesterone reduce serotonin turnover in several  brain regions known to be important for the expression of  reproductive behavior.  He will now extend these findings by  determining the physiological relevance of ovarian effects on  serotonergic functioning.  Dr. Renner will use a novel technique,  in vivo microdialysis, to pinpoint the alterations in serotonin  neurotransmission that may contribute to the regulation of  reproductive behavior.  Using this technique, he will examine the  relationship between estrogen and progesterone, serotonin release,  and reproductive behavior in several different brain regions in  freely moving animals.  This work will help define the functional  linkage between sites within the neural network controlling  reproductive behavior.  Dr. Renner will also monitor the  neurochemical and behavioral effects of various pharmacological   interventions in animals primed with different regimes of ovarian  hormones.  These results are likely to help unlock some of the  secrets underlying the integration of the neurochemical events by  which gonadal steroid hormones induce a behavioral response.    ***",
