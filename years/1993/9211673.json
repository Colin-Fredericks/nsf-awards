 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large fraction of the products produced by the chemical                       industry involve solids processes (the term solids processes                    here refers to plants that involve operations such as                           crystallization, filtration, dissolution and drying in the                      main process train).  Little work has been done on the design                   of whole plants that include such processes, including how to                   identify economic tradeoffs and the integration of different                    units to minimize costs.  Work has been done on crushing and                    grinding, filtration, crystallization, drying, etc. as                          separate unit operations, but it is insufficient to view these                  operations in isolation, more integration of such subsystems                    is needed to improve the overall process.                                                                                                                       This research involves the study of the design of plants                        containing solids processing steps.  It deals with three                        aspects: conceptual design, mathematical modeling in terms of                   discretized population balance equations, and the development                   of design methodologies.  In conceptual design, hierarchical                    procedures will be expanded to include vapor-solids systems,                    and an attempt to cover a wide spectrum of plants including                     hydrometallurgical processes and the manufacture of catalysts.                  The procedure will include quantitative heuristics and methods                  of calculation, such as those for equipment and solvent                         selection.  A framework based on discretized population                         equations will be developed to account for changes in particle                  size distribution.  This will be accompanied by the                             formulation of compatible solids processing equipment models                    for use with the population equations.  Case studies will be                    used to help identify heuristics and to provide future users                    with concrete examples.  A computer code is planned to                          demonstrate the procedure.  Another major goal is the                           invention and/or systematization of building blocks which are                   not in the existing repertoire for the design of solids                         processes.  Design procedures for the complete separation of                    three-solute mixtures using extractive and fractional                           crystallization, and for the use of fractional crystallization                  to minimize the loss of products and byproducts to liquid                       purge streams will be developed.  The physics of processing                     solids is emphasized in all aspects of the program.  It is                      expected that the results could contribute to the design                        effort of people in industry, both in conceptual design and                     computer simulation, and provide a coherent body of knowledge                   and concrete examples for teaching the design of solids                         processes.*** //",
