 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collection of the Invertebrate Paleontology Section of the                  National History Museum of Los Angeles County, ranked sixth in                  North America in size and importance by the paleontological                     Society, contains about 3.5 million specimens from 26,000                       catalogued localities, and more than 8,000 type and figured                     specimens cited in about 570 published papers.  The collection                  forms an important national paleontological resource, but one from              which taxonomic data cannot be quickly retrieved.  To alleviate                 this situation, the institution investigated a program to                       computerize its collection records using relational database                    software (Paradox 3.5) running inhouse on a DOS platform.  The                  planning phase of computerization was completed in late 1991 and                implementation of data entry and report forms, testing of database              designs with preliminary data sets, and fine tuning of table and                field definitions, data dictionaries, and procedural manuals will               soon be completed.  This project will provide one-time assistance               for purchase of hardware (computers, printers, mass storage and                 communication devices) to assist in these acquisitions and funding              for a full-time curatorial assistant for two years for data entry               and validation of the locality, type specimen, and bibliographic                databases that constitute the sectional collection records.                     %%%                                                                             Collections of this type some as important national resources not               only for fundamental research but also for general public                       exhibition, educational programs aimed at all sectors of the                    population, and as source materials for the testing are validation              of models designed to emulate past biological/climatological                    histories and make projections for the future.",
