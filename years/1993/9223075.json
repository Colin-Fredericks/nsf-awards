 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses questions concerning the comparative use of                just-in-time (JIT) production philosophy in the United States and               Mexico.  Earlier research identified obstacles to the application               of JIT in varying social and economic cultures.  The goal of this               project is twofold:  (1).  How do potential obstacles affect a                  company's ability to use and achieve the benefits of JIT, and (2).              Does JIT lead to improved performance in non-US settings.  In order             to address these questions, a model of JIT and hypotheses                       concerning potential obstacles was developed.  Case studies of                  plants in the United States and Mexico that are moving towards                  adoptions of JIT will be used to test the hypotheses.  Data will be             collected through interviews, observations, and surveys                         administered to workers and managers in each plant.  Results should             enhance understanding of how the operating environment affects                  operations in general and should lead to a better understanding of              JIT because of the unique perspectives that can be achieved by                  studying it in diverse environments.  The research should benefit               firms doing business in different cultures and environments.  The               project is funded as a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant.",
