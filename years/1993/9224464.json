It seeks to  give a purely combinatorial construction of known quantum  invariants and to look for non-trivial topological quantum field  theories not related to quantum groups; to study polynomial link  invariants defined by a construction similar to Seifert's  construction for the Alexander module, but with homology replaced  by any topological quantum field theory; to develop link theory  in special 3-manifolds like projective space; to study Vassiliev  invariants and their generalizations; and to investigate the  possibility of combinatorial construction of 4-manifold  invariants.  The second part is devoted to realizing bistellar  transformations of smooth triangulations.  The third part is  related to the topology of real algebraic varieties.  It involves  investigation of the relationship between special classes of real  algebraic varieties and their topological models and an attempt  to study the topology of real algebraic knots in 3-dimensional  projective space.       The main idea of this project is to develop the topological  side of quantum topology, a theory which has flowered recently as  a result of the  introduction of modern physics into  low-dimensional topology.  The effect of this progress on  topology needs to be better understood.  The new tools deserve  more detailed study and systematic application to geometric  problems.  They also provide a new opportunity to study  topological properties of real algebraic varieties.  Of course,  traditional methods are to be used together with the new ones.  ***",
