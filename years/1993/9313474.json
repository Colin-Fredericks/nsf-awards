 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313474  Renaghan  The J.W. Wilson Lab at Brown University houses a large number of  researchers in molecular biology and biochemistry.  Twenty three  faculty, 24 postdoctoral fellows, and about 57 graduate students  make use of the research facilities in this building that have not  been renovated in 31 years.  Due to the age of the building, it is  unsafe, unreliable, has serious capacity and energy problems and  the general environmental conditions do not attract scientists or  students.  This award will allow Brown University to renovate and  modernize the research and research training facilities in this  building and impact the research infrastructure by: 1) providing  for an uninterrupted and stable research environment while removing  restrictions currently in place on hoods and research equipment; 2)  providing for an optimal HVAC system thereby creating a healthy  environment for performance of research and reduction of downtime;  3) providing for flexible and reliable use of mechanical and  electrical research equipment in laboratories; 4) providing for  compliance with all applicable building and environmental codes; 5)  providing greater opportunity for enhanced preparation and improved  productivity of faculty and student researchers; and 6) providing  a safe and stable working environment for graduate, undergraduate  and postdoctoral trainees.  The researchers at this institution  have an excellent research record in biotechnology research areas  and the modernization project to be undertaken will greatly enable  their efforts.  ***",
