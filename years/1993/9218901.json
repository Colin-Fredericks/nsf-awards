 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are (1) to understand the roles of                   allosteric interactions in the regulation of metabolite transfer                between sequential enzymes in a metabolic pathway, (2) to                       understand the relationship between enzyme conformation change,                 substrate specificity, and catalysis, and (3) to explore the                    significance of direct metabolite transfer in systems which contain             more than one type of catalytic site.  Tryptophan synthase systems              from E. coli and S. typhimurium (bienzyme complexes) and yeast and              blue-green algae (multienzymes) will be studied utilizing rapid                 mixing kinetic techniques in combination with absorbance and                    fluorescence spectrophotometry, and high resolution nuclear                     magnetic resonance.                                                             %%%                                                                             The efficiency of cellular metabolism requires the existence of                 multienzyme complexes which catalyze a sequence of chemical changes             on metabolites.  The efficiency derived from not having to                      recapture intermediates from the exterior milieu is suspected to be             the primary reason for such highly organized processing.  The                   proposed research explores an ideal model system for such linked                enzyme-catalyzed processing of substrates.  In the case of                      tryptophan synthase, substrate is passed through a \"tunnel\" between             the enzyme active sites.  The studies planned will examine how the              two active sites interact with each other in order to optimize                  catalysis and transfer of metabolites between them.  A great deal               will potentially be learned through this work about the way this                complex protein machinery works and why it is designed as it is.",
