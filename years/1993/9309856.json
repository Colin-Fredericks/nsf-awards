 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309856  Jordan         During normal development, adult patterns of synaptic  connections are established through an elimination of excess  neural connections.  For example, in newborns, muscle fibers  receive innervation from several different motoneurons.  By the  time the mammal has matured into adulthood, muscle fibers are  each typically innervated by only a single motoneuron.  Dr.  Jordan's research program seeks to understand the cellular and  molecular bases of synapse elimination.  Her model is a   a relatively simple neuromuscular system, namely the  perineal levator ani muscle and its innervating motoneurons  located in the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus.  Studying  synapse elimination in this system offers the significant  advantage that this mechanism can be regulated by steroid  hormones.  Androgen treatment during a specified period of  development  permanently prevents some synapse elimination in  this system. Thus, androgens are a naturally occurring factor  that influences the development of the central nervous system.   Dr. Jordan will use steroid hormones as a tool for the control  and manipulation of synapse elimination.  Information about where  androgen acts to prevent this loss is necessary for directing  further experiments aimed at identifying the underlying  mechanisms.  In addition, she will examine the mechanisms that  initiate the onset of synapse elimination.  Dr. Jordan will  explore the possibility that it is the electrical uncoupling of  the neurons that underlie the selective stabilization and  maintenance of synapses.  Information gained about the factors  controlling this crucial developmental event in the neuromuscular  system could be applied to neuronal populations in the brain that  undergo similar synaptic alternations due to either normal or  pathological processes.    ***",
