 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue REU support  for                          another year in the Department of Biology at Augustana                          College.  The program will support undergraduate                                participation in a  focused research program which                              integrates the research activities of ten investigators from                    Augustana College (6), Univ. Neb. (1), The Nature                               Conservancy (1), S.D. State Univ. (1), and Black Hills State                    Univ. (1). The projects are integrated at the scientific                        level because of the common interests in prairie ecology and                    paleoecology, and because each project benefits from the                        applications of the stable isotopes of C and N to the                           methodology. A coherent group and a unique methodology will                     be used to continue ecological and archeological                                reconstructions in a geographic area of rich ecological                         resources and to encompass growing interest in diets and                        physiology. The REU students will be active participants as                     Augustana College hosts the International Conference. on                        Bone Modifications in 1993. Four high school teachers will                      participate,  funded in total by the S. Dakota-NSF State                        Systemic Initiative.                                                                                                                                            Ten students (half women, half from off-campus) will study                      field and laboratory problems with a common focus.  They                        will be expected to gain some mastery of the theoretical                        basis for their study as well as the experimental design and                    ultimate interpretation. Weekly seminars and workshops will                     review each project's theoretical basis and research design;                    enhance the students' library, laboratory, data handling,                       and scientific writing skills; and broaden their                                understanding of the related projects. The ten-week summer                      program and academic year independent study will culminate                      in an REU Symposium in which each student will present                          his/her results and conclusions and help develop the                            hypotheses for next summer's projects. Outstanding women                        will be selected again as seminar speakers and to serve as                      role models. Twenty high schools will be invited to select                      an outstanding woman student to attend the REU Symposium and                    return for one day in summer. A major ethics conference will                    be hosted and  a report disseminated  dealing with reburial                     of museum specimens and animal research.",
