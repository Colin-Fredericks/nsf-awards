 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a six month visit to Japan by Dr. John P.               Hughes, High Energy Astrophysics Division, U.S. Smithsonian                     Institution Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts               to carry out a collaborative project with Professor Katsuji                     Koyama, Department of Physics at Kyoto University.  The                         researchers will also be cooperating with scientists at the                     Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), which is                   located outside Tokyo and serves as the \"hub\" for X-ray astronomy               in Japan.  The research will be based on information to be                      transmitted from the X-ray Astronomy Satellite (ASTRO-D) which is               scheduled for launch in February l993.  This satellite is a                     collaborative mission between the U.S. and Japan and will be the                fourth in a series of X-ray satellites launched in Japan.  This                 mission has high capability of imaging and spectroscopy in the                  hard X-ray band.  The first phase of the mission will be devoted                to performance verfication and on-orbit calibration activities.                 This will be followed by studies and analyses of supernova                      remnants and clusters of galaxies.                                                                                                                              Knowledge provided by this data will develop fundamental new                    insights into the nature and emission processes of all classes of               astrophysical sources.  The Japanese have been the leaders in                   this area of X-ray astronomy.  Professor Hughes has expertise in                the areas of verification and calibration of X-ray satellites                   which will be valuable to the Japanese.  Both he and the U.S.                   scientific community will benefit from very early access to the                 data.  It is anticipated that the collaboration developed between               these researchers will continue for many years.",
