 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor James Skinner is supported by a grant from the                        Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue                     his work in studies of relaxation, spectroscopy, and                            transport in condensed phases.  Skinner employs a model                         system consisting of two quantum levels coupled to a quantum                    mechanical bath which is used for studies of relaxation                         processes, and has applications to many different branches                      of spectroscopy.  In the usual approach it is assumed that                      the coupling between the quantum levels and the bath is                         weak, and that the initial density matrix factors into a                        product of density matrices for the quantum levels and one                      for the bath.  Skinner's approach differs in that his                           studies of the relaxation properties of the reduced density                     matrix do not involve either of these two assumptions.                          Skinner will develop a microscopic theory of inhomogeneous                      lineshapes in crystals which he will apply to results of                        several experiments.  He also will develop a statistical                        mechanical dynamical theory of electronic spectroscopy in                       liquids and dense gases such as supercritical fluids.                           %%%                                                                             The last decade has shown that disorder is responsible for                      many important properties of materials.  In addition, the                       transport of electrons in condensed matter, which has                           important implications for biology and solar energy                             collection, is greatly affected by disorder.  Skinner's                         research provides important insights at the molecular level                     which will lead to a clearer understanding of the way in                        which disorder influences the important material properties                     of condensed phase chemical systems.",
