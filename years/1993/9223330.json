 "awd_abstract_narration": "The image which many scientists wish to convey is that the pursuit              of \"pure\" science is \"objective\" and unsullied by practical                     economic, political and social concerns.  Developments within the               Science and Technology Studies (STS) community over the past two                decades, however, have sought to break down the supposed barriers               between science and society.  Leading theorists argue that not only             do science and technology influence society, but that, as a human               endeavor, society must necessarily affect both the way science and              technology develop but also the content of scientific and                       technological thought.  Researchers within STS are now engaged in               detailed case studies of how this interaction between science and               society occurs.                                                                                                                                                 Dr. Shirley Roe is engaged in an important study of the nature of               the science-society interaction when biologists struggled to                    determine the nature and origins of life.  Even today, scientists               argue about how life began on earth: either by creation,                        spontaneous generation or transportation from another planet.  The              last view, however, begs the question since one is then left with               the question of how life arose on the planet from which life was                transported to earth.  Scientists who reject creation argue that                conditions on earth in primordial times coalesced in some way so                that living organisms sprang to life and evolved.  Scientists are               trying to reproduce these conditions in order to prove that life                could have generated on earth without external interference.  Dr.               Roe is examining the origins of these debates in French biology of              the 18th century.  In famous experiments, Tuberville Needham and                Georges Buffon tried to demonstrate the existence of conditions in              which life can arise.  Their opponent, Lazzaro Spallanzani, in a                series of brilliant experiments, demonstrated sources of contagion              which led to the seeming \"spontaneous\" growth of new organisms                  within Needham's primordial brew.   Objectivists wishing to defend              \"pure\" science would argue that these are all straight-forward                  scientific experiments uninfluenced by social concerns.  Dr. Roe is             challenging this view.  She has found that the new biological                   discoveries of Needham and Buffon became controversial precisely                because they were seen at the time as having daring implications                for religion and morality.  She situates both proponents and                    opponents of the new biology within the crisis over the philosophes             that was so prominent at the time and argues that the new                       biological evidence for active matter struck at the heart of the                notion of a divinely ordered world.   By lending support to atheism             and materialism the new biology called into question the religious              basis for social morality and political order.  Attacks on the new              biology were motivated by a conservative defense of the established             order.  The parallelism with contemporary issues of science,                    religion, and morality are striking.  Hence, Dr. Roe's study not                only will illuminate the interactions of science and society in the             18th century but will also illuminate many of the concerns of                   modern religion with advances of contemporary science.",
