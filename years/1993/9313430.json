The laboratory was envisioned as a common departmental resource, where any department member, faculty or student, could learn modern molecular genetic techniques and apply these techniques to the research problem.  The need for the laboratory developed from the rising importance of molecular genetic techniques in many of the sub-disciplines of biology, particularly ecology, evolution and systematics.   Access to these techniques can prove to be an insurmountable problem for some researchers and students due to lack of training or funds.  Present conditions in Foster Hall, home of the Biology Department, have impeded research activities.  Researchers are forced to travel throughout the building to perform different steps of various techniques, leading to the duplication of experiments.  This award will provide funding for the consolidation of research space that is currently scattered  within Foster Hall.  Some of the laboratories that will undergo renovations were not originally designed as laboratory space and are inadequate to conduct modern research.  Laboratory casework, benches and fume hoods will be replaced, in addition to modifying the electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems.  By creating a shared facility, the Department will ensure that all of its members have access to the equipment, methods, and training essential for the successful incoporations of molecular biological techni ques into a research program.
