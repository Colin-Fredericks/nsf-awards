 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311097  Gentry and Talbot       Among the fascinating growth forms of tropical plants, lianas  or woody vines are common in forests and ecologically important.   They are also poorly studied taxonomically, in part because of  difficulties in procuring flowering and fruiting material from high  in the forest canopy.  Graduate student Talbot under the  supervision of Dr. Gentry is studying the species of the New World  genus Salacia of the family Hippocrateaceae, mostly lianas and  small trees, with a great diversity of floral form in regions of  northern South America.  Herbarium study of preserved specimens  will be supplemented by extensive field work in Brazil, Peru, and  Ecuador to acquire new materials and to make observations on  pollination and seed dispersal.  New morphological characters will  be acquired through use of scanning electron microscopy of pollen  and of leaf surfaces, adding to traditional anatomical and  morphological features.  %%%       The diversity of species in the tropics is still little  appreciated or documented, and in particular for lianas or woody  vines, where flowers and fruits are difficult to collect from the  high forest canopy.  This research will focus on plants of the  genus Salacia and will improve our understanding of species  recognition, phylogenetic relationships among the species, and  patterns of geographical spread and endemism.  ***",
