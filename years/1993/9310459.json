 "awd_abstract_narration": "As research on global change has evolved in recent years,                  the need for greater understanding of the complex interactions                  among human and natural systems has become increasingly apparent.               Because of long-standing interests and expertise in the analysis                of human-environmental interactions at a variety of scales,                     geographers have been especially well suited to play central                    roles in the development and conduct of research on the human and               other dimensions of global change.  While a significant number of               geographers have stepped forward and turned their scholarly                     attention to this important topic, many other geographers have                  not recognized the potential for using their conceptual                         frameworks and research approaches to address these important                   problems.  This award will provide support for a workshop on                    geographic contributions to global change research.  The workshop               will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, in early April 1993,                          immediately prior to the start of the Annual Meeting of the                     Association of American Geographers (AAG), the largest                          professional society of research-oriented geographers in the U.S.               This workshop marks a critical stage in joint work that has been                conducted by AAG leaders together with NSF Geography and Regional               Science Program officers.  Geographers who have been leading                    researchers on topics related to the human dimensions of global                 environmental change will assist AAG leaders and NSF program                    officers in the selection of roughly 50 participants and in the                 conduct of the conference.  The workshop will consist of a series               of working-group discussions interspersed among plenary sessions                at which all participants will meet to consider salient points                  raised in their group discussions.  The outcome of the conference               will be a number of articles in widely disseminated publications                of the AAG and its specialty groups.  These articles should help                identify important lines of inquiry to be pursued by geographers                in one or more of three general approaches.  Another outcome of                 the workshop should be new knowledge by NSF program officers of                 research needs that must be addressed in order to stimulate                     greater involvement of geographers in basic and applied inquiries               into the human and other dimensions of global change.                                This workshop should facilitate the more active involvement                of geographers in research on global change by identifying ways                 that current theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches               can be adapted to address a variety of problems.  The workshop                  also should assist NSF program officers in determining new                      strategies that the foundation might use to facilitate and                      support basic research by geographers and other spatially                       oriented scientists on this critical topic.",
