 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted in order to gain a better                understanding of fundamental physical laws that govern stochastic               transport processes in heterogeneous media with macroscopically                 correlated disorder.  For composites with \"block\" disorder,                     conventional macroscopic transport equations generally do not                   apply, and an attempt will be made to formulate the appropriate                 composition laws that permit a macroscopic description of transport             in such systems.  The superdiffusive motion of Brownian particles               in a randomly stratified flow field will then be investigated.                  Steady-state and first-passage characteristics of this system                   appear to be controlled by exceptional fluctuations, leading to a               multiplicity of basic time scales in the system.  Theoretical and               numerical studies will determine the appropriate macroscopic                    description.  The unusual transport properties of Brownian                      particles which are driven by prototypical random flow fields will              also be explored.  Finally, the first-passage characteristics in                source-sink flow will be studied, where the interplay between                   spatially varying convection and molecular diffusion are                        anticipated to yield unusual first-passage properties.  The studies             will be extended to fractured media, where fast transport in                    fracture competes in a subtle way with slow transport modes.                                                                                                    This project is coordinated with an identical one at the Department             of Energy, Basic Energy Sciences, which supports Professor Joel                 Koplik of the City University of New York who is collaborating with             Professor Redner.                                                               %%%                                                                             Analytical and numerical research will be conducted on random                   transport in heterogeneous media and flows.  In particular, the                 movement of a passive particle in porous media will be studied                  under the influence of various types of random disorder.  Examples              include fluid flow in stratified geological media and the                       propagation of fracture in rocks and other heterogeneous materials.             The research addresses fundamental issues in statistical physics                and, at the same time, has many real applications.  The research is             coordinated with an identical grant at the Department of Energy                 which supports Professor Koplik at the City University of New York.",
