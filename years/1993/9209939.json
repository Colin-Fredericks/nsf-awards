 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurons extend two distinct types of neurites, axons, and                       dendrites.  Axons are highly specialized to transmit information                over long distances, whereas dendrites are highly specialized to                receive and process information.  A growing body of evidence                    indicates that the more overt differences between these neurites                derive from underlying differences in their cytoskeletal structure,             and in particular of their microtubules.  Microtubules are                      filamentous proteins that have important functions in cellular                  architecture and motility.  In recent years, considerable effort                has been devoted toward understanding the regulation and functions              of microtubules in the axon.  In contrast, dendritic microtubules               are poorly studied.  The experiments in this application will                   explore the role of MAP-2, a somatodendritic-specific                           microtubule-associated protein in the organization and stability                properties of dendritic microtubules.  Other experiments will                   explore the potential role of microtubules in regulating organelle              transport in the dendrite.  These studies will resolve important                issues about dendritic microtubules, and will thereby provide new               insights into the mechanisms that generate and maintain neuronal                polarity.  Information of this kind is essential for understanding              the cell biology of the neuron, and for elucidating the causes and              potential cures for neuropathologies involving retardation of                   dendritic growth, and/or loss of neuronal polarity.",
