 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304808  Nelson         This award will support planning for the second phase of an  international collaborative project to collect deep seismic  reflection and related geophysical and geological data across the  Himalaya/Tibet Plateau collision zone.  The pilot phase of this  project, termed INDEPTH (INternational DEep Profiling of Tibet and  the Himalaya) was successfully completed last summer (1992) by a  team of U. S. and Chinese scientists operating a Chinese seismic  reflection crew in southern Tibet.  The cost of the pilot project  was shared by NSF's Continental Dynamics Program and China's  Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.  Having demonstrated  \"proof of concept\" with the pilot study, the principal  investigators will proceed with the next phase of INDEPTH data  acquisition during the summer of 1994.  In order to do this,  however, the need to:         1.   Bring their Science Advisory Team and other potential            U.S. and foreign participants in INDEPTH together to            review final analyses of the pilot survey results, to            identify the next profiling site to recommend to their            Chinese colleagues, to design the core seismic            experiments and to coordinate the broader participation            by these other groups in INDEPTH.         2.   Send a delegation of INDEPTH scientists to China to            negotiate the next phase of INDEPTH data acquisition,            participate in a workshop being  held by the Chinese to            discuss the joint results of the pilot study, and most            importantly scout the next profiling site in Tibet.         This award will support these critical planning activities.  ***",
