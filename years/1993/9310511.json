Different types of glial cells have different functions and are needed in different parts of the nervous system.  Little is known about how the different glial cell types arise during development of the nervous system. This study will define how neurons alter glial cells during the development, and will establish the similarities and differences between two types of glial cells, those of nerves and those of ganglia. The hypothesis to be tested is that glial cell precursors divide and mature into either of these two types of glia in response to factors from the neurons.  A cell culture system has been developed that will allow this hypothesis to be tested. Information from these studies will lead to a greater understanding of how cell-cell interactions influence development in the normal nervous system.  ***                                         9310511  Hall    The nervous system is composed of two major cell types, neurons and glia.
