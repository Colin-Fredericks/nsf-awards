 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores next-generation neural computing based               on oscillatory behavior of neuron columns found in the visual                   cortex and olfactory bulbs of mammals.  The biological basis for                looking further than magnitude of signals is sufficient as                      supported by recent discoveries such as evidence of oscillations in             the olfactory bulbs of rabbits which helped them to determine the               sex and age of other rabbits.  That state of neuron would not be                considered as a simple level or magnitude, but rather a combination             of magnitude, frequency, phase, and perhaps other attributes, of                its output relative to other neighboring neurons.  This research                seeks to analyze and characterize the behavior of coupled                       oscillatory systems by mathematically deriving closed-form                      solutions to the dynamic equations and simulation, the behavior of              the coupled oscillatory columns can be observed by varying the                  stimulus, self-feedback gain, lateral coupling, and frequency                   parameter of oscillation.  The effects of Gaussian noise on large               networks of oscillatory columns will also be investigated.",
