 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range objective of this project is to understand, the                  structure and function of the mitochondrial tricarboxylate                      transport protein.  This protein catalyzes a tricarboxylate-                    H+/dicarboxylate antiport across the mitochondrial inner membrane,              an action which is essential to the energy metabolism of the liver              parenchymal cell.  Experiments will be conducted to: 1) isolate,                characterize and sequence the cDNA that encodes the entire rat                  liver mitochondrial CTP in order to deduce the complete amino acid              sequence of this carrier; 2) elucidate the topography of the CTP                within the mitochondrial inner membrane via the use of site-                    specific polyclonal antibodies, in situ proteolysis, and vectorial              labeling; and 3) begin to identify and localize specific amino acid             residues which form the substrate binding site within the CTP                   through the use of both active-site directed and group-directed                 probes in combination with amino acid sequence analysis of modified             domains.  The proposed studies are both necessary and fundamental               for an in depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms that                  biological systems utilize to transport anions across membranes and             thereby meet metabolic meeds.                                                   %%%                                                                             The aim of this project is to understand, at the molecular and                  chemical levels, the structure and function of the mitochondrial                citrate transport protein (CTP).  This protein transports citrate               and malate across the mitochondrial inner membrane and is essential             to the energy metabolism of hepatic cells.  In order to accomplish              this aim we will conduct experiments to: 1) deduce the complete                 amino acid sequence of the rat liver mitochondrial CTP; 2)                      determine how this transport protein is folded and orientated                   within the mitochondrial inner membrane; and 3) begin to identify               and localize specific amino acid residues which are essential to                the transport mechanism and which form the citrate and malate                   binding site(s).  These studies are fundamental to an in depth                  understanding of the molecular mechanisms that biological systems               utilize to transport molecules across membranes to meet their                   metabolic needs.  More generally, these investigations are expected             to provide a significant advance in our knowledge about how                     transport proteins work.",
