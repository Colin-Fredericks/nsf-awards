 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southeastern Regional Education Service Center of New                       Hampshire has initiated a series of planning activities that                    will establish action plans for reform of elementary and                        middle school science instruction in 13 school districts.                       These districts include 20 elementary and 10 middle schools,                    representing 25% of the state's total K-12 enrollment.  The                     planning activities will include 1) surveys to establish the                    status of and needs for improved science instruction in each                    district, and 2) training and planning workshops for                            district teams (principals, teachers, district                                  administrators).  Each team will use the training workshops                     to develop action plans leading to adoption of hands-on                         inquiry-based curricula and teaching practices.                                                                                                                 The planning activities described above will initiate an                        important reform effort within each district, and will                          create a regional network of collaborating reformers.  This                     planning process is critical to the long-term success of the                    effort, and will serve as a model for other consortia of                        small school districts.                                                                                                                                         Cost sharing amounts to 29% of the NSF contribution.",
