 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developmental instability (DI) is the failure of an organism               to develop normally, in ways ranging from physical anomalies and                disease to abnormal behavior.  The causes of DI include genetic                 and environmental factors and their interactions.  In man, DIs                  include cleft lip, congenital heart disease, schizophrenia and                  chromosomal abnormalities as well as exposure to teratogens such                as alcohol and isoretinoin.  However, despite extensive                         theoretical explanations, it is not known how developmental                     homeostasis breaks down to produce abnormal phenotypes.                                                                                                         This award supports a workshop titled \"Developmental Instability:               Its Origins and Evolutionary Significance\".  This conference will               discuss ways to measure developmental instability, genetic and                  developmental origins of instability, human health and phenotypic               variation, and DI's relevance to population biology and evolution               in general.  The coonference breaks new ground and has a strong                 interdisciplinary approach, joining the fields of evolutionary                  and developmental biology.                                                      %%%                                                                                  DI has far-reaching implications for population biology,                   environmental biology and human health.  DI is reported to                      increase in populations of organisms whose habitats are polluted                or otherwise altered, as well as in those experiencing                          bottlenecks and subsequent inbreeding.  Despite this lack of                    knowledge, DI is already employed as the basis for decisions                    regarding whether species are endangered or humans are at risk.",
