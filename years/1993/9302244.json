 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302244  Snodgrass    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.   Many emerging applications, including geographical information  systems and scientific databases, such as those associated with  global change studies, require simultaneous support for spatial and  temporal data.  This project considers three areas where previously  proposed approaches for handling space or time separately need to  be generalized to produce a coherent approach to spatiotemporal  (ST) database.  The first issue is the design of ST databases.   Database administrators use a data model to describe the enterprise  to be modeled.  A conceptual data model used in temporal databases  that employs sets of time instants is being merged with the point  set model used in spatial databases.  The second issue is that of  query processing, specifically efficient execution of ST natural  joins and ST aggregates.  Extensions of currently proposed temporal  query processing methods are under development.  Finally, ST  indeterminacy, or \"don't know exactly where or when\" information,  must be handled.  Again, the merged data model is quite helpful, as  it is possible to model indeterminacy in this model as sets of  possible instants and points.  The result will be enhanced methods  of designing ST databases and implementing ST database management  systems, in which time and space support is balanced and  coordinated.   ***",
