 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of three projects investigating how economic             agents use their past experience to guide their current decisions.              The first research project studies agents who use very simple rules             of thumb in choosing between alternative technologies; these rules              will incorporate the idea that agents try to learn from the                     experiences of their neighbors.  The project will investigate the               long-run implications of such \"social learning,\" and in particular              on when simple rules can lead to efficient long-run outcomes.  The              second project studies learning in games.  Here the focus is on                 when repeated interaction will lead play to correspond to a Nash                equilibrium or to one of its refinements.  The third project will               develop a model of optimal contracts between a firm's owners and                its manager in a setting where the owners learn about the firm's                future prospects from its current performance.  The model will                  provide an explanation for the widely-observed practice of \"income              smoothing,\" under which the manager takes actions that increase                 reported income when income is low, and decrease reported income                when income is high.  This research is important because it tackles             and helps provide answers to a few of the most important issues in              the economic implications of learning.",
