Demographic, technological, socio-  economic, and legal pressures have resulted in disintegration of  traditional institutional arrangements in many parts of the world  in recent decades.  This doctoral dissertation research project  will examine the nature and impact of these changes on  environmental conditions in Rajasthan, an arid state in  northwestern India.  The research will consist of integration of  information from a number of different sources.  Remotely sensed  images will be interpreted as part of a time-series analysis of  land-use change in the region, and information about the  structure and rule systems of institutions will be assembled from  surveys and written sources.  Analyses of these data will form  the foundation for a more intensive comparative evaluation of  three representative villages in the region.  Ethnographic  methods will be used to identify institutional formation and  adaptations within different rule systems, and ecological surveys  will be used to test quantitatively the impact of changing  institution arrangements on resource management and changes in  natural environmental conditions.       This project will provide valuable insights into a number of  important relationships, including links among changing land uses  and institutional systems as well as among regional environmental  changes and patterns of local resource use.  The project will  enhance understandings of the historical evolution of land-use  change under different cultural and economic regimes, thereby  expanding general knowledge about the human dimensions of global  environmental change.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement  award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising  student to establish a strong independent research career.  ***",
