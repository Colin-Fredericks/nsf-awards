 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352889  Moore       The authors are developing interactive laboratory and classroom  materials to support follow-on courses for students completing  reformed calculus course:  linear algebra, differential equations,  and applied mathematical analysis.  A seven-member development  team, working at five different institutions over a two-year  period, will develop approximately 70 interactive text modules.   Each module will be developed in one of the systems Mathcad 3.1,  Maple V, or Mathematica, and translated by student assistants to  each of the other two system.  This project will build on and reinforce the acquired concepts and  shared experiences of students moving on from reformed calculus  courses.  These students know how to work in a lab, how to work  with partners, and how to work on their own.  Moreover, they have  had introductions to many of the important ideas that will be  developed further in the follow-on courses.  Such students will  find conventional courses less than satisfactory as preparation for  their scientific or engineering careers in the 21st century.  The  modules to be developed by this project will enable students to  work with significant and realistic problems in a modern computer  environment that allows the to experiment to vary examples  endlessly, and to control the order and pace of their learning.",
