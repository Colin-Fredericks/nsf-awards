Commitments by major industries were made up to three years ago  to reduce hazardous wastes and toxic emissions by 50% by the year  1995.  Industrial managers are now challenged to decide: 1) which  product changes should be initiated to achieve pollution  prevention goals? 20 which innovative technologies should receive  research and development investments to advance pollution  prevention goals? and 3) Which processes should be redesigned  using innovative technologies that have already been researched  and developed but not yet deployed?   To ensure the economic as  well as the environmental viability of the company, these  managers must make informed decisions based on reasonably  accurate costs and benefits.  Historically, though, environmental  costs have not been properly valued, notably externalities have  not been internalized by producers.  Additionally, the manner in  which any environmental costs have been tracked is not conductive  to on-going management of technology innovation because the costs  are not allocated accurately to technologies, processes and  products.  The proposed research effort addresses both these  needs.  Through case-studies and benchmarking the research will  establish a systems framework to track environmental costs as  well as a method for valuing them.  Life-cycle costing will  enable this.  Eventual practical implementation of the system  will be facilitated by formalizing the links between the costs  and the technologies by defining waste generating processes and  overlaying on them Activity-Based Costing (ABC) methods.  The ABC  system will be specific to the Chemical and Refining Industries  since it is activity based.  These two industries were selected  for three reasons: 1) together the y contribute to over half of  all waste generated in the United States; 2) the tendency to  focus on discrete manufacturing has neglected these very  important waste producers and economic contributors; and 3) these  industries are heavily concentrated in the State of Texas where  the majority of the research will be conducted.  The wide range  of support to this effort from industry representatives, policy  organizations, academics and government agencies is a testament  to feasibility and desirability of this research endeavor.  ***",
