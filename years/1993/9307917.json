The long-term objective  of the research is to define a hierarchy of formal specification  languages that address, in increasing specificity, the  requirements of concurrent systems.  This family of languages is  based on the concept of a base language that serves as the parent  class and subclasses that represent increasingly specify features  of concurrent systems.  The preliminary approach is to first  develop a hierarchical description of the classes and their  relationships and then to formally define the base class, both  syntactically and semantically.  Using inheritance, subclasses  will then be defined for categories of programming languages that  support specific language features.  This approach to the  specification of concurrent object-oriented systems promotes the  use of abstraction and assists the specifier with the  transformation of a problem to a language-specific form.  The  hierarchy of specifications also has potential for specification  reuse.    The planning activities include comprehensive study of research  in  areas that are fundamental to the proposed research,  including formal specification languages, concurrent object-  oriented languages, and algebraic specifications.  The planning  activities also include the development of a mini-language to  provide a mechanism for experimentation and for expansion of the  proposed research.  ***",
