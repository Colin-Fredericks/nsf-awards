 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project undertakes a four-year research and development                    effort to produce a comprehensive, conceptually-based                           physics program that integrates video-based, inquiry-based,                     and lab-oriented materials with findings from current                           research in preconceptions along with an effective pedagogy                     for use in physics teacher enhancement workshops.                                                                                                               In the initial stage an Oversight Committee composed of                         physicists, researchers, and other experts will be                              established to examine existing materials, such as PRISMS,                      CASTLE, InfoMall, Physics Teach to Learn, and Mechanical                        Universe, in light of research findings in physics                              education.  The goal will be to assemble \"best of the best\"                     into a coherent, multi-faceted Core Curriculum materials for                    teachers of physics and to produce a Workbook for student                       use.  All the materials will take an approach focussed on                       identifying students' preconceptions and misconceptions and                     replacing them with sound concepts.  An Academic Council of                     high school teachers will develop a draft of the                                comprehensive program in the first year of the project for                      review by the Oversight Committee.  The Project Staff will                      then refine the materials.                                                                                                                                      In the second year of the project, the Core Curriculum will                     be used for the education of seventy-five Leaders of Physics                    Instruction (LPIs) through a four-week long summer                              Leadership Institute at the University of Dallas.  During                       this Institute the LPIs will explore the materials and their                    effective use, gain insights into teaching through a                            conceptual approach, and have the opportunity to teach                          certain concepts to their peers.  During the following                          academic year, these teachers will use the materials in                         their classrooms and evaluate their effectiveness for                           improving students' understanding of physical concepts.                                                                                                         In the third year of the project, the LPIs will offer                           workshops for less-prepared physics teachers in their                           regions.  Local Educational Agencies will contribute to the                     project through the purchase of the materials for their                         teachers.  In the fourth year of the project, the LPIs will                     have a follow-up session to assess the workshops and to make                    plans for continuation of the program beyond the period of                      NSF support.  Through the continued offering of workshops by                    LPIs, that will be supported by non-NSF funds, it is                            estimated that 750 teachers and 30,000 students per year                        will be impacted by the project.                                                                                                                                Cost-Sharing equals 100% of the NSF award.",
