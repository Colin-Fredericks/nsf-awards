 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313472  Barnett  The Biology Department at San Diego State University is the  second largest academic department in the University.  Research  expertise in diverse areas of biology is organized into three  major program areas within the department: (1) cell and molecular  biology (2) ecology, and (3) systematics and evolution.  The  department plays a key role in providing research training  required for a scientifically literate workforce in the areas of  biotechnology, environmental protection and environmental impact.  The microbiology program is critical for those students enrolled  in masters and doctoral programs in microbiology and cell and  molecular biology,  as well as those students who pursue  employment in the local biotechnology industry.  In addition, the  department has a major role in training teachers for K-12  education and training personnel for health-related occupations.    ARI funds are requested to renovate laboratory space in the Life  Sciences North building to provide a new faculty research space  and to upgrade an existing facility that provides support for  faculty members doing research in virology, immunology,  bacteriology and microbial genetics.  The existing space,  constructed in 1962, is poorly designed for current research, and  does not comply with health and safety regulations.  The  renovation of this space will increase research training  opportunities in microbiology, for a diverse population of  undergraduate and graduate students by providing a modern  research laboratory to conduct experiments, and increase the  efficiency and utility of research support for current faculty.  ***",
