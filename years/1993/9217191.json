 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in inorganic and organometallic chemistry between Kim Dunbar of                 Michigan State University and Patrick Batail of the University of               Paris, South (Orsay).  The objective of the research is to                      develop low dimensional materials that have useful electrical and               magnetic properties.  The investigators will use dinuclear and                  cluster metal-metal bonded compounds as precursors to reactions                 with redox-active organic molecules which have functional groups                capable of attaching to a metal. They will synthesize three main                types of materials: (1) covalently-linked one dimensional                       materials consisting of alternating metal and p-organic groups;                 (2) network polymers comprised of cross-linked metal units; and                 (3) metal complexes of new phosphorus ligands.  These are                       interesting materials because of their potential for electrical                 and magnetic properties.                                                                                                                                        The Michigan State group brings to this collaboration experience                in molecular chemistry.  They have been involved in the synthesis               of new metal precursors for the design of molecular based charge                transfer polymers and materials.  This is complemented by the                   French group's expertise in theoretical solid state chemistry,                  conductivity, magnetism, and their work on transition metal                     clusters.  The collaboration allows the U.S. investigator to                    expand her research to the materials area by taking advantage of                French expertise.",
