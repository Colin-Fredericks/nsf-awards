 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an in situ and short traverse seismic                       reflection/refraction and magnetotelluric experiment in West                    Antarctica.  This collaborative experiment involves four awards at              four institutions.  The four-fold purpose is 1) to investigate part             of the Byrd Subglacial Basin, 2) to test techniques for this work               that could be done in a long traverse, 3) to determine the                      viability of the magnetotelluric method on a thick (electrically                resistive) ice sheet, and 4) to evaluate the relative merits of                 refraction with wide reflection versus reflection with narrow                   refraction seismic studies in imaging the lithosphere.  The                     geophysical techniques that will be employed are capable of imaging             the ice sheet, the continental lithosphere, and the upper mantle,               as well as determining physical properties of parts of the                      lithosphere and mantle.  Investigations of outcrop geology over the             last thirty years in West Antarctica and the Transantarctic                     Mountains have lead to recent interpretations that the crust is                 made up of many different lithospheric blocks.  Seismic reflection              work is the only way image the crust in detail and the refraction               work is the only way to determine physical properties of the layers             and blocks defined by the reflection work.  The magnetotelluric                 work is scientifically risky because it may not yield useful                    information when used over the electrically resistive ice sheet.                However, if it works it has the potential to image molten rock in               the crust and upper mantle.  In a continental rift region such as               West Antarctica, the presence of melt in the lithosphere is likely              and, if documented, has very important ramifications to ice sheet               dynamics.  Research work supported by this award is expected to                 provide constraints to models of a range of crustal processes from              models of ice sheet dynamics to tectonic and kinematic models of                lithospheric thinning and rifting.",
