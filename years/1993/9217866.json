 "awd_abstract_narration": "One important property of a system that changes over time, such  as an economy or an ecosystem, is the extent to which its future  behavior can be predicted. This work will develop statistical  methods for quantifying predictability, and apply these methods  to address some open questions in ecology, epidemiology and  macroeconomics.  The result of this work will be an understanding  of how a complex system's dynamics can be divided in two parts: a  part that is a possibly complex function of the previous history  of the system and a random component that is unrelated to the  system's past behavior.  The ability to make predictions depends  on both of these components; moreover, knowing the relative  contributions of the components is necessary for understanding  how the system responds to external shocks.  In the past 20 years there has been much interest in the use of  nonlinear models to explain seemingly unpredictable or random  phenomena.  Most techniques for analyzing data from a nonlinear  dynamic system have been based on large data sets and properties  of deterministic models.  Such methods are not useful for  biological and economic systems that are subject to random  perturbations and observed over a limited amount of time.   Statistical methods will be developed that address these  situations by combining techniques of nonparametric regression  and time series analysis.  These statistical techniques will  enable researchers to reliably estimate the rules governing a  system's evolution over time (law of motion) and the average  response of the system to small perturbations (Lyapunov  exponent).  Also, at a more theoretical level, the properties of  artificial neural networks for approximating systems of many  variables will be studied.  The methods will be applied to  empirical, substantive time series in ecology and epidemiology in  order to quantify the predictability of the systems from past  history and to identify the system's response to exogenous (e.g.  environmental) shocks.   These methods, coupled with general  equilibrium economic models, will provide new evidence for  resolving a longstanding controversy in macroeconomics: Are  extreme fluctuations in financial markets natural phenomena or  are they aberrations requiring government regulation?",
