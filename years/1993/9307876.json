 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project contributes to our understanding of the                             characteristics of important social insurance structures.  It                   continues research on the pricing of alternative health insurance               options, including analysis of whether premiums should be                       different for individuals changing policies and individuals                     continuing with the same policy.  It examines the way retirement                benefits should vary with the age of retirement in a model that                 recognizes individual differences, stochastic employment                        possibilities, and limited observation of work opportunities.  It               studies the way taxes and expenditures should vary with the                     outcome of aggregate risks.                                                                                                                                     The project also continues research on the micro foundations of                 macroeconomies.  It examines the importance of labor market                     tightness and of impediments to labor mobility for the efficiency               of the allocation of labor.  Of special interest will be                        estimates of the loss in efficiency due to the way the existing                 system of health insurance locks workers into existing employers.               Another is the determination of the endogenous distribution of                  ownership of purchasing power and its effect on aggregate                       efficiency.  The CRAY supercomputer will be used to simulate this               extremely complex model.  A third is the effect of different                    forms of money illusion on equilibrium in the housing market.                   This research will be undertaken jointly with a psychologist and                will explore alternative ways of modeling individual decisions on               selling houses that integrate psychological and economic                        concerns.",
