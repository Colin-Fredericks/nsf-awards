New technology will be utilized  to overcome difficulties in effective collaboration caused by physically separate centers of  research within the existing clusters of the Advanced Development Program.  Three specific  activities will be implemented:  1) A telecommunications seminar series will be initiated over  the  recently inaugurated Rural Development Telecommunications Network; 2) All investigators  will be provided access to Internet and instruction in its use so that daily communication between  investigators, between the Project Director and investigators, and between investigators and their  colleagues outside of South Dakota can occur; 3) Investigators will be provided with access to  Uncover2, an information retrieval and document delivery service so that they can have the  research libraries of the country available to them.",
