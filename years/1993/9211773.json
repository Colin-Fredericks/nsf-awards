 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extreme environment of the McMurdo Dry Valleys  will be the                 focus of a Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) project located                 approximately 100 km west of McMurdo Station, Antarctica.  The                  dry valleys are among the most extreme deserts in the world.  The               perennially ice-covered lakes, ephemeral streams, and extensive                 areas of soil within the valleys are subject to low temperatures,               very limited precipitation, and salt accumulation.  The                         biological systems in the valleys are relatively simple, with no                vascular plants or vertebrates and very few insects.  Trophic                   interactions and biogeochemical nutrient cycles are largely                     limited to microbial populations and micro-invertebrates.                       Species diversity and abundance are low as would be predicted for               such extreme environments.  Despite this simplicity, complex                    interactions among species and between the biological and                       physico-chemical environment exist in the lakes, streams and                    soils.  Furthermore, interactions between various components of                 the ecosystem enhance the overall productivity of the dry valley                landscapes.  All ecosystems are shaped to varying degrees by                    climate and material transport, but nowhere is this more apparent               than in the dry valleys.  The obvious effects of an extreme                     environment coupled with the general simplicity of ecosystem                    structure makes the dry valleys an ideal location to study these                basic relationships.  Two central hypotheses will be the focus of               this research:  1) The structure and function of dry valley                     ecosystems are primarily controlled by physical constraints, and                2) The structure and function of dry valley ecosystems are                      modified by material transport.  The dry valley LTER will address               these hypotheses and the five core areas of LTER research                       emphasis through a program of systematic environmental data                     collection, long-term experiments, and model development.                       Efforts will focus on the integration of the biological processes               within and material transport between the lakes, streams and                    terrestrial ecosystems comprising the McMurdo Dry Valley                        landscape.",
