 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chakrabarti         In the past, real-time image processing has been restricted  to low-level tasks such as filtering; the more complex medium and  high-level tasks have been left to general-purpose computers  which are unable to handle the large computation rates of these  tasks.  Real-time computation of these tasks thus necessitates  development of task-specific algorithms and architectures.  This  project is developing efficient algorithms and architectures for  an important and representative medium-level task:  motion  estimation of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional objects.  The  approach reduces the number of computations in motion estimation  by implementing it in the Hough space.  Specifically, the objects  are represented by peaks in the Hough space, and motion  parameters are extracted from shifts of these peaks.  To  facilitate real-time computation of Hough transforms, efficient  algorithms that reduce the size of the Hough transform parameter  space are being developed.  To keep the design costs low, these  algorithms are targeted to customized versions of a \"base\"  architecture:  a highly pipelined linear array of processors,  which has access to an array of memory banks.  Apart from  developing an efficient scheme for real-time motion estimation,  this research will also provide design guidelines for algorithm  and architecture development of other medium- and high-level  image processing tasks.",
