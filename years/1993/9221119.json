 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves the catalytic mechanism of bovine                liver glutamate dehydrogenase.  The timing of bond-making and bond-             breaking processes as well as proton transfers will be determined               for both the forward and reverse reactions catalyzed by the enzyme.             The catalytic reaction coordinate will be correlated with enzyme                conformation changes which are known to alter solvent access to the             active site.  Mechanistic results will be correlated with available             protein three dimensional structural information to arrive at a                 unified description of the catalytic process as a function of time.             %%%                                                                             Enzyme mechanism studies characterize the step by step processes                involving the enzyme, solvent, and substrate(s) which occur during              catalysis.  Developing a self-consistent picture of an enzyme                   mechanism is difficult and laborious, requiring application of                  structural, chemical, as well as kinetic information.  It is the                most difficult and potentially most rewarding study that can be                 undertaken with enzymes, which are in their very essence active and             time-dependent entities.  Knowledge of mechanism allows                         manipulation of the enzyme's catalytic machinery to carry out                   chemistry and permits design of inhibitors of the enzyme which                  often turn out to be potent drugs.",
