 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary biology has always been controversial:  in Darwin's                time, there was the famous debate in Britain between Bishop \"Soapy              Sam\" Wilburforce and Thomas Huxley;  at the turn of the century,                there was the Skopes \"monkey\" trial in the US;  and today, there                have been efforts in, for example, Louisiana to require that                    \"creationism\" be taught alongside the \"theory\" of evolution.  Yet               the most serious attacks on Darwin's theory came not from religion              but from science itself.  In the 19th century, physicists led by                Lord Kelvin argued that the earth was too \"young\" to have allowed               enough time for evolution to have occurred.  With the discovery of              natural radiation, however, the age of the earth was greatly                    increased to several billions of years--old enough for evolution to             occur.  But where physics failed, Mendelian and population genetics             stepped in with a scientific assault on Darwin's principle of                   natural selection.  It wasn't until the late 1930's and 1940's that             evolutionary biology was reconciled with genetics.  The first                   person to propose this synthesis was Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900-               1975) in his Genetics and the Origin of Species, (1937).  With the              collapse of the Soviet Union and the opening of the Russian                     archives to Western scholars, Dr. Mark Adams is undertaking the                 first full-scale study of this founder of modern Western population             genetics.                                                                                                                                                       Dr. Adams is focussing his study of Dobzhansky on the period 1900               to 1937 when \"Dobbie\" published his book launching the evolutionary             biology synthesis.  He is also pursuing the persistent Russian                  dimension of Dobbie's work even after he moved to the United States             (1927).  Dr. Adams aims to clarify the influence of the Kiev school             of cytogenetics on Dobzhansky's chromosomal work (1914-1924); the               views of his Petersburg mentor, Filipchenko, on his approach to                 micro- and macroevolution, and on his social views (1924-27) the                influence of Russian entomological traditions on his approach to                populations, species, and field practice; his gradual assimilation              of the conventions and practices of T. H. Morgan's laboratory when              he came to the United States; the influence of his Russian                      background on the writing of his evolutionary classic; his role in              supporting Russian geneticists and opposing Lysenkoism during the               period 1937-1960; and the abiding influence of his formative                    Russian years in shaping the worldview that informed both his                   research and writings on heredity, society, cosmology, and the                  human conditions, 1960-1974.",
