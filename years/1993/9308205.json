 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308205  Weichman  This proposal concerns the understanding of phase transitions where  quantum mechanics is important. The work is mainly analytical in  nature based mainly upon renormalization group methods. The PI will  consider two types of system: 1) Phase transitions at T=0 driven  entirely by quantum fluctuations. Examples include superfluidity  and superconductivity in disordered systems with special emphasis  on understanding properties of the recently proposed Bose and  vortex glass phase transitions. 2) Phase transitions at T>0 driven  by thermal fluctuations but in which quantum fluctuations still  play a significant role. Examples include phase transitions in 2D  dipolar ferromagnets; superfluidity of 4He in porous media and the  superfluid-normal phase interface of 4He under gravity.  %%%  This work concerns issues in our understanding of phase transitions  at very low temperatures where fluctuations of quantum degrees of  freedom drive the transition - rather than the usual, higher  temperature cases where thermal fluctuations are the important  factors. The work will concentrate on systems of current  experimental interest such as thin film superconductors and helium  superfluidity in porous media and under gravity. This type of work  on phase transitions is state-of-the-art in low temperature  condensed matter theory.  ***",
