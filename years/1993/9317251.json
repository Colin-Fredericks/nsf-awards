By experimentally growing silicon crystals under different conditions, the team will test the accuracy of numerical models developed by Ms. Booker for silicon crystal growth.  As the basis of most electronic devices, silicon based semiconductors are essential to the consumer electronics, telecommunications, and computer industries.  A high quality silicon substrate is crucial for further advancement and refinement of small scale electronic devices.  In order to produce the necessary high quality single silicon crystals, the primary technique for growing these crystals, the Czochralski (CZ) method, must be better understood.  Ms. Booker has developed numerical models to describe the bulk fluid motion in the CZ system and the effect of this motion on the growing crystal, however, the accuracy of this model is verifiable only through the use of experimental data.  By working with Dr. Kakimoto, Ms. Booker will utilize Dr. Kakimoto's technique for directly observing bulk fluid motion in melting silicon and provide numerical simulation to aid in the analysis of the e xperimental results.   An experimentally verified model for the Czochralski crystal growth system will benefit not only the semiconductor industry, but also a wide range of materials development efforts which are based on single crystal growth.",
