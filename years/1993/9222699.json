 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brown mouse lemur, Microcebus rufus, is the world's smallest                living primate, and heretofore virtually nothing is known about its             natural history - it is nocturnal and is restricted to a section of             Madagascar.                                                                                                                                                     This dissertation project is designed to understand the basic                   survival and reproductive strategy of this secretive primate.  It               will involve observations on its reproductive pattern and                       potential, seasonal changes in natural diet, body weight and                    activity patterns, and seasonal patterns of spatial distribution.               Its importance to conservation strategies is very clear, as well as             the door it will open on nocturnal observations of such primates.",
