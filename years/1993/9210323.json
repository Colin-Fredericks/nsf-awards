 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves efforts to incorporate more realistic                     psychological assumptions into formal economics, both at a general              level and in particular economic applications.  The research                    emphasizes two general areas.                                                                                                                                   First, many social scientists have criticized mainstream economics              as too narrowly focused on how people pursue their material self-               interest, ignoring social goals such as fairness.  The project                  involves developing a general game-theoretic model of the fact that             people try to help those who help them and hurt those who hurt                  them.  The model's implications in several economic situations are              considered, and it is shown how consumer concerns over fairness                 will lead a monopolist to lower its price.                                                                                                                      The second area of research is to understand the economic                       implications of \"loss aversion\" and the \"endowment effect.\"  These              notions summarize strong psychological evidence of seemingly                    central features of human preferences: our utility from consumption             is heavily influenced by our status quo, and we tend to weigh                   losses relative to this status quo more heavily than gains.                     Foundations are developed for incorporating such issues, and                    economic applications are pursued.  The main application under                  development is consumer dynamic savings-versus-consumption                      decisions, investigating whether consumers tend to resist lowering              their consumption in response to bad news about future income.                                                                                                  This research brings more realism to economic models by                         incorporating well-established psychological findings.  It takes a              significant step toward building a useful and descriptive theory to             enhance our understanding of human behavior.",
