 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Robert B. Gennis and a graduate                   student of the University of Illinois to collaborate in biochemistry            research with Professor Marten Wikstrom and his research group at               the Department of Medicinal Chemistry of the University of Helsinki,            Finland.  The primary objective of their research is to characterize            the structural and functional details of the predominant membrane-              bound enzyme in Escherichia coli which catalyzes the oxidation of               ubiquinol and the reduction of molecular oxygen to water.  This                 electron transfer reaction is coupled to the net translocation of               protons across the cell membrane.  The research plan involves a                 synergistic combination of molecular genetics expertise in the U.S.             group and biophysical and spectroscopic expertise in the group in               Finland.                                                                                                                                                        The type of oxidases being studied by these scientists are a major              family of enzymes directly involved in biological energy                        transduction.  The proposed research should provide the experimental            basis for understanding the architecture of these enzymes and the               molecular basis of proton translocation.",
