It also improves  the instruction of transducer principles and their extension to  system applications. By providing students with an  instrumentation workstation that functions with numerous built-  in transducers in conjunction with data-acquisition hardware  and advanced engineering software, basic instrumentation  principles are demonstrated. Specifically, this project allows  students:     *  to acquire data from transducers in an automated fashion;     *  to use their acquired data for further mathematical                 analysis;     *  to use their acquired data as a stimulus for theoretical            system model evaluations; and     *  to use their acquired data to support real-time process             control experiments.  Providing computer-based simulation tools for the evaluation of  systems that are too complex to construct in the laboratory, or  too expensive and time-intensive to implement in practice,   allows students to expand their knowledge of basic course  principles to those examples that encompass complex systems  encountered in the workplace.  ***y",
