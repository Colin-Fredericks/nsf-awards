 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance undergraduate laboratory                          experiences for students at the University of New England by                    incorporating fluorescence spectroscopy into several courses                    and research experiences offered for Chemistry, Biology, Marine                 Biology and Environmental Science students within the Division                  of Life Sciences. The analytical applications of fluorescence                   are growing dramatically because of its sensitivity and                         applicability to problems of environmental and clinical                         importance and will be exploited in Quantitative Analysis,                      Instrumental Methods, Biochemistry/Cell Biology and Marine                      Biology/Oceanography laboratories. Examples of analyses to be                   performed include the determination of pharmaceutical                           components, pollutants in natural waters, chlorophyll in plant                  materials and fluorescent markers for monitoring phytoplankton                  and water mass migration. The technique's increasing use in                     Biochemistry and Cell Biology will be illustrated in, among                     other applications, probing intracellular ion transport                         mechanisms. More fundamental applications will be introduced in                 General Chemistry and explored in detail in Instrumental                        Methods and Physical Chemistry. Fluorescence immunoassay will                   become a component of the Immunology lab. Fluorescence will                     also be used extensively for undergraduate research. The                        multidisciplinary use of the proposed instrument will foster                    increased cooperative interactions between Chemistry and                        Biology faculty and impress upon students the increasingly                      interdisciplinary nature of modern science. The instruments                     will also be used by University of Southern Maine students in                   Instrumental Methods and Physical Chemistry courses.",
