 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator is proposing theoretical studies                into some aspects of the dynamics of galaxies.  One objective of                this research is to build self-consistent equilibrium stellar                   dynamic models of elliptical galaxies, with special emphasis on                 galaxies in which orbits of more than one basic family are                      present.  For self-consistency, the different orbits that are                   dynamically possible must be populated in such a way that the                   resulting gravitational field is exactly that needed to hold the                galaxy together.  The second aim of the work is to understand the               kinematic properties of the stellar dynamic models, and to relate               them to observations.  Projections of the kinematic properties of               real galaxies  on the plane of the sky can be observed, and                     provide only indirect  information from which to determine the                  true intrinsic motions.  A third aim of the work is to study the                oscillations and stability of disk-like galaxies.                                    A typical galaxy is composed of hundreds of billions of                    stars, each of which moves on its own individual orbit according                to well-known physical laws of dynamics.   Galaxies are also                    interesting examples of complex systems, whose behavior comes                   from the combined effects of much simpler components.  This                     project aims to build mathematical models that incorporate the                  basic characteristics of real galaxies, matching observations as                far as possible, which is not simple because only flat pictures                 of the truly three-dimensional galaxies are ever observed.  The                 work will use a combination of both mathematical analysis and                   computation to elucidate the present day dynamical structure of                 galaxies, which should contain significant information about                    their past history, including that of their formation.",
