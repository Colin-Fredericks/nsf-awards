 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224963  Cooper  This is the first year of a three-year continuing award. Accurate,  low-computational-cost recognition of 3D objects having highly-  variable curved surfaces, or of the membership class of an object,  or of a deformable object, have been among the research topics most  resistant to satisfactory solution, and yet are necessary if  reasonably general practical machine vision is to become a reality.   This research explores solutions to these problems based on the  unified use of patches of 3D surfaces and space curves modeled by  high-degree implicit polynomials, algebraic invariants, probability  distributions on the coefficient vectors for the polynomials, and  asymptotic minimum probability of error (i.e., Bayesian)  recognizers.  The implicit polynomial curves and surfaces are  generalizations of quadrics, and have much greater representation  power than do quadrics or superquadrics. The algebraic invariants  are functions of the polynomial coefficients having values that do  not change when the data is translated, rotated or scaled  differently in two different directions (i.e., an affine  transformation).  Among the intended applications are service  robots that must recognize and handle materials and parts, service  robots or machine vision systems that must interact with people,  and parts inspection for manufacturing automation.  The techniques  to be used have received very little attention in the research  literature, but now are the subject of growing interest.",
