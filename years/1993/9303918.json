 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Prof. James Weisshaar of the University of                  Wisconsin at Madison will conduct a broad program of                            fundamental measurements on the reactivities and electronic                     structures of metal-hydrocarbon molecules as function of                        temperature, pressure, and the electronic state of the neutral                  reactant molecule.  Specifically, research will be pursued in                   three areas: 1) a survey of the chemical kinetics involving                     neutral transition metal atoms, 2) a study of the absorption                    and desorption of small molecules on, or from, size specific                    clusters of transition metal atoms by means of time-resolved                    bimolecular collisions, and 3) application of the new technique                 of mass-analyzed threshold ionization to obtain mass-specific                   spectra for small aggregates of metal atoms and clusters formed                 by metal atoms and organic molecules.                                           %%%                                                                             Saturated hydrocarbon molecules, such as, for example, methane                  and ethane, are abundant sources of carbon, but they are rather                 inert.  Their chemical reactivities can, however, be                            significantly enhanced under low energy conditions by catalysts                 of transition-metal atoms such as nickel, platinum, rhodium,                    and others.  The physical chemistry of this activation process                  is not well understood and this research is devoted to improve                  our knowledge of the interactions between metal atoms and                       hydrocarbon molecules.  This will be done by conducting the                     experiments under controlled conditions in the gas phase, in                    which the perturbing effects of possible solvents are absent.                   This research is of an interdisciplinary nature and its results                 will affect our understanding of solution-phase organo-metallic                 chemistry, heterogeneous catalysis, and surface chemistry.                      Furthermore, the data obtained in these investigations will be                  of use in the development of theoretical models and techniques                  for the calculation of interaction potentials between metal                     atoms and hydrocarbon molecules.",
