 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307001  Wesler    With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Kit Wesler  will develop a curation plan for the archaeological materials  housed at the Wickliffe Mounds Research Center. These consist of an  artifact collection which includes more than 85,000 ceramics,  animal remains and lithics. More than 90% of the specimens bear  legible provenience labels and result from gridded archaeological  excavations. Although the collection is now available for research,  additional curation is necessary. Materials need to be properly  boxed and data entered into a computerized system. MS. Katherine  Singley, a conservation expert will visit the Center and provide  needed advice on which a longer term project can be based.    The Wickliffe Mounds site is a Mississippi period town-and-mound  complex located on the bluffs of the Mississippi River in Ballard  County Kentucky. It spans the period from ca. 1100 to 1400 AD and  documents the fluorescence of the Mississippi cultures. Although  they did not reach a state level of organization, in pre-Columbian  times such groups integrated large numbers of individuals,  maintained trade networks which spanned large portions of the  midwest and undertook large scale constructions. Archaeologists  wish to know how such societies which lacked both writing and  wheeled vehicles developed and were maintained. Data from sites  such as Wickliffe therefore are of great interest. However for such  material to be maximally useful, it must be properly curated and  catalogued. This project will help to Dr. Wesler to proceed in this  direction.",
