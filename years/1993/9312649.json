 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312649  Dietz         Under this project, previously developed research tools for  computer architecture performance analysis and for assembler,  compiler, and translator construction will be adapted and augmented  to create the foundation for an experimental approach to integrated  system design at the undergraduate level. The emphasis will be on  making the tools powerful and easy-to-use, providing software  support, and developing tool-based modular experiments tied to  specific concepts in computer system design. These experiments will  enhance traditional courses, especially those involving computer  architecture and compilers. At the lowest level, the tools will  facilitate experimentation with simple concepts in architecture  design and system software construction. At the highest level, they  will support experiments that allow students to examine design  tradeoffs in complete systems, where the interaction of  architecture and system software is varied and evaluated. This new  and innovative educational material will be utilized in a new  Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree program and  also, as appropriate, in the Computer Science program at Purdue.          The dissemination plan makes heavy use of electronic  distribution. Videotapes and teleconferences, produced using  Purdue's Continuing Engineering Education facilities, will provide  \"electronic instructors' manuals\" to help other schools adopt the  tools and experiments.  ***",
