 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Mark A. Ratner is supported by a grant from the                       Chemistry Division and the Graduate Education and Research                      Division at NSF for a Graduate Traineeship Program emphasizing                  the chemical aspects of molecule-based electronics.  A team of                  six Northwestern University chemistry faculty members with                      teaching and research expertise in this and related areas will                  be assembled to provide graduate training and mentoring as well                 as research program direction in this area.  To ensure the                      program leads to a net expansion of training within the                         chemistry department, an aggressive recruitment plan                            emphasizing minority and female students will be devised.  Once                 recruited, the trainees will take part in a rigorous program                    designed to provide: 1) courses pertinent to the central themes                 of molecule-based electronics; 2) exposure to and interaction                   with leading academic and industrial researchers from outside                   Northwestern University; 3) research training within the                        laboratories of Northwestern University faculty; and 4)                         experience in team-oriented, interdisciplinary problem solving                  via collaborative research interactions.                                        %%%                                                                             Molecule-based electronics is the use of molecular materials                    for electronic or photonic applications.  The scope of this                     field ranges from well-defined and well-understood phenomena                    such as nonlinear optical response of a single crystal of an                    organic chromophore to the more tantalizing and conceptually                    more difficult areas involving optical computing and optical                    memory storage systems at the molecular level. This                             interdisciplinary field encompasses not only chemistry, but                     also physics, engineering and materials science.  With the                      emergence of the first commercial molecular electronic                          technologies, the need for U.S. trained Ph.D. level scientists                  has become self-evident.  Funding provided through this                         Graduate Research Traineeship award will help to provide                        scientists in this area of national need.",
