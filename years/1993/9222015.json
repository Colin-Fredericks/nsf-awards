 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foraging honey bees learn the locations of dozens of flower                     patches within a 10-kilometer radius of their nest, and perform a               series of body movements referred to as a \"dance language\" to                   communicate to nestmates the locations of these sites.  Memory of               landmarks, and of the relationship between the landscape and the                sun's course, plays a prominent role in these behavioral feats.                                                                                                 Dr. Dyer's previous studies have clarified what bees learn about                the relationships among landmarks seen in different parts of                    their foraging range, and about the course of the sun relative to               the landscape.  The present project will further investigate the                contents of spatial memory in experienced honey bees, and will                  also attempt to uncover the processes whereby naive bees acquire                information about important spatial relationships in the                        environment.                                                                                                                                                    Honey bees are extremely attractive subjects for such studies                   because their behavior poses some intriguing problems, given the                enormous scale and flexibility of the bees' movements and the                   small size of their brain.  At the same time, the behavior is                   highly amenable to experimental exploration of the underlying                   processes.  To the extent that many other animals face                          navigational problems parallel to those faced by honey bees,                    these studies can contribute to the development of general                      theories about how nervous systems may be equipped to make use of               inevitably limited processing capacity.",
