 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stuart A. Rice is supported by a grant from the                       Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                 studies involving liquid-liquid, and liquid-vapor interfaces.                   Rice will use a combination of theory and experiment to perform                 studies of: 1) the molecular packing and properties of several                  phases of liquid supported monolayers; 2) the influence of a                    monolayer on the structure of the adjacent region of the                        supporting liquid; 3) the influence of the monolayer on the                     distribution of solutes in the adjacent region of the                           supporting liquid; and 4) the structural consequences of                        segregation of the components in a liquid-vapor interface of a                  metallic mixture.  Experimental studies will involve the use of                 grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform                       infrared spectroscopy.  Simulations will involve the use of                     Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques as well as                        Car-Parinello theory.                                                           %%%                                                                             Very little is known about the sturcture of the interface                       between two immiscible phases.  Many chemical and biological                    phenomena depend on the nature of this interface.  For example,                 the interface between long chain amphiphiles and water is a                     model for biological membranes which occur in the cell wall.                    Professor Rice is using a combination of theoretical and                        experimental methods which have only recently become available                  to explore the detailed structure of these phase boundaries and                 the factors which influence this structure.",
