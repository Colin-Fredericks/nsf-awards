The program's                                    awards provide opportunities for joint                                          research, and the use of unique or                                              complementary facilities, expertise and                                         experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Susan Mini                                   to the Universite Paris-Sud to work with Dr.                                    Alain Fontaine.                                                                                                                                                 The aim of their research will be to study the                                  magnetic properties of metallic multilayers                                     using magnetic circular x-ray dichroism                                         spectroscopy (MCXD).  The importance of this                                    new spectroscopic technique is that each atomic                                 species can be probed selectively.  MCXD is a                                   high energy spectroscopic method which has been                                 used for the study of localized and itinerant                                   magnetism in ordered magnetic systems.  It is a                                 powerful tool for the study of the local                                        magnetic properties because it takes advantage                                  of the selectivity of x-ray absorption                                          spectroscopy and the polarization properties of                                 synchrotron radiation.  Because it can                                          selectively probe each core orbital of each                                     atomic species in a material, the magnetic                                      contribution of each species in a multilayer                                    may be deduced.  Multilayers of interest                                        include Fe/Pd systems because the Fe-Pd(l00)                                    interface appears to experience minimal mixing                                  and unlike many other systems the Fe appears to                                 induce a magnet moment in the interfacial Pd                                    atomic layer \u0131C.Liu et al., J.Appl. Phys 67,                                    5758 '90!.  Since MCXD is element specific, the                                 magnetic moment contributions of the Fe and Pd                                  may be observed separately.  MCXD can be used                                   to address specific problems concerning the                                     magnetism of multilayer interfaces.
