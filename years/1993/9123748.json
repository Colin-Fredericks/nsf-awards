 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mothers of almost all nonaquatic, nonhuman mammalian species                    ingest amniotic fluid and placenta during delivery.  Dr. Kristal                has demonstrated that the increased contact, associated with this               ingestion from the surface of the young, causes an accelerated                  onset of maternal behavior toward those young.  Moreover, he has                shown that this enigmatic behavior helps to relieve the mother's                pain and discomfort during delivery.  A substance contained in                  the afterbirth materials, which he has named the Placental                      Opioid-Enhancing Factor or POEF, seems to potentiate any ongoing                opioid-mediated analgesia but does not by itself produce                        analgesia.  The importance of this factor is that during labor                  and delivery, pregnancy-mediated analgesia can be maximized                     without so massive a release of endogenous opiates.  Thus, it is                possible to relieve pain with only a minimum brain opioid level.                This is very important since too high a level of natural                        occurring opioids during and immediately after birth can                        detrimentally interfere with maternal behavior.  A major problem                that has prevented a thorough understanding of this fundamental                 behavior is the inability to prevent delivering mothers from                    ingesting any placenta or amniotic fluid without stressing the                  mother, disrupting delivery, or blocking the mother's natural                   behaviors.  Dr. Kristal has overcome this obstacle by a clever                  series of experiments in which activated charcoal administration                is used to block the utilization of subsequently ingested POEF.                 He can now determine its effects on pain threshold, maternal and                other behaviors, as well as natural characteristics of delivery                 and fertility.  These findings will enhance our knowledge of the                physiological mechanisms of birth and postpartum behavior.                      Moreover, the research has importance for a broader range of                    mammalian taxa, since it could point the way toward the                         development of a new class of non-narcotic analgesics and shed                  new light on fundamental processes involved in pain and the                     body's reaction to it.",
