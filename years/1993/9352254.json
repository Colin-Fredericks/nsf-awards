This program  complements our  existing physical chemistry laboratory course which emphasizes  gas phase and condensed phase topics.  To incorporate the new  material, we are expanding the physical chemistry laboratory  from two quarters to three.  Five experiments are being  developed.  Students are performing three experiments on a UHV  surface apparatus: elemental analysis of surface composition by  Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), surface structure studies  using Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), and desorption  kinetics measurements of chemisorbed molecules by Temperature  Programmed Desorption (TPD).  In a fourth experiment, surface  structure is being studied in a complementary approach with a  scanning tunneling microscope (STM) in air; the emphasis is on  surface electronic states.  Finally, transmission FT-IR  spectroscopy is being used to examine structure of adsorbates  on supported metal particles.  The institution has already  purchased a vacuum chamber, LEED optics, and sample  manipulator, and made available vacuum pumps for the UHV  instrument.  This apparatus is being completed by including  sample mounting and introduction hardware, electronics, and  residual gas analyzer for TPD.  An instructional STM is being  used in the surface imaging experiment.  Finally, we are  upgrading an existing FTIR spectrometer for the adsorbate  spectroscopy experiment.    ***",
