 "awd_abstract_narration": "New techniques for digital X-ray imaging have been under                        investigation for decades.  Some of the most promising techniques               incorporate solid-state X-ray detectors, which are attractive                   because of their compactness.  High-Z semiconductor X-ray                       detectors have further advantages due to their high stopping                    power.  One of the drawbacks of high-Z semiconductor detectors                  was the cost of producing large-area arrays.  The usual approach                was to assemble an array of isolated, individually-fabricated                   detector elements.  A competing technology is to enhance large                  area arrays of amorphous silicon (a-Si) photodiodes by coating                  them with a film of high-Z scintillating material (e.g. CsI) by                 evaporation.  While this technique is more effective in stopping                X-rays than using \"naked\" silicon photodiodes, the poor                         conversion efficiency of scintillators limits the signal                        amplitude.                                                                                                                                                      We propose producing sublimed films of a new, high-Z                            semiconductor (thallium bromide), and to characterize their                     utility as pixilated detectors for X-ray image detection.  We                   have made measurements of sublimed TlBr films produced in our                   laboratories and have noted that these detectors maintain                       surprisingly good charge carrier transport properties in spite of               their poor crystallinity.  We propose that these films will be                  read out by depositing them on an amorphous silicon thin-film                   transistor array.  These detectors would yield a larger signal                  than the scintillator-enhanced detectors, due to their high                     conversion efficiency while maintaining high X-ray stopping                     power.",
