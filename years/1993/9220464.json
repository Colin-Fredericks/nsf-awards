 "awd_abstract_narration": "When solutes and water are transported across epithelial tissues                such as the intestine, they may take one of two pathways: through               cells and/or between cells. To this date transport through cells                has been studied in enormous detail. Our good understanding of                  transcellular transport and its regulation has helped us                        appreciate the mechanisms of animal adaptation to fresh- and                    saltwater, it has led to  the discovery of the molecular defect                 in cystic fibrosis, and it has aided the development of new drugs               (diuretics). The mechanisms of transport between cells are just                 now beginning to receive attention. A major advance in this                     direction was made during the previous NSF award period in the                  laboratory of the PI: the first demonstration that an                           extracellular peptide (leucoknin, a neurohormone) regulates a                   transport pathway outside the cell. Whether this pathway is                     between cells, the so-called paracellular pathway, is the first                 and most important objective of the continuation of this work.                  The second objective is the detailed examination of the ion pump                located in the cell membrane facing the urine side of the kidney.               The third objective is to discover new hormones involved in the                 regulation of transport. This work is done in isolated kidneys of               insects, the so-called Malpighian tubules of the yellow fever                   mosquito.",
