 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates application of theoretical tools to   analyze fundamental issues in machine learning, in planning from incomplete   information, and in  approximation algorithms.  In the area of machine learning,   one  direction is to provide new algorithmic techniques for fast learning when   there is much information available about objects  but only a small amount   is truly relevant.  These techniques are potentially useful both for speeding   up learning and for automating the process of selecting what information   is given to a learning algorithm.  Also new algorithms for learning using    neural networks are investigated, especially in the difficult case of high   dimensional input spaces.  Other fundamental research issues examined   include relationships between learning and cryptography, and various ways   a learner can usefully employ more active approaches.  In the domain of   on-line planning past work has been on strategies for traveling without a map   in scenes with simple types of obstacles, whose performance can be guaranteed   to be not too much worse than the best possible, if one had a map of the region.    This is expanded to more varied situations,  including those where some   kinds of partial maps are available.  One interesting case is where partial   maps are created by previous explorations.  Here one can combine ideas of    on-line planning and learning.",
