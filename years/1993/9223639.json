 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of                  Laser Diagnostics in Combustion has been held biennially since                  1981.  The 1993 meeting will be held in July, 1993 at Plymouth                  State College in New Hampshire.  The purpose of this                            conference is to examine closely and discuss freely the                         chemical and physical foundations of the various laser                          diagnostic techniques including such issues as quenching,                       energy transfer, quantitative species concentration                             measurements, line spacings, line widths, and convolutions.                     New themes of the 1993 conference will include laser                            diagnostics of resonant wave-mixing techniques, the                             interaction between the modeling of chemical flame structure                    and laser diagnostics, and the metrology of particle                            diagnostics.  The emphasis of the conference is directed                        toward the science of the measurement processes.  The invited                   speakers and discussion leaders include researchers                             specializing in the development and application of laser                        diagnostics in combustion as well as investigators from basic                   areas not directly involved in laser diagnostics.                                                                                                               The major products of this conference will be the exchange of                   information between researchers on the cutting edge of this                     technology area, hopefully leading to synergism which will                      result in further advances, and a final report which will                       summarize the activities of the conference.",
