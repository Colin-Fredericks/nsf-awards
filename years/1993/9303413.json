 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project develops new methods involving                       completely integrable differential equations (of the Painleve                   type), operator theory and asymptotic analysis to study the level               spacing distributions for various random matrix ensembles.  The                 level spacing distribution for various orthogonal polynomial                    ensembles can be expressed in terms of a Fredholm determinant.                  The methods of the PI and his collaborator Harold Widom show that               this determinant is also a tau-function.  In the general problem                that will be analyzed the tau function has two distinct types of                variables. There are the ``KP type variables'' which describe a                 KP flow on the Sato Grassmannian and there are the ``deformation                type variables.''  It is the combination and interplay between                  these two types of variables that give the general tau-function.                Particular examples of this general tau function are important in               disordered conductors, numerical analysis associated with the                   condition number of a matrix, in addition to the standard                       applications of random matrix ensembles to the analysis of                      eigenvalue statistics.  The methods developed in this program                   will give detailed and explicit formulas for these important                    cases.                                                                          %%%                                                                                  Complex systems that arise in nuclear physics, atomic and                  molecular physics, condensed matter physics dealing with media                  with impurities require a type of mathematics that gives results                for averaged quantities, since on the macroscopic everyday world                the variables that are controlled in various experiments (like                  concentration of an impurity, the energy of the system) do not                  completely specify the microscopic system.  Therefore one                       develops statistical methods that predict average behavior or                   give the probabilities of deviation from this average behavior.                 The subject of random matrices is one such statistical theory                   that has been successfully applied to the above problems in                     physics along with a host of more theoretical problems in                       mathematics and practical problems in numerical analysis.  This                 research project develops new methods using the tools of                        differential equations to study these statistical theories.",
