 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Electrical and Computer Engineering Technology (ECET)                       department of the Southern College of Technology is developing                  a Local Area Network (LAN) laboratory to support a new Local                    Area Networks course. Southern Tech realizes the impact                         networking has on the world today and is striving to educate                    and prepare undergraduates for work in this growing                             communications era. With the help of a grant from the National                  Science Foundation, the ECET LAN laboratory is giving students                  hands-on experience with state of the art communications                        equipment. The lab consists of (1) various network                              configurations, e.g. Ethernet and Token Ring with Novell and                    IBM network operating systems, (2) a variety of transmission                    media, e.g., coax, twisted pair, and fiber optic cabling, (3)                   network analysis tools that have the ability to monitor                         signals, examine protocols and simulate network traffic, (4) a                  LAN simulation package used to analyze designed networks and                    optimize performance, and (5) a gateway to X.25, the long haul                  environment, with access to DSO up to T3 lines. The students                    are designing, installing, and testing various LAN                              configurations and preparing to configure a company-wide local                  area network. This hands on education gained in the laboratory                  is preparing Southern Tech Electrical and Computer Engineering                  Technology graduates to contribute immediately to today's                       communications industry.",
