 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to interconnect multichip modules using vertical-                    cavity surface-emitting lasers VCSELs as optoelectronic                         interconnects and to design a microelectronic information                       processing system (MIPS). Our emphasis is on:  (1) physically                   realizable computing systems and methods for their design, and                  (2) corresponding hardware such as :  optoelectronic                            devices/components, integrated optics, optical switching devices                and optical interconnections.  The goals of this program are                    to(1) demonstrate the interconnection of vertically stacked                     planes using electrically addressed VCSELs, microoptics, and                    detectors; (2) using these results design a 3D MIPS comprising                  optoelectronically interconnected multichip modules (MCMs); and                 (3) develop a phase II follow-up proposal to construct a                        prototype MIPS to prove the feasibility of near tera                            operation/sec (e.g. teraflop/sec) performance.  Numerous schemes                for the interconnection of MCMs or wafers have been proposed and                are under development.  The first approach, pioneered by Hughes,                attempts to interconnect several vertically stacked wafers with                 metallic air-bridge interconnects.  However, recently the advent                of optoelectronic components has revealed a much more promising                 and powerful alternative to all-electronic interconnects known as               optoelectronic interconnects.  Our revolutionary VCSEL approach                 to optoelectronic interconnection of MCMs is unrivaled (by e.g.                 optical modulators) for speed, functionality, integrability and                 manufacturability.  Implementation of the proposed program goals                will also further the emergence of the globally enabling VCSEL                  technology which is projected by U.S., European and Pacific Rim                 groups to have numerous commercial applications.",
