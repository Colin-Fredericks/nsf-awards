Using a suspension culture of Arabidopsis cells expressing  the PHB biosynthetic pathway, the flux of acetyl-CoA towards  lipids, sterols, and PHB, will be measured.  Manipulation of the  growth media by the addition of various carbon sources (eg acetate  and citrate), as well as inhibitors of lipid and sterol  biosynthesis, will be used to manipulate the flux of acetyl-CoA  towards the various sinks and to increase PHB production.   Furthermore, the influence of the addition of the bacterial 3-  ketothiolase on the production of PHB in transgenic plants will be  examined.  A major effort will be directed towards targeting the  enzymes of the PHB biosynthetic pathway into the plastids.  The  rationale is that higher amounts of PHB and minimal disruption of  plant growth may be accomplished by diverting the high flux of  acetyl-CoA away from seed storage lipid synthesis towards PHB  synthesis.  The bacterial PHB biosynthetic genes will be modified  to introduce a plastid targeting sequence and to direct their  expression under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35s and a  seed specific promoter.  Each of the three PHB genes will be  introduced separately into tobacco and Arabidopsis.  The efficiency  of protein targeting and signal sequences cleavage, as well as the  activity of the bacterial enzymes in  the plastid, will be  determined.  Cross-pollination between the various transgenic lines  will produce hybrids containing all genes required for PHB  synthesis in the plastid.  PHB production in different tissues of  the hybrid transgenic plants will be measured.  Finally, the  influence of a reduction in starch biosynthesis on the production  of PHB in the plastid will be examined by backcrossing in  Arabidopsis transg enics to the starches mutants.  A secondary goal  is to purify sufficient amounts of plant PHB granules for the  initial analysis of their physical and chemical properties, in  comparison to the properties of bacterial PHB.  This will be  accomplished using the suspension culture of transgenic Arabidopsis  cells grown under conditions maximizing PHB production, as  determined by the experiments on the manipulation of the flux of  acetyl-CoA into various sinks.  %%%  A significant breakthrough in the production of biodegradable  plastic in plants has been accomplished from previous work.  The  continuation of this work involves increasing the amount of plastic  production per plant.  Instead of a slow selection method which  would take many generations of plants, molecular biology and  metabolic inhibitors will be tried to divert the biosynthetic  apparatus of the plant toward the synthesis of plastic.  It is  important that the major amount of the energy of the plant be used  for growth; the biosynthetic enzymes for the plastic will be  directed into a specific compartment in the cell.  By introducing  a bacterial enzyme responsible for this component into the plant it  is hoped that greater amounts of the plastic end product will  result.  These studies if successful will pioneer the efforts to  produce useful biomaterials in plants.  ***",
