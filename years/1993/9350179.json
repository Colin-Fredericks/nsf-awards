 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between speech and gesture in narrative discourse              will be investigated by animating the interaction between the two               media on a three-dimensional interactive animated model -- a                    graphic figure on a computer screen that would ultimately be able               to \"communicate\" with a listener, gesturing appropriately while                 producing speech.                                                                                                                                               Research demonstrates that gesture is intimately linked to speech               both in the production and the comprehension of narrative                       discourse.  This interaction exists at many different levels of                 organization.  The relationship between speech and gesture can be               specified at the level of the timing of gestures with respect to                the prosodic contour of a clause.  It can be specified at the level             of semantic and pragmatic descriptions of an utterance, and at the              level of narrative structure with respect to the types of gestures              found at different points in a narrative.                                                                                                                       Interactive activities at the host institution include:  meetings               once every two weeks, open to graduate students and junior faculty,             to discuss particular problems in accomplishing work and                        constructing a supportive environment for achieving professional                goals; hour-long meetings the alternate weeks of the month with                 undergraduate students, to discuss similar topics; sponsorship of               two visiting cognitive scientists per semester, where these will be             women who have made 'non-standard' career choices and/or have                   written about professional issues facing women in academia; co-                 teaching a seminar in Computational Linguistics with Ellen Prince               on discourse processing and gesture.  All of the parts will be                  carried out under the aegis of the Computer Science Department, but             will be open to other members of the Cognitive Science community at             the University of Pennsylvania.                                                                                                                                 This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
