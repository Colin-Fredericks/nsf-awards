 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Gardening Association will be offering a                           four-year program of professional development for elementary                    teachers interested in inquiry-centered teaching using                          plants in the classroom.  This program will provide                             three-week summer workshops and follow-up support to                            leadership teams of teachers, school administrators, and                        community partners from 16 urban sites.  These teams will                       become experts in the use of GrowLab, an instructional                          program developed with NSF support by the National Gardening                    Association, and Fast Plants, another NSF-supported                             instructional program, developed at the University of                           Wisconsin.  Private businesses and informal learning centers                    such as botanical gardens and horticultural clubs will                          provide content support to teachers.  The teams of                              participating teachers will offer professional development                      opportunities to other teachers in their region, and act as                     advocates for inquiry-centered teaching in elementary                           classrooms.  More than 360 teachers, administrators, and                        community partners will be reached directly or indirectly by                    this program of leadership development.  A national network                     and newsletter will also disseminate news of this project.                                                                                                      Cost sharing represents 50% of the NSF contribution.",
