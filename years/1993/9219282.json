 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus upon the molecular and genetic analysis of              Pl-Bh, a gene which controls the synthesis of purple anthocyanin                pigments in the maize plant. Preliminary analysis indicates that at             the nucleotide level, this gene is nearly identical to the wild-                type Pl gene but, unlike that gene, is heavily methylated. The                  planned experiments will test the hypothesis that methylation of                the Pl-Bh DNA is responsible for the variegated pattern of                      expression or the altered tissue-specificity of this allele or                  both. The methylation status will be determined using genomic                   sequencing methods and will be correlated with the level of gene                expression in lightly pigmented and darkly pigmented cells from                 plant and kernel tissues. Possible alterations in chromatin                     configuration and/or protein-DNA contacts will be analyzed by DNase             footprinting. Both the wild-type and mutant genes will be                       introduced into various tissues by microprojectile bombardment and              their expression correlated with phenotypic differences. We will                look for genetic modifiers of the mutant allele and it will be                  determined if the modification is a result of alterations in the                methylation pattern of the Pl-Bh allele.                                        %%%                                                                             DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene               expression in many eukaryotes, usually by silencing gene                        expression. In only a few cases has it been shown to influence the              tissue-specificity of expression. The results of these experiments              should serve to enhance our understanding of this and other                     epigenetic mechanisms which modulate plant gene expression.                     $$$",
