 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353753  Chandrasekhar    This proposal is requesting second year funding to further develop and expand an experiment-  based, hands-on program which is introducing girls in the 4th, 5th and 6th grades to the physical  sciences, through a collaboration between a university physics professor and the science  coordinator of the local schools.  The topic areas selected are:  Optics, Sound, Electricity,  Magnetism and Mechanics.  For each a series of modules will be developed.  Individual modules  will develop a concept (e.g., the reflection of light) through a series of logically sequential  games, simple experiment, building of gadgets, toys, art projects and finally, laboratory  experiments using simple scientific equipment, and \"gee whiz\" exploratorium-style exhibits.  By  introducing the girls to a number of different ways of observing and using the same concept, we  will allow them to see how a simple concept is developed on a logical basis to understand  complex scientific phenomena.  The objective is to motivate the girls by conveying that science  is fun, but more importantly, by familiarizing them with simple scientific equipment, by  developing their building and experimenting skills, as well as their capabilities of logical  reasoning.    The program is set up in the initial years as an extra-curricular effort.  There will be sessions  twice a week for four weeks.  The Optics modules were tested in two of the eighteen school in  the Columbia Public School District in the first year.  In the second year, we will concentrate  on two major areas of enhancement.  We will develop modules on two more subjects  (Mechanics, and Electricity and Magnetism), and we will conduct workshops to train about 30  teachers.  The program will be implemented at eight to twelve schools in the second year.  We  anticipate that the material developed will be integrated by elementary school teachers into the  regular curriculum in coming years.  ***",
