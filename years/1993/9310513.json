 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Michael Rosenberg and              his colleagues will conduct archaeological excavation at the site               of Hallan Cemi which is located in the Zagros mountain region of                Southeastern Turkey. The site itself consists of a low mound which              covers approximately .7 hectares and previous work by Dr. Rosenberg             has shown that it covers the time period from approximately 10,600              to 10.000 years before the present. Dr. Rosenberg will conduct two              seasons of work in which he will open broad areas and through                   controlled stratigraphic excavation recover large amounts of faunal             and floral remains as well as a broad range of material objects                 such as stone tools. These will be analyzed by a team of                        specialists in order to reconstruct subsistence and social patterns             and to set the site into a broader regional context.                                                                                                            Given the date of Hallan Cemi and the materials collected to date,              it is apparent that this site documents a very early phase of the               Neolithic Revolution. The term \"Revolution\" is an appropriate one               because it marks perhaps the most significant shift in lifestyle                over the ca. 2,000,000 years of human existence. In the Neolithic               plants and animals were domesticated, settled village life emerged              and a technological explosion which included the development of                 ceramic technology and metallurgy occurred. It is ironic, given                 great archaeological interest in this question that so little is                known about the Zagros region since it is both known to contain                 very early Neolithic sites and has been postulated as a possible                point of origin. The work to date by Dr. Rosenberg has demonstrated             that Hallan Cemi represents an early stage in this process. While               it contains domestic plants and animals, ceramics, another hallmark             of the Neolithic are lacking. The large faunal and floral samples               which will be collected will shed new light on the subsistence                  change.                                                                                                                                                         This research is important for several reasons. Within two years                this entire region will be flooded by a newly constructed dam and               if work is now done now a unique opportunity will be irrevocably                lost. The information which Dr. Rosenberg collects will increase                our understanding of perhaps the most important transformation in               human history.",
