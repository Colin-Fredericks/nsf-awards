 "awd_abstract_narration": "The alpha-2-macroglobulins are plasma proteins that are present in              all classes of vertebrates and that function as broad-spectrum                  protease inhibitors.  The proposed research will investigate the                structure and function of a form of alpha-2-macroglobulin from the              horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus.  This laboratory has obtained               extensive peptide sequence information and antisera to Limulus                  alpha-2-macroglobulin which will be used to isolate and sequence                the full length cDNA from a CDNA library developed to the poly (A)+             RNA of the Limulus amebocyte.  In contrast to vertebrates, which                possess a large number of plasma protease inhibitors, alpha-2-                  macroglobulin is the only protease inhibitor in the plasma of                   Limulus, which should facilitate its functional characterization in             vivo.  The proposed research will investigate the possibility that              alpha-2-macroglobulin participates in a receptor-mediated clearance             pathway for proteases.  Alpha-2-macroglobulin also participates in              a cytolytic system in the plasma of Limulus that may be homologous              to the vertebrate complement system.  This system will be                       characterized, the participating molecules identified, and their                sequence of action and mechanism of cytolysis characterized.  This              study, which represents the first molecular characterization of a               complement-like cytolytic system in an invertebrate, should yield               valuable information concerning this important immune-like defense              system.                                                                         %%%                                                                             Multicellular organisms have a varied array of defense strategies               that limit their susceptibility to damage by potential pathogens.               These defense mechanisms generally involve cells and soluble                    factors of the blood.  One of the most ancient of these blood                   factors is the plasma protein, alpha-2-macroglobulin.  This                     molecule is found in a wide range of animals from invertebrates to              humans.  Alpha-2-macroglobulin appears to have two general types of             function, one as a trap for enzymes in the blood or on cell                     surfaces that might otherwise do damage by digesting other                      proteins, and the second is as a part of a specific biochemical                 chain reaction that functions to kill invading pathogens or foreign             cells.   The purpose of this research is to characterize the                    structure and function of the alpha-2-macroglobulin from the                    horseshoe crab, Limulus, a relatively primitive animal.  The                    results of this research will contribute to understanding of the                diverse array of defense mechanisms found in nature, and may also               shed light on the functioning of the defense molecules of higher                organisms.",
