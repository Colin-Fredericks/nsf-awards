 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visual  programming  languages (VPLs) offer the  hope  of  higher  reliability at lower labor costs, but only if they can be  scaled  up  for  realistically-sized  programming  projects.  This research  addresses  a  critical  factor  in  scaling   up  declarative  VPLs, by  developing an interactive  and  visual  yet  powerful  approach to data  abstraction. The visual approach  adds  expressive  power  to VPLs through  simplicity,  rather  than  the  traditional  approach  of  providing  them  at  the  expense   of  simplicity.  The  concepts developed are being  implemented  in  a  research   declarative  VPL  and  made  available  to  interested  researchers.    This work builds upon recent work in data abstraction,  event-  handling,  and  the scaling-up problem. Visual  design  issues are addressed,  and  the  current  implementation is being prepared to serve as  a  base  research  system.  The research seeks the  incorporation of a visual and  flexible approach to code reuse. At  the  same time, a simple approach to  exception handling based  on  the  earlier  work on events is being developed.  Additional  work  regarding  visual impact and visual support for the  approach  to  data abstraction is expected to enhance the simplicity and effectiveness of  the  results.",
