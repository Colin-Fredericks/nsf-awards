 "awd_abstract_narration": "A reliable energy source is an essential infrastructure                    support component for any type of manufacturing system.                         Approximately 30% of the world's fossil fuels and 25% of the world              petroleum are consumed by the United States alone.  In order for                the United States manufacturers to be competitive in the                        international market, the effectiveness of the energy utilization               should be improved.  Because of the pollutant emission                          considerations, electricity is displacing natural gas as an energy              source.  Therefore there is an increased demand for electric power              by manufacturing and material processing industry.  An                          Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Advanced Control             of Energy/Power System at Purdue University could establish a                   better mechanism to advance the development and application of                  basic research on power and energy system.                                           A planning meeting will study if industry will support an                  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Advanced Control             of Power/Energy System to be headquartered the Purdue University.               The meeting will assess industry interest and determine if the                  Center has sufficient support and merit to meet the                             Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.              The proposed research projects will address:  1) power generation               and transmission; 2) energy distribution and utilization; 3)                    optimal dynamic dispatching; 4) monitoring and diagnostics; and 5)              instrumentation and control.                                                         The Principal Investigator is recognized as an eminent                     researcher and has the resources for the planning meeting.                      Currently, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and four                other companies have committed to support this effort.                               The Program Manager recommends Purdue University be awarded                $9,999 for four months for this planning meeting.",
