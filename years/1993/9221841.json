 "awd_abstract_narration": "9221841  Wolfgang Sachtler    This is a systematic study of metal-proton adducts in zeolites,  including the role of these adducts in modifying the catalytic  characteristics of metal and in anchoring metal clusters to the  zeolite.  One issue addressed is whether the enhanced catalytic  activity of transition metals in proton-containing zeolites is due  to the electron deficiency of the metal particles or to the  chemical participation of adduct protons in the catalytic reaction.   The emphasis in this effort is on rhodium clusters although  additional work on palladium and platinum is also included.  The  rates of hydrocarbon conversion reactions on metals and metal-  proton adducts are compared with the electron deficiency of the  metals as determined by photoelectron spectroscopy.  Other  characterization techniques used include X-ray absorption methods  (using synchrotron radiation), electron microscopy, infrared  spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, temperature-programmed  mass spectrometric methods, and isotopic exchange.  The effects of  alcohols and amines on metal sintering in zeolites is also study.   Zeolites studied include Y, L, and ZSM-5.    The catalyst systems under study here are important in petroleum  refining and in the production of monomers for the fiber and  plastics industries.  The effects uncovered here could dramatically  influence the performance or lifetimes of these systems.",
