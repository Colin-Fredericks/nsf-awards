 "awd_abstract_narration": "In vitro mutagenesis has been used extensively  in probing the                  structure and function of ribosomal RNA from the bacterium E. coli              Only recently has this powerful technique been applied toward the               study of ribosomal proteins.  The objective of this planning grant              is the modification of a two plasmid, inducible expression system               based upon T7 RNA polymerase that was adapted for an investigation              of E. coli ribosomal protein L2.  This system has made it possible              to quickly identify dominant-negative mutations by replica plating              transformants at two different temperatures.  The refinements being             carried out in this study is the coupled expression of a mutant                 ribosomal protein gene and an rRNA operon that codes for an                     antibiotic resistance.  Upon induction of the T7 RNA polymerase                 expression system, the vast majority of de novo ribosomes will                  include of an antibiotic resistance marker as well as the targeted              mutant ribosomal protein during subunit assembly.  Wild type                    ribosomes assembled prior to induction will be functionally                     eliminated by the inclusion of the appropriate antibiotic during                invitro activity assays.  This will allow for mutant ribosomal                  subunits assembled in vivo to be characterized in vitro for their               activity/inactivity in the partial reactions of protein synthesis,              eliminating the need to physically separate the two ribosome                    populations.                                                                    %%%                                                                             The planning grant is testing the applicability of a new technique              to the study of ribosomal RNA-protein interactions.  Completion of              the work will help us better understand the mechanism by which                  proteins are synthesized in all cells.",
