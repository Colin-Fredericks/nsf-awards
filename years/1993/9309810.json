Burrows at the State University of New York, Stony                   Brook. The work concerns an investigation into the                              oxidative reactions of simple cobalt compounds using DNA and RNA                targets as an extension of the investigator's DNA oxidation                     studies using nickel(II) complexes. In particular, DNA sequences                containing G-G mismatches, G bulges or hairpin loops will be                    studied in efforts to develop a probe for such structures.                      Studies on RNA will include examination of transfer RNA's and the               group I intron from Tetrahymena. The experimental methods of this               work will focus on DNA and RNA purification by high resolution                  gel electrophoresis.                                                            %%%                                                                             This Career Advancement Award to Professor Burrows will extend                  her work on nickel complexes and their interactions with DNA to use of          cobalt complexes and to RNA structure manipulations and catalysis.              The application of these nonporphyrin complexes to both DNA and                 RNA is sought in DNA with double mismatches, transfer RNA, and                  group I intron from Tetrahymena. The work is expected to impact                 on medical, coordination, and biochemistry.",
