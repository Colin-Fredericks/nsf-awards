 "awd_abstract_narration": "We claim that short hands-on laboratories make text books                       obsolete for many purposes. This is particularly true for those                 topics which are largely implementation-dependent or \"how to\"                   topics, or deal with purely representational aspects of                         material. This material is better presented in small                            interactive modules, which we call gateway labs. The name                       gateway was used in part because these labs share some of the                   properties of both open and closed labs: they are open because                  the student works independently, but the tasks comprise closed-                 end introductions, which can be much shorter than either of the                 two more common formats, open or closed labs. We claim students                 should receive the bulk of their \"how to\" instruction through                   direct hands-on interaction with gateway labs. The lectures,                    the text, and the traditional labs can, thus, be devoted to the                 more intellectual aspects of the course, such as problem                        solving. We believe gateways should be implemented as a                         coordinated set of as the principal means of instruction in the                 use of specific software tools. Gateway labs will be assigned                   regularly and frequently, just as most courses currently employ                 reading assignments. We expect roughly as many gateway labs as                  there are lectures. Thus, a full course will incorporate 30 to                  40 specific modules.  We presently incorporate several gateway                  labs in our primary course for non-majors, CSc 104: problem                     solving with computers, a problem-solving course, in which the                  actual use of computer tools is subordinate to the generalized                  problem-solving techniques. Although we focus on problem                        solving, students must still have experience in the use of                      specific tools. Such experience is best gained through                          laboratories, but we want to use our traditional-format labs                    for problem-solving experiences.",
