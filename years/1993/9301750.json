 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies indicate that ultraviolet radiation can penetrate to             considerable depths on tropical reefs. Persistent high levels of UV             penetration, resulting from extended periods of calm sea                        conditions, have been shown to induce stress leading to the loss of             symbiotic zooxanthellae (i.e., bleaching) in reef-building corals.              These conditions may have contributed significantly to the regional             mass coral bleaching events observed in the Caribbean during 1987               and 1990.  This project will continue monitoring penetration of UV              radiation, sea temperatures, and recovery of coral exposed to UV                radiation.  In addition, the project will be expanded to evaluate               the effects of UV radiation on the early life-history stages,                   namely planula larvae and newly-recruited juveniles, of predominant             coral species.  While increases in UV radiation are predicted to be             minimal at low latitudes, increased frequency of calm sea                       conditions predicted by global warming will lead to enhanced water              column clarity and high UV penetration with subsequent negative                 effects on reef corals.  This project, by experimentally defining               the maximum UV intensities that can be tolerated by larval and                  juveniles corals, will provide insight into the role that current               intensities of UV radiation play in limiting recruitment and                    shaping subsequent coral community structure.",
