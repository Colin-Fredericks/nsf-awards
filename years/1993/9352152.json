The incorporation of ICP into the curricula will  enhance their ability to educate students about the theory,  operation and applications of modern instrumentation in  analytical chemistry. ICP is a relatively new technology that  is now commonly used in industry and government for the  analysis of metal ions; however, the principles, operation, and  applications of ICP are not commonly taught at undergraduate  universities.  The university has developed a long-standing  philosophy that \"hands-on\" training in the laboratory is the  cornerstone in the education of young scientists. ICP will be  incorporated into three formal classes: Instrumental Analysis,  Standard Methods of Water Analysis, and Aquatic Toxicology. In  addition, many students will gain advanced experience with the  ICP as part of their undergraduate research.",
