 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to analyze seismic data collected during and                 after the eruption of Pinatubo Volcano, Luzon, Philippines.  This               cataclysmic 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo was among the largest                 volcanic eruptions of the century, with profound effects on the                 people, landscape, and economic infrastructure of the Philippines               and the climate of the world.  The eruption was also one of the                 best recorded natural disasters in history, providing a rich and                voluminous collection of seismological data that can be used both               for understanding the dynamics of an explosive volcanic system and              as a basis for predicting future volcanic eruptions.  The primary               objectives are to study the pre- and post-eruptive seismicity                   patterns, including the ongoing 1992-93 volcanic crisis; to study               the wave-form characteristics of seismic events; to relate these                studies to volcanic processes including the 1991 phreatic and                   paroxsysmal eruptions, the 1992 dome-forming event, secondary                   explosions on the pyroclastic flows, lahars, and steam jetting.                 The research involves close collaboration between scientists at                 Indiana University, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and                 Seismology, the U.S. Geological Survey, and other groups involved               in volcanological research at Mt. Pinatubo.  This research is a                 component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.",
