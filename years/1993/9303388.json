 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program will support work by Drs. James H. Espenson and Andreja                 Bakac of the Chemistry Department, Iowa State University, on                    transition metal-mediated oxidation reactions.  Many of the                     studies will explore the superoxochromium(III) ion, which is                    quickly formed when Cr(II) reacts with oxygen.  Related aqua                    and macrocyclic complexes of Cr, W, and Mo will be                              characterized in order to determine the oxygen binding mode.                    The mechanism of oxygen self-exchange of the ion will be                        determined using radioactive labeling methods.  Oxygen transfer                 reactions between Ru, Rh, and Cr and other transition metal oxo                 acceptors will be studied.  In addition, the very rapid                         reactions of other low-valent transition metal ions with oxygen                 will be investigated and the mechanism of those reactions                       determined.  Metal-oxo, metal-peroxo, or metal-superoxo                         complexes might be expected to be observed as intermediates.                    Various reactions of the metal-oxo complexes formed will be                     undertaken, including electron transfer and  hydrogen                           abstraction.                                                                    %%%                                                                             In this thorough investigation of the details the interaction                   of a number of transition metal ions with oxygen, Espenson and                  Bakac will determine the way oxygen binds to the metal, the                     rates and pathways by which oxygen is exchanged with other                      metals, and the susceptibility of the metal-oxo complexes to                    oxidation or reduction.  The fundamental results are expected                   to be helpful in understanding the role of transition metals in                 organic oxidation reactions, which are industrially important,                  and of metal-oxo ions in biological systems.",
