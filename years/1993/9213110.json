In a series                of experiments, we explore the nature of American Sign Language                 (ASL) and its neural substrate.                                                                                                                                      Biological and Linguistic constraints on Structure.  We                    investigate the ways in which requirements of production                        constrain the 'phonological' structure of language, sorting                     natural constraints imposed by the visual gestural modality from                language-particular characteristics.  We also initiate new                      analyses of ASL verbs, which are the blueprint for and the                      backbone of the ASL sentence.  The research aims toward a                       comprehensive and systematic account of verb class organization,                lexical representation, and morphosyntax in ASL.                                                                                                                     Neurological Control of Language and Movement.  The study of               sign language probes the interaction of the brain's control of                  language and of movement.  We combine new techniques of                         three-dimensional computer-graphic movement analyses with                       linguistic analyses to illuminate neural mechanisms controlling                 language and movement from an important new perspective: We                     contrast brain damaged signers with deficits at different levels                of linguistic processing and motor control.                                                                                                                          Biological and Linguistic Constraints on Perception and                    Action.  Signs in American Sign Language are not static, but                    rather move in complex, highly patterned dynamic arrays.  We                    quantitatively investigate the ability of signers with motor                    disorders to analyze various types of visual motion stimuli,                    ranging from the simplest analysis of velocity, to motion with                  linguistic content.  Moreover, we investigate the processing                    stages underlying their ability to point to memorized target                    locations in 3-D space.  These data sets will help uncover the                  perceptual-motor underpinnings of the neural substrate for sign                 language.                                                                                                                                                            The convergence of formal linguistic, objective three-                     dimensional measurement, and neurological approaches in this                    project will provide fresh perspectives on issues in brain                      organization for language that are relevant for all natural                     languages, both spoken and signed.",
