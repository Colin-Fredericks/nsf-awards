 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318328  Kim       The objective of this project is to investigate the  functionality and the specificity of neural networks formed from  artificially cultured biological neurons on a VLSI chip, with  respect to information processing.  To achieve the objective,  methods to understand signal transmission and processing in  neurites, as well as the methods to understand the operation of  neural networks formed from biological neurons.  For this project,  there are three goals:  1) investigate the dynamic neuronal  connectivity of function-specific neurons of the snail, Helisoma  trivolvis on a VLSI chip with real time measurements.  2)  test the  hypothesis that the synapsin molecules play an important role on  the information processing as the neighboring associated molecules  of cytoskeleton of neurites.  3)  develop a nonlinear dynamic  Hebbian-like learning algorithm based on the mathematical modeling  of the experimental results.  The proposed research will develop a  new discipline called synthetic neuroscience, i.e. the use of  electronics technology to assist the quantitative understanding of  the brian, bringing together neuroscience and electronic chip  engineering.",
