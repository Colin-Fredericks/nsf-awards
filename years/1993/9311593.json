 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311593  Dietz         This is a project designed to develop an improved model  for  studying  the  environmental  impacts  associated  with  trends  in  population,  affluence,  and  technology.   Each  portion  of  the  simple  equation  often  used  to   assess  environmental  impacts  (I=PAT)  will  be  reformulated   to  reflect  added  complexity, and  then  time  series,  cross-  sectional, and pooled time series cross-sectional data  from  a  variety  of nations will be used to estimate  new  models  incorporating these changes.        This  project  has  the potential  to  make  important  contributions  not only to our theoretical understanding  of  the   sources  of  environmental  problems,  but   also   to  environmental policy.  Previous work using the  I=PAT  model  has  been  hindered  by the oversimplified  and  unrealistic  nature  of the variables used and the relationships  assumed  to  exist among them, thus making it impossible to use  this  model to accurately study and forecast environmental trends.  To  the  extent  that  this project is successful,  it  will  overcome these difficulties.  ***",
