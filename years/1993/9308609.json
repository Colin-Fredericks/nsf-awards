 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combettes         The goal of this research is to lay a theoretical and  computational foundation for the use of parallel projection  methods in set theoretic signal/image restoration and  reconstruction.  Its main motivation is to overcome the  shortcomings of the Method of Successive Projections (MOSP, POCS  in the Convex case) that currently prevail in the field: MOSP is  not well suited for implementation on parallel processors due to  its serial structure; it provides poor solutions if the sets do  not intersect (inconsistent formulations); and it converges  slowly and there is no general rule for adapting the relaxation  coefficients to speed up the iterations.         A general Method Of Parallel Projections (MOPP) is being  developed in which the current iterate is projected  simultaneously onto selected sets and the update is a relaxed  convex combination of the projections.  Research objectives  include, a formal study of the convergence properties of MOPP for  convex and nonconvex, as well as for the consistent and  inconsistent formulations; development of iteration-dependent,  extrapolated overrelaxations to achieve very fast convergence;  and investigation of the practical and computational issues  pertaining to signal/image recovery applications.",
