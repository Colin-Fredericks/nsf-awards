 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of manufacturing enterprises in Bulgaria, 500 of                them state owned and 100 new private companies, that will examine               factors associated with success and failure over a four-year time               span.   Data from the first wave of this longitudinal survey have               already been collected, and subsequent waves will add data from                 surveys and official sources.  This study will test sociological                theories of organization ecology that predict success of                        enterprises is shaped by the age of the enterprise, its size,                   structural inertia, dynamics of population density, environmental               imprinting, niche width, and r-versus-K strategies.  The study will             also apply theories from neoclassical economics and from several                competing economic approaches.                                                                                                                                  This study capitalizes upon a unique opportunity to examine a                   society that is struggling to escape from totalitarian government               and a demand economy to develop the institutions of a free market.              The chief scientific goal is to test general theories of the                    success and failure of enterprises in an environment of rapid                   social change, but the study will also generate a substantial data              base that will be of great use to many economists and sociologists              in research projects of many kinds.",
