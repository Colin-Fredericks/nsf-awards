 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robinson is studying a mainstream area of biological                  research in order to describe better the course of biology's                    development and to analyze the issues involved in the workings of               experimental science.  In order to carry out this research, he has              selected case studies that represent experimental approaches to                 determining the mechanisms responsible (i) for creating the                     asymmetric distribution of Na+ and K+ between cells and their                   environments and (ii) for linking the oxidation of nutrients to the             production of ATP by the cell mitochondria.  These inquires                     converged in formulations of active transport across biological                 membranes, and led to the recognition of ATP-utilizing enzymes that             create ion gradients, ATP-synthesizing enzymes that consume ion                 gradients, and the role of both ATP and ion gradients as potential              energy reservoirs for driving cellular function.  The case studies              also represent the variety of experimental origins and outcomes:                theory-driven and serendipitous discovery, falsification and                    immunity to falsification, corroboration, controversy, consensus                formation, and the attainment of conceptual unity through the                   reductionist program.  The goals of this project include drawing to             the attention of historians and philosophers of science such                    ordinary practice, and illustrating to working scientists some                  practical and theoretical aspects of their toils--including causes              and consequences of success and failure in rival research programs.",
