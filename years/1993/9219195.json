 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Botany and Plant Sciences, University of                      California, Riverside (UCR) has held a symposium each of the past               15 years on timely topics in plant physiology.  The 16th Annual                 Symposium, entitled \"Plant Response to Cellular Dehydration During              Environmental Stress,\" will be held January 28-30, 1993, and will               be organized by Professors Timothy J. Close and Elizabeth A. Bray.                                                                                              The objective of the 1993 Symposium is to bring together scientists             working in the area of environmental stress, with the intention                 that discussion and presentations will lead to a greater                        understanding of cellular, physiological, and genetic aspects of                stress adaptation.  Speakers, especially young investigators, from              abroad and other institutions in the U.S. will be invited.  Time                for discussion and poster presentation is allotted.  Presented                  papers, as well as poster abstracts, will be published rapidly and              inexpensively.                                                                                                                                                  Riverside is an ideal location for this symposium because:  (1)                 there are a substantial number of faculty here and in Southern                  California with research interests in environmental stress; (2)                 Riverside is easily accessible; (3) UCR has built a reputation for              successful symposia; (4) the close proximity to the 1993 Gordon                 Research Conference on Temperature Stress in Plants which will                  follow this conference.",
