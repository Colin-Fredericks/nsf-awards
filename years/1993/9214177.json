The renovated                                  building now will house the Departments of                                      Mathematics, Computer Science, and Psychology, in                               addition of Physics.  Renovation will include:                                  improvement of the building's heating, cooling, and                             electrical systems; bringing the building into                                  compliance with modern building codes and refitting                             for proper ventilation, handicap accessing, and                                 fire sprinkler systems; removal of fume hoods,                                  plumbing, and specialized laboratory benches; and                               cleaning and flushing of two organic chemistry                                  laboratories in order to meet health codes.                                          These improvements will have a major impact on                             approximately two-thirds of the Science Division                                graduates who select a senior individualized                                    project that involves experimental research and who                             go on either to graduate programs or directly into                              research and development environments.//",
