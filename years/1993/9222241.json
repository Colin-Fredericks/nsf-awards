 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores connections between initial value                   constraints and gauge transformations in classical field                        theories.  Initial value analyses of standard examples indicate                 that (i) the Euler-Lagrange equations are simultaneously                        underdetermined and overdetermined; (ii) the (first class)                      constraints are given by the vanishing of the energy-momentum map               associated to the gauge group; and (iii) the evolution equations                can be written in adjoint form.  Noether's theorem and the Dirac-               Bergmann analysis of constraints help to predict and explain                    these features.  The key tool in the analysis is the                            \"energy- momentum map.\"                                                              The general goal of this research is to develop an                         understanding of the mathematical structure of physical theories                underlying physical entities such as gravitation,                               electromagnetism and the nuclear forces.  Recent work has shown                 that all basic physical processes can be described in a very                    similar manner mathematically, and this observation has led to                  the discovery of several striking features and phenomena which                  yield new insights into these processes.  These insights, in                    turn, have generated applications in fields far from removed                    their source, such as robotics, optimal control and laser optics.               The proposed research will endeavor to unify and extend current                 approaches, based on geometric and symmetry considerations,                     thereby obtaining a fundamentally new understanding of the                      structure of physical theories.",
