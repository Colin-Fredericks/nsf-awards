 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interaction of science, technology and national culture is a                frequently mentioned but too rarely examined phenomenon.                        Historians and social scientists have long maintained that there is             such a thing as a national style of doing science and technology.               The standard example is physics: the British required mechanical                models to facilitate understanding of physical forces while the                 French disdained such models in favor of mathematical equations                 which allow calculation of how forces act.  But beyond this                     example, there have been too few studies.  Correspondingly, there               have been too few studies of the influence of science and                       technology on national culture.  Dr. Jackson, working with Dr.                  Peter Galison of Harvard University, is examining these                         relationships in the context of the science and technology of                   optics in Germany, contrasting them with optics in Great Britain.               Under this grant, Dr. Jackson is analyzing the switch in optical                hegemony from London to Munich in the 19th century and how leading              German scholars retrospectively reconstituted this historical                   episode in order to legitimize their scientific, social, economic               and political interests.                                                                                                                                        Among other things, Dr. Jackson is examining how the advances in                glass technology in Bavaria made possible the creation of                       scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, spectroscopy,                      photochemistry and x-ray technology.  Glass technology was to                   revolutionize the way scientists literally saw the world.  Bavarian             optical instruments combined with Gaussian mathematics were to                  enable German physicists and astronomers to surpass their British               colleagues.  Optics was also crucial to the development of Germany              as a political and economic power, as evidenced by the rise of                  companies such as the Carl Zeiss Works.  This company not only                  produced superior optical instruments, but also provided imperial               Germany with instruments and technologies applicable to war.  This              important history was incorporated into the German culture as an                example of the German superiority in technical, scientific research             and development.  An examination of both the technical and the                  cultural history of German optics will greatly contribute to our                understanding of the interaction of science, technology and                     society.",
