 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311930  Hoover  In this project, Professor Hoover is building a bridge between the  analysis of causality in the philosophy of science and the practice  of macroeconomics and macroeconometrics.   To build this bridge, he  is taking the constraints imposed by the nature of macroeconomics  on useful causal analysis as seriously as philosophers of science  typically take the constraint imposed by quantum mechanics.  A  central theme of the first part of Professor Hoover's study is that  probabilistic theories of causality, especially those that rely on  assumptions about temporal order, are not adequate for  macroeconomics.  In contrast, a counterfactual analysis that  stresses the importance of the invariance of economic structures  and the transmission of the effects of interventions is more  suitable.  Probabilistic theories have a clear function only within  such a structural account.  The second part of the study uses  results from the first part to motivate and justify methods of  causal inference that are then applied to empirical questions of  causal direction in macroeconomics.   The study aims both to  improve applied macroeconomics and to provide a richer and more  general philosophical analysis of causality.  ***",
