 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to learn that molecular basis for structure/function             of the lambdoid bacteriophage N proteins, essential for                         antitemination of transcription by RNA polymerase of their host,                Escherichia coli.  These small (ca. 100 amino acid), positively                 charged proteins are already known by DNA (thence protein) sequence             and mutations.  N of phage has been shown by others to participate              in a transcription complex with host RNA polymerase and 4 host                  'Nus' proteins, a complex induced in response to the specific                   recognition of N both for NusA protein and for an RNA stem/loop                 structure (boxB) in the transcript of affected operons.  N proteins             from different phages appear to have the same impact, although the              amino acid sequences of different N's seem unrelated except for an              arginine-rich region near the amino terminal of each; the Arg-rich              region proves critical to N interaction with boxB, but does not                 account for the specificity of that interaction.  Directed mutation             of both boxB and N from different lambdoid phages, in conjunction               with available NusA variants, will be pursed in order to find the               basis, for observed functional specificity.  Furthermore, purified              segments of N protein, now available through cloning as fusions to              glutathione-S-transferase, will be tested for affinity to boxB RNA,             to NusA or both in combination.  Antibodies against those N                     segments will provide yet another specific reagent, testable                    against each affinity.  If segments affinities emerge, mutation                 will be directed towards pinpointing the basis.                                 The peculiar capacity of lambdoid bacteriophages to overcome the                ability of host RNA polymerase to terminate transcription thus                  becomes an opportunity to explore the molecular basis of                        specificity between proteins and RNA.  Such interactions are known              to be critical, example, to the functions of HIV viruses.  The                  simpler lambdoid components, have through cloning, all been made                accessible to directed mutagenesis and easy detection of mutational             impact. The major divergence of the lambdoid proteins is of further             interest for considerations both of protein structure/function as               well as of evolution.                                                           %%%                                                                             Bacteria can be infected by viruses which take over control of the              replicative machinery of the bacterial host cell for replication of             the virus.  This proposal focuses one a central aspect of this                  take-over process: copying of the viral rather that host cell DNA               into messenger RNAs (which are then translated into viral                       proteins).  A single viral protein, after recognizing a specific                DNA sequence in the virus genome, complexes with host replicative               proteins, thereby recruiting them to copying of viral genes.  This              proposal examines in detail the molecular parameters governing the              protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions which result in virus              take-over of the cell.",
