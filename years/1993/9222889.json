 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will complete data analyses and prepare a series of                publications on ethics and values in graduate education in four                 fields:  chemistry, civil engineering, microbiology, and                        sociology.  The project, which is co-sponsored by the AAAS                      Committee on Scientific Freedom and Responsibility, the Council                 of Graduate Schools, and Sigma Xi, has been underway since 1987.                Major research foci include the nature and transmission of                      professional values and ethical standards held by doctoral                      students and their faculty and the types of ethical problems and                value conflicts that occur in the context of graduate education                 programs in the four disciplines.  The study's findings and                     recommendations will be based on comparative and associational                  analyses of four sets of project data:  (1) a 1988 national                     survey of graduate school deans concerning university policies                  and ethical issues in research and graduate education, (2) a 1990               national survey of 2,000 doctoral students enrolled in                          departments/programs in the four disciplines at major research                  universities, (3) a 1991 survey of 2,000 graduate school faculty                in the departments/programs whose students were surveyed in 1990,               and (4) a set of 78 in-depth interviews, ranging from 60 to 120                 minutes, conducted during 1991-1992 with graduate students and                  faculty in the four disciplines at eight departments in three                   major research universities.",
