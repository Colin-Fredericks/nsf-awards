 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this investigation is delineation of                   mechanisms of thermal destruction and product formation (major                  product species as well as dioxins and furans) during the pyrolysis             and combustion of chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC) fuels at different              air/fuel ratios and various surrounding thermal and chemical                    environments.  Soot and carbonaceous particles formed during                    pyrolysis and combustion of various CHC fuels as well as ignition               delay times over a range of temperatures will also be determined.               Droplets/particles of CHC fuels representative of industrial                    hazardous wastes will be selected and their time-resolved behavior              during passage along the axis of controlled temperature-composition             reactor determined.  Information will thus be obtained on the                   thermal destruction, vaporization, and combustion of these fuels                under well-defined conditions of fuel particle/droplet size, inter-             particle spacing, and thermal and chemical envirionment around the              particle in order to guide the development of strategies for                    effective thermal destruction of hazardous wastes in addition to                determining ignition delays, combustion rates, destruction                      efficiencies, and formation of volatile organic compounds, dioxins,             furans, soot, and carbonaceous particles during combustion.  This               approach will yield rate and mechanistic information on the thermal             destruction and and product formation of CHC fuels.  Particular                 emphasis will be place on definition of approaches for avoidance                of formation of chlorine, phosgene, soot, particulates, dioxins,                and furans during the combustion of such fuels.                                                                                                                 The incentive for this research arises from the need for scientific             and engineering information on the combustion and pollution                     characteristics of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds such that                  large-scale hazardous chemical waste incineration systems can be                designed and operated more reliably and satifactorily in an                     environmentally acceptable manner without undue hazard to human                 health and environment.  The lack of our present understanding on               the combustion characteristics of CHCs, particularly as regards                 thermal destruction and production of various toxic products, has               resulted in the use of highly empirical methods for design of                   incinerators.  This research program is aimed at development of a               better understanding of the thermal destruction and product                     formation mechanisms, as well as determination of information                   regarding formation of soot and particulates and ignition delay                 times associated with these species during the incineration of                  hazardous chlorinated wastes.",
