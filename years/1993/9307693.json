 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307693  Konigsberg    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Lyle Konigsberg will  curate a large series of Native American skeletal materials  excavated from sites in the midwest. Because they are not  associated with named tribes this series is not subject to  repatriation and provides an extremely important data base for  scientific research. The materials are currently stored in less  than optimal conditions and have not been entered into a  computer  inventory. This current project will remedy these defects.  Materials will be moved to a new storage area, properly packed in  new boxes and placed in closed storage units. Labels will be  recopied and the data entered into a computerized data base.    Human osteological collections provide an irreplaceable resource  for documenting and studying humankind's past history. Nowhere is  the value of this material greater than in those cases where there  are no known living descendant groups, and as a consequence the  history of a past people has become faded or unknown. Materials  such as these, because they were collected through controlled  archaeological excavation are also important for what they reveal  about human biological adaptation. Through integration into a  larger cultural context, it is possible to examine how people  respond biologically to varying diet social organization and  environmental conditions.     This project is important because it will both preserve valuable  scientific materials and make them available for  research.",
