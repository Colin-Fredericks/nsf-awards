 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most actively transcribed genes in any organism are those                   coding for the ~37S pre-ribosomal RNAs.  In eukaryotes, this is                 accomplished by RNA polymerase I and additional factors.  How these             interact is of fundamental importance.  In vivo analysis of the                 role of the rDNA transcription factor UBF (upstream binding factor)             in catalysis of rRNA synthesis in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces                 pombe is proposed.  To facilitate these studies the S. pombe UBF                gene is being cloned.  The first transcription extract capable of               supporting accurate initiation on an S. pombe rDNA mini-gene is now             successfully established, and it is sensitive to the action of a                vertebrate rDNA enhance which specifically interacts with UBF.                  Activation of the rDNA promoter in this S-100 extract is also                   responsive to regulatory elements in the pombe intergenic spacer                (from ~-1800 to ~-850 that apparently act by stably binding RNA                 polymerase I transcriptional factors.  Factors interacting with                 essential rDNA promoter and intergenic regulatory sequences will be             analyzed.  Our two experimental aims include:  1.) Analysis of the              activity of the S. pombe RNA polymerase I transcription factor UBF              in vivo and in vitro; 2.) Characterization of the role of                       regulatory sequences in the S. pombe rDNA spacer in transcriptional             activation of the rDNA promoter and identification of interacting               factors.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Every cell in an organism has millions of ribosomes, the complexes              where proteins are synthesized.  The function of these complexes is             absolutely required for all cells, since proteins are key                       determinants of cellular structure and functions.  The ribosomes re             composed of both protein and nucleic acid components.  My                       laboratory is studying how the essential nucleic acid components of             these complexes, called the ribosomal RNAs, are produced.  Our                  approach incorporates both genetic and biochemical analysis of                  requirements for the production of the ribosomal RNAs and analysis              of the means by which a cell regulates this production.",
