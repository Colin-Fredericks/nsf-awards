This activity is part of an effort to increase the representation of  women in SEM fields.  The project extends a previously successful model program designed to  promote interest and academic instruction in these disciplines for underrepresented minorities.   The participating local high schools are populated by ethnic groups having historically high  attrition rates in secondary and post secondary education and low representation in SEM related  occupations.    Success in science, engineering and mathematics for women is often dependent upon the  internalized interpretation of female roles in society.  Additional motivation and training is  needed for women to enter the male dominated (SEM) professions.  The project will help create  a supportive environment for both the high school participants and the female undergraduate  mentors.  The project also provides critical instructional assistance for secondary laboratory  classes.  Low ratios of instructors to students (1:35) at the participating high schools contribute  to the inability to understand the basic scientific principles taught in the classroom.  Female  undergraduates receive positive reinforcement in their science instructor/mentor roles, which  give them added motivation to complete the course work necessary for careers in SEM.  The  participating undergraduates will receive a $2,000 stipend to help them complete their course  work.  ***",
