 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-time recognition of speaker-independent                                    connected speech has proven to be a difficult                                   problem for electronic systems.  Low-precision                                  highly parallel analog neural networks have                                     been shown to recognize speaker-dependent                                       small-vocabulary connected speech using                                         standard components.  This project will                                         research and develop massively parallel custom                                  integrated circuits that will perform this task,                                using integrated delay lines and analog                                         computing networks.  Phase I has included the                                   design and fabrication of test chips to prove                                   the feasibility of our development; the Phase                                   II effort will continue this development                                        through design, fabrication and testing of full-                                scale prototype systems.                                                        The approach utilizes standard readily                                          available CMOS Bulk integrated circuit                                          technology so products arising from this                                        research can be fabricated reliably and                                         economically by a number of vendors.   Phase                                    I culminated in the fabrication and testing of                                  an expandable, programmable single-chip                                         speech classifier.  This chip operates at over                                  100 MIPS and enjoys a 50x improvement in                                        performance over DSP chips (normalized to                                       the same silicon area usage). The P.I. has also                                 shown the feasibility of using floating-nodes to                                provide nonvolatile storage of analog voltages.                                 These voltages can be used to control the                                       operation of the chip thus implementing the                                     capability to learn or be trained in the field.                                 During Phase II, the P.I. will investigate the                                  mapping of learning algorithms to efficient                                     silicon circuits.                                                               This proposed research applies the P.I.'s                                       experience to the challenging and important                                     problem of real-time speech recognition and                                     may lead directly to inexpensive products with                                  wide commercial applicability.",
