 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Katherine Spielmann, Mr. James Bayman                will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct                archaeological excavation at the site of Marana in the Sonoran                  Desert of Arizona. This site, constructed and occupied by Hohokan               peoples, dates from approximately AD 1100-11350 and consists, in                effect of a vast multi-site community which spans a 146 km square               area and cross-cuts three environmental zones. To date, research                has been conducted in two of these zones and with National Science              Foundation support Mr. Bayman will excavate in the third of these               to collect comparative data. He will place 1 x 2 meter test pits in             four of the largest refuse middens  which appear the represent the              remains of separate households. He will then analyze the materials              recovered both to determine the kinds of production activities                  which characterized this zone and nature and frequency of \"exotic\"              materials. With these data he will attempt to reconstruct the                   social, political and economic organization of Marana.                                                                                                          By early in the first millennium A.D. Hohocam peoples had developed             a complex society which knit together large numbers of peoples in               a harsh and unpredictable desert environment. Archaeologists wish               to understand how Hohocam groups organized themselves to exist                  successfully in this seemingly difficult situation. In many areas               groups developed large scale irrigation systems and archaeologists              believe that the need both to build and then maintain canals led to             the growth and continual reinforcement of political centralization.             The Marana community is interesting because this group appears to               have depended on rainfall agriculture and a canal system is not                 present. Mr. Bayman believes that a combination of economic                     specialization by subregion and control of exotic materials by                  elites served the same social function as canals and his research               will evaluate this hypothesis.                                                                                                                                  This work is important for several reasons. It will increase our                understanding of an only partially understood period in American                prehistory. It will shed new light on how societies at a simple                 level of technology adapted to harsh and unpredictable environments             and finally it will contribute to the training of a promising young             scientist.",
