 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project by Prof. David Pratt of the University of                      Pittsburgh, the Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry                     Division supports experimental research on fundamental                          questions concerning the structures and forces at work in                       weakly bound complexes, mechanisms of intramolecular energy                     flow, and chemical reaction pathways.  By means of high                         resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy the properties of excited                   electronic states are determined and questions of the dynamics                  of chemical reactions are addressed.                                            %%%                                                                             Understanding the fundamentals of chemical reactions on a                       molecular level is at the current frontier of physical                          chemistry.  Once a molecule is enriched with high vibrational                   and electronic energy, it can shed this energy in a                             reactionless process, it can dissociate into fragments, or it                   can react with other molecules to form new ones.  If the                        details of these individual processes are known and understood,                 reactions could be steered into preferred directions.  The                      determination of such detailed, molecular level understanding                   for species of chemical interest is the goal of this research                   project.",
