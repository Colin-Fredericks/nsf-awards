 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312460  Dinnocenzo  The generality, scope, and limitations of three-electron SN2   substitutions on cation radical sigma bonds will be studied.   The study will: (1) extend the variety of nucleophiles that   can be used in practical substitution reactions, (2)   investigate the factors that control the regiochemistry of   three-electron SN2 reactions, (3) probe the electronic   structures of various cyclopropane cation radicals to test   structure/reactivity relationships, and (4) test the   viability of substitution reactions on simple, alkyl-  substituted cyclopropane cation radicals and, in addition,   cation radicals which do not contain a cyclopropane ring.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   work of Professor Joseph P. Dinnocenzo at the University of   Rochester. The reactions of electron-rich molecules with   cyclopropane cation radicals will be studied. The latter   species are three-carbon cycles in which one electron has   been removed. The study will include consideration of where   the electron-rich molecule attacks the cyclopropane cation   radical and extension of the reaction to species other than   the cyclopropane cation radical. These reactions will have   the potential to make larger molecules that are of interest.   The reaction to be studied will provide important   theoretical insight as well, since it is the three-electron   analog of a common two-electron substitution reaction.  ***",
