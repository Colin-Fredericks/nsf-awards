 "awd_abstract_narration": "There will be a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)                   program in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at Cornell.  Every                 effort is to be made to include women and underrepresented                      minorities at a proportion that reflects their numbers in society.              Under-represented minorities will be energetically recruited                    through the NSF-funded Engineering Synthesis Coalition.  The summer             program will start with a two-week training period, in which the                students will learn basic machine shop skills, some computer                    skills, and basic electronic circuit construction skills.  The                  students will then work with their individual advisor, meeting at               least weekly.  The summer program will also include weekly REU                  meetings, tours of Cornell labs and of local companies, and some                social activities.  Every student will write a final report and all             students will give a short final oral presentation.  Participation              in the REU program is likely to increase the chance that students               will pursue graduate studies.",
