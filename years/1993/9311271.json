 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311271  DeMeter       The equipment grant is for the manufacture of a best fixture  purchase of two program mable power units for clamps and for  association computer hardware and software for fixture control and  monitoring.  The equipment and software will be used in the  development of techniques to analyze and control fixture-workpiece  dynamics.  Results from preliminary modeling indicated that  fixture-workpiece dynamics could be a source of machining error  nearly a magnitude greater than machine repeatability.  This  research will focus on the dynamics of workpiece restrained by  small area contact and subject to milling.  It will: (1) develop  models to predict the impact of element contact surface geometry,  fixture element placement, and clamp actuation on machining  accuracy, (2) develop contact surfaces geometries which have  superior resistance to slippage, (3 develop models for determining  element placement and clamp actuation intensities which will  maximize machining accuracy, and (4) investigate variable clamp  actuation as a means of reducing workpiece displacement.   Experimentation will  be conducted throughout this research in  order to evaluate models and design concepts.       The research process can be extended to nearly all fixture  applications and measures of machining accuracy.  It will have an  impact on work-holding science, process planning science, and the  economics of machining.  In addition, it will identify other  research issues in work-holding and process planning",
