 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351228  Longshore  An X-ray fluorescence spectrometer is being used as a state of  the art analytical instrument in the undergraduate geology  curriculum.  Operating principles are being introduced in  sophomore-level classes, and students are having hands on  experience with the equipment in several upper-division  laboratories, including petrography, igneous petrology, X-ray  powder methods, geochemistry, and economic geology.  Students  are using the apparatus to perform high precision major and  trace element analyses on a variety of geological materials in  these classes, elucidating course subject matter and gaining  practical experience with modern instrumentation.  The  analytical power of the requested equipment is finding  significant applications in senior undergraduate research  projects.  The ability of the students to obtain accurate  chemical data is greatly enhancing their abilities to achieve  their research objectives, to solve important problems, and to  contribute meaningfully to the knowledge of northern California  geology.  Many of these undergraduate projects are leading to  publications and presentations at professional meetings.  ***",
