Parkin of the Chemistry Department, Columbia University,                  on main group metals.  Monomeric complexes containing                           poly(pyrazolyl)hydroboratate ligands will be prepared,                          including alkyl and hydride derivatives, carbonyl derivatives,                  subvalent derivatives, and terminal oxo, sulfido, and imido                     complexes.  Multiple bonding with heavy main group compounds                    will receive particular attention.  Attempts will be made to                    isolate structurally homologous complexes so that comparisons                   can be made between the reactions of particular metals.  Alkyl                  derivatives of members of Group 2 beyond beryllium will be                      characterized.  Synthesis of anionic copper(I) hydrides will be                 be attempted, as well as that of new CO complexes of silver and                 gold.  The reactivity of Zn, Cd, and Hg species will be                         compared to that of Group 2.                                                    %%%                                                                             Main group metals are used as reagents in organic synthesis and                 are important components of ceramic materials, semiconductors,                  and superconductors.  This work would provide fundamental                       information about the behavior of these metals, particularly                    the heavy members whose chemistry is less well known, and whose                 usefulness in materials applications has not been fully                         exploited.",
