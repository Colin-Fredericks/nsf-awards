 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the travel to Australia by two U.S.                         investigators as part of a cooperative research program between                 Cornell University and the Australian National University to                    study the transport behavior of fluids in narrow pores, using the               methods of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and molecular                   simulation. The senior collaborators will be Professor                          K. E. Gubbins and Dr. L. A. Pozhar from Cornell and Professor                   D. J. Evans at the Australian National University.                                                                                                              The objectives of the research, to be conducted over a two year                 period, are to develop and test a kinetic theory of inhomogenius                fluids, and to apply it to the prediction of diffusion, viscous                 flow and heat transport in model micropores. In addition,                       molecular dynamics simulations will be used to test the kinetic                 theory and nonequilibrium simulations of transport processes in                 micropores of simple geometries (slits and cylinders) will be                   made to obtain an understanding of the effects of pore size and                 shape, type of pore wall, and state conditions on transport                     processes in such confined fluids. Microporous materials are                    widely used in industry to carry out chemical reactions and to                  effect purification and separations.  The proposed work is needed               to design better and more efficient processes for such                          industries.                                                                                                                                                     This project, supported jointly by NSF and the Australian                       Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC),                        brings together the expertise of the researchers in                             computational and theoretical statistical mechanics.",
