The major                                  thrust of the work is to study high-angular                                     momentum phenomena in nuclear physics, in                                       particular studies of exotic shapes and                                         lifetime measurements using the recoil distance                                 technique.  Experiments will be carried out at                                  the Nuclear Science Center (NSC), New Delhi, at                                 the University of Notre Dame Nuclear Structure                                  Laboratory, and at the Argonne National                                         laboratory ATLAS facility.  For experiments in                                  which the PU group takes the lead, most of the                                  data analysis will be performed there, the                                      measurements will be made there to determine                                    feasibility and optimal conditions.  The final                                  experiment would then be performed using the                                    full power of the Argonne-Notre Dame facility                                   if warranted by  experimental data from NSC.                                    This investigation offers an excellent                                          opportunity to make optimum use of facilities                                   available both in India and in the U.S. since                                   much of the work could be done at the NSC in                                    India.                                                                                                                                                          Scope:  The proposed research involving the                                     study of exotic shapes of nuclei represents one                                 of the most active fields in structure physics                                  at the present time.  The division of                                           experiments between the two facilities is very                                  useful considering that the Argonne-Notre Dame                                  Facility is in high demand and the accelerator                                  over-subscribed.  Postdoctoral fellows and                                      graduate students at both institutions will be                                  included in this research.  ***",
