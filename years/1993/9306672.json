 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306672  Wainwright         This research will investigate the evolution of anatomical  and physiological design of the feeding mechanism in fishes of  the order Tetraodontiformes (puffer fishes, trigger fishes, and  their relatives). The primary goal of this work is to provide  several specific tests of the general hypothesis that features of  design limit or direct subsequent evolutionary changes. During  feeding behavior, patterns of muscular contraction will be  documented by recording the electrical signals associated with  muscle contraction through fine-wire electrodes, and movements of  the structural components of the head will be assessed by  comparing the ability of species to alter muscle activation  patterns and movements while feeding on prey that vary in the  challenges they present to the fish. Data collected from several  species will be used to examine the correlation between  evolutionary duplication of jaw closing muscles may enhance  subsequent diversification and flexibility of feeding behavior.  Second, the effect of incorporating a major evolutionary novelty  into the head on the feeding system will be explored using the  puffer fish body-inflation mechanism as a model system.       This research will contribute to our understanding of how  complex muscle-skeleton systems evolve. The work will provide  rare tests of the influence of specific features of functional  design on the subsequent evolution of those systems. In addition,  this research will broaden our base of comparative knowledge of  the diverse feeding systems in vertebrates.  ***",
