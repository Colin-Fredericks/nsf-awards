 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Circuit Isomorphism problem is the problem of deciding  whether two given circuits are isomorphic.  Two circuits are  isomorphic, in this sense, when they are functionally identical  (compute the same input/output relation) under some permutation  of the input values.  The computational complexity of this problem has not been  established.  This project undertakes a comprehensive study of the  complexity of Circuit Isomorphism  in relation to the standard  complexity classes.  It is conjectured that Circuit Isomorphism  is an incomplete problem in the Polynomial Hierarchy.  The basis  of this conjecture relies on the observation that the counting  version of the Circuit Isomorphism problem has a relatively lower  computational complexity.  (The counting version of the Circuit  Isomorphism problem asks for the number of permutations which  certify the isomorphism between the two circuits.)  Thus, it  seems appropriate for the decision problem to have a lower  computational complexity as well.  Extensive comparisons are made  to the much better studied Graph Isomorphism problem, which is a  special case of the Circuit Isomorphism problem.  The results of this study would bring about a better  understanding of the computational complexity of Circuit  Isomorphism and establish a new link between counting problems  and decision problems.",
