 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is being made through the NSF initiative for                         Computational Approaches to Real Materials which was part of the                High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative.  This                 award was rated High Priority by panel review.  Research on the                 electronic structure and properties of substitutional alloys will               be conducted in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory                using the 2048-node Intel PARAGON computer.                                                                                                                     Recent developments of theory and methodology have progressed to                where calculations of formation energies and other physical                     properties of solid substitutional alloys give results that are in              good agreement with experiment.  The proposed research will extend              this theory and develop new algorithms to elucidate the underlying              electronic mechanisms in several problems of technological                      interest, such as the origins of site selectivity of third alloy                additions in binary intermetallic alloys.  Since the required                   calculations are presently beyond the limits of current vector                  supercomputers, the theory will be implemented on the new                       generation of massively parallel supercomputers, and the associated             algorithms and codes will be developed.                                         %%%                                                                             This computational research will focus on calculating the                       electronic properties of important classes of metallic alloys.  The             calculations are sophisticated ones which are accurate in                       comparison with actual measurements.  Due to the complexity of this             work, the calculations will be performed on a new generation                    massively parallel computer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The              necessary computer codes will be developed.                                                                                                                     This research is funded through a NSF initiative called                         Computational Approaches to Real Materials which is part of the                 High Performance Computing and Communication Initiative.",
