 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Ray/9309055    Tailored particles are finding increasing applications in the manufacturing of advanced ceramic materials, electronic and photonic devices, catalysts, microencapsulated polymer particles for control release and thin film coating.  Some of these processes require monodisperse particles of specific size and composition or composite particles (for example layered particles), and recent electronic devices based on quantum dots require nano-size particles.  Of the current techniques for the production of small particles, reactions with aerosols is one of the simplest for the production of high purity particles of  a desired size.  Homogeneous, composite, hollow and layered particles of desired size can be generated by such techniques where composition and structure (along with the size) dictate the possible applications of the particles.  The objectives of this research are to understand the physical and chemical processes involved in the chemical and photochemical reactions in small particles, factors that control the morphology and mechanical strength of the final particles, and to develop techniques for the generation of tailored particles.    Experiments will be conducted on single droplets suspended in an electrodynamic balance and on highly monodisperse droplets generated by a vibrating orifice aerosol generator.  An elastic scattering technique, based on optical resonance, will be applied for the precise determination of the size and the refractive index of a homogeneous or a layered droplet during a reaction with the surrounding vapor.  This technique, in conjunction with Raman scattering a nd graviometric techniques, will provide information on the mass, composition, and porosity of a particle.  The pore size distribution in a final solid particle will be analyzed by adsorption and desorption of vapors.  To estimate the mechanical strength of an inorganic or a polymeric shell covering a core droplet generated by a reaction, a technique, based on the relations between the stress and strain for the shell and between the osmotic pressure and core composition for a surrounding vapor soluble in the core, will be used.  The theory of interaction of light with small droplets suggests an efficient way for the utilization of microdroplets as photochemical reaction media.  Photochemical reactions requiring high power light sources will be examined in microdroplets with low power sources.  Whether a photochemical reaction can be limited to region to form a shell of desired thickness will also be tested.  The formation of surfactant-free emulsions in microdroplets and their use for the generation of nano-size particles will also be examined.   / / /   / / / / / /   / /   / / / / / / / /!/\"/#/$/%/&/'/(/)/*/+/,/-/    0/  2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/:/;/</=/>/?/@/A/B/  D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M/N/O/P/Q/R/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/   /\\/            c/d/e/f/g/h/i/j/k/l/m/n/o/p/q/r/s/t/u/v/w/x/y/z/{/|/}/~/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /   / / / / / /       / /     / / / / / /   / / / / / /   / / / / / / / / / / / / /Abstract - Ray/9309055    Tailored particles are finding increasing applications in the manufacturing of advanced ceramic materi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      !         !         !
