 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project scientists at the Institute of                    Ecosystem Studies and Syracuse University will continue long-term               biogeochemical studies at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest                 (HBEF) in New Hampshire to evaluate trends in atmospheric                       deposition, streamwater chemistry and cycling of critical nutrient              elements.  During the past three decades, dramatic changes in                   atmospheric deposition, streamwater chemistry, vegetation biomass               and soil chemistry were observed at the HBEF.  These changes have               important ecological implications for the management of base-poor               forest ecosystems, which are widespread throughout the                          northeastern U.S.  In particular, a decline in atmospheric inputs               of base cations has increased the sensitivity of forest and                     aquatic ecosystems to continuing high inputs of acidic deposition,              as well as to forest management practices, such as harvest by                   clearcutting.  Neither the decline in atmospheric inputs nor                    declines in forest floor concentrations of base cations observed                during this period were predicted from existing knowledge or from               models of nutrient cycling for forest ecosystems.  Significantly,               the pattern of recovery following anthropogenic acidification                   suggests that acidification may not be a fully reversible process.              %%%                                                                             Long-term efforts at synthesis and integration of biogeochemical                information at Hubbard Brook will be continued.  Results from this              research will improve the  understanding of biogeochemical flux                 and cycling in forest ecosystems of the northeastern U.S.  In                   addition, the continuation of the long-term record of                           precipitation, streamwater and soilwater chemistry at Hubbard                   Brook will provide a basis for interpreting the effects of                      changing atmospheric deposition on biogeochemical processes in                  terrestrial and associated aquatic ecosystems.",
