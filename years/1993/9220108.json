 "awd_abstract_narration": "9220108  Stith    A new pathway for the induction of meiotic cell division was  suggested when a phorbol ester was found to induce meiosis in  Xenopus oocytes.  It is known that phorbols act through protein  kinase C, but the pathway to cell division beyond protein kinase C  is not known.  Protein kinase C is also believed to be involved in  the proliferative pathway of ras p21, insulin, insulin-like growth  factor-1 (IGF-1) and some other growth factors.  Since phorbols,  ras p21, insulin and IGF-1 initiate meiotic cell division in  Xenopus laevis oocytes, we will examine whether PKC acts through  regulation of one or more of four different cell cycle regulatory  proteins.  With both in vivo and in vitro studies, the  phosphorylation, amount and activity of ras p21, mos, cyclin, and  p34cdc2 will be examined as a function of protein kinase C  activity.  It may be found that only one isozymic form of PKC is  central to the regulation of proliferation and that PKC induces  cell division through regulation of specific protein(s).  This  research should elucidate heretofore uncharacterized steps in the  pathway to cell division.  %%%  Certain plant products, phorbol esters, induce cell division in  animal cells.  These chemicals activate an enzyme known as protein  kinase C (PKC).  The function of protein kinase C is to transfer   phosphate groups onto other proteins.  Much evidence suggests that  growth hormones such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 and  epidermal growth factor induce cell division by activating protein  kinase C.  The steps beyond activation of protein kinase C which  lead to cell division are not known.  A separate line of research  over the past five years has been the search for genes and proteins  important to cell division.  Some of the newly discovered proteins  are called mos, cyclin, p34cdc2 and ras p21.  The goals of this  research are: (a) to determine whether protein kinase C can  transfer phosphate to these proteins in a test tube or in living  cells, (b) if i t does, to locate the site of phosphate addition to  these proteins, and (c) determine whether these important cell  division proteins are turned on or off by the addition of  phosphate.  The results of this research should define new steps in  the sequence of events that leads to induction of cell division by  growth factors.  Since this research will be carried out at an  undergraduate institution with the participation of students, it  will also contribute to training a future generation of scientists.  ***",
