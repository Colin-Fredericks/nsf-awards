 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311982  Humphreys  The \"received view\" of how scientific theories in different domains  are related to each other has been, for a number of years, a  hierarchical model.  At the base is physics, or elementary particle  physics to be more precise.  Particle physics is taken as the most  fundamental of all sciences.  Then come, in order, chemistry  molecular biology, general biology, psychology, and the social  sciences.  Much work in the philosophy of science has been devoted  to the relationship between adjacent levels within this science.   Dr. Humphreys, in this project, is attempting to answer concerns  about the inter-level relationship of properties.   An example of  major concern for philosophy and psychology has been the relation  between psychological or computational properties and their  underlying neurobiological/physical properties.  Issues concerning  the mind/body problem and the status of cognitive science depend  directly on how this general question is answered.    Dr. Humphreys is specifically addressing a new way to characterize  the distinction between \"emergent\" and \"nonemergent\" properties.   How, for example, can the mind \"emerge\" from the properties of the  neurons that make up the brain?  How does thought and memory come  out of the chemical and electrical interactions that occur in this  physical organ?  The crucial point in looking at these relations is  that the causal properties that the psychologist deals with  (thoughts, emotions, memories) do not exist at the neurobiology  level and only \"emerge\" at the level of psychology.  The main focus  of this research is the proper way to construe these emergent  properties, with the distinction between internal and external  relations as the guide to a correct treatment.  Dr. Humphreys is  using these investigations to extend existing accounts of  scientific explanation to include emergent properties.  ***",
