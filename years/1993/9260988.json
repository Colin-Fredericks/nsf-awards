 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language is the binding force of a nation and has served as                the communication tool for its people.  The diversification of                  languages among various nations in the world has created the                    language barrier which is one of the major causes for today's world             disorder.  Machine translation holds the key to solve the language              barrier problem.  We consider Chinese-to-English translation by                 computer because Chinese and English are certainly two of the most              popular languages in the world.  In this proposal we are concerned              with an important aspect in Chinese-to-English by computer.                          After eight years of research, Julius T. Tou invented the                  CITAC computer for translating Chinese sentences and text into                  idiomatic English.  CITAC (patent pending in US, PRC, UK), the                  world's first genuine Chinese translation machine, is an                        intelligent computer.  However, due to the radical differences                  between the Chinese language and the English language, the English              translation generated by CITAC is idiomatically correct but may be              grammatically wrong for reasons to be explained in the proposal.                To make the CITAC output of English grammatically correct, we                   propose to conduct research for the design of a self-correction                 scheme for English grammar improvement.  When the propose research              is completed, we anticipate that CITAC will become a full-fledged               computer to translate Chinese sentences and text into perfect                   English.  Thus, the potential application of the research are to                make Chinese-to-English machine translation a reality, not just and             academic endeavor.  The success of the proposed research will beat              the Japanese in machine translation research and will enable the                United State to rule the roost in machine translation industry.//",
