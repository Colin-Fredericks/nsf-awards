The Center continues to meet the  renewal criteria requirements of the I/UCRC Program.      Additional funds are provided by the Department of Energy's  Environmental Restoration and Waste Management to obtain a non-  voting membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Arizona be awarded  $40,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award.  An  additional $10,000 is recommended for one year with funding  provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent  to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
