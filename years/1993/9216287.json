 "awd_abstract_narration": "High speed packet switches are essential elements in the                   high-performance integrated communication networks for providing                multimedia services.  This project in high speed switched networks              can be divided into three categories:  the development of a                     theoretical foundation for the evaluation and comparison of a very              broad spectrum of high speed switching techniques, exploration of               the principle of error correcting routing in high speed switched                networks, and the study of fundamental properties governing traffic             management in ATM networks in order to simplify network level                   management.  We have been developing a theoretical foundation for               the evaluation and comparison of the complexity of a very broad                 spectrum of high speed packet switching designs.  We have developed             a uniform approach to determining the growth of the switch                      complexity as a function of switch size for a given performance                 requirement.  We are also studying the property of dual shuffle                 exchange switching network that makes use of the principle of                   error-correcting routing.  Based on an error-correcting an                      self-routing algorithm, we have shown by analysis and simulation                that the dual shuffle-exchange network can achieve the Shannon                  lower bound on switch complexity with arbitrarily small packet loss             probability.  A network node that incorporates traffic control                  policies that depend only on each individual input and output, but              not on the details of the traffic distributions from  inputs to                 outputs, is said to have the distribution-independent property .                This is a fundamental property that is essential for simplification             of network level traffic management. We have established this                   property for some switch designs.  The goal of this part of this                project is to clarify issues related to the                                     distribution-independent  property and to establish its feasibility             for a generic output queued switch on a rigorous basis.",
