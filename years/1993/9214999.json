 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Seismic Zone 4, there are many older, existing buildings                     that do not meet the lateral strength, drift control, and                       ductile detailing requirements of the 1991 Uniform Building                     Code.  A preliminary study using hypothetical buildings                         indicates the additional strength, stiffness, and energy                        dissipation can be provided by a non-invasive retrofit                          scheme involving the replacement of the existing cladding                       with structural (steel) panels and energy dissipating                           cladding-to-frame connections.  To examine this retrofit                        scheme in detail, two older, existing buildings will be                         studied.  A preliminary design will be done first, which                        includes:  (1) design decisions regarding the relative                          structural contributions of the existing frames and the                         cladding system to the retrofit building system; and (2) for                    the cladding system, design of practical cladding-to-frame                      connections and their attachments, and development of a                         design procedure for the cladding panels.  The feasibility                      of this seismic retrofit scheme will be assessed                                analytically by subjecting the retrofit perimeter frames to                     a set of ground motions with ranges of peak ground                              accelerations, predominant frequencies, and durations.  The                     research will advance the state-of-the-art in passive                           control of structures in two ways:  (1) by identifying                          conditions under which the structural characteristics of                        cladding and cladding-to-frame connections can be effective                     and efficient, and (2) by providing a foundation for the                        development of rational guidelines for the designs of energy                    dissipating cladding systems for either existing weak                           buildings or newly designed buildings.",
