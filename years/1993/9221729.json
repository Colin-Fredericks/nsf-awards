Centrifugation is proving to be a potentially important new tool                in processing of materials, particularly in the crystal growth of               semiconductor, superconductor, optical and detector materials.                  Currently, many surprising experimental results have been obtained              but not yet explained.  The conference follows the First                        International Workshop, which was organized and held at Dubna in                the United Soviet Socialist Republic in 1991 and for which                      Professor Regel was the prime organizer and chair.                                   If the growth of crystals under enhanced gravity fields can                be better understood, the potential exists for producing                        semiconductor and other crystals of superior quality.",
