 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. E. Wyllys Andrews, Mr. Geoffrey Braswell             will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Mr. Braswell has               participated in an archaeological project which has studied the                 prehistory of the San Martin Jilotepque area of Guatemala. In                   during much of this time the region was an important trade center               because it contained abundant obsidian resources. Before the                    introduction of metal tools, this form of volcanic glass was highly             prized because flakes formed and held sharp edges which were used               as cutting tools. Studies have indicated that obsidian was widely               traded both across and beyond the Mayan area and that this trade                may have played an important role in the development of Mayan                   civilization.                                                                                                                                                   To date  Mr. Braswell has located the geological source areas of                San Martin Jilotepque obsidian and charactered them by neutron                  activation analysis. The results show that different regions have               distinct chemical signatures and thus archaeological materials can,             in principle, be matched to source of origin. A survey to locate                obsidian working areas has been carried out and small scale                     excavation conducted. With National Science Foundation support Mr               Braswell will now analyze the materials collected. He will conduct              additional neutron activation analyses to characterize sources more             precisely. Study of ceramics and radiocarbon dating of related                  materials will allow the construction of a more precise chronology.             Through study of obsidian remains recovered at archaeological sites             the process of manufacturing and distribution will then be                      ascertained.                                                                                                                                                    Because it was so spatially localized and so widely traded, it is               clear that obsidian played a major role in prehistoric economic and             social system of the Maya. Just how this production and trade was               organized however is not well understood. With his focus on a                   limited region with rich obsidian resources Mr. Braswell should                 gain important insights into this process.                                                                                                                      This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of how complex societies emerge and are maintained.               It will also assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
