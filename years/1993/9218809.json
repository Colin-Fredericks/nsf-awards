 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to investigate the implications of a new,                    unusually long (at least two hours) seismic wave train having                   periods of about 230 sec that was recorded at seismic stations                  throughout the world following the major eruption of Mount Pinatubo             in the Philippines on June 15, 1991.  Preliminary analysis                      indicates that this was a Rayleigh wave excited by atmospheric                  oscillations near the volcano that were set off by continuous                   thermal energy flux from the volcano.  If this conclusion is                    correct, one can expect similar oscillations for other eruptions                observed on the new NSF-supported Global Seismic Network (GSN).                 Acoustically coupled Rayleigh waves can be used for detection,                  characterization and quantification of major volcanic eruptions and             for study of the properties of the Earth's atmosphere.  A                       quantitative description of the source is desirable as it would                 allow us to estimate the amount of material injected in to the                  atmosphere which in turn permits us to estimate the general impact              on the environment.  Volcanic plumes pose a particular threat to                air traffic and the seismic signal emitted by large volcanic                    eruptions has the potential to yield rapid estimates about the                  plume dimensions.",
