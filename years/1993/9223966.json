 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223966  Russell    This award is to start a new Materials Research Group (MRG) at  Princeton University on the topic of microstructured  macromolecular soft materials.  The goal of the research is to  understand, control, and exploit these materials.  The research  addresses three major themes:  (1) block copolymers where the  meso-scale morphology is determined by block lengths and  thermodynamic incompatibilities of the constituents,   (2)  polymer-particle dispersions where the attachment of the block  copolymer at an interface leads to ordering in the colloidal  phase,  (3)  study of the properties of complex structured  fluids.  These three themes involve research on dynamics of  ordering, effects of shear on ordering, use of phase separated  systems as templates for nano-lithography, effects of block  copolymer structure on adsorption and ordering, tailoring of  fluid rheology through control of microstructure.    Microstructured soft materials order on the length scale of ten  to hundred nanometers, where structure formation or self assembly  occurs in the fluid state.  Structure formation is determined by  the balance among structural entropy, steric energy, and  electrostatic forces.  Examples of microstructured soft materials  include motor oils and lubricants, colloidal additives to  plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, paints and coatings, drilling  fluids, nano-lithography for electronics, and nonlinear optics.  The research involves collaboration with Exxon Corporate Research  Laboratories.  The institutional environment at Princeton  University is excellent for training advanced students for  careers in research and teaching.  ***",
