 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research on a wide range               of problems in complex analysis and integral geometry.  It                      divides into three main areas, the first being concerned with                   residues, the division problem and applications.  By this one                   understands the problem of finding solutions to the Bezout                      problem of finding multipliers which produce a constant sum of                  entire functions without common roots.  This is an algebra                      problem in the sense that one wants to generate a certain ideal                 from a collection of functions.  It may turn out that the ideal                 is the entire space.  This type of deconvolution is only of                     interest when one can control the degree of the multipliers.                    Answers to such questions leads to effective methods in                         arithmetic intersection theory.  The second line of investigation               concerns integral geometry on the Heisenberg group.  If the                     integral of a function taken over translates of the same curve by               an underlying group always results in a constant value, can one                 make any assertion about the function?  In one complex dimension                the answer is taught in undergraduate classes.  In higher                       dimensions the problem of deciding which are the admissible                     curves remains to be determined.  Finally, related work will be                 done on the inverse conductivity problem which in applications                  refers to the problem of determining interior characteristics of                a body from boundary measurements of conductivity.                                   The research in this project represent a combination of deep               theoretical ideas with close ties with applications to problems                 in electric impedance tomography, analysis of defects in                        materials, robotics and control theory.",
