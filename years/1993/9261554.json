When successfully developed, it will result in an                    important new capability for locating and monitoring trace                      organic species in the groundwater environment.                                                                                                                 The objective of the proposed program is to build on ongoing                    sensor and surface chemistry research at TPL so that the proposed               sensor system can yield practical results in several areas,                     including:  an improved understanding of the levels of organic                  chemicals at a pollution site, an automated mechanism for                       monitoring the migration of pollutants, a rapid and accurate                    assessment technique to assess the effects of purification                      technologies employed to mitigate hazardous waste problems.                                                                                                     The proposed research should result in a new sensor system with                 significant capabilities necessary for enhanced understanding of                the causes and effects of groundwater pollution and the efficacy                of treatments to repair the damage.",
