 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whereas most invertebrates (animals that lack backbones) live for               just a few weeks, ticks typically live for several years. Moreover,             one particular group of ticks, the Ornithodoros ticks, can survive              for several years without feeding. The proposed research will                   elucidate the behavioral and physiological means by which these                 ticks survive long periods of starvation.                                                                                                                       Ornithodoros ticks are the preeminent transmitters of relapsing                 fever to human and livestock. They are also the only biological                 transmitters of the African swine fever, a highly contagious                    disease against which drugs and vaccine are presently not                       available. The ability of the Ornithodoros ticks to harbor and                  transmit disease agents is enhanced by the fact that they feed on               a variety of birds, mammals and reptiles. No less significant are               their longevity and their ability to survive long periods of                    starvation. Because these ticks can live for as long as fifteen                 years without feeding, they are superb reservoirs of many                       bacterial, protozoan and viral diseases even in the absence of                  suitable hosts. A better understanding of the mechanisms for this               spectacular capability of a physiologically and ecologically                    rational strategy for their control.",
