After separation from                 the beam and other reaction products, recoil nuclei are polarized               by passage through an array of tilted carbon foils, after which                 they are implanted in a crystal host immersed in a strong                       magnetic field whose direction coincides with the polarization                  axis.  Angular distribution of the B-decay is asymmetric parallel               and anti-parallel to the polarization axis owing to the parity-                 violating nature of B-decay.  Search for the NMR involves                       applying a weak RF magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the                 polarization axis, and finding the frequency at which decay                     asymmetry disappears.  Knowledge of this frequency and of the                   magnetic field in which the nucleus precesses allows simple                     extraction of the nuclear magnetic moment.  The current focus of                this project is 23Mg, the last T = 1/2 mirror nucleus in the sd-                shell whose magnetic moment is unknown.  Successful measurement                 of its moment will supply an important nuclear datum to the study               of mirror nuclei in the sd-shell, and will contribute to the                    understanding of the shell model structure of the nucleus.                      Similar measurements are planned for other nuclei, both in the                  sd- and fp-shells.",
