 "awd_abstract_narration": "The approaches in computational geometry to date have  been largely theoretical and deal with discrete and  combinatorial structures such as point sets, lines, polygons,  polyhedra and at most general arrangement of hyperplanes.  This project considers the design and implementation of  efficient algorithms for an arbitrary arrangement of algebraic  curves and surfaces and specifically compact solids bounded by  curved algebraic surface patches.  The class of algebraic  surfaces, a subset of arbitrary analytic surfaces, provides  enough generality to accurately model almost all complex rigid  objects.  Additionally, algebraic curves and surfaces have  compact storage representation and form a class which is  complete under all common operations required by a geometric  modeling system.  Finally, representing physical objects with  algebraic surfaces encompasses all prior modeling approaches.  The main research thrusts of this project are:  (1) the design of efficient algorithms for basic operations on  algebraic surfaces (these manipulations include  intersection, parameterization, Ck-interpolation, and  approximation), and  (2) the design of efficient algorithms for basic manipulations  on solids bounded by algebraic surface patches (these  manipulations include: boolean set operations, convex hull,  decomposition, convolution, offset, blending, and smoothing  operations).",
