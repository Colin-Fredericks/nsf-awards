 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concurrent in the development of a Virtual                Design Laboratory (VDL): a system which uses virtual reality                    technology to design and  assemble prototypes of mechatronic                    systems rapidly and naturally.  For this research, virtual reality              can be thought of as the computer-generated simulation of real                  experience which immerses the computer user in any system of                    location which the computer can model. The research VDL                         system offers three advantages over current approaches to design:               (1) the VDL saves the designer a great deal of time in the design               process; (2) the VDL allows the designer to design in a more                    natural and less mathematical way without discounting the                       importance of mathematics to good design work; and (3) the VDL lets             the designer experiment with a very wide variety of parts,  and,                in fact, potentially experiment with every possible part                        option.  To develop a new machine using the VDL system, the                     designer wears a helmet and two powered master gloves.  The helmet              has a  computer-generated virtual reality display mounted in a type             of  faceshield to produce the virtual reality environment in front              of the designer's eyes.  The gloves have sensors in them to let the             designer \"feel\" and manipulate various machine parts in the virtual             reality environment.  The designer installs in the VDL the virtual              reality software developed as a catalog of parts by parts                       manufacturers.  In the resulting virtual reality display, the                   designer can see various computer-generated shelves, each shelf                 containing only one type of machine parts.  The designer                        manipulates the master gloves to have the computer-generated slave              gloves within the VDL choose from the shelves several parts to try              in the particular machine design and also to build the machine,                 both within the VDL.  These parts are not physically present.  They             exist in the VDL with all of their engineering properties having                been modeled mathematically in the virtual reality environment to               replicate the behavior of the actual part.                                           The objective of this research project is to determine the                 ground rules for the operations of the VDL through the design,                  construction, and control of a simple experimental design                       workstation.  The knowledge obtained from this preliminary research             will serve as a basis for the design and construction of the next-              generation design workstations.",
