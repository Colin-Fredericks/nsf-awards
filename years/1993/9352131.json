 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to create new avenues of                             interdisciplinary collaboration among students in the natural,                  social, and mathematical sciences through instruction in                        advanced computerized methods of data acquisition, analysis,                    and modeling. The project involves the departments of Biology,                  Mathematical Sciences, Physics and Chemistry, Psychology, and                   Social Sciences, and emphasizes computer-based research methods                 common to these departments.A common laboratory will house a                    network of Macintosh computers, software, and associated data                   acquisition boards including three powerful and versatile                       software packages, LabVIEW, STELLA II, and SYSTAT. Students                     will be introduced to the technology in an interdisciplinary                    laboratory course, \"Computers in the Sciences\". Skills and                      knowledge gained in this setting will be applied in various                     disciplinary laboratories, for which numerous experiments and                   exercises have already been designed and trial-tested in                        courses as diverse as Principles of Macroeconomics,                             Personality, and Neurobiology. Senior students will use these                   computing tools in their thesis projects, which will be                         presented in a new interdisciplinary seminar.We seek to                         generate an atmosphere of interdisciplinary collaboration using                 new laboratory technologies which students are likely to use in                 both graduate research and work settings. Students will be                      prepared to take their places in both basic and applied                         research projects which require an interdisciplinary                            perspective.",
