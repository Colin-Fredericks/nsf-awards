 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Dr. M. Morse  of the University of                   Utah will investigate the chemical bonding and electronic                       structure of diatomic transition metal molecules using                          electronic spectroscopy.  The methods include resonant                          two-photon ionization, high resolution laser-induced                            fluorescence, and dispersed fluorescence spectroscopy.  In all                  cases the samples are prepared by pulsed laser vaporization of                  a suitable metal target, followed by supersonic expansion with                  helium as the carrier gas.  The severe cooling that attends                     this expansion brings about significant reductions in the                       complexity of the spectra without which their analysis would be                 prohibitively difficult if not impossible.  The research will                   focus on the diatomic molecules of iron, cobalt, titanium,                      niobium, tantalum, and platinum, as well as on their mixed                      diatomic variants.                                                              %%%                                                                             Prof. Morse is recognized as an expert on gas phase transition                  metal dimer (and trimer) molecules.  The work is in an area of                  great relevance to disciplines ranging from computational                       quantum chemistry to the inorganic chemistry  of transition                     metal alloys.  The results of this research will be ground and                  excited state symmetries, bond strengths, bond lengths, and                     vibrational frequencies for the transition metal molecules                      studied.  These results in turn provide benchmark data for the                  development and testing of reliable quantum chemical models for                 transition metal molecules.",
