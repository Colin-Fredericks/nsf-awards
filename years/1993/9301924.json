 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of field-assisted combustion is proposed.  The                 planned research will focus on the role of electromagnetic fields               in the mechanism of self-sustaining reactions.  Preliminary                     observations have demonstrated that the imposition of electric                  fields alters markedly the kinetics of the process as well as the               nature of the products of combustion.  The goal of the study is to              provide a basis for the inclusion of a field as a processing                    parameter in combustion synthesis.  The proposed approach will                  focus on the use of thermal as well as material analyses to                     ascertain the role of the field.  These include the use of the                  Boddington-Laye method temperature profile analysis. Anticipated                results will determine the nature of the field effect in terms of               thermal or chemical contributions to the combustion wave reaction.              Both electric and magnetic field effects will be investigated.                                                                                                  The proposed work represents a continuation of the already                      established collaborative arrangement with FSU scientists in                    accordance with the established Memorandum of Understanding between             NSF and the FSU Academy of Sciences.  Participants from the FSU                 will include Professor Shteinberg from the Russian Institute (RISM)             of Structural Macro-kinetics, Professor Maximov (RISM), and Dr.                 Gedevanishili from the Tavadze Inst. of Metallurgy of the Georgia               Academy of Science.  The U.S. portion of the research will be                   carried out at UCD and the Russian portion conducted at the Tomsk               Branch of RISM at the main facility in Chernogolovka, and at the                Tavadze Institute if Metallurgy.  A coordinated research plan will              be conducted in the US and FSU initially on the same combustion                 systems and subsequent investigations will assume a different                   emphasis depending on the initial results.  It is anticipated that              the proposed research will impact both fundamental and applied                  aspects of combustion synthesis.",
