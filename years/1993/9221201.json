 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental aspects of the interaction of transition metals                     with silicon surfaces, particularly Ni, Co and Pd on Si(111)                    will be studied using advanced surface characterization                         techniques including \"hot STM\" with on-stage deposition for                     in situ, real time observations of atomic scale processes,                      synchrotron X-ray diffraction for studying buried                               interfaces, and Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM) which                     allows real time observations of crystal growth at high                         temperature.  With these complementary techniques, we aim to                    first characterize stages of overlayer growth from atoms to                     clusters to islands to layers, and secondly to monitor the                      growth process between these stages, emphasizing the                            connection between bulk and surface silicide phases. The                        long term goal is to develop quantitative and predictive                        models for reactive crystal growth processes relevant to                        advanced processing methods including low temperature                           molecular beam epitaxy, codeposition and template layers.                       %%%                                                                             This research is expected to provide fundamental new                            information about metal-semiconductor interfaces,                               particularly in the silicide systems, which are widely used                     for interconnects in VLSI technology.  State-of-the-art                         surface characterization instruments and methods will reveal                    atomic scale features of surface interactions in real time                      as reactions occur.  The metal/semiconductor materials under                    study have wide applicability in electronic and                                 optoelectronic devices, and a greater understanding of their                    primary materials science properties is expected to improve                     the performance of devices made from these materials.  New                      devices and device configurations may result from these                         studies as well as significant improvements in devices and                      integrated circuits currently used in computing, information                    processing, and telecommunications.",
