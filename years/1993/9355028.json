 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355028  Garrett    We propose Traineeships in Cognitive Science, with emphasis on  human language systems.  Cognitive Science is an inherently  interdisciplinary enterprise, and the program at Arizona provides  coverage in all principal areas of study.  For the purposes of the  GRT, however, we target natural language processing as the specific  interdisciplinary focus that will unite trainees' experience.   Every trainee will receive a grounding in formal, computational,  and experimental approaches to language study, and will bring that  training to bear on research problems that connect language to  other major classes of cognitive processing.    Each trainee will be a Ph.D. student in one of three departments  participating in the Arizona Cognitive Science program:  Linguistics, Psychology and Philosophy.  Major study areas in the  Cognitive Science Program are:  (1) Formal and Computational Models  of Language Structure, (2) Language Processing, (3) Linguistic and  Cognitive Development, (4) Visual Cognition, (5) Knowledge  Representation and Reasoning, (6) Cognitive Neuroscience.  All  students will undergo interdisciplinary training in areas (1) and  (2), and in addition will undertake study in at least one of the  other areas.  Each Trainee's program will include a GRT core  curriculum that identifies specific course work in areas (1) and  (2); this will be supplemented by material selected from other  areas suited ot the particular major and research interest of each  trainee.  ***",
