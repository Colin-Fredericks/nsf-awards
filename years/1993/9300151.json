 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will survey and document the scarcely                   known fishes inhabiting the deep, principal channels of the                     Brazilian Amazon.  Aquatic invertebrates and fish parasites will                also be sampled.  The project will also determine the large scale               and local scale distribution of fish species and correlate these                geographic patterns with environmental factors.  The collection                 data will become part of NEODAT, an on-line database of                         neotropical fish biodiversity.  This documentation of Amazonian                 deep channel fishes and their distribution is essential for                     monitoring biotic change and for planning fisheries management and              conservation along the Amazon.  The project will deposit research               and teaching collections of fishes and associated tissues in                    Brazilian and US institutions for voucher records, future studies               and the training of students.  Collaborating Brazilian                          institutions/scientists include: (1) the Brazilian government                   funding agency, CNPq; (2) two ichthyologists from the Museu de                  Zoologia and the Universidade de Sao Paulo, and two fish ecologist              at Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Belem; (3) one masters student               and two doctoral students, one of which is currently completing                 her PhD with the PI at Arizona; (4) and INPA researcher with a                  CNPq scholarship; and (5) five postdoctoral students who will                   receive research training at the University of Arizona in addition              to being part of the on-site research team.  Other collaborators                include researchers in the US (University of Washington),                       Venezuela (Universidad Central de Venezuela), France (ORSTROM) and              Germany (Max Planck Institute).                                                 %%%                                                                             This project will document the deep water fishes the Amazon River,              Brazil and the mouths of its major tributaries.  The results will               become part of a national fish biodiversity database and will be                critical to planning fisheries management and conservation for the              Amazon region.  The project includes training of Brazilian and US               students in the field as well as the laboratory in the most modern              methods of fish sampling and biodiversity research.",
