 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing economic equilibrium models assume that agents,                        participating in interactive systems, have precise knowledge of the             system, the environment in which it operates, and the behavior of               the other agents.  When such knowledge is not available, or when                differential information is possessed by different agents, the                  models assume that uncertain parameters are drawn from prior                    probability distributions which are known to the agents.  Since the             parameters and distributions assumed known are the correct ones,                these models may be considered objective.                                                                                                                       While some of the data available in interactive situations is                   objective, the vast majority is not.  For example, when one models              competition with uncertainty about production costs, any                        probability distribution over these parameters must be highly                   subjective.  Probability distributions over future prices and                   competitors' actions, which compound uncertainties about basic                  primitives with uncertainties about other agents' responses to such             uncertainties, become even more subjective.  A second criticism of              economic equilibria is the lack of dynamical systems describing the             learning processes that lead agents to equilibrium.  Without such               a process it is difficult to justify equilibrium analysis as a                  predictive model of agents' actual behavior.                                                                                                                    This project aims to address the above two issues.  Some well-                  established dynamic equilibrium concepts will be expanded to allow              economic agents to hold subjective beliefs.  The research will                  concentrate on (1) developing further theoretical methods in the                theory of Bayesian and Bounded Bayesian forecasting, and (2)                    applying these methods to some well-established equilibrium                     concepts in economic theory.  These include equilibrium analysis in             strategic environments, rational expectations equilibrium, and                  equilibrium analysis of more general social dynamics.",
