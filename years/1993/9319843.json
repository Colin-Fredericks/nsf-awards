 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319843  Townsend        This project will investigate the \"distributional histories\" of  larval cod on Georges Bank during the spring and early summer  period of developing thermal stratification.  The period of thermal  stratification is a time during which the intricacies of larval cod  vertical and areal distributions may hold important implications  for survival and ultimately recruitment.  This project will utilize  a new technique of otolith analyses (Sr/Ca ratios), which has  recently been developed, to hindcast the temperature histories, and  hence distributional histories (that is from the time of hatching  to capture), of individual cod larvae collected in various  hydrographic regimes in the Georges Bank area.  The technique will  be advanced by employing a new technology, electron energy loss  spectroscopy, which will increase the resolution of the Sr/Ca  technique to a level capable of resolving sub-daily temperature  histories.  These analyses could reveal diel vertical migrations  into or through a thermocline.    Larval cod are believed to be more closely associated with the  stratified waters on the sides of Georges Bank than the tidally  mixed waters on top of the Bank, and are transported around Georges  Bank and to the southwest with the residual circulation.  The  abundances of their zooplankton prey are also more abundant on the  stratified side of the thermal front in early spring, and the  larvae are often associated with the depth of maximum prey  abundance in the thermocline.  Later in the year the late larvae  and early juveniles are on the top of the Bank, where zooplankton  densities become greater than on the flanks.  The exact nature of  the vertical and areal distributions of the larvae in relation to  mixed and stratified waters may be very important with regard to  horizontal transport processes, temperature effects on growth, and  the availability of zooplankton prey items.  This project will  employ new technology to examine the distributions of cod larvae  a nd will form a collaborative link with an already-funded study  (NOAA) that focuses on the physics of the vernal stratification  process as it relates to the complete suite of zooplankton, and the  distribution, growth and condition of cod and haddock larvae, thus  making for a strong interdisciplinary program.   ***",
