The  project is developing field-oriented student research that  encompasses and synthesizes elements of both disciplines.  The  project involves an investigation of a well-exposed mylonite  zone located approximately 10 miles from campus.  Students  first are studying it as part of a petrology project; the  following semester they are continuing their research on the  mylonite zone as part of a class project in structural geology,  incorporating their data from the petrology class.  Critical to  this project is the ability of the students to work  cooperatively. Groups are working on different parts of the  mylonite zone, so they are sharing their data and are working  together to formulate ideas and working models.    ***",
