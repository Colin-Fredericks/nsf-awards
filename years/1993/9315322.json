 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315322  Hockberger  The goal of this project is to  build a bridge between advanced  concepts of neurocontrol from  neuroengineering, and substantial  experimental evidence on control  systems in higher organisms.  Past  collaborations between biologist  and experts in neurocontrol have  been relatively few and theoretical   in nature (Madhavan et al., 1993).   On theoretical grounds, they have  suggested that the inferior olive  in the mammalian brain is an  example of what is called an  \"adaptive critic\" network in  neuroengineering.  The purpose of  this project is to provide the  first serious experimental  evaluation of the theory, and if  possible, some empirical  understanding of the learning  mechanisms used to adapt that  network.  If successful, this  project should open the door to  much better two-way communication  between theory and experiment, to  the benefit of both; thus learning  mechanisms in the brain once   identified might in engineering,  and ideas from engineering might be  used to develop a more mathematical  understanding of these circuits.   The results form this project will  be incorporated into ongoing  theoretical collaborations between  biologist and engineers.  ***",
