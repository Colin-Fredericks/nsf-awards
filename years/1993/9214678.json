 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study particle acceleration in solar flares.             A key problem in solar flare physics is the manner in which protons             and other particles are accelerated to several tens of MeV in a few             seconds as evidenced by impulsive \u001a-ray emission. This process is               called first-phase ion acceleration. The most widely accepted                   models in explaining this acceleration are shock acceleration and               stochastic acceleration by Alfven or magnetosonic waves. Neither of             these models has been developed self-consistently or has direct                 observational verification. This project examines the consistent                development of a single-loop manetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave                      stochastic acceleration model. A half-loop is divided into 2                    coronal sections attached to a model chromosphere and photosphere.              The coronal sections include the source where time-dependent                    acceleration including wave-particle and wave-wave interactions                 occurs, and a transport section in which protons propagate                      diffusively. Unlike previous work, it will be a complete model for              nonrelativistic energies including a nuclear interaction                        calculation. Thus, it will be possible to study the effect of                   changing the spectrum and/or power of turbulence in the source, the             loop size, etc., throughout the whole loop. In short, we shall be               able to put the stochastic acceleration model to a very thorough                test. Observational consequences in prompt \u001a-ray emission come from             the nuclear interaction part of the calculation. These results will             increase our understanding in this important area of solar                      research.                                                                       #",
