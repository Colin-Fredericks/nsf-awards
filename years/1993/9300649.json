Investigators from the University of Miami and Florida Atlantic                 University, will initiate field work and research that are directed             at fundamental scientific issues relating to the impact of                      Hurricane ANDREW on the south Florida marine ecosystem.  Following              the initial field work and planning provided by this project,                   formal research proposals will be submitted through the normal                  peer-review process.  The timely initiation of this immediate field             research, will enhance these longer-term and larger-scale research              activities.                                                                                                                                                     The tasks to be covered by this project include:                                   -  Sediment characterization   Dr. Harold Wanless                               -  Sediment/organics characterization   Dr. Peter Swart                         -  Mangrove effects characterization   Dr. Samuel Snedaker                      -  Seagrass characterization   Peggy Fong                                       -  Nutrients/coral reef characterization   Dr. Alina Szmant                     -  Endangered turtle species effects   Dr. Peter Lutz                           -  Exotic tree species distributions   Dr. Daniel Austin                        -  Exotic fish species distributions  Dr. Walter Courtenay                                                                                                   In addition to these research tasks, the funding will help support              a special session on Hurricane ANDREW environmental consequences at             the Symposium on the Florida Keys Regional Ecosystem, being                     organized by RSMAS for mid-November 1992 in Miami.",
