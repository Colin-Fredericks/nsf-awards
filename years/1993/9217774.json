 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing                     Initiative and is supported by both the Chemistry and Materials                 Research Divisions. Several computer simulation techniques will                 be applied to study the formation and properties of thin                        metallic films.  The simulations closely mimic the laboratory                   formation of both amorphous and ordered thin films by atom                      deposition.  Solid-liquid and solid-solid interfaces in                         metallic systems will be simulated separately to gain a better                  understanding of stability and elastic properties of thin                       films.  The atomic interactions are described by the Embedded                   Atom Method-type interaction potentials that will reproduce                     data from a wide range of condensed phase experiments. A                        systematic analysis of the microscopic structure will be used                   to characterize short-range order in amorphous films, defects                   in ordered films, the effect of controllable parameters on film                 morphology, and the decay of structural correlations at                         interfaces. The microscopic models generated in the simulations                 will be used to study two-level systems, vibrational modes and                  elastic properties of the films. Comparison will be made with                   experimental data on (1) two-level systems and vibrational                      modes in amorphous copper-zirconium films and, (2)                              layer-by-layer growth of platinum films at low temperature.                     %%%                                                                             Computer simulations of metallic film growth, surface                           morphology and surface-liquid interfaces will clarify the                       results of specific experiments and in some cases will provide                  insights into microscopic events not directly amenable to                       experiment.",
