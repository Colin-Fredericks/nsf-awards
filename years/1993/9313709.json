The Navy is                 providing the civilian academic ocean science community with a                  unique, first-time opportunity to make scientific measurements                  under the ice in the Arctic Ocean from a nuclear powered submarine.             This cruise is scheduled for the late summer and is a prototype for             potential future submarine science cruises.  SSXCTDs are submarine-             launched counterparts to XCTDs that are deployed from research                  vessels.  These free-falling probes measure seawater temperature                and conductivity as a function of depth.  Use of SSXCTDs are                    crucial to the planned physical oceanography program on the                     submarine.                                                                                                                                                      Making ocean science measurements, especially under the ice cap,                from an operational submarine has long been of interest to civilian             investigators.  This summer's cruise represents an opportunity to               test the feasibility of using operational submarines for basic                  scientific research.",
