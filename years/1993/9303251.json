 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolution of wing pattern variation in Neotropical mimetic             Heliconius butterflies (altogether 38 species in the genus) is an               ideal system for investigating the roles of genetic drift and                   natural selection in the formation of geographical races.  Years of             studying this system have failed to reveal underlying mechanisms to             which a stunning diversity of distinct allopatric forms may be                  attributed.  By identifying RAPD molecular genetic markers that co-             segregate with wing-pattern alleles in backcrossed broods, it will              be possible to identify and sequence nuclear DNA fragments linked               to pattern-altering alleles from multiple geographical races of a               widespread species (Heliconius erato).  A phylogenetic analysis of              each pattern-related marker among different H. erato races will be              compared to an independent phylogenetic hypothesis of intraspecific             relationships from a mitochondrial gene, to determine if similar                wing patterns in allopatric races have been maintained over time by             selection, or have arisen multiply and independently from separate              ancestors.                                                                      %%%                                                                             Results will enhance our understanding of the roles of alternate                evolutionary forces in the production of a mimicry complex and                  provide a preliminary template for genomic map studies in                       Heliconius.  This study will also illuminate the effects of                     selection on phenotype at the molecular level.  The possibility of              identifying genes that are functionally involved in pattern                     formation is an exciting one, for it has been hypothesized that the             developmental pathway responsible for wing patterns is homologous               in all butterflies (and possibly all Lepidoptera).  If this is                  true, it would have far reaching implications for molecular                     developmental biology in general.",
