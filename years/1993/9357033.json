 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.               The awardee is using a combined genetic, biochemical, and cell                  biological approach to understand how centrosomes (spindle pole                 bodies) replicate in cells, using as a model cell the yeast                     Saccharomyces cerevisiae.                                                       %%%                                                                             The centrosome is a subcellular organelle made up of a highly                   organized set of microtubules.  It serves as a microtubule                      organizing center for the cell, and is critical to the process of               mitosis.  During cell division, the genetic information of the                  cell, contained in the chromosomes, is apportioned equally between              the two daughter cells by means of microtubules arrayed in a                    structure called the mitotic spindle.  During the mitotic process,              chromosomes are dragged from the center of the spindle to either of             the two poles at opposite ends of the spindle, such that by the end             of the process each pole contains the appropriate chromosomes for               each daughter cell and the separation is complete.  This process is             controlled by the centrosomes, one of which sits at each pole of                the spindle.  At the end of cell division, each daughter cell                   receives the chromosomes and centrosome from one of the spindle                 poles.  Thus, the centrosome must replicate before another round of             cell division can be completed.   This project will use modern                  molecular and cellular biology approaches, including the use of                 yeast mutants defective in centrosome replication, to understand                how centrosomes replicate and function.",
