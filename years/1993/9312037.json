They will  contract with MRNet for delivery of Internet services.  These  services would support joint projects on the FDLCC campus and on  the Fond du Lac Reservation funded by the Department of Energy,  the National Science Foundation, and the Environmental Protection  Agency specifically designed to support young Native Americans in  pursuing scientific careers.       FDLCC would be the first Minnesota Community College System  campus to join MRNEt and one of the first American Indian Higher  Education Consortium (AIHEC) members to offer Internet services  on campus.  FDLCC would be in a good position to provide  leadership and technical assistance, especially in utilizing  Internet services,other AIHEC institutions.       The College needs greater functionality and network speed to  be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail  system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.   This is also a unique opportunity for the school to explore  innovative educational resources.  ***",
