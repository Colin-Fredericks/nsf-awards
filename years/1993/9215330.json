 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling of the perturbations of atmospheric emissions                     due to gravity waves and tides at mesopause altitudes (85km)                    provides insight into the coupling between chemistry and                        dynamics in this region. Without theoretical models to serve                    as a guide, ambiguities will exist in the interpretation of                     nightglow observations of gravity waves and tides. The Na-D                     nightglow has never been modeled in terms of gravity wave                       forcing. The modeling of the effects of gravity waves on the                    Na layer, as revealed, in lidar measurements have until now                     only included dynamics and not considered chemistry.                                 We propose to model gravity wave-driven fluctuations in                    the sodium nightglow by developing a model that incorporates                    both dynamics and chemistry. This new model will use the                        most recent self-consistent model of the sodium chemistry,                      including reactions involving neutral species, ions and                         cluster-ions. The dynamics will be based on linear gravity                      wave theory but will include the generalized effects of eddy                    diffusivities. Na and OH nightglow measured with an all-sky                     camera system will provide us with the horizontal wavelength                    and period, and azimuth of propagation and the relative                         intensity variations of the two nightglows for comparison                       with the Na nightglow fluctuation models and OH nightglow.",
