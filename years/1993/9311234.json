The investigator plans to use the system in  conducting analyses of environmental samples  in research on processes to remove organic  contaminants from water and wastewaters and  to concentrate chemical compounds of  potential value from waste materials produced  during processing of agricultural products  and from industrial operations.    The costs of bringing water up to desired  quality standards and in treatment of  wastewater to minimize undesirable  environmental impact can be reduced by  removal of organic compounds and recovering  their resource values.  The equipment  purchased under this award will also  contribute to the education of students.  The  proposal leading to this award was submitted  in accord with conditions contained in the  Program Announcement and Guidelines,  \"Research Equipment Grant Program,\" NSF 90-  146.",
