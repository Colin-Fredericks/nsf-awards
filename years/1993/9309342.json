 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research stresses the flexible fixturing problem with a               main goal of developing a computer-aided fixturing system for                   modular fixture applications in CIMS.  The research includes three              aspects:  computer-aided fixture design, computer-aided fixture                 design evaluation and computer-aided fixturing management.  Methods             used are unique and practical.  In fixture design, this research                studies how to acquire and utilize previous design experience and               how to practically generate a fixture design.  A locating method                dominated fixuring requirement analysis and fixture structure                   analysis are performed as the basis of the fixture design.  In                  fixture design evaluation, criteria are explored for automated                  fixture design verification.  In fixturing management, fixture                  station management and communication with other manufacturing                   departments are studied.  Therefore, fixturing activity can be                  integrated with CAD/CAPP/CAM and production control systems.                         This  project provides an engineering tool for using computer              technology to design, verify, and manage modular fixtures.  The                 application of the research results may contribute to:  (1) making              FMS truly flexible and CIMS practically feasible; (2) significantly             reducing fixture design and fabrication time and cost in small and              batch production; (3) improving quality of fixture design with the              utilization of previous design experience, fixturing analysis, and              fixture design evaluations; and (4) providing a practical tool for              industry to deal with complex fixturing problems by using computer              technology.",
