 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Wolczanski of Cornell University will conduct                         investigations of early transition metal oxo and nitrido                        compounds with funding from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                    Organometallic Program.  In one phase of the studies he will                    investigate small molecule activation by low-coordinate                         electrophilic metal centers such as zirconium and titanium                      compounds of bulky hard pi donors.  Reactions of these                          compounds with alkanes, alkenes, and arenes will be studied for                 their ability to cleave the C-H and C-C bonds.  The other phase                 of the work will be directed towards preparing new materials by                 use of early transition metal complexes as precursors.  These                   precursors will have strong pi donor ligands such as nitrides                   and amides.  It is anticipated that use of these precursors                     will enable the synthesis of materials that are more complex                    than those obtained by conventional high-temperature methods.                   %%%                                                                             The chemistry of a class of early transition metal molecules                    that have bonds through nitrogen and oxygen atoms will be                       studied for two reasons.  One is that these compounds display                   unusual and unique reactivity with C-C and C-H bonds in other                   molecules.  The other is that they can be used as molecular                     precursors in the synthesis of novel materials of high                          complexity.  It is hoped that these studies will lead to                        improved methods of controlling the reactivity of hydrocarbons                  and of designing interesting materials.",
