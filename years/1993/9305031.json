 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose an ambitious mineral surface chemistry project                       that will proceed on two parallel and complementary fronts.                     One project deals with the study of the electronic structure                    of individual atomic sites on mineral surfaces.  The other                      project deals with heterogeneous redox reactions.                               Theoretical,  experimental, and analytic methods will be                        employed .  Including scanning tunneling microscopy,                            electron tunneling spectroscopy, scanning (atomic) force                        microscopy, x-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron                                 spectroscopies, Auger electron spectroscopy and scanning                        Auger microscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and                          secondary electron microscopy.  Theoretical aspects of  this                    study will deal primarily with electron tunneling and the                       electronic properties of surfaces.  The specific objectives                     in Part I are a) to calculate the electronic structure of                       individual atoms on both \"perfect\" and defective surfaces of                    hematite, pyrite, and galena, b) to use this information to                     interpret tunneling images and spectra collected in vacuum                      and non-vacuum environments, and c) to relate our findings                      to theories/speculations on \"reactive sites\" on mineral                         surfaces.  The objectives in Part II are a) to determine the                    specific mechanisms by which Mn(II)aq is oxidized on mineral                    surfaces, b) to determine the influence of trace amounts of                     other environmentally important metals, and c) to relate our                    findings to other heterogeneous  redox and non-redox systems                    involving the interaction of aqueous metals on oxides.  If                      successful, our results will be applicable to nearly every                      aspect of mineral surface chemistry.",
