 "awd_abstract_narration": "9217217  Lanni  The goal of this project is the construction of a fluorescence  microscope for high-speed, high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging  of biological specimens. The approach to be taken is a direct extension  of Standing-Wave Fluorescence Microscopy, demonstrated in this  laboratory previously. The proposed instrument will incorporate a  laser-based optical system for excitation field sYnthesis, in which  standing wave fields are time-multiplexed in the specimen to create an  effective intensity field that is peaked at the in-focus object plane.  Fluorescence emission will therefore be excited maximally from only  in-focus object features. Serial focal plane images will then be  recorded in the usual way, by use of an electronic (CCD) camera. The  optical transfer function for this field-synthesis fluorescence  microscope (FSFM) covers a band of axial spatial frequencies not  accessible through classical optical sectioning microscopy. In  principle, this instrument has the speed and transverse resolution of  an imaging system, and axial resolution comparable to or better than a  scanning confocal microscope.    The significance of this project in the biological sciences can be  stated concisely. Microscopes are most severely limited in axial, as  opposed to transverse, resolution. This problem is rectified by  confocal scanning, but with a loss of the fast, efficient information  transfer that occurs in direct image formation. In many biological  problems, particularly in studies of live cells, speed and photometric  efficiency are primary constraints. The field-synthesis fluorescence  microscope is designed specifically to give improved axial resolution  while still retaining the high-performance characteristics of an  imaging system.",
