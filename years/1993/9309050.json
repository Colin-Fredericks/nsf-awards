 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309050  Mayer  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which is to formulate and  validate mechanistic relationships for  physical nonequilibrium movement of  contaminants in groundwater as a function of  the physical properties of the media through  which flow occurs in the unsaturated zone  above the water table.  The project involves  experiments with four different porous media  derived from a silica sand obtained from  Michigan's Keweenaw peninsula containing  little or no organic matter and exhibiting  little or no micro-porosity.  The sand will  be separated into four fractions based on  particle sizing to obtain the requisite  variations in pore-size characteristics  necessary to validate the mathematical models  of flow.    The proposal leading to this award was  submitted in response to NSF 92-122, Research  Initiation Awards Program Announcement and  Guidelines.  Results are expected to improve  the predictive capabilities for transport of  solutes in the unsaturated zone.  This in  turn is expected to provide improvement in  the ability to predict the movement  characteristics of groundwater pollutants and  contaminants for potential use in engineering  design of remediation systems for groundwater  polluted by seepage from ponds, surface and  subsurface storage tanks and landfills.",
