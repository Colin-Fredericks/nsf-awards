 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I SBIR project proposes a field                                      adaptation and evaluation of a prototype in situ                                geotechnical testing system for earthquake                                      resistance.  The system is to provide reliable                                  estimates for soil deposits of the in situ cyclic shear                         vs strain characteristics needed by dynamic                                     earthquake analyses such as liquefaction, cyclic                                degradation and deformation, and undegraded                                     nonlinear inelastic characteristics.                                                                                                                            Problems to be addressed include reliably                                       predicting amplified motions, liquefaction, and                                 deformations of soil deposits - sources of                                      significant seismic loss.  While this area has been                             advanced considerably, fundamental improvements                                 in estimating soil characteristics are still greatly                            needed.  Earthquake-like cyclic loads are to be                                 applied.  Tests, however, are to be conducted in                                situ with many steps to preserve in situ conditions.                            Recent laboratory prototype tests show promise in                               the proposed approach and the potential is good to                              apply it to retrofitting of existing critical                                   constructed facilities for earthquake resistance and                            in land use planning for seismically active areas.",
