 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three research projects that explore some recent and  innovative methodologies of active interest in time series  analysis are investigated. The first focuses on the problem of  obtaining robust recursive estimates for ARMA models, and will  initially address a number of important issues that arise when  redescending robust criteria are employed in the recursive  procedure. In the second project, applications and finite sample  properties associated with the spectral envelope methodology for  analyzing categorical time series are investigated. The extension  of this methodology to real-valued time series is also explored.   The development and integration of exploratory time series  analysis methods within the dynamic graphical environment is  considered in the final project, and provides an effective means  to perform the research involved in each project concurrently.           The development of new procedures for analyzing time series  data is an important and active area of research across a variety  of disciplines.  Typically, time series analysis is equated with  data that is observed sequentially over time (eg. stock market  prices, temperature), but in other disciplines \"time\" may simply  be a positional index that defines, for example, the order of the  base-pair codings (a,t,g,c) in DNA sequences.  In this project,  three innovative approaches to time series analysis are  investigated.  The first concerns the problem of retaining the  ability to obtain useful information about a time series process  when aberrant observations may be present.  The second approach  deals with the concept of a \"spectral envelope\" which provides an  objective criterion for assessing periodic patterns in  qualitative series such as DNA sequences.  A large component of  the research involved in both these approaches will be  incorporated into the last project where the development of  highly interactive exploratory graphical methods for time series  analysis is pursued.",
