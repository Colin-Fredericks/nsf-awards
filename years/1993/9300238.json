 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300238  Plummer  This award supports Professors E. Ward Plummer of the University of  Tennessee, Peter Dowben of Syracuse University, and N. John DiNardo  of Drexel University to collaborate in condensed matter physics with  three German counterparts: Professor Klaus Rademann and Dr. Ourania  Rademann of the University of Marburg and Dr. Eckart Ruhl of the  Free University of Berlin.  The purpose of their cooperative  research is to develop a picture of the fundamental mechanisms for  the nonmetal to metal transition in the simple metals.  The  collaborative plan brings together three U.S. experimentalists who  have done substantial research on the nonmetal transition in two  dimensions and at solid surfaces to work with three German  experimentalists who have done complementary research on the  transition in clusters.  The research requires substantial  experimental work at a synchrotron light source, as well as access  to other very specialized analytical equipment.  The German  collaborators are able to provide access to the German facility  known as BESSY, in Berlin, while the U.S. collaborators will arrange  for joint work at the U.S. National Synchrotron Light Source and  other U.S. facilities suitable for the very complicated  characterizations of alkali metal in surface islands and surface  aggregates.  Both U.S. and German postdoctoral associates and  graduate students will be involved in the collaborative research.    Transition metal clusters and aggregates exhibit a nonmetal to metal  transition with increasing cluster size.  Similar transitions have  been observed for transition metal layers on solid surfaces.  So  far, the in-depth study needed to demonstrate a direct connection  between metal to nonmetal transition in clusters and at surfaces has  been done successfully only for one metal, mercury.  These  investigators propose to expand that base of knowledge by  undertaking the necessary comparative research on transition in  alkali metals.  Since data already exist on alkali b ehavior in  surface layers, the joint research will focus principally on the  transition in clusters.  Results from this research will contribute  to understanding the basis for the difference in behavior between  metals and non-metals.  ***",
