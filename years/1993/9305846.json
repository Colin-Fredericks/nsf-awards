 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305846  Robbins  Heterochromatin is a substantial fraction of every eukaryotic  genome and has a number or remarkable characteristics.  Nevertheless, few heterochromatic functions have been identified.  Among those few are the ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA)and Rex         (Ribosomal exchange), a maternal-effect cominant that induces rDNA  recombination during early mitotic divisions in embryos produced by  Rex females. Rex has now been shown to be a repeated element  located within the rDNA array. Deletion of rDNA repeats at the  sites of Rex induced exchange suggests that chromosome breakage is  involved. An endonuclease produced by an active variant of one of  the insertion sequences found in all rDNA arrays could be the basis  of active variant of one of the insertion sequences found in all  rDNA arrays could be the basis of Rex. Analysis of this system will  continue in three areas: 1) Molecular and genetic analysis of the  nature and action of Rex, 2) Rapid mapping of rDNA arrays by use of  Rex-induced recombination, 3) Analysis of the properties of  recombinant rDNA arrays.  %%%  Roughly thirty percent of the genome of the fruit fly is  constitutive heterochromatin and yet little is known about either  its structure or function. Rex can provide a tool for learning more  about these chromosomal regions in the fruit fly, which knowledge  can be then extrapolated to other eukaryotic organisms in which  these type of experiments cannot be done.  ***",
