The principal themes of this work are the fundamental problems of  finding various criteria for the uniform persistence of these  considered systems, the global stability of steady states, the  existence of periodic solutions and spatial patterns, and the  existence of chaotic behaviors.  These topics indeed cover most  aspects of the so-called global qualitative analysis of nonlinear  systems.  In particular, the investigator studies some  mathematical models of populations dispersing among patches in  heterogeneous environments, where various kind of interactions  are considered. In addition to performing the traditional local  stability or bifurcation analysis, he considers global stability,  bifurcation, and chaos aspects of the nonlinear systems.       Time delays and space variations constitute  integral components of most ecological, biological,  physiological, chemical, physical, economic and atmospheric  processes.  Almost all these real-life processes are nonlinear in  nature.  They are normally too complicated to simulate in a lab,  or too difficult to understand from experimental work alone.  In  order to better manage or control such processes, it is necessary  to study them mathematically.  Most of the previous approaches to  these applied mathematical problems have been local (pretending  the system behaves in a small region as if it were linear rather  than nonlinear) and thus do not paint the whole picture of the  real systems.  This project tries to gain a full view of the  real picture by focusing on the nonlinear effects of the dynamics  of the considered systems.  This work offers a better  understanding of the dynamic interplay of the effects of time  delays and diffusions.  In particular, the final results can be  useful to ecologists, engineers, and system scientists.  ***",
