 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309061  Ketterson    This project is devoted to the study of the order parameter  collective modes in the condensed matter systems, principally  superfluid 3He and superconducting UPt3.  Superfluid 3He is known  to have an unconventional superfluid order parameter and there is  growing evidence that the same is true of UPt3.  This project will  continue investigations of collective mode phenomena in superfluid  3He with special emphasis on shear wave propagation and electric  field effect splittings.  A prediction by the principal  investigator, that many collective modes (not just nmr) can be made  for the order parameter collective modes in UPt3 using ultrasonic  attenuation or electromagnetic absorption.  Their observation would  establish the existence if this phenomena in a superconductor (a  topic that has long been debated since the development of  conventional superconductor theory) and could open the way to their  observation in conventional superconductors.  %%%  Quantum systems exhibit complex wave or Vibrational behavior which  can be probed by sending sound waves or magnetization waves through  them.  Similar techniques can be used to probe the degree to which  a system is magnetic or superfluid or superconducting.  This  project uses novel acoustic and other means to study a special  superfluid 3He and a so-called unconventional superconductor, UPt3.   The experiments will shed light on why all superconductors are not  the same, and will provide fundamental information that will be of  interest in practical superconductors, the high-Tc superconductors,  and other complex assemblies which include liquids, solids, nuclei  and even neutron stars.  ***",
