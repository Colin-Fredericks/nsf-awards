 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hydrothermal vent/seawater mixing zone is truly one of the most             intense interfaces on Earth.  A whole series of reactions alter the             incipient hydrothermal flux and regulate the net transfer of                    elements from metal-rich vent solutions to seawater.  Some metal                precipitate while others escape in dissolve form.  Some metals                  precipitates scavenge trace metals from seawater and other                      partially redissolve.  However, within this conceptual framework,               the complex interactions and net effects of hydrothermal processes              on the concentrations of trace metals in seawater are just                      beginning to be pieced together.  This effort will carry out an                 integrated program on trace metals in hydrothermal systems during               the next three years.  The research will include analyses of                    samples already on hand as well as new field and experimental work              to be coordinated with several independently-funded researchers in              the following areas:  (1) Vent Fluid and Plume Processes, (2)                   Preservation of Hydrothermal Precipitates, and (3) Implications for             Geochemical Cycles.  The investigation will focus on trace metals               that have values for the \u0131(M/Fe)plume particles/(M/Fe)vent fluid!               ratio >10 or <0.1 (excluding Mn) and/or some of the metals as yet               univestigated in vent fluids/plumes for which preliminary data is               very promising including Ga, Bi, Sb, Co, Ni and Tl.",
