 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to bridge educational research and                          classroom practice through the establishment of                                 collaborative partnerships among university educational                         researchers and practicing middle school classroom science                      teachers.  Expected results include (a) enhancing the                           expertise and professionalism of middle school science                          teachers in the state of Texas, and (b) producing a field-                      tested model for the development and integrated mathematics                     and science problem-solving curricula.  There are three                         major objectives of the project: (1) to plan, design,                           execute, and evaluate a project that develops and enhances                      teachers' abilities to teach science; (2) to design, filed                      test and revise a prototype of a model for the development                      of middle school problem-solving curricula; and (3) to                          evaluate the model's effectiveness in answering research                        questions that pertain to the teaching and learning of                          science.  Texas teachers will be involved at two levels.                        Three master teachers specifically chosen because of their                      areas of expertise in mathematics, science, and computers,                      will collaboratively execute all aspects of the project,                        including workshop teaching to other teachers and                               collaborative research with university researchers; and 30                      pilot teachers, chosen from a pool of teachers throughout                       the state of Texas, who will receive instruction, write and                     field test the prototype, and assist in the research                            activities of the project.  The significant of the project                      is that it provides a mechanism for interpreting research                       data and their cognitive worth within the context of good                       science teaching.                                                                                                                                               Cost sharing is equivalent to 2.0% of the NSF award.",
