The proposed program is structurally  innovative in that it combines the disciplines of human-computer  interaction and cognitive science to develop computer systems that  interact with humans via spoken language.  The proposed program  addresses national research needs as identified by the NSF.  OGI's  Center for Spoken Language Understanding has created the first  academic program in the U.S. designed specifically to provide  students with the background and research skills needed to develop  spoken language systems.    Innovative inter-institutional components of the proposed program  include:  (1) partnerships with the University of Texas at El Paso  (UTEP) and Clark Atlanta University (CAU), whose undergraduate  populations are predominantly composed of students from under-  represented minorities; (2) outreach and recruitment efforts  through the partner institutions to interest and involve students  in advanced study in spoken language interfaces; and (3) multi-  level team-based support of the trainees in OGI's program.  ***",
