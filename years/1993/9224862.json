Popov at the Joint                               Institute of Nuclear Research, Dubna.  The                                      workshop will focus on the study of parity and                                  time reversal symmetry violation in neutron                                     physics.  A prime motivation for holding the                                    workshop in Russia is that much of the early work                               in the study of parity violation was carried out                                by scientists in Moscow, Dubna, St. Petersburg                                  and Novosibirsk.  Since 1987 much of the major                                  work on symmetry violation has been carried out                                 by the TRIPLE collaboration working at the Los                                  Alamos Neutron Scattering Center.  Half of the                                  funds are to support attendance by graduate                                     students and research associates.                                                                                                                               This project in physics fulfills the program                                    objectives of advancing science by enabling                                     leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine                               complementary talents and pool research resources                               in the areas of strong mutual interest and                                      competence.",
