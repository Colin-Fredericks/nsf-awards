 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314619  Lomax    This is a SGER (small grant for exploratory research) award to  obtain crucial preliminary data for the future investigation on  the mechanisms of interaction between the two plant hormones,  auxin and cytokinin.  Auxin and cytokinin are two of the most  important plant hormones.  They are integrally involved in most  steps in plant growth and development.  There is a long history  of research in this area, however, as yet we know nothing about  how the two hormones interact with each other, how the ratio of  the two is measured by the plant, and surprisingly little about  the mode of action of either hormone. Recently, Dr. Lomax has  discovered that a mutant of tomato, the diageotropica (dgt)  mutant which is insensitive to auxin, has elevated cytokinin  levels as compared to wild type plants.  Dr. Lomax hypothesizes  that elevated cytokinin levels produce phenotypic effects which  mimic an auxin-insensitive phenotype. She proposes that expanded  studies on the biosynthesis and metabolism of cytokinin and the  regulation of auxin responses in dtg may yield significant new  insight into the interactions of these two important hormones.  This is an exploratory research into an important subject which  has not been amenable to more conventional approaches.  It is  expected that if successful, the results of this study may  provide an emerging opportunity to determine the mode of action  for both auxin and cytokinin.  ***",
