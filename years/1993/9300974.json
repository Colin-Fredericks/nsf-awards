 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300974  Smith       Ordinary differential equations, equations with time delays,  reaction-diffusion systems containing time delays, and hyperbolic  partial differential equations with nonlocal boundary conditions  arise naturally in population biology, epidemiology, and in  neural modeling.  They are commonly used in the biological  modeling of populations.  The focus of this project is on means  of determining the long-term behavior of solutions of this wide  variety of differential equations.  From the dynamical systems  point of view,  the investigator aims to find and exploit common  features of the dynamics exhibited by this wide class of systems  in order to determine asymptotic behavior.  Monotonicity, the  preservation of a partial order relation on the space of initial  states by the dynamics, is one such feature shared by many  systems that model competing populations of organisms, neurons,  etc.  More realistic models often take the form of complex  hyperbolic systems modeling the time-evolution of densities of  populations structured by size, age, stored nutrient, etc.   Often, in their original form, these systems are mathematically  intractable and means must be found to transform them to simpler,  more well-understood, dynamical systems.  Finding transformations  of these complicated systems to simpler ones is an aim of the  present study.       Mathematical modeling of interacting populations  of organisms, neurons, etc., is an important area of  current interest.  The goal is to try to explain observations of  complex behavior in real populations by ignoring all but the  \"essential\" features of the interactions and constructing  simplified models of these systems that are amenable to  mathematical analysis.  If too much biology is ignored in the  modeling then the models do not mirror the interactions of real  populations; if too little is ignored, the models become so  complicated that present knowledge does not permit successful  analysis.  Progress in applying the rapidly d eveloping field of  dynamical systems to biological systems has steadily pushed this  fine line between biologically irrelevant models and  mathematically intractable ones forward, so that ever more  biology can be incorporated into the models, making them more  realistic to biologists, better mirrors of real populations,  while yet remaining tractable.  Essentially, the aim of this  project is to push further in this direction.  ***",
