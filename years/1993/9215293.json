 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses three problem areas in the theory of algorithms  and computational complexity, with the goal to increase knowledge  about the power and limitations of various computational models for  solving specific problems.  (1) The first part aims at  deriving lower bounds for the computational difficulty of computing  Boolean functions by circuits.  (2) The second part deals with the analysis  of on-line computational problems, that is, problems where the input is  provided as a sequence of requests and an output response must be  produced as the sequence is being received rather than after all  requests are known.  The aim in a particular situation is to develop an  algorithm whose performance compares favorably with the best off-line  algorithm for the problem.  The focus of the work is to develop  tools for analyzing the structure of on-line problems and to use the  structure to determine how good an on-line algorithm is possible.    (3) In the third part, problems in distributed computing are considered.    The goal is to develop an understanding of two basic   issues in coordinating a set  of loosely linked processors:  what kind of agreement can be reached  among processors in such a system, and how can resource scheduling be  efficiently performed.",
