 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Scanning Tunneling Microscope for Undergraduate                            Instruction in Thin Film Science\" project is proposed to                        enhance the undergraduate Electronic Thin Film laboratory for                   seniors in the Materials Science and Engineering Department.                    Because surface thermodynamics and kinetics play a key role in                  the growth and processing of thin film electronic materials, we                 seek to expand the topics for our laboratory to include surface                 atomic structure and surface thermodynamics and kinetics. The                   invention of the STM allows undergraduate students the                          opportunity to actually observe not only atoms individually but                 also to measure fundamental properties of materials on the most                 basic level. It will be used in our laboratory to observe the                   dynamics of the interactions between the atoms on the surface                   which is key to understanding the basic materials processes                     such as diffusion, coalescence and grain growth. Drawing on our                 personal experience with STM and the input of colleagues we                     have assembled set of experiments to be investigated for their                  suitability for undergraduate instruction. Experiments include                  tunneling phenomena, structure and microstructure                               characterization including atomic resolution of individual                      organic adsorbates and the 2-D ordering of polymers. However                    the majority of the development of this work will be focused                    toward designing experiments which emphasis core concepts in                    materials science: Nucleation and Growth. A report which                        details these experiments will be written as a laboratory                       manual.",
