 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will map the 3-D P- and S-wave velocity structures              in the crust of southern California by tomographically inverting                over 1.5 million P- and S-wave first-arrival times from over 80,000             local events recorded by the Caltech/USGS network since 1981.  The              massive data size and the demand for a full 3-D raytracing due to               known large lateral inhomogeneities in the crust have imposed a                 major computational challenge to conventional methods.  By an                   innovative Master Station Method of incorporating 3-D ray tracing,              however, the P and S structures will be imaged simultaneously in                this project with relocation of summarized events.  The primary                 objectives are to construct P and S crustal velocity models for                 southern California at one order higher resolution than the latest              P velocity model, to relocate earthquakes and re-examine first-                 motion focal mechanisms in areas of large bias by routine                       processing, and to gain insight into the crustal seismo-tectonic                processes through integrated analysis of all known geophysical and              geological information.  This research is a component of the                    National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.",
