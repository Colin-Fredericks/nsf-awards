 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313570  Vedula  This award will allow Iowa State University to renovate two  floors of a 65-year old building into a dynamic focal point  for materials-related research activities.  The Materials  Science and Engineering Department at this institution has  23 faculty members that make use of this research facility.  Their research and educational activities involve  metallurgy, ceramics, magnetic materials, and nondestructive  evaluation and with emerging strengths in electronic,  photonic, bio- and composite materials. This program in  materials science is in a dynamic stage as evidenced by the  70% increase in graduate student enrollment, from 36 to 62,  during the past two years.  The Department is well funded by  federal sources.    The renovation approach to be used is based on a new concept  of \"shared\" research space, which is believed to be  particularly relevant for materials science because of its  interdisciplinary thrust.  \"Generic\" labs will provide  common services to many researchers, and a good portion of  the space will be renovated for use as \"modular\" space for  individual research groups, depending on their current  needs.  This method of space allocation is expected to be  responsive to the dynamic nature of the field and changes in  faculty composition and interests as well as to provide a  convenient format for interactions with other disciplines of  science and engineering.  Finally, this modernization is  expected to become a major asset for attracting more U.S.  students, particularly minorities and women, to materials  science studies.  ***",
