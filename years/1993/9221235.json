 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the relationship of hard physical labor              under natural conditions (Polish peasant women in a mountainous                 region), and fertility (specifically ovarian function as assayed by             steroid levels in saliva).  The working hypothesis is that, even                with adequate diet, physical exertion can cause the suppression of              what we think of as normal female ovarian cycling, which has been               shown to be the case in female athletes in the U.S.A.                                                                                                                The student will go to Poland in the winter to collect data                during that seasonal period to compare already collected and                    analyzed materials from the summer, to see if seasonal variation in             ovarian function exists among the harder working women.  The                    working hypothesis is that their steroid levels will fluctuate with             workload, while less hard working women's levels will remain                    roughly the same.",
