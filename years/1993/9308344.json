 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predictability - the ability to foretell that an                                implementation will not violate a set of specified                              requirements - is a crucial, highly desirable property of                       embedded systems.  This research aims at developing a                           programming environment (language, libraries, and tools) for                    building predictable time-critical systems.                                                                                                                     The backbone of the environment is CLEOPATRA, a programming                     language that is demonstrably well-suited for the                               requirements of embedded systems.  CLEOPATRA features a C-                      like imperative syntax for the description of computation,                      which makes it easier to incorporate in applications already                    using C.  It is event-driven, and thus appropriate for                          embedded process control applications. It is object-oriented                    and compositional, thus advocating modularity and                               reusability.  CLEOPATRA is semantically sound; its objects                      can be transformed, mechanically and unambiguously, into                        formal TRA automata for verification purposes, which can be                     pursued using model-checking or theorem providing                               techniques. Since 1989, an ancestor of CLEOPATRA has been in                    use as a specification and simulation language for embedded                     time-critical robotic processes.  The goal of this research                     goes one step further.  It aims at building an integrated                       CLEOPATRA-based support environment that would be useful for                    real-time system developers, both in academia and in                            industry.",
