 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307956  Maslak  A study of mesolysis will be undertaken, which is the   cleavage of radical ions to radicals and ions. The   relationship between activation energy for mesolytic   reactions and the free energy change for different modes of   bond rupture and electron apportionment to products will be   explored. The project will include probing solvent effects   and ion pairing as well as a search for a Marcus-type   inverted region for highly exergonic reactions. Redox   potentials of radicals, ions, and radical ions will be   measured by several methods and used to develop an empirical   relation to evaluate redox potentials that are necessary to   calculate thermodynamic quantities of mesolytic reactions. A   unifying theoretical treatment of unimolecular dissociation   reactions in solution will be developed from these results,   where the goal is a master equation that governs these   reactions. Mesolysis will also be studied by semiempirical   and ab initio molecular calculations in order to evaluate   pertinent stereoelectronic and charge delocalization   aspects.   %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor Przemyslaw B. Maslak at   Pennsylvania State University. Bond breaking in molecules   that contain either a positive or negative charge and a   radical center (an unpaired electron on an atom) will be   studied. The effect of solvent and pairing of these radical   ions will be considered in this study as well as special   effects when the reaction is highly favored. The energetics   of transferring an electron to or from radical ions,   radicals, and ions will be determined and these data will be   correlated with the rate of bond breaking of the radical   ions to give a master equation that governs these reactions.  ***",
