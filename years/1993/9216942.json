 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed toward the problem of extracting three-               dimensional circuit models from microcircuit and packaging layout               descriptions by using the newly developed Asymptotic Waveform                   Evaluation (AWE) technique to develop interconnect models in an                 efficient manner.  Several features of AWE make this approach                   attractive:  a large speed-up over traditional interconnect                     extraction and simulation methods; the ability to perform efficient             time-domain sensitivity analysis; the capability to handle                      distributed elements without making a lumped model; an efficient                strategy for building macromodels of linear interconnect; and the               ease with which three-dimensional electromagnetic problems                      (involving distributed resistance, capacitance, inductance, as well             as retardation effects) can be handled.  AWE sensitivity analysis               helps to identify \"critical\" nets which must be extracted with                  detailed models; this should improve efficiency by allowing the                 remaining nets to be treated more simply.                                                                                                                       The first task in this work is the efficient simulation of                      nonlinear circuits which contain high-speed interconnect by                     development of a simulation strategy which combines the benefits                of AWE for the linear portion of the circuit (interconnect) with                the generality of existing simulation algorithms for the nonlinear              circuit elements (such as transistors).  The second task is the                 efficient extraction of accurate circuit models from three-                     dimensional interconnect geometry.  This is done in such a way that             the subsequent circuit simulation remains efficient.  Greater                   simulation efficiency is achieved by eliminating the detailed                   interconnect models and replacing them by macromodels.",
