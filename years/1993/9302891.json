 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to understand the relationship between                      perceived risks and emergency events better through an                          exploratory effort focused on data collection and analysis.  The                study explores how prior risk perceptions affect public response                to a specific hazard, and compiles a data set of public                         perceptions of risk during and after a significant fire at the                  Champion Chemical facility in Odessa, Texas.  The two primary                   goals of this research are to examine the effect that emergencies               have on the perceptions of risk among nearby residents, and to                  analyze the impact of perceived risks on emergency responses                    during an chemical accident.  The study takes advantage of                      research conducted in the Spring of 1992 on perceived and                       acceptable risk in Texas communities.  The pre-event survey data                are used in a panel design by re-interviewing respondents in                    Odessa and one other Texas community studied in the Spring of                   1992.  The collected data will be analyzed to lay the foundation                for a more ambitious proposal on the relationship between                       experience, and perceived and acceptable risk on the one hand,                  and perceptions of risk and emergency responses, on the other.",
