Sixteen high  school teachers selected from rural, minority schools will be selected to participate in  EPSCoR-related research projects for six weeks during the summer at the University of South  Carolina and Clemson University.  Activities include team or individual research projects,  weekly seminars, development of instructional materials and experiments to take back to the  classroom, and oral presentation of their research results at a mini-symposium.    The research projects offered through the Rural Minority Teacher Research Program will be  directly related to the research projects of the ninety-seven NSF/EPSCoR Research Cluster  faculty.  Systemic and potential long term impacts include the transfer of new knowledge to the  classroom; the potential for recertification or graduate degree credit; access to curriculum   materials and other resources and information provided by the universities; and the interface to  the funded South Carolina AMP Program and the (pending) South Carolina Statewide Systemic   Initiative.    A plan for monitoring and assessing the Program is described.  Dissemination will occur via a  mini-symposium, AP press releases, and the South Carolina EPSCoR Newsletter distributed to  South Carolina's twelve public colleges and universities, twenty-one private and professional  colleges, sixteen technical colleges, school district offices, selected elementary and secondary  schools, and the South Carolina Department of Education.",
