To understand  contemporary American society and American science, one must  understand its sources.  Joseph Henry, physicist, founding member  and president of the National Academy of Science, first Secretary  of the Smithsonian Institution, played a central role not only in  creating an American style of science, but also for creating the  major institutions that have nurtured the develop of science in  America.  Dr. Albert Moyer is undertaking a three year study of  Joseph Henry and his pivotal role in shaping the ideas and  institutions of American science.  He is also probing Henry's more  subtle impact on individuals and ideology in the United States  during a crucial, formative era--an era in which he came to  symbolize the ideal scientist and even \"American science\" itself.   Dr. Moyer's study also reveals how Henry himself was being shaped  by contemporary practices, interactions, and beliefs at home and  abroad.  In effect, this study is the story of the \"invention\" of  American science, to the extent that Henry helped forge a modern  vision of the scientist and science in American society.    ***",
