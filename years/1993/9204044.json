 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Phase I it was discovered that zeolite membranes can be                      synthesized using silicone polymers as a silicone polymers as                   a silica source.  Polymer chains are incorporated into the                      growing zeolite crystals to give a zeolite film of interlocked                  crystals.  Initial work was with water insoluble solid                          silicones, which gave a process involving three phases                          (polymer, solution and zeolite).  No successful preparation of                  self-supporting zeolite membranes has been reported previously                  in the literature.                                                                                                                                              In Phase II it is proposed to simplify the synthetic process                    by using a water soluble silicone.  Commercially available                      silicones will be evaluated as well as synthesizing silicones                   to optimize parameters, such as average molecular weight,                       water solubility, rate of conversion to zeolite, and physical                   properties of the zeolite membranes.  Elements such as boron,                   aluminum and titanium will be added to the silicones so that                    they will become part of the zeolite framework, giving the                      zeolite uniquely valuable properties.  The zeolite membranes                    prepared will be evaluated for separation (N2/O2 and                            ethanol/water) and catalytic (xylene isomerization and fuel                     cells) applications.  The availability of zeolite membranes                     with molecular sized pores and catalytic sites opens many more                  opportunities than can possibly be studied in a single                          project.  These include lower separations costs, purification                   of polluted air and water, and new catalytic processes.",
