 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357851  Zhang  Reasoning algorithms are used in many application areas of  computer science and artificial intelligence, and high  performance of reasoning algorithms is indispensable to the  successes of these applications.  The objectives of this research  are to develop high performance reasoning algorithms, and to  apply these algorithms in formal verification of hardware and  software designs.  This research will substantially improve the  performance of a software system called RRL (Rewrite Rule  Laboratory) by adding new reasoning algorithms into it, and by  building new applications on the top of it.    The research will focus on redundance control of automated  deduction and mathematical induction, and efficient  representation of data structures.  The topics include restricted  inference rules, powerful simplification rules, unnecessary  computation detection, induction schemata formulation, induction  hypotheses handling, and efficient implementations of all the  involved algorithms.  Practical verification problems will be  chosen from software and hardware design as test problems for RRL  and RRL will be enhanced to meet the need of large-scale  applications by providing failure-resistant and user-friendly  interfaces.  Special effort will be made on distributing RRL  world-wide to the people who are interested in using RRL as  either a research tool or a teaching tool in automated reasoning.  ***",
