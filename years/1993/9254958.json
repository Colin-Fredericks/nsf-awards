The nature of change on the independent variable side -- SEM  education -- is largely at the level and \"density\" of the intended  curriculum: i.e., alterations in the number of science and math  courses and specifics content coverage (e.g., related to technology  or new fields of science).  Measures of pedagogy, broad attitude  toward school science, nature of testing, and other possible  significant changes are not involved.       The methodology involved consists, on the independent variable  side, of close analysis of educational documents and policies  (course descriptions, curriculum frameworks, teaching materials,  and the like) nation by nation, together with scaling or clustering  of this material.  On the dependent variable side, the measures are  largely those of macroeconomic estimates of GNP growth over  particular periods of time, using a kind of segmented or  interrupted time series approach,, which amounts to a sort of  pseudo-panel approach.  That is, relatively brief periods of half  a decade or a decade are looked at over the entire span of 30 or  more years, with each nation's data forming its own series but with  comparisons possible across nations during particular periods.",
