 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jemez Tomography Experiment (JTEX) is a cooperative and                interdisciplinary  research program involving scientist from six                major Universities, the Los Alamos National Laboratory with support             from the DOE, and the U.S. Geological Survey.  The Jemez Mountains              volcanic field (JMVF) is a major Late Cenozoic silicic volcanic                 system.  Perhaps its best-known feature is the Valles Caldera and               associated 1.1 to 1.6 Ma explosive volcanic products including the              Bandelier Tuff.  The fundamental questions that relate to the JMVF              and other recent silicic volcanic systems and which are addressed               in the project are:                                                                                                                                                  1.   What is the nature and extent of crustal involvement and                        accompanying modifications of the crust during the                              volcanic activity in the JMVF?  Are crustal intrusions,                         pluton, or underplated regions present in the crust                             beneath the Valles Caldera and Jemez Mountains?                                                                                                            2.   How has the JMVF evolved through the last 15 Ma,                                culminating in eruption of the Bandelier rhyolite                               ignimbrite and caldera collapse?  Petrologic models of                          silicic magma generation suggest that large volumes of                          mafic intrusions (on the order of ten times the volume                          of erupted material) are present in the crust beneath                           major silicic volcanic centers.  Can we image these                             intrusions geophysically and interpret their                                    relationships to the observed volcanic geology?                                                                                                       In order to address these and other questions related specifically              to the JMVF and generally to continental magmatism, the principal               investigators will conduct intensive geophysical studies of the                 JMVF, analyze the data collected and interpret the results in                   concert with petrologic and geochemical information.  The new                   geophysical data will include:  seismic refraction/reflection,                  teleseismic delay time and waveform, gravity, magnetic, and                     magnetotelluric (MT) data.  The program is designed to provide a                three-dimensional image of the magmatically modified c rust beneath             the JMVF.  Tomographic inversion of the explosion seismic and                   teleseismic data and combined interpretation with the potential                 field, MT and geologic data will produce the most high resolution               3-D study of crustal scale features that is currently available.",
