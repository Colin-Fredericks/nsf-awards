 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary studies on the strawberry notch (sno) gene suggest that             it functions together with the genes Notch, Serrate, deltex and the             Enhancer of split complex in establishing a pathway of cell-cell                communication that leads to the specification of cell fates. The                sno mutation not only shares many of the phenotypes associated with             mutations in these genes, but also displays strong genetic                      interactions with them. Additionally, duplications of Notch                     suppress most of the phenotypes observed in sno flies. A genetic                analysis of sno has been completed, and it has been determined that             the function of sno is needed in several specific steps of                      development in many different tissues. The sno gene has been                    localized through deficiency mapping to a single band of the X-                 chromosome. As part of this proposal, Dr. Banerjee will isolate the             sno gene by chromosomal walking and characterize its gene product.              A functional analysis will be initiated to determine the role of                sno in the Notch related pathway. He hopes that the                             characterization of sno will help us understand the molecular basis             for permissive interactions that are crucial in the determination               of cell fate.",
