 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to explore how low dimensions, strong              interactions and frustration from applied fields act together to                produce interesting states of matter.  One such material (Bechgaard             salt) exhibits metallic, insulating, antiferromagnetic, density                 wave, superconducting, non-ohmic, quasi-periodic and Quantum Hall               Effect phases as temperature, pressure and magnetic field are                   varied.  Experiments involving magnetic, thermal, elastic, and                  structural measurements are conducted on normal, superconducting                and exotic phases of the quasi-one and quasi-two dimensional                    organic charge transfer salts.  New phenomena found in no other                 materials also are examined.  These include a cascade of magnetic               field induced transitions and new forms of quantum oscillations.                In addition, the effects of extraordinary magnetic field, up to 65              Tesla, on the behavior of low-dimensional systems are investigated.             %%%                                                                             In this work, electronic properties of highly anisotropic organic               conductors are studied.  Typically, the conductivity is one million             times better along the best conducting direction of the crystal                 than along the worst.  Because the electrons are constrained to                 move along chains, they interact more strongly with other                       electrons, thus causing a number of unusual transitions and                     properties.  At room temperature, the materials are metallic.  On               cooling to liquid helium temperatures, the materials become                     insulating, magnetic or superconducting.  When magnetic fields are              applied and oriented in different directions relative to the                    chains, striking changes in material properties are noted.  The                 object of these studies is to understand the basic competition                  between metals and insulator, magnet and superconductor in a                    molecular system.  The successful completion of the proposed                    studies ultimately will lead to the development of new materials                for fabrication of new electronic devices.",
