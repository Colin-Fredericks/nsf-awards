 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313437  Newell       The Science and Technology Division of Shaw University  is housed in Roberts Science Hall which was constructed in  1924. Shaw University is an Historically Black University  with a strong tradition of preparing minority students  through research training for graduate school in the  sciences. The faculty's commitment to engaging students in  their research programs is hampered by the lack of suitable  laboratory environments. The building was recently remodeled  (new windows, paint, and flooring) but its electrical,  ventilating, heating, cooling, and plumbing systems are  inadequate for research and research training purposes. The  University plans to renovate the building to address these  problems, and to add modifications that will make the  building accessible to persons with disabilities.       The renovation of Roberts Science Hall will have  several important effects: 1) enabling faculty research in a  number of scientific disciplines; 2) creating safe and  suitable environments for research instruments; 3)  supporting research training as a part of the undergraduate  curriculum; 4) promoting student-faculty research  collaboration; and 5) attracting minority students into  careers in science and engineering.  ***",
