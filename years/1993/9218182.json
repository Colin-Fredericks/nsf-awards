 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, cold-formed steel structures have been widely used             in building construction and other applications.  A large number                of research projects have been performed in the United States and               Australia to study the strengths of individual cold-formed steel                members, connections and structural systems.  In order to provide               a forum for American and Australian experts to discuss the recent               research findings and the latest developments in this particular                field and to identify future research needs, an International                   Workshop is to be held at the University of Sydney, Australia, on               February 15-17, 1993.  The discussion  will be concentrated on                  numerous specific subjects relative to (1) behavior of the                      thin-walled elements, (2) flexural members, (3) compression                     members, (4) purlin-sheeting systems, (5) composite decks, (6)                  tubular members (7) sandwich panels, (8) connections, (9) test                  methods, (10) automotive components, (11) specification                         developments, and (12) structural systems.  These topics are                    directly related to the transfer of technology  and have economic               significance for  the development of new design recommendations                 and construction methods.",
