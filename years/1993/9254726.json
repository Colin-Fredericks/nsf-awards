An action agenda for 2010 will be                   developed through two, inter-related efforts. First, a series                   of five inter-connected colloquia, and data gathering                           activities, will be held that focus on developing specific                      strategies, models, and mechanisms to (a) recognize co-equally                  the instructional scholarship, public service, and research                     excellence of engineering, mathematics, and science faculty,                    and (b) increase substantially resources for instructional                      innovation and curriculum renewal, especially for undergraduate                 instruction.  Second, (a) a network will be developed among the                 past and present PYIs, and future NSF Young Investigators and                   Presidential Faculty Fellows, who are committed to providing a                  high-quality education for all students and increased career                    participation in engineering, mathematics, and science by all                   segments of society, and (b) an ethnographic study will be                      conducted of the PYI population to assess its current future                    impact on higher education and to gain insights useful for                      future NSF programming.",
