 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300568  Foote       The advancement in computer technology and the competition  among computer companies have resulted in an increase in the  application of computer aided design (CAD), computer aided process  planning and computer aided manufacturing (CAM).  Although the  development of new technologies is necessary for the advancement of  science, lack of integration of these technologies will prove  detrimental to the system and hence may result in the desertion of  such technologies. Today, there is greater need for efficient    production management techniques than ever.  Current methods of  improving production management focus on several approaches as  independent methods of improvement.  The goal of this research is  to develop in some sense a 'maximal' production management  methodology.  A 'maximal' methodology is one  that takes advantages  of the major variable sources of flexibility and response available   to a manager:  choosing lot size,process plan (which part feature  to process), process used to create feature, sequence at each  process, inventory created, shortage accepted or subcontract  awarded.  The methodology applies to a hybrid assembly job  shop,  which manufactures components some of which go to an assembly line.       This approach is now possible due to advances in modeling  and  computational methodologies, increased computer power, and advances  in data base organization.  The individual data fields (time  standards, process plans, holding costs, reliability and defect  rate data, etc.) are limited to those currently available in actual  manufacturing systems known and explored by the researchers.  The  individual choices must be coordinated since optimizing an  individual variable such as lot size may overload a bottleneck  resource, optimizing flow time by shortest processing time may  increase tardiness and again overload a temporary bottleneck.   The  integration of fast simulation process planning, multiple criteria  optimization, stochastic programming with  recourse techniques with  the scheduling and sequencing techniques is original and shows  promise of improvements over the  current theory.",
