 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hendrix College proposes to establish a computer laboratory                 to continue improvement in Calculus and Differential Equations                  consistent with the following objectives: (1) present concepts                  in a meaningful context; (2) use writing as an effective                        learning tool; (3) nurture collaborative learning among the                     students; and (4) develop an environment for discovery                          learning. For the past five years, the Mathematics Department                   has made incremental, innovative changes in its Calculus III                    sequence by introducing writing assignments and computer                        laboratories which integrate writing and numeric, graphic, and                  symbolic computations using the \"notebook\" feature of                           Mathematica on the Macintosh. The Department is poised to                       implement similar curricular enhancements in Calculus III and                   Differential Equations. However, these courses require more                     extensive computations to visualize and explore concepts in a                   dynamic, collaborative environment, and existing equipment is                   not adequate to perform these tasks.  This proposal requests                    funds to (1) establish a student computer laboratory to run                     Mathematica satisfactorily, (2) provide a mobile computer                       workstation for classroom demonstrations, and (3) upgrade two                   workstations for faculty developing and teaching the courses.                   The requested equipment is designed to sustain cumulative                       improvement through incremental curricular change initiated                     within the context of institutional needs and resources.                        Diverse materials generated by other calculus reform and                        writing across the curriculum initiatives are evaluated and                     then adapted to meet local objectives. This approach not only                   serves as a model to other institutions who share the desire to                 invigorate their curriculum, but it also stimulates the                         utilization of these valuable materials to do so.",
