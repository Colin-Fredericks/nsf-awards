 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a symposium entitled,                   \"Molecular Genetics of Plant-Microbe Interactions,\" to be held on               April 21 - 24, 1993, at Rutgers University.  One of the topical                 areas of plant biology research involves the molecular                          investigation of the interactions between plants and their                      parasitic and mutualistice microbes.  From these investigations,                insights into plant molecular biology and the molecular biology of              many types of microorganisms have been gained.  The study of the                molecular genetics of these interactions moves at such a rapid pace             that constant update is critical to keeping pace with the field.                This symposium is organized to provide a forum for such an update.              The symposium is divided into three types of sessions.  Formal                  presentations will be given by leaders in the field each morning                and early afternoon.  Workshops covering specific topics will be                held each afternoon, allowing for interactive discussions among                 smaller groups of participants.  Finally, opportunity for other                 meeting participants to present their results will be provided                  through poster sessions.  This meeting is international and                     multidisciplinary in scope, with authoritative speakers and                     workshop participants drawn from seven countries.  In addition to               the invitees of international stature, included in the program are              speakers and workshop participants who are more junior, but who                 have already established high quality research programs.  This                  symposium is also structured to interest many, and be affordable                for young investigators.",
