 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present work focuses on a new type of toughening mechanism --               extensive diffused damage surrounding in the main crack-tip.  The               proposed research is motivated by a recent discovery of a ductile               fracture mode in strain hardening brittle cement matrix composites              (SHBMC) reinforced with 1-4 % polyethylene fibers.  Crack                       propagation is observed to be accompanied by extensive volumetric               inelastic deformation surrounding the crack tip, in addition to                 conventional fiber bridging and pull-out in the crack wake.  The                off-crack-plane energy absorption is found to be even higher than               the fiber bridging energy in some specimens we have tested so far,              with total fracture energy reaching 34 kJ/m2.  This represents                  roughly 3400 times the fracture energy of the virgin matrix without             fibers.  As reference, the fracture energy of aluminum alloys is                between 8 - 30 kJ/m2.  Experimental investigations on R-curve                   behavior, and on- and off-crack-plane fracture energy partitioning              will be conducted based on the J-based fracture testing technique.              Correlation between pseudo strain-hardening processes in uniaxial               testing and the spatial evolution of damage during the ductile                  fracture process in notched specimens will be used to establish the             detail micromechanisms of the ductile fracture mode.",
