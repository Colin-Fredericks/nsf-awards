 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318043  Kassam-Adams  The proposed project's primary objective is to create a multi-  campus network, to be referred to as MedNet, based on the INTERNET  and connecting clinicians, librarians, educators, students,  researchers, and administrators working at several regional care  centers and hospitals in the central Virginia region.  Connecting  these patient care providing institutions to the INTERNET will  provide them easier access to the information services available at  the University of Virginia (UVA) Health Sciences Center along with  the many resources available through the INTERNET.  This project  will also be the basis for a demonstration proto-type for  connecting isolated, rural health care centers to regional  hospitals via an existing network (INTERNET) in order to facilitate  clinical consultations, patient care, and continued education. As  a result, the project will serve as a limited test of a larger,  more robust, regional health information network.  The project's goals can be achieved by connecting the various  regional health care centers and hospitals to the INTERNET and by  building an easy-to-use, menu driven, system to coordinate access  to the services offered by the University of Virginia Health  Sciences Center and other institutions linked to the INTERNET.  The University of Virginia Health Sciences Center will purchase and  install all the necessary hardware and software to connect upto  five (5) regional care centers and hospitals to the INTERNET.  UVA  will also develop an INTERNET accessible MedNet Information Center  that provides electronic mail-boxes, bulletin board services,  electronic conferencing, and an events calendar for use by MedNet  participants.",
