 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research could make significant contributions to theory,                   econometrics, field research and our basic understanding of                     formal, informal, market and programmed credit-insurance.                       This project uses theory, econometrics, and field work to examine               how credit and insurance systems work both in theory and in                     actual economies.  Existing theoretical models are confronted                   with data, consolidated and reformulated.  Solutions to the                     models are deduced analytically, as for the work on risk-sharing,               or simulated numerically, as in the models for private                          information.  More generally, institutions and programmed credit-               insurance schemes are evaluated relative to characteristics                     suggested by theory: risk-contingencies, monitoring, group                      formation, training of borrower and staff, expectations, and                    limited enforcement.  Econometrics is used for analysis of                      consumption and labor with an eye toward what techniques allow                  one to say something definite about an economy relative to a                    theoretical benchmark.  Field research leading to original data                 is used to evaluate actual risk response mechanisms and to see if               impediments to trade of the kind postulated by theorists are                    serious impediments in practice.                                                                                                                                The economies studied include poor high risk villages in northern               Thailand, using data gathered in field work, and in India's semi-               arid tropics, using the standard data set gathered by the                       Institute for Crops Research of the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT).                The work will be extended to consider national economies as a                   whole, e.g., Thailand as a growing economy with wide disparities                in the levels and growth rates of income, using data gathered by                the National Statistical Office of Thailand.  The work also                     includes consideration of various schemes for the promotion of                  credit and insurance.  Credit and insurance will be examined from               the point of view of theory and compared with data from these                   actual economies.  Arrow-Debreu full risk sharing or complete                   markets models and, where complete markets models are judged to                 be inappropriate, contract theory and mechanism design will be                  used in conjunction with the ICRISAT data for Indian villages,                  data for Thailand as a whole, and data on indigenous profit-                    sharing groups in India, Bangladesh and Thailand.",
