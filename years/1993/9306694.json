 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306694 Quinn The objective of this proposal is to carry out preliminary studies essential for a detailed investigation of the mechanism of copper dependent plastocyanin biosynthesis in Scenedesmus.  This detailed study will be undertaken by the PI as part of her independent research program.  Specifically the objectives of the research proposal are to identify and isolate cDNA clones containing Scenedesmus plastocyanin encoding sequences and to generate a genomic library and screen it to identify plastocyanin encoding genomic clones.  The genomic clones will be subcloned and sequenced so that potential regulatory regions can be compared with sequences from the copper regulated cytochrome C6 gene of Chlamydomonas.  Finally, since Scenedesmus is currently not a convenient experimental system for molecular and genetic analyses, the phytocyanin encoding genomic clones will be introduced into the heterologous host C. reinhardtii and the resulting transformants tested for their ability to express the Scenedesmus plastocyanin gene in response to the level of available copper ions.   The outcome of these experiments will determine the future directions and methodologies to be used for further characterization of the mechanism of regulation of plastocyanin biosynthesis.  The results of these experiments will offer insights into the conservation of copper independent regulatory pathways between related organisms.  The utility of this novel approach, if sucessful, could also greatly expand future prospects for algal molecular biology in general. %%% Algae are capable of utilizing two different proteins in the photosynthetic process. Which is used depends on the presen ce or absence of copper ions in the environment.  This project examines the mechanisms underlying the induction of expression of one of these genes in response to the presence of copper ions in the environment. ***",
