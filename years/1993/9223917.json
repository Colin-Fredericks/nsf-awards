 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of returns to scale in firms has traditionally focused on             technological returns to scale in the production process.  However,             as the scale of a firm's production process grows, so does its                  administrative apparatus.  The task of much of this administrative              apparatus is information processing, including communication and                decision-making.  This task is important to the performance of the              firm, and hence relevant to returns to scale.                                                                                                                   This research uses a model of stochastic control with explicit and              costly computation of policies, coupled with a parallel processing              model of information processing in organizations.  It is expected               that a variety of results will be obtained for which returns depend             on assumptions on the statistical properties of the information to              be processed and on the loss function.  Further studies include a               locational model of scale, explicit models of the firm with scale               measured by physical inputs and outputs rather than by the                      informational size of the environment, and a distributed                        computational model of information processing.                                                                                                                  This research works across the frontier between computer science                and economics.  It relates information processing and organization              design and function, and will enhance our understanding of a                    problem of long standing and great importance in economics.",
