 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agamospermy, the asexual production of seeds, occurs in a wide             variety of flowering plants.  In groups where hybridization,                    polyploidy, and agamospermy are combined, an agamic complex is                  formed.  The Crepis occidentalis agamic complex is among the best               known and most frequently cited examples of an agamic complex.                  This research will use restriction site variation in chloroplast                and nuclear ribosomal DNA, as will as allozyme variation, to                    examine the origin, development, and maintenance of this complex.               The relationship of the North American taxa to other sections of                the genus, the relationships among North American species, and the              origins of polyploids within the complex will be evaluated with                 restriction site data.  The genetic structure of the agamic                     population will be examined using allozyme variation.  Results from             this research will have implications for taxonomic treatment of                 this and other agamic complexes and will serve as a model for                   combining traditional and molecular methods in the study of agamic              complexes in plants.  This study will greatly add to the                        understanding of the adaptive radiation and spread of this group                and help explain how genetic variation is introduced, distributed,              and maintained in agamic complexes.",
