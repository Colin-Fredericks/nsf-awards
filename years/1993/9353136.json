In cooperation  with four school districts in San Antonio, Texas with more than 98,000 students of whom 92%  are Hispanic, the San Antonio CRCM seeks to facilitate systemic change in the education system  which currently enables less than 1% of the Hispanic student population to earn a STEM B.S.  degree and less than 0.05% of the Hispanic student population to earn a STEM Ph.D.    The San Antonio CRCM will offer activities which will address the need to:    1.     Create expectations for all minority students that they will aspire to attend college and         will succeed in college.    2.     Increase teachers' awareness of elements of the Hispanic culture which cause Hispanic         boys and girls to find competitiveness to be aversive, and which places value of         family closeness over educational opportunities.    3.     Provide student counseling and other student support services.    4.     Improve teacher knowledge and teaching skills in mathematics and the sciences.    5.     Improve course content, including course curricula and curriculum materials, to enable         minority students to learn the mathematical and scientific skills and concepts necessary         to compete and achieve in college STEM degree programs.",
