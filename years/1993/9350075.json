 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. McDuff will continue her research into the structure of                     symplectic 4-manifolds.  For a long time she has been using the                 theory of J-holomorphic curves in an attempt to classify them, and              has been quite successful in doing this for a restricted class of               manifolds (those which contain suitable 2-spheres).  The method                 seems to be getting to its limit.  Meantime, Gompf and others have              found a new way to construct examples of symplectic 4-manifolds.                Dr. McDuff proposes a detailed analysis of the possibilities of                 this construction to determine exactly where the J-holomorphic                  curve methods breaks down.  In addition, she will look for new                  invariants of symplectic 4-manifolds, and enlarge her own knowledge             by studying the new methods recently introduced into symplectic                 topology, such as generating functions.                                                                                                                         Interactive activities at the host institution include:  leading a              seminar on New Developments in Symplectic Topology, and                         participating in the activities of the Noetherian Ring, the women               graduate student group in the Mathematics department at Berkeley.                                                                                               This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
