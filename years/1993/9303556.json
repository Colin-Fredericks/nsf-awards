 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will focus on research in the six areas of                     Robust Bayesian Analysis, Default Prior Bayesian Methodology,                   Conditional Inference in Decision Theory, Multivariate                          Estimation, Hierarchical Modelling, and Bayesian Computation. In                the first two areas, special emphasis will be paid to problems                  involving testing and model selection.  Bayesian approaches to                  these problems are severely underutilized, primarily because                    robust or default prior analyses in these areas have not been                   developed.  In Conditional Inference, the primary focus will be                 the study of situations in which Bayesian answers have a valid                  conditional frequentist interpretation.  Identification of such                 situations is not only valuable foundationally, but also                        indicates situations in which adopting a conditional frequentist                approach can be highly advantageous.  In Bayesian Computation,                  emphasis will be on use of Markov Chain and other simulation                    techniques for carrying out Bayesian integrations.                                   Bayesian analysis is perhaps the most rapidly growing                      approach to statistical analysis, because of its ability to model               and analyze even extremely complex situations, and because it                   readily allows combination of multiple information sources. The                 chief limitations of Bayesian analysis have been concern about                  sensitivity to modelling assumptions, and the difficulty in                     carrying out Bayesian computations in high dimensional problems.                In this project we will attack the sensitivity problem by                       developing Bayesian models that are inherently \"robust,\" and by                 creating powerful methods for selecting from among competing                    Bayesian models.  On the computational side, we will extend new                 techniques based on simulation that have the promise of handling                situations with hundreds or thousands of unknown model                          parameters.",
