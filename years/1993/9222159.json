 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate how people make judgments about the              truth of statements when they have only incomplete knowledge.  The              problem arises very frequently in areas ranging from business to                public policy to personal matters.  As examples, an intelligence                analyst may be asked for a probability judgment of whether Boris                Yeltsin will remain in power in Russia for the next six months, an              EPA official may have to set a pollution standard for a substance               based on sparse knowledge of its health effects, or a physician may             have to select a treatment plan given inconclusive medical data.                                                                                                The work will focus primarily on the cognitive processes of                     judgment and response selection.  The research will develop                     psychological theories, based on prior work, that can be expressed              as mathematical models, test these theories and models empirically,             and modify them accordingly.  The models will provide a framework               for distinguishing the subjective degree of confidence one has that             a proposition is true from the overt decision or response one makes             or provides to someone else.  One's degree of confidence depends on             what one knows about the topic area, as well as on how that                     knowledge is organized and searched, whereas the response selection             depends on motivational and related factors.                                                                                                                    One question this research will investigate concerns the                        relationships among certain documented phenomena.  One is a covert              bias to think statements are true.  The other is an additional bias             to call statements true relative to one's covert judgment (when the             response options are limited to true or false), but not a bias to               assign probabilities that statements are true (when the response                options are numbers from 0 to 100).                                                                                                                             Another question concerns how a person's strategy for searching his             or her knowledge base depends on the specific form and sequence of              the judgment tasks that he or she faces.  Additional issues the                 research will investigate include differences in judging past                   versus future events, the comparison of confidence in the truth of              statements across knowledge domains, payoff effects on judgment and             responding, and effects of degree and organization of knowledge on              judgment.                                                                                                                                                       The long-range goal of the work is to improve the quality of                    judgments.  It should become possible to combine the mathematical               models of judgment to be developed in this work with derived                    measures of performance either to improve accuracy or to calibrate              it in a manner that suitable corrections can be imposed.",
