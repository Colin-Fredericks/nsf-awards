 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of vertex operator algebras and their                           representations is a very important subject of study, which has                 many applications in mathematics and physics.  The first area of                this project is the study of the representation theory of vertex                operator algebras.  This study will lead to the construction of                 irreducible twisted modules which are always assumed to exist in                the physics literature.  The second area of the project is the                  study of the orbifold theory associated with a finite cyclic                    group G for a holomorphic vertex algebra V.  The last area of the               project is to study the moonshine module vertex operator algebra                and to prove the Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman conjecture on the                     moonshine module vertex operator algebra.                                            Conformal field theory is an important physical theory                     describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed                 matter physics and classical motions of strings in string theory.               Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful and rich                       mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has                       interested many mathematicians.  New relations between different                branches of mathematics, such as representations of                             infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces                  and algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular                       functions and modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is               revealed in the study of conformal field theory.  It is believed                that the study of the mathematics involved in conformal field                   theory will lead to new mathematical structures which will be                   important both in mathematics and theoretical physics.",
