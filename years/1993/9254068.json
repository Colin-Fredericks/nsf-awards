 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the number of jobs in which shared rather than individual                    work continues to grow, we are being forced to re-examine the                   way people work.  This proposal suggests that in today's work-                  place, computer scientists must be adept at both technical as                   well as communication skills.  It also suggests that we, as                     educators, must be prepared to teach our students how to work                   in collaborative environments that improve programmer                           productivity.  Towards this end, we propose to use an existing                  computer-supported cooperative problem solving environment to                   teach undergraduate computer science students to elicit                         software requirements.  We believe that requirements                            elicitation and cooperative skills are highly interrelated and,                 as such, can be taught more effectively through the use of a                    computer-supported cooperative environment.  By doing this, we                  will be able to expand the problem solving skills of our                        students and, thus, release into the computer science community                 more effective programmers.  The environment will encourage                     cooperative work, and yet provide instructors with the ability                  to monitor individual as well as group performance.  Through                    this system, students will be able to learn requirements                        elicitation techniques and, at the same time, gain valuable                     experience in working together on large team projects.",
