 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CONCERT Network (Communications for North Carolina                     Education, Research, and Technology) is a mid-level network that                serves the State of North Carolina.  CONCERT is connected directly              to the NSFNET Backbone Network.  It is the intention of CONCERT to              offer NSFNET connections to all higher education institutions in                North Carolina.                                                                      This proposal requests support to establish six new                        connections with a special emphasis on community colleges in the                state for:  Cape Fear CC, Carteret CC, Central Piedmont CC, Forsyth             Technical CC, Guilford Technical CC, and Wake Technical CC.                          A primary goal of CONCERT is to facilitate collaborative                   projects and sharing of resources between institution, including                those outside the state.  CONCERT will provide operations                       management and information services as well as provide appropriate              dedicated connections to the six institutions.                                       The universities need greater functionality and network speed              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                   transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail               system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                    innovative educational resources.",
