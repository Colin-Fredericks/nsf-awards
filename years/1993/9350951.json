 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides improved learning opportunities in                        mathematics, chemistry and physics for engineering majors                       through the creation of a microcomputer laboratory designed to                  support instruction in these courses.To demystify the abstract                  nature of these courses, engineering majors need an environment                 in which they can interact with one another in working complex                  experiments and in solving problems with an increased                           interdisciplinary base. An instructor-developed program to                      track both student time and their level of success on computer                  assignments will become an integral part of these courses.                      Feedback from the program will advise students of their                         progress toward skill development in time to secure assistance,                 if necessary. Feedback to the instructor regarding the nature                   and extent of student progress toward required skills will                      allow the learning process to inform the teaching process on a                  cyclical basis.To implement the proposed change in the                          instructional process within math and science courses, a series                 of computer modules will be created to support the new                          methodology. These modules will be based on existing course                     topics but designed to provide students with the opportunity                    to: Practice with problem solving; Discover underlying concepts                 and principles; Interrelate learning between disciplines;                       Investigate complex and tedious problems; and, Compete                          effectively in an increasingly technologically literate and                     student population.",
