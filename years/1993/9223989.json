 "awd_abstract_narration": "Goel         During the last few years, GaAs technology has emerged  rapidly from basic research to device and circuit development.   It is crucial to know the expected propagation delays in an  integrated circuit before it is fabricated.  To meet this  objective, numerical models have been developed that address  crosstalk and propagation delays in the parallel and crossing  VLSI multilevel interconnections as well as for the transverse  delays in the GaAs MESFETs and GaAs/AIGaAs MODFETs.  In addition  to determining the crosstalk and propagation delays, the models  can be utilized to achieve the optimization of the device and  interconnection dimensions and other parameters for minimum  crosstalk and delays.  Validation of these numerical models by  comparison of the modeling results with actual experimental  observations is critical if they are to be incorporated into GaAs  CAD tools.  This research effort focuses on the following set of  objectives:  1.     design and fabrication of several GaAs-based logic circuits  to retain the ability to alter the various design parameters;  2.     application of the interconnection and the GaAs MESFET delay  models recently developed for the determination of propagation  delays in these GaAs-based logic circuits;  3.     experimental measurements of propagation delays in these  circuits and comparison with developed delay models;  4.     modification of the interconnection and transistor delay  models, as required; and  5.     experimental validation of the final models.",
