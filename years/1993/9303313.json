 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent here is to generate and compare mitochondrial and               nuclear DNA sequences in order to explore the tempo and mode of                 sequence evolution in strepsirhine primates (e.g., lemurs and                   lorises).  The primary objective of this research is to test two                discrete hypotheses: (a) do lemurs show a reduced rate of molecular             evolution compared to lorises and other primates?, and (b) do                   lemurs exhibit a slower transition rate?  If it can be demonstrated             that lemurs have experienced a molecular slowdown relative to other             primates, this would indicate that generation time isn't the                    principal variable responsible for controlling the rate of primate              evolution.  A reduced overall rate of molecular evolution                       coincident with a depressed transition rate would be suggestive of              a mechanism whereby overall rates can be retarded or accelerated.               The large number of mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequences to be generated             for a uniform taxonomic sample will enable comparisons of rates of              evolution and phylogenies for the two data sets.  A prime research              strength of this approach is that molecular evolutionary phenomena              are to be explored within a robust phylogenetic context.                        %%%                                                                             Results are expected to shed light on our understanding of                      strepsirhine evolution and more specifically Malagasy lemuriforms,              which exemplify biological diversity.  In addition findings will                impact the on-going debate over the reality of a molecular clock.               The lack of consensus that predominates the current controversy is              partly due to the poor phylogenetic grounding of many studies.  A               third justification for the study is its assessment of nuclear                  versus mitochondrial nucleotide sequences, an approach not taken so             often.  Estimation of the magnitude of mtDNA and nuclear rate                   differentials may affect the phylogenetic utility of those genes.",
