This                     project facilitates learning basic microscopy and also teaches                  observation, critical thinking, and research skills.  Students                  use both light and scanning electron microscopes as                             investigative tools.  The photomicrography equipment enables                    students to record data about chosen specimens and subsequently                 analyze structure (i.e., measuring size of various cellular                     features, etc.). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)                         provides greater levels of resolution, and the opportunity to                   do comparative structural analysis in addition to its function                  of recording data. Implementation of this project will improve                  the quality of the laboratory experience in an Introductory                     Biology Course. It will allow beginning students hands-on                       access to modern instrumentation, improve research skills, and                  provide opportunities for a process oriented learning                           experience rather than the traditional cookbook approach.",
