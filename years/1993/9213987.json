 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Patricia Thiel, Dr. Luke                          Chang and a graduate student from Iowa State University                         to collaborate in surface chemistry research with                               Professor R. J\u001argen Behm and others of the University of                        Ulm, Germany.  Both groups are actively pursuing research                       on metal film growth and structure.  Together, they have                        chosen to study the morphology of a particular metal-on-                        metal system, and the mechanisms by which that morphology                       is achieved.  Specifically, they will use Scanning                              Tunneling microscopy (STM) to elucidate the morphology of                       a system composed of Rhodium on Silver (Rh on Ag(100)).                         These metals are immiscible and do not appear to form an                        alloy, but when combined they exhibit very unusual                              behavior by forming a multi-layer sandwich of Ag-Rh-Ag.                         The two research groups bring complementary expertise to                        this complex study:  the U.S. group contributes expertise                       in the particular metal system and the German group                             offers experimental facilities and well-established                             experience with STM of metals.                                                                                                                                  Films of solid materials are used in applications which                         range from corrosion-resistant coatings to magnetic                             recording devices.  The characteristic of a film that is                        most important in determining its physical properties and                       thus its performance in a given application is its                              morphology.  The research proposed in this collaboration                        is directed at understanding the factors which control                          film morphology, particularly in the complicated case                           where there is a mixture of materials involved which may                        form an alloy or a sandwich.",
