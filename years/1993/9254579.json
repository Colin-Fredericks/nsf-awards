Each of pair                     of mentor teachers will work with faculty at three                              participant schools for a two-year period.  The focus of the                    project is on trying technology and technological skills to                     the NCTM Standards, local textbooks, national curriculum                        projects, and specific district curricula.                                                                                                                      The program involves: 1) spring and summer workshops for                        mentor teachers and participant faculty; 2) continuing in-                      service and on-site visitations by the mentor teachers; 3)                      adaptation of new classroom materials and exploration and                       development of teaching strategies that take into account                       local faculty expertise, hardware/software, course                              offerings, current texts, and curriculum emphasis; and 4)                       the establishment of a resource center/library of                               technology-oriented teaching materials at Elmhurst College                      for the hub, participant, and other area schools' faculty.",
