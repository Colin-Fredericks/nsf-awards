 "awd_abstract_narration": "For centuries the Balinese have used an irrigation system                       controlled by temple priests to coordinate the water schedules of               paddy rice farmers.  The effectiveness of indigenously run                      irrigation systems has been questioned by social scientists and                 development planners in terms of whether they will permit the                   maximization of rice yields or the minimization of risk of                      failure.  This project will help answer this question and                       potentially provide insights into how complex systems are simply                and effectively coordinated.  The research will evaluate the                    hypothesis that Balinese water temple networks are                              self-organizing managerial systems, a hitherto unknown form of                  complex adaptive system.  It will also test whether computer                    simulation models can predict variations in the structure of                    temple networks.  Previous research has enabled the investigators               to build and test a predictive linear simulation model of the                   role of water temples in the management of the terraced rice                    field ecology.  This project builds directly on that research,                  but shifts attention from the ecological role of individual                     water temples to possible system-level properties of temple                     networks.  Models of coadaptation on rugged fitness landscapes                  will enable one to investigate emergent properties of temple                    networks under varying ecological conditions in a comparative                   study of five different river systems.  The results of                          optimization analyses will yield models of the adaptive landscape               of each river, which will then be compared to existing temple                   networks.",
