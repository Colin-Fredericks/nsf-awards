 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work aims at producing a series of case studies of the                     appropriation of advanced technology into the everyday classroom                practices of teachers.  We will follow a collection of teachers--               who range from technology-sophisticated and professionally                      innovative, to completely computer-naive -- as they learn about                 and seek to incorporate a flexible, advanced technology, the                    Boxer system, into their day-to-day teaching.  The case studies                 will be interpretive and synthetic, organized around themes that                emerge as important in the practice of these teachers and in the                processes of change.  Each study will involve a \"stratified                     analysis\" including:  teachers' values and learning goals, the                  repeatable patterns they use in classrooms (activity structures),               the skills both teachers and students need to reproduce such                    patterns, and the kind of learning that results.  The forms of                  these case studies will be:  (1) extended narrative analysis                    charting facilitory patterns and critical barriers; and (2)                     richly annotated video tapes of classroom practice.  We will                    incorporate student teachers as apprentice researches in studying               effective new forms of instruction based on the availability of                 advanced technology.",
