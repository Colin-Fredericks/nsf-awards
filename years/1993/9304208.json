The researchers intend to collaborate                               on the development of algorithms to use                                         implicitly defined cubic curves in computer-aided                               geometric design.                                                                                                                                               There are essentially two ways to describe curves                               in the plane: with a parametrization or an                                      implicit equation. The parametrizations used in                                 computer-aided design are defined either by                                     polynomials or by rational functions and they                                   offer several advantages, including ease of                                     graphing and the existence of various methods to                                control them.  However, there is much to be                                     gained by the use of implicit equations in                                      computer-aided geometric modeling, including the                                localization of points with reference to the                                    curve.  Moreover, the use of implicit curves is                                 in its infancy in comparison with parametric                                    curves and, consequently, much work remains to be                               done on the subject.  The collaborators bring to                                the topic complementary approaches and expertise,                               and the work has the potential to make an                                       important contribution, particularly in the area                                of numerical/computational modeling.",
