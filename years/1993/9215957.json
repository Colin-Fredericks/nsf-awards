 "awd_abstract_narration": "Redinbo         Mobile cellular communication systems, a rapidly growing  communications medium, rely upon significant digital processing  elements, particularly in the central cell sites where numerous  users in a geographic area interface with the full network.   Reliability is a serious design requirement where processing  elements are shared among many users and failures can  significantly degrade the network performance for all users.   This research is applying new evolving fault tolerance design  methodologies to modern system designs which employ  configurations of high-speed functional processing units,  Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).         In the new fault-tolerance design philosophy, algorithm-  based fault tolerance, data sample integrity is paramount, and  special number codes are being used to generate parity values in  parallel with the normal processing operations.  Comparisons  between these values and other associated parity generation are  very similar to functional elements employed in the main  processing operations, and therefore can be substituted for  failed functional elements when failures are detected.         The important interrelationships between detecting failed  functional units and protecting the underlying control units are  being examined.  Simple reliability calculations employing  straightforward failure rate models are being used to guide fault  tolerance levels and the system location for detection  facilities.",
