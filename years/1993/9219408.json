 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introns of eukaryotic precursor messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) are              removed by splicing.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to                 understand how one factor, the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein               (snRNP), functions in splicing in the yeast Saccharomyces                       cerevisiae. The U1 snRNP has a critical, hierarchic role in intron              recognition.  It is the first snRNP to bind to the pre-mRNA.  This              binding depends not only on the 5' splice site, but also on the                 branchpoint region of the intron.  This suggests that these two                 regions of the intron are juxtaposed at this step.  This hypothesis             will be tested by in vitro RNAse protection assays.  Two components             of the U1 snRNP, its small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and proteins will be             studied.  The function of the SNP1 protein will be investigated;                its gene will be mutated in vitro and the effects of these                      mutations will be assayed in vivo and in vitro.  The results of the             in vitro assays will determine if, when and how the SNP| protein                functions in splicing.  The U1 snRNA will be investigated with an               in vitro reconstitution assay that will be developed.  Additional               factors for U1 snRNP function will be identified genetically and                analyzed.  These studies aim to understand fundamental mechanisms               in splice site recognition.  These mechanisms are important, for                example, for the replication of several viruses, including the                  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",
