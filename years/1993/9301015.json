 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI requests funds to operate the National Ocean Sciences                    Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) facility that has recently been             built at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  The facility is                 automated for the analysis of oceanographic seawater samples that               are being collected as part of the Global Change research programs              and will provide AMS dates as a service to the scientific                       community.                                                                                                                                                      In the mid-1980s, the ocean sciences community strongly advocated               establishing a radiocarbon dating facility dedicated to the                     analysis of carbon isotopes and other tracers in samples collected              during major Global Change related field programs such as the World             Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the Joint Global Ocean Flux             Study (JGOFS).  The original project solicitation for the Ocean                 Sciences Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) facility was presented             to the NSB as an information item in May 1987 NSB-87-35.  After                 extensive review of proposals to establish the facility, the NSB                approved a 3-year award beginning in 1989 to Woods Hole                         Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) NSB-88-164.  In 1992, a management             decision was made to extend the original award to complete                      developmental testing of the facility as part of the construction               phase prior to establishing an operational award.  This                         transitional phase was approved by the NSB in August 1992 NSB-92-               132.  Construction and testing of the facility are complete, and                this award will begin the operational phase of the facility.                                                                                                    WHOI will establish two advisory committees which will oversee the              efforts of the facility.  The National AMS Policy Board (NAPB) will             consist of extramural representatives of the AMS and oceanographic              community. This committee will meet annually to review progress at              the facility and to recommend technical and managerial changes.                 WHOI has also established an internal advisory committee that will              deal with WHOI administrative issues and will supply more frequent              oversight.  Liaison members will provide coordination between the               two committees.                                                                                                                                                 Woods Hole has successfully created a National AMS facility for the             ocean sciences community within budget and with minor delays.  The              operational phase for the AMS facility is new to both Woods Hole                and the oceanographic research community.  The commitment of                    operations support for 5 years is warranted, but until more                     experience is gained, the facility's progress will be monitored                 closely through the use of review panels and advisory boards.                   Program recommends a 5 year award with an interim review after Year             2. Budgets will be negotiated on an annual basis.                                                                                                               Program recommends an award via a cooperative agreement which will              allow NSF to maintain proper oversight during the initial operating             years.  Terms of the cooperative agreement will be negotiated by                the Division of Grants and Contracts.//",
