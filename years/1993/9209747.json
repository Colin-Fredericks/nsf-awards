 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental and computational studies of the effects of                        natural gas composition variables on autoignition delay times                   will be carried out under simulated diesel engine conditions                    in a constant-volume combustion vessel.  Onset of heat release                  and flame lumino-sity will be measured for experimental                         determination of these delay times.  In addition, the HCT                       program (an existing one-dimensional hydrodynamic, chemical,                    and thermal computer code) will be used to study the                            theoretical dependence of this delay time on natural gas                        composition.  Model predictions will be checked against the                     experimental results.  Finally, a Cooperative Fuel Research                     (CFR) single-cylinder Diesel engine will be modified to burn                    compressed natural gas (CNG) and efficacy of these                              modifications will be studied.                                                                                                                                  Natural gas is an attractive alternative fuel to diesel fuel                    since it has a low emissions potential and is readily                           available.  However, under compression ignition conditions,                     natural gas has poor ignition characteristics relative to                       diesel fuel.  Better understanding of the ignition                              characteristics of natural gas and their dependence on gas                      composition (which is somewhat variable) are needed to                          facilitate the use of this fuel in compression ignition                         engines.",
