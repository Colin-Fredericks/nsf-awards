 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Integrating Technology into the Elementary Mathematics and                     Science Curriculum (InTech)\" is an inservice program for                        elementary teachers developed by the Miami Museum of Science                    through support by the Florida Department of Education.                         InTech trains teachers to train other teachers in the                           classroom use of microcomputers, probes, databases, CD-ROMs,                    videodiscs, and simulation software.  To date, two hundred                      teacher trainers from 27 Florida school districts have been                     trained using state funds.  Dr. Judy Chen, InTech project                       director, now plans to expand this training effort to a                         national audience.  Four of the US Department of Education's                    Regional Educational Research Labs (the NETWORK, North                          Central Lab, SERVE, and the Far West Lab) will act as                           dissemination agents using the recently established                             Inter-Lab National Science and Math Collaborative.  Dr. Chen                    will also develop one additional workshop module (on                            telecommunications), thereby extending the InTech training                      workshop to a full week.  Each Regional Lab will host one                       workshop for states in that region.  A total of 96 teacher                      trainers will be trained in teams of four (science                              supervisors, university faculty, district coordinators for                      technology, representatives of state education associations)                    from 24 states (six per region).  Each participant will be                      expected to conduct at least of nine days of training, and                      their employers must commit support for this inservice                          training in the application to the workshop.                                                                                                                    Relatively few elementary school teachers are comfortable                       with computers and computer-related instruction.  Therefore,                    the proposed training and dissemination effort will address                     a pressing need in elementary schools across the country.                       Creating a network of teacher-trainers will generate an                         ever-expanding pool of teachers capable of integrating                          technology into their classroom instruction.                                                                                                                    Cost sharing represents 62% of the NSF contribution.",
