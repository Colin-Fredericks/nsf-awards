 "awd_abstract_narration": "Single stranded RNA viruses contain both messenger RNA for protein              synthesis and an RNA template for replication.  Utilizing an                    experimental system which permits the study of each of these                    functions separately both in vivo and in vitro, the proposed                    research aims at characterizing the functional domains of the QB                replicase.  Such domains involve the catalytic site, RNA                        recognition and binding, and interaction sites for a variety of                 host proteins.  Studies planned involve manipulation of viral RNA               sequences.  A second objective is the study of the viral nucleotide             sequences coding for the production of the QB replicase.  Chemical,             biochemical and molecular biological approaches will combine to                 correlate the function of the viral genome with its primary and                 secondary structure.                                                            %%%                                                                             The genome of single stranded RNA viruses is extrordinarily                     susceptible to mutation.  One consequence of this is a pronounced               difficulty in developing host resistance to viral attack.  Since                the viral RNA codes both for its replication and for synthesis of               critical proteins, it has been difficult to study these two                     activities in isolation.   The proposed research into the details               of the behavior of the viral genome is based on work in the                     investigator's laboratory which resulted in the development of an               experimental system permitting study of these two aspects of viral              genome function independently.  A variety of molecular biological               and biochemical approaches will be employed to relate the structure             of the viral genome with its ability to reproduce and infect cells.",
