 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311671  Gordon    There is widespread agreement that slow productivity growth over  the past two decades is the greatest economic problem faced by  the United States.  While the importance of U.S. productivity is  widely recognized, economists have as yet made little progress in  understanding the phenomenon.  The post-1982 slowdown in the  growth rates of average labor productivity and multi-factor  productivity have withstood the efforts of economists to provide  a single-cause explanation, including fluctuations of energy  prices, inadequate private investment, inadequate infrastructure  investment, excessive government regulation, and declining  educational scores.  While some of these may make a partial  contribution, even when combined they appear to leave most of the  slowdown unexplained.  This ongoing research project takes a  comprehensive approach to the study of slow U.S. productivity.   Its focus combines three dimensions - (1) long-run historical,  (2) cross-country, and (3) individual industry studies - and  attempts by studying these dimensions singly and in combination  to develop an improved degree of understanding.      Contrary to conventional wisdom, over the past 120 years  productivity growth in the U.S. displays the pattern of \"one big  wave,\" slow from 1870 to 1913, rapid from 1913 to 1964 (peaking  in 1928-50), and slow again after 1964.  The project attempts to  isolate the industrial sectors where the big wave occurs, assess  its statistical accuracy, and develop hypotheses to explain it.   The cross-country aspect of the research detailed industry-by-  industry data on productivity for other large nations to identify  the largest differences between the U.S.  It assesses the role of  differing measurement methodology in accounting for the  differences.  Finally, a detailed industry study will be carried  out for the U.S. construction sector, which has exhibited  negative measured productivity growth since the mid-1960s.    ***",
