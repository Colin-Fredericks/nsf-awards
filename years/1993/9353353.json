 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353353  Rowe    Curriculum development projects depend for their success on  fruitful collaboration between developers and teachers.  In many  projects, however, trial sites are spread around the country making  on going communication and feedback cumbersome.  As a result  projects suffer because developers do not receive and respond to  feedback in a timely manner.  The purpose of this project is to  create a viable electronic learning community in conjunction with  a science curriculum development project for middle schools.  In  theory the potential contribution of electronic networks is great.   In practice, however, few have survived and none have been studied  carefully enough to provide a useful knowledge base on which to  build others.  Two NSF funded projects will collaborate, one in  curriculum and one that has developed communication software  especially suited to help people who are geographically dispersed  work together to produce better results.  One product of this study  will be the preparation of guidelines for the formation of new  electronic learning communities.  ***",
