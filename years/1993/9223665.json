 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concerns over global warming, carbon monoxide pollution and ozone               formation are forcing a fundamental shift in the role of                        alternative fuels and fuel additives in Western Hemisphere                      markets.  In the U.S. Clean-Air Act legislation mandates the use                of cleaner burning fuels.  Ethanol is the primary renewable                     liquid fuel alternative.  There are two major ethanol country                   programs in the Western Hemisphere.  The U.S has a modest, highly               subsidized, high cost trade-protected corn-based industry.                      Brazil has a larger, lower-cost, excess supply, sugarcane-based                 ethanol program.  This project focuses on the compilation of a                  domestic database suitable for research into the viability of                   alternative liquid fuels.  The demand analysis is restricted to                 the U.S. market to be met by both domestic and imported supplies.               Supply and demand changes in response to Clean-Air Act                          legislation are estimated.  Alternative domestic subsidy and                    import policies are explored within a cost-benefit framework.                   Polices benefitting consumers, producers, and governments with                  ever tightening budgets are proposed and evaluated.",
