 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Conference session on Domains in Ferroelectrics will be                 held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on                    Ferroelectrics during the Summer, 1993 at NIST to address current               research topics such as systems of domain walls and their                       interactions with each other, the thermodynamics and kinetics of                domain wall configurations and domain walls that are both fer-                  roelectric as well as ferroelastic.  There are many materials, such             as relaxors, and devices, such as integrated ferroelectric thin                 film memories, in which these aspects are of central importance.                Since these topics are usually not taught as such in graduate                   programs the conference organization is making a special effort to              have a large student participation.  Arrangements were made to                  expand the Conference session into an evening Workshop session to               allow for in-depth discussions on critical subject areas.  It is                expected that top scientists in the field will attend, and that the             Conference and Workshop sessions will provide an effective forum to             discuss and delineate critical scientific issues, and to consider               and define the approaches and techniques needed to address them.                %%%                                                                                  An evaluation of the status of domains in ferroelectrics, and              recommendations by the session participants for the emphasis of                 future work, and their assessment of the most important contem-                 porary research issues will be of great value to the understanding              and development of ferroelectric and related materials, and for                 their subsequent utilization in fields such as microelectronics.",
