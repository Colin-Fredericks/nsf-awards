 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments are proposed using the incoherent scatter radar                     facility at Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland, and to study plasma                   processes on magnetic field lines connected to the dayside auroral              oval and discrete arcs in the evening sector.  Recent upgrades to               the radar have made several new operating modes possible that will              enable measurements of ionospheric properties such as vertical and              horizontal ion drift, electron densities, and ion and electron                  temperatures with greatly improved temporal and spatial resolution.             A carefully planned experimental program will be conducted that                 takes advantage of these new capabilities as well as additional                 data from other ground-based instruments and satellites.  The                   objectives are (1) to study the spatial and temporal variations of              ionospheric properties in the dayside auroral oval, (2) to                      characterize the source region for ions that are transported from               the dayside oval to populate the magnetosphere, and (3) to develop              radar methods for observing plasma properties at high altitudes on              field lines connected to auroral arcs.  The dayside observations                will be used to define the initial conditions for theoretical                   modeling of upward ion fluxes and their effects on magnetospheric               pressure balance in the near-Earth plasma sheet.  The high altitude             measurements on auroral field lines will be used to determine the               presence of coherent echoes from plasma turbulence associated with              the auroral acceleration region.  The results of these experiments              will establish a firm observational framework for ground-based                  studies of auroral precipitation and will have important                        implications for our understanding of magnetosphere/ionosphere                  coupling on the dayside and how it relates to auroral substorm                  processes.",
