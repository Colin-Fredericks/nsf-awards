 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory has developed a procedure for using beta-                    lactamase (beta-1a) for analysis of the topology of transmembrane               proteins expressed in yeast.  A C-terminal beta-1a reporter is                  fused to N-terminal fragments of target proteins via the P fragment             of Killer preprotoxin.  In fusions in which this P-beta-1a reporter             is lumenal, processing of P in a late Golgi compartment by the Kex2             protease results in secretion of beta-1a.  Analysis of Kex2-                    dependent beta-1a secretion, with and without an intervening signal             sequence S, provides positive identification of both cytoplasmic                (internal) and \"periplasmic\" (external) fusion sites.  A model for              the Ste2 receptor was produced that agreed with predictions.                    Corroborative data should result from analysis of the size, N-                  glycosylation pattern and protease sensitivity of the intact fusion             proteins expressed in a kex2 mutant, or expressed in vitro.  The                technique is being used to analyze the topology of Pma1, the yeast              plasma membrane proton ATPase, a model for the family of P-type                 ATPase ion pumps found in all cell types.  Any ambiguities in                   deduced topology will be resolved using a sandwich technique, using             either beta-1a or P-beta-1a as the inserted reporter.  Analyses of              Pma1 function by site-directed mutagenesis have identified many                 residues important to the conserved cytoplasmic kinase and                      phosphatase domains, but have had very limited success in                       identifying residues critical to proton channel function.  Our                  preliminary Pma1 topology identifies new candidate residues; if the             topology is confirmed, the phenotypes of mutants in these residues              should clarify the ion pump mechanism.                                          %%%                                                                             A thorough understanding of protein function (and the ability to                use such an understanding to engineer proteins with desired                     properties) depends on knowledge of three-dimensional structure.                Unfortunately, the very properties of integral membrane proteins                that allow their transmembrane segments to interact with the lipid              biolayer make it impossible to apply the usual approaches for                   purification and crystallization that are normally employed for                 determining 3-D protein structures.  Thus, structural information               on membrane-spanning proteins is particularly difficult to obtain.              This is frustrating, because some of the most interesting proteins              from a functional point of view are membrane-spanning proteins                  (receptors, pumps, channels, etc.).  This project offers a clever               approach to the dilemma, which involves topological analysis of                 membrane proteins through genetic engineering.  The idea is to                  construct chimeric mutants of the membrane protein of interest in               which the introduced piece has a known proteolytic cleavage site                that only gets cleaved if it is facing the lumen of the Golgi.  By              determining which constructs undergo cleavage, one can deduce the               locations of the transmembrane regions of the protein, and from                 that deduce 3-D structure.  Although the project focuses on a                   specific transmembrane proton pump, the approach can be generalized             to a wide variety of biologically important proteins.  Many                     downstream biotechnological applications of both the approach and               the structural information obtained can easily be envisioned.",
