(A blind prediction is one in which the  prediction is made without knowing in advance what the  result should be.)  These tests are being conducted by a  consortium of organizations, including the Electric Power  Research Institute (EPRI), the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, and institutions from Taiwan, Japan, Korea and  France.    The three tasks are:    (1) Comparisons of observed data with earlier predictions  for the response of the containment model, prior to backfill  of the soil surrounding the foundation, are used to test the  computer programs employed, and to improve the mathematical  models for the structure and the soil.  (2) Blind predictions are made for the response of the  structure during forced vibration tests, after backfill of  the soil surrounding the foundation.  (3) The prediction are compared with observations (which are  to be released by EPRI only after the blind predictions have  been properly recorded) for an overall assessment of the  current capability to model the dynamic response of  structures partially embedded in medium strength soils and  subjected to external forces.    Funding for this project is a collaboration between the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the National Science  Foundation.  ***",
