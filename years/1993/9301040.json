 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports work by Professor Shahidi in the theory of             automorphic forms and representation theory.  The investigator will             study the non-discrete tempered spetrum of classical groups over                local fields by means of the theory of endoscopy as developed by                Kottwitz, Langlands and Shelstad.                                                    This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
