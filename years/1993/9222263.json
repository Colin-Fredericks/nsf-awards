 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222263  Birkle         Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a 41-amino acid  neuropeptide, plays a central role in the physiological response  to stress and anxiety.  Behavioral studies have demonstrated that  injection of this neuropeptide into the brain mimics anxiety-like  and stress-like reactions possibly by its activation of the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  Indeed under certain  conditions, CRF is released into the portal system from neurons  in the hypothalamus, stimulates the pituitary to secrete  adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) which then acts on the adrenal  to release glucocorticoids.  Recently, CRF-secreting neurons have  been shown to be not only located in the hypothalamic area but  also in limbic structures, including the amygdala.  This is  exciting since the amygdala is considered to be the seat of  emotional responses like fear and rage.  Dr. Birkle will examine  the regulation of the release of CRF from neurons in the  amygdala.  She will use neurons from this brain region that are   isolated from developing tissue and grown in culture.  This  technique offers the advantage of creating a pure population of  nerve cells in an easily manipulated environment.  Dr. Birkle  will first identify neurons that contain CRF receptors and then  determine what type of neurotransmitter are also located in these  cells.  She will use then determine the effects of exposure to  these neurochemical mediators and their antagonists on the  release of CRF.  The results will provide new insights about the  regulation of CRF in extrahypothalamic sites.  Since CRF plays a  pivotal role in the expression of anxiety and autonomic responses  to stressful events, the results will provide a better  understanding about how the brain, as a whole, integrates the  multicomponent response to stress and anxiety.  Moreover, this  work will increase our knowledge of the neurochemical processes  that lead to the experience of anxiety and will provide direction  for the development of better preventi on and therapy for this  disorder.  ***",
