 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project outlines a research plan for the development of a                  sensor to measure supersaturation activity in solution.  The sensor             consists of a tube chamber which is immersed in the solution and                which is filled with a buffer solution containing a probe molecule              pyranine.  One side of the chamber consists of a ion exchange                   membrane which allows for the selective transport of protons from               the exterior solution into the chamber, but does not allow the                  transport of the probe molecule out into the solution.  The proton              concentration determines the equilibrium between the protonated and             unprotonated forms of pyranine.  The chamber is irradiated by UV                light through a fiber optic inserted into the chamber.  The                     radiation excites both protonated and unprotonated forms of the                 molecule, causing emission of the protonated form at 440 nm and of              the unprotonated form at 511 nm.  The ration of the intensities at              these two wavelengths is a function of the ratio of the ratio of                the two molecular forms, and this in turn characterizes the proton              concentration in the chamber (and presumably in the solution).  The             intensities are measured using a second fiber optic immersed in the             chamber and connected to a photodiode detector.                                                                                                                 This sensor will be used to measure supersaturation.  Recent                    evidence for source indicates that the concentration level affects              the proton availability.  In particular, previous research reviewed             in the proposal demonstrates that the emission intensities of the               protonated form of the molecular increases with sucrose                         concentration, while that of the unprotonated form decreases with               increasing sucrose concentration.",
