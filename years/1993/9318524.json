 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318524 Reid  This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year continuing award for the \"Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research\" Program at the Oklahoma State University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Web Handling.  The Center has demonstrated successful research support from industrial members and has met the review criteria of I/UCRC Program.    Funding is also provided to support an evaluator at the Center to continue the evaluation responsibility on monitoring the industry/university interaction in the Center.    The U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Office is providing funding to obtain a non-voting membership in the Center.  Additional funding is provided for a woman undergraduate student to aid the Center in its's ongoing research activities.      The Program Manager recommends the Oklahoma State University be awarded:   $33,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award (includes $8,000 for evaluator support); $5,000 for one year to support an undergraduate student; and $10,000 for one year with funds provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.  This continuing grant should be processed as a unilateral action with $10,000 funded in FY93 with funds provided by the Department of Energy and $38,000 funded with FY94 funds with no other action required.  Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which  the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the next period of this continuing award.",
