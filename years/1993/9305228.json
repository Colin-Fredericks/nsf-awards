 "awd_abstract_narration": "P.I. will study some free interface problems modeling                      combustion and phase transitions which generate complex dynamics                even in 1-D evolution. He will prove global in time existence of                classical solutions and stability for Hopf bifurcation. He will                 obtain numerically a complete dynamical portrait including                      sequences of period doubling and transition to chaos, infinite                  period bifurcations, Silnikov type dynamics etc. Finite-D system                modeling entire variety of their dynamics will be derived and                   studied. P.I. will also study numerically and analytically                      dynamics  generated by a number of invariant surface evolution                  equations.  The equations model basic instabilities in flames and               demonstrate formation of nontrivial patterns such as cellular                   structures, self-turbulence, spiral waves etc.                                       P.I. will study rigorously and numerically several problems                modeling propagation of flames, solidification fronts and laser                 induced evaporation.  These processes are known to generate                     complex dynamical patterns, both temporal and spacial. P.I will                 obtain numerically a complete dynamical portrait of a variety of                regular and chaotic pulsating regimes associated with plane                     evolution.   P.I. will also study numerically and analytically                  dynamics generated by a number of surface evolution equations.
