This project is a  collaborative study of surface interactions that will lead to an  elucidation of relationships between biomaterial surface properties  and blood protein and monocyte/macrophage adhesion and activation.   The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Applied  Polymers will be responsible for the biological characterization  both before and following protein adsorption.  The  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Biosurfaces  will be responsible for surface characterization both before and  following protein adsorption and cell adhesion.    The researchers are very well qualified to perform this joint  project.    Additional funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's  Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Office to obtain a  non-voting membership in the Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center for Applied Polymers Research.    The Program Manager recommends Case Western Reserve University be  awarded $25,000 for the first year of a two-year continuing award.   An additional $10,000 is recommended for one year with funding  provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.",
