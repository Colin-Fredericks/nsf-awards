 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222177  Potts    The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play a  major role in immune recognition.  Because of this, it has  generally been assumed that their unequalled genetic diversity  results from parasite-driven selection.  However, these genes may  also function in a genetic-based kin-recognition system.  This  possibility is indicated by Dr. Potts' recent demonstration that  female house mice prefer to mate with MHC-dissimilar males, but  prefer to nest communally with MHC-similar females.  Dr. Potts  will now attempt to extend these findings in two major ways.   First, discrimination in kin-recognition systems requires a  referent to which other individuals are compared.  Dr. Potts will  use MHC-based mating preferences in a seminatural population of  house mice as an assay to determine (1) whether self, a parent, a  nestmate, or some combination is the referent, and (2) the nature  of the rules for matching MHC haplotypes.  Second, to determine  whether or not the unique features of MHC (known primarily from  studies of mice) are general vertebrate traits, Dr. Potts will  evaluate MHC-related patterns of fitness, mating, and genetic  diversity in natural populations of five other vertebrate  species.    If MHC genes are generally involved in disease resistance, mating  preferences, and kin recognition in vertebrate species,  understanding the mechanisms and function of this MHC-based  discrimination will have important implications for a wide range  of areas in vertebrate biology.  These areas include the  evolution of immune-recognition systems, the evolution of social  behavior, modulation of kin-based cooperation, inbreeding-  avoidance mechanisms, and the genetic basis of mating behavior  and kin discrimination.",
