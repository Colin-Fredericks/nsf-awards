 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research planning grant for women, experiments are being                conducted that will test the effect of immune system proteins,                  interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tissue necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)               on steroidogenic secretion and follicular health in two genetic                 lines of laying chickens selected for either a high (HA) or low                 (LA) antibody response to sheep erythrocytes.  IL-1 isolated from               the chicken macrophage HD 11 cell line and human recombinant TNF                alpha will be used to ascertain in vitro granulosa and thecal cell              androstenedione and progesterone secretion as affected by an immune             protein.  Further, follicles will be examined for morphological                 appearance and the presence of surface hemorrhages prior to cell                culture as an indicator of atresia.  Ethidium bromide agarose gels              of DNA isolated from these same follicles will be used to further               substantiate follicular health as determined by the presence or                 absence of 185 base pair fragments, an indicator of cellular                    apoptosis.  Additional experiments will test the in vivo response               of laying hens to a strong immune challenge induced by an                       intraperitoneal injection of sephadex particles.  Follicles will be             isolated and examined for morphological appearance as described                 before.  Gonadal cells will be grown in cell culture for the                    assessment of steroid secretion, followed by the isolation of DNA               for an assessment of apoptosis.  It is anticipated that isolation               of IL-1 from the HD 11 cell line will lead to the determination of              the amino acid sequence of the protein.  Once this information is               obtained, future studies will be developed to clone the gene for                IL-1, and use this as a means of assessing immune system proteins               as regulators of reproduction in avian species.                                                                                                                 These experiments will be used to assess the role of the immune                 system as a regulator of reproductive efficiency.  In order to                  complete these experiments, laying chickens will be used as the                 research model since follicles destined for ovulation can be                    predicted precisely as well as those follicles most likely to be                excluded from future development.  Two experiments will be                      conducted that will: (1) assess the role of specific immune system              proteins, interleukin 1 and tissue necrosis factor alpha, on the                secretion of gonadal hormones from cells isolated from ovarian                  tissue, and (2) measure the secretion of gonadal hormones from                  ovarian tissues after hens are exposed to a laboratory induced                  immunological challenge.  The effect of immune proteins or an                   immune challenge on follicular health will be determined by                     measuring the presence or absence of cellular genetic material                  (DNA) which has been degraded after the exposure to either of the               two treatments.  It is hoped that results from these experiments                will lead to the isolation of the protein, interleukin 1, from                  chicken immune system cells.  It is further anticipated that future             experiments will be planned to determine not only the role of the               immune system on reproduction, but how this system and its                      secretory proteins are controlled.",
