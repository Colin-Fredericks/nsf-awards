 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be done to complete and extend a broader, simpler,                and more physically based reformulation of the crystallographic                 description of periodic and quasiperiodic materials.  There are now             great simplifications to be made in both the derivation and the                 description of the so-called superspace-group categories of                     quasiperiodic materials.  In the case of the (3+1) non-cubic and                the (3+3) cubic superspace groups this reformulation will clarify               conceptually, condense in form, and extend in scope the existing                scheme, while demonstrating explicitly that its present restriction             to weakly modulated crystals is entirely unnecessary.  Rules will               be extracted for this new crystallography (including rules for the              compatibility of point group and lattice that are obscure in the                quasiperiodic case) by deriving the generalized crystallography                 from the general stability conditions for materials with                        diffraction patterns consisting of Bragg peaks.  The extension of               this approach to magnetic and color groups will be investigated in              both the periodic and quasiperiodic case and the question of                    commensurate-incommensurate transitions will be reexamined from                 this new perspective.                                                           %%%                                                                             Research will be done on a new formulation of crystallography.  The             work is motivated by the discovery of quasiperiodic materials which             are not adequately described by conventional crystallography.  In               reformulating crystallography to account for these quasiperiodic                materials, a new scheme has been devised to cover periodic                      materials as well.  This unique approach could have a major impact              in crystallography.",
