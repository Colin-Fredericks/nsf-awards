 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on attempts by Mayan peoples in Guatemala                 to create a civil, multicultural, and all encompassing state in                 the context of 35 year civil war.  Recently there has been an                   increase in the number of Mayan groups who are attempting to                    define themselves in the context of a multicultural state and, at               the same, time maintain some sense of ethnic identity.  The key                 issue the PI hopes to illuminate is the fact that states consist                of a variety of interest groups which compete and cooperate as                  they struggle to articulate some form of a national identity.                   This process will be examined by interviewing leaders in                        government, business, military, and ethnic sectors and analyzing                their statements presented i the media, at festivals, tourism                   literature, and political rallies.",
