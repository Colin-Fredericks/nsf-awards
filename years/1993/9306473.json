 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306473  Kohn       Natural populations of the emergent-aquatic annual  Eichhornia paniculata often contain two readily identifiable  genetic morphs whose rates of self fertilization average 0.8 and  0.2, respectively.  We will take advantage of these populations  to evaluate several recent theoretical predications of critical  importance for understanding the evolutionary  dynamics of  inbreeding depression and mating system change.  We will measure  morph-specific levels of self fertilization and male outcrossing  success to obtain complete information on morph-specific gamete  transmission in these natural populations.  This will provide  some of the first information on how a floral morphology that  increases the selfing rate affects other aspects of gamete  transmission.  We will evaluate morph-specific inbreeding  depression to see if genes that control the mating system are in  disequilibrium with fitness alleles responsible for inbreeding  depression.  Such associations are expected under many recent  theoretical models and can alter expectations based on population  mean levels of inbreeding depression.  However, associations  between mating and fitness alleles have not as yet been  demonstrated in any natural population of hermaphroditic plants.   We will resample morph frequencies in populations first examined  over 10 years ago to gain information on the stability of morph  ratios over time.  Previous measures of transmission in these  populations provided an expectation of rapid decline in the  frequency of the morph with the lower selfing rate.  If morph  frequencies  have not changed, our measures of transmission and  viability should shed light on factors maintaining mating system  polymorphism.  If the morph with the lower selfing rate is in  decline, we will gain an unusually well-documented example of  evolution by natural selection over a human time scale.  The  results will provide useful insights into factors promoting  stability or instability of mixed mating systems and t he dynamics  of inbreeding depression in natural populations.***",
