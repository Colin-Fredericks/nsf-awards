 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings the Mathematica public-domain software                      Signal Processing Packages (SPP) to engineering, mathematics,                   and physics students who can use computers to speed up their                    learning process, to learn material on their own, to test                       themselves, to generate their own problems and answers. The                     University of the Pacific is setting up a laboratory with                       computers dedicated to SPP for students to do assigned                          problems. These computers are being used to complement and not                  to replace students' understanding of the basic principles                      involved. Thus, only after the students demonstrate they can                    solve problems in a certain area are they assigned computer                     problems in that area. SPP covers most areas taught in                          engineering and mathematics. Areas not covered by SPP are                       covered by Mathematica. This project is being designed liberate                 students from the drudgery of repeated calculations. The                        student use the time saved to learn new material or do other                    homework.",
