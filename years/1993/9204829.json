 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amino acid metabolism, involving unusually diverse intermediates                and/or products, is central to all cellular processes. Amino acids              per se are the building blocks of proteins, and enzymes (which are              nearly all proteins) are amazingly effective biocatalysts.  The                 amino acid sequence of enzymes (proteins) specifies conformation;               catalytic function arises from conformation which, in turn, relates             to the binding of substrate molecules in precise orientation and to             the stabilization of transition states.  Multiple techniques can                now be used to explore the molecular basis for specific enzymic                 function and to modify enzymes in specific ways.  The objective of              the proposed of the proposed research is to study                               structure/function interrelationships of 2-key enzymes involved in              L-Threonine metabolism.  L-Threonine dehydrogenase and 2-amino-3-               ketobutyrate lyase, enzymes we first succeeded in purifying to                  homogeneity, will be the objects of in depth structure\\function                 studies.  This dehydrogenase and lyase, in sequences, are the first             two enzymes in the primary route for threonine utilization by both              eukaryotes and prokaryotes.  By the action of these two enzymes, L-             threonine is first oxidized to the unstable intermediate, 2-amino-              3-ketobutyrate, which in turn is cleaved by the lyase in a coenzyme             A-dependent reaction yielding acetyl CoA plus glycine.  Threonine               dehydrogenase is one of a number of gene products whose level has               been shown to be regulated by leucine-i.e. it is a member of the                so-called leucine regulon.  We proposed studying these two pure                 enzymes, with primary emphasis on the dehydrogenase and secondary               emphasis on the lyase, but selective chemical                                   modification/inactivation experiments, by isolating and sequencing              peptides containing these modified residues, and thereby establish              their position in the primary structure of the molecule.  Since the             genes for both of these enzymes have recently been cloned and the               primary structure of each enzyme is now known, site-directed                    mutagenesis of specific amino acid residues will be carried out and             the effects of such changes on the enzyme's catalytic/regulatory                properties examined.  Attempts will also be made to crystallize                 this dehydrogenase (primary effort) and lyase (secondary) for                   subsequent 3-dimensional structure determination by X-ray                       crystallographic techniques.  The goal are to relate specific                   enzyme catalysis/regulation with protein structure and to                       understand enzymic processes in sufficient detail so that, long                 range, modern metabolic and protein engineering is possible.                    %%%                                                                             Advances made by studies such as this are significant in that a                 thorough knowledge of metabolic/enzymic processes allows for modern             metabolic/protein engineering. By such engineering pathways may be              altered to remove a poisonous product, introduce a new pathway, and             /or enhance production of a commercially important material.",
