 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with application of a kinetic model                          describing the general sequence of events undergone by protein                  at an interface to quantify protein charge and stability                        effects on interfacial behavior.  Selected synthetic mutants                    of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme are produced form transformed                      cells obtained from the Institute of Molecular Biology at the                   University of Oregon.  Mutants exhibiting differences in                        thermodynamic stability and charge are used to quantify the                     influences of these molecular properties on reaction rate                       constants describing protein attachment and unfolding at each                   of a series of solid surfaces differing in hydrophobicity.                      Silicon surfaces will be modified by silanization with                          dichlorodimethylsilane, and in situ ellipsometry will be used                   to measure the adsorption kinetics and isotherm describing                      each specific protein- surface contact.  Upon completion of                     the project, current multi-protein adsorption models could be                   re-examined and refined by studying adsorption from mixtures                    of lysozyme mutants.  Experimentation with more relevant                        mixtures of proteins would then allow deviations from                           predicted behavior to be related to properties such as                          molecular size and shape in a more readily quantifiable way.                    This approach is expected to result in a sound starting point                   for quantifying competitive adsorption from complex media and                   may lead to new separation techniques.",
