 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research continues the study of generic stochastic                    manufacturing systems.  It includes the development of further                  results on simple almost optimal heuristics for parallel machine                scheduling.  It also examines a wide range of flow line problems,               including probabilistic analysis of deterministic scheduling rules,             new models for tandem lines with dependent service times, and some              new performance measures aimed at reduced Work-In-Process and Just-             In-Time manufacturing.  New approaches to control of queueing                   networks and jobshops, such as Bandit problems and                              Brownian networks that may yield robust, simple, priority                       scheduling rules will be explored.  Some recently started work in               scheduling of a metal rolling mill, will provide a practical                    testbed for the combined  application of stochastic and                         deterministic models.  Here the stochastic models provide long term             optimal throughput, while short term deterministic algorithms                   minimize setup and changeover costs.  This is a realistic approach              for the increasing uncertainty as the time horizon lengthens.                        Technology transfer will be achieved through the                           implementation of case studies and development of constructional                manuals and tutorials for curriculum in manufacturing systems.",
