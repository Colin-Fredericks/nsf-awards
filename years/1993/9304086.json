 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304086 Andersen          Advances in electron microscopy and in molecular analyses of DNA have renewed interest in many aspects of the biology of protists (unicellular algae, fungi, and protozoa).  Two primary reasons are their roles in bridging the evolutionary gap between prokaryotes (bacteria) and the multicellular plants and animals, and their roles as model experimental systems in cell and molecular biology.  Despite the interest of many biologists in the phylogeny of protists, few scientists have addressed the basic problems in terminology and homology that were created by the classical academic separation of the fields of phycology, mycology, and protozoology.  In an attempt to resolve problems in communication and synthesis, a NSF sponsored task force was established in 1987.  The Cell Surface Components Task Force will complete its studies this year, and it will present its findings at the 1993 American Institute of Biological Sciences annual meeting.  Leading national and international scientists will participate in two symposia that summarize recent advances in the study of protistan cell surfaces.  Proceedings of the meetings and additional solicited review papers will be published in international journals. %%%          Experts in the biology of unicellular algae, fungi, and protozoa will meet at the annual meetings of the American Institute of Biological Sciences to synthesize recent ultrastructural and molecular data on protis tan organisms.  The principal goal is to synthesize a single, coherent terminology for homologous features of protistan cell surfaces, hitherto obscured by the separate academic traditions of studying these organisms in phycology, mycology, and protozoology departments.",
