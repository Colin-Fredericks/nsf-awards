 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306813  Carey    The overall goal of this 3-year project is to increase  understanding of regulatory signals underlying changes in  intestinal function during the seasonal cycle of a mammalian  hibernator, the 13-lined ground squirrel.  Previous studies in  the applicant's laboratory have documented structural and  functional changes in small intestinal tissues of ground  squirrels that are closely related to the seasonal cycles of food  intake and metabolic activity in these animals.  During the  proposed project period, we plan to extend our earlier findings  and determine how digestive enzyme and nutrient transport  function are regulated during the different activity phases of  ground squirrels.  This objective will be met by focusing on four  areas:  (1) characterization of sugar and amino acid transport at  the level of the brush border membrane; (2) immunocytochemical  localization of Na+-glucose transporter and sucrase-isomaltase  proteins in intestinal tissues; (3) determination of intestinal  epithelial cell age and migration rates in hibernating and active  squirrels; (4) determination of messenger RNA levels coding for  NA+-glucose transporter and sucrase-isomaltase proteins during  specific activity states of the squirrels.  This project will  directly address the increasing evidence (in non-hibernating  species) that the presence of luminal substrate is required for  maximal expression of nutrient transporters on brush border  membranes, by studying a mammal that has been shaped by adaptive  evolution to forego feeding for long periods of time.  Together,  these studies should provide a comprehensive picture that  characterizes the regulation of nutrient digestive and transport  function on multiple levels.  Information gained from this study  will increase our understanding of the ability of intestinal  transport systems to adapt to dramatic changes in food resources  in a seasonal environment.  ***",
