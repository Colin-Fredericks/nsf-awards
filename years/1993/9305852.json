 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305852  Gehring       This project is concerned with mathematical research on  geometric problems associated with classical complex analysis and  its more modern derivatives of quasiconformal mapping and Mobius  groups in two and higher dimensions.  The work on groups focuses  on questions related to the geometry of discrete two generator  groups with an elliptic generator.  It is possible to study the  groups through triples of complex numbers derived from the traces   of the generators.  But not all triples come from two-generator  groups and efforts to determine description of the sets  which determine discrete groups or the sets arising from  elliptic generators of order greater than three will be  undertaken.  Applications of this work are made to the study of  three- dimensional complete hyperbolic orbifolds.  In  particular substantial improvements in known lower bounds for the  volume of these orbifolds has been found.  The primary goal of  this project is to show that the volume of every hyperbolic  orbifold is the same as those for which the corresponding group  contains an elliptic element of order greater than three.  This  value is approximately .03905... Work in quasiconformal mapping  continues on the basic issue of determining when a domain in  dimension greater than two is quaiconformally equivalent to the  unit ball of the same dimension.  Sufficient conditions are known  through Schoenflies type theorems.  If necessary conditions are  found, they will probably have to be formulated in certain types  of k- connectivity of the domains.  Finally, students supported  by this award will consider how classical function theory  relations discovered by Hardy and Littlewood carry over to  bounded quasidisks.        Studies in geometric function theory focus on how domains  are mapped into one another by smooth functions on which  various distortion restrictions are placed.  Questions of which  domains can be transformed into one another arise naturally and  this point of view automati cally leads to group theoretic  questions of fundamental consequence.  ***",
