 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleague study by mathematical                   modeling and computer simulation several phenomena dealing with                 the mechanochemistry of cell and organelle motions.  In                         particular, they focus on the role of biased random motions in                  creating order at two levels of organization.  At the cell/tissue               level they investigate how apparently random cell motions can                   self organize into tissue geometries via boundary inhibitions and               intercellular communication.  At the molecular/cell level they                  examine several intracellular motility phenomena that appear to                 extract work from random thermal motions by employing chemical                  bond energy to ratchet molecular assembly and disassembly.                           This study aims at basic questions about how cells move                    and change shape during morphogenesis, and how macromolecules                   are transported across cell membranes.  The issues are important                for fundamental understanding, and also have implications for                   such problems as wound healing and the development of tissues.                  During and after protein synthesis on ribosomes the nascent                     polypeptide chains must be transported across internal membranes                into intracellular compartments such as endoplasmic reticula and                mitochondria.  How this is accomplished is a mystery, for                       it appears to proceed in the absence of a metabolic energy                      source such as nucleotide hydrolysis.  The investigators propose                a mechanism to explain this process based on the idea that                      the thermal motions of the amino acid chain can be biased by                    any process that makes it difficult for the chain to go                         backwards.  Examples of such processes are binding of                           chaperonins, glycosylation, and/or chain folding.  The propulsion               mechanism of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is               another example of a process that works, they believe, by                       ratcheted Brownian motion.  This bacterium drives itself by                     building a tail of cross-linked actin filaments.  They propose to               model this process by simulating the coupled dynamics of tail                   assembly and the Brownian motion of the bacterium.",
