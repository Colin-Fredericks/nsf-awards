 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will pioneer the use of a newly emerging  light                      scattering technique, diffusive wave spectroscopy (DWS), to the                 study of the dynamics of structure formation in colloidal systems.              In DWS applied to colloidal suspensions, light scatters off of many             colloid particles before leaving the system. The scattered light                is measured by a PM tube.  For each particular photon path, the                 displacement of the particles in the path (\u001ari(t)) gives rise to a              change in the scattering intensity. By measuring the scattering                 intensity as a function of time,  the autocorrelation g1(t) of the              scattered light can be obtained. It is assumed that (1) the net                 phase change for the scatterings along a photon path is a Gaussian              random variable, (2) the displacement vector of a particle in a                 photon path (\u001ari(t)) and the scattering vector qi are uncorrelated,             and (3) the direction of propogation becomes uncorrelated over a                length l*.  With these assumptions,   the contribution to the                   correlation function for one photon path can be written in terms                of the mean square displacement <\u001ar2>,  l* and the path length s.               To obtain the contribution of  path lengths of length s to the                  total scattering intensity, the energy density of the light at time             t and position r (the photons per unit volume U(t,r))  is first                 obtained by solving a diffusion equation for the particular sample              geometry, and from this function the weighting factor can be                    obtained. The transport mean free path is obtained by a calibration             procedure in which an autocorrelation is measured on particles                  which are not interacting and the mean square displacement can be               estimated from theory. The technique will be used to probe the                  influence of ionic stregth and concentration on short time particle             dynamics in disordered and ordered systems.",
