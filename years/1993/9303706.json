 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303706  Ermentrout       The proposer continues his work on the modelling of central  pattern generators with particular application to the lamprey  spinal cord.  He collaborates with several physiologists on  modelling of the propagation and genesis of electrical activity  in muscular and nervous tissues.  Techniques for reducing complex  membrane models to ``connectionist'' models and the requisite  numerical routines will be developed.  Interactive computational  tools for solving of parabolic PDES and integral equations that  arise in biological models will also be developed.       The formation of regular patterns of muscular contraction  activity is critical in many living systems.  This proposal aims  to study the common features of this organization.  The rhythmic  waves of contraction as food moves down the small intestine, the  small regular changes in diameter of blood vessels, and the  regular beating of the heart are all controlled by oscillating  electrical activity of cells.  Understanding such patterned  oscillators is critical in developing a fundamental understanding  of physiological structures and functions.  Moreover,  irregularities in these activities can lead to diseased states  and in some cases even death.  Mathematical models of interacting  rhythmical units can shed light on how the units normally behave  and interact, how irregularities in the units arise, and  sometimes on how to reset them to their normal mode.  The  proposer continues his work on such models as well as the  development of computational tools to aid in this type of  modeling.  ***",
