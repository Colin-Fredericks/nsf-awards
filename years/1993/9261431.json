 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project is in the                general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the                     subfield of surface spectroscopy.  This research should determine               the feasibility of developing an inelastic tunneling spectrometer               capable of measuring the vibrational spectrum of adsorbed species               on surfaces in the room temperature regime.  The device features                inelastic tunneling and field emission of electrons across a gas                or vacuum gap.  The novel innovation in this device is the use of               reversed biased semiconductor electrodes.  Electrons generated in               an inversion layer on p-Si have a very narrow distribution of                   energies which leads to an electron beam probe with a bandwidth as              low as 2.8 meV at room temperature, depending on doping density.                The narrow bandwidth allows inelastic spectra to be determined at               room temperature.  Previously liquid helium temperatures (4.2 deg               K) were required to obtain good resolution.  The new device should              have all the beneficial properties of low temperature inelastic                 tunneling spectroscopy including very wide spectral range and                   fractional monolayer sensitivity.  Additional attributes of the                 new device will be operation at room temperature and use of                     substrates other than alumina.                                                  %%%                                                                             The spectral tool whose feasibility is being evaluated in this                  Phase I research should enable the vibrational spectroscopic                    characterization of many adsorbed molecules which play critical                 roles in numerous technologically and commercially important                    processes.",
