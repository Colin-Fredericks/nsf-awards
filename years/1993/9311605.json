Using tunable single frequency sources,  short pulses and subwavelength spatial resolution, the key  statistical characteristic of wave propagation and the microscopic  scattering parameters are determined in an ensemble of random  scatterers.  Measurements are made of the scaling of the  probability distributions, correlation function and average value  of the intensity, transmission and conductance as well as time of  flight distribution of localized waves.  The description of  propagation is cast into a universal form using appropriate  combinations of scattering parameters, sample geometry and boundary  conditions.  %%%  Classical wave propagation is the vehicle for communication and  provides a measure for discovering the structure of inhomogenous  systems.  Moreover, it serves as a model for electronic transport  in ultrasmall systems.  The aim of this project is to find a  universal description of the transition from diffusive regime  (random scattering from many centers, like atoms and molecules) to  a \"localized\" regime where the light is no longer able to propagate  through the medium.  This is a subtle and complicated effect that  is known for electrons in the semiconductor world, but is just now  being explored for optical and mircrowave radiation propagating  through macroscopic media.  The research has important implications  for photonic materials development and technological applications  such as compact filters and switches.  ***",
