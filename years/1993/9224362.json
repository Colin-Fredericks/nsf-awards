 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent decades have seen considerable progress in geographic               information processing, particularly the application of computer                methods to mapping.  Less attention and fewer resources have been               devoted to the final part of the cartographic communication                     process, the transformation of information from map to map                      readers.  Theories that explain how humans visually process                     spatial information can lead to future geographical information                 systems that not only display maps, but also perform visual                     processing of information such as searches, identifications,                    comparisons, classifications and generalizations.  This research                project seeks to examine the cognitive processes that underlie                  visual search by map readers, and it will model components of                   those human search processes through computer simulations based                 on neural net principles.  A series of experiments will be                      conducted wherein subjects perform search tasks using maps as                   stimuli.  These experiments will document the search behavior of                human map readers and uncover the cognitive processes that were                 the basis of their search behavior.  Experimental objects will be               constructed using color, shape, size, and orientation.  This will               allow for testing of the hypothesis that the spatial distribution               of objects on a map affects a person's ability to suppress                      information that is not critical in reading the map.                                 Symbols on maps attempt to accurately reflect selected                     information about the environment, and they are constructed to                  present information in an aesthetically pleasing way.  Research                 on how people read maps will ultimately assist cartographers to                 construct more efficient maps and enhance the communication                     process.  Cognitive experiments are important because they can                  extend theory developed with laboratory stimuli to a level that                 is closer to real world environments.  This theory can then be                  the basis of visual processing capabilities in more intelligent                 geographical information systems.",
