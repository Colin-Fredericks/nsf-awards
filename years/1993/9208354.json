The seminar is being organized by Dr.                    Chien-Lu Ping of the University of Alaska and Dr. G.V.                          Dobrovolsky of the Institute of Soil Science and Photosynthesis of              the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The specific objectives of the                seminar are to (1) discuss and examine the cryogenic processes in               cold soils and identify the fundamental controlling processes of                permafrost and alpine soils; (2) design experiments for                         cryopedological research to aid the interpretation of global change,            paleoecology, and resource management in the arctic and subarctic               zones; (3) compare the current classification systems of cryogenic              soils in the world, especially in the United States and Russia, and             develop a common cross-reference system for soil-based technology               transfer among the circumpolar nations; and (4) identify potential              research partnerships in permafrost-dominated or cryogenic soils.               This activity fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific            knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the United States and              the former Soviet Union to combine complementary efforts and                    capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence in the           field of basic scientific research on the basis of equality,                    reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
