 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310193  Land    This project will develop, estimate, and evaluate hierarchical  linear models for several datasets on criminal victimization, thus  taking into account the implicit hierarchical structure of  victimization survey data - from individuals to neighborhoods to  cities or urban areas.  This approach will integrate and compare  the two major theoretical approaches to victimization: 1) the  routine activities/crime opportunity approach that stresses  individual-level covariates such as age, sex, and life style  characteristics, and 2) other approaches that emphasize  characteristics of aggregate units, such as neighborhoods and  cities.  The research will address critical criminological and  sociological issues that have been at issue in the assessment of  variations in victimization rates.    The research will improve scientific understanding of the factors  that put people at risk of being the victims of crime.  In so doing  it will demonstrate the power of new techniques of statistical  analysis, thus encouraging social scientists in several fields to  use them.  Knowledge of the factors that affect the risk of being  a victim of crime will be useful in reducing that risk.    ***",
