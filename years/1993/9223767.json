 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Buechler's research is in stability theory, a                    subfield of model theory.  In recent years several general                      model-theoretic problems have been systematically approached via                the stability-theoretic hierarchy.  Even though a problem itself                may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering                        separately the cases: totally transcendental, superstable, etc.,                brings into play a mass of technical machinery.  Such is the case               for Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for totally                 transcendental theories and (over the past 5 years) by Buechler                 for the superstable theories of finite rank.  Buechler intends to               continue using the methods of geometrical stability theory to                   gain insight into Vaught's conjecture for all superstable                       theories.  The geometrical methods bring modules into the                       picture, allowing for the use of representation theory and other                algebra to pin down further the models of these theories.                            This research lies in the general setting of abstract                      \"Classification Theory.\"  In many diverse branches of mathematics               researchers attempt to code each element of a class of structures               with an element of a \"simpler\" class of structures.  The original               class is then more easily analyzed, using the more detailed                     information that one can obtain for this simpler class.                         Classification Theory is the abstract study of such codings.                    Researchers have shown that it is possible to determine when such               a simplification exists by using only rather basic information                  about the original class.  Buechler intends to study when an                    abstract class can be simplified down to a very precise class of                objects called \"modules,\" which have been studied in great detail               by algebraists.",
