 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307658 Huntly          This research combines theory and experiments to define and measure  the mechanisms by which fluctuating environmental factors (e.g., temporal  variation in weather patterns, spatial variation in soil water or nitrogen content)  influence coexistence, using desert annual plants of the Chihuahuan Desert as a  test case. The PI's will focus on an integrated examination of effects of  environmental variability at several temporal scales, both within and between  years, and on simultaneous measurements of the effects of several different  mechanisms of coexistence, two being dependent on variable environmental  conditions and one being classical niche differences. The PI's  combine  development of models of germination and growth of desert annual plants with  field and laboratory experiments designed to measure responses of plants to  within- and among-year patterns of temperature and resource availability, and to  detect non-linear competitive interactions.  %%% A sound understanding of the role of environmental variability in the dynamics  and diversity of communities is needed, as is a framework for understanding the  contributions of multiple factors to species coexistence. This research will  provide a better understanding of species coexistence in variable environments  mediated by multiple interactions, and increase our understanding of the ecology  and coexistence of desert annual plants. ***",
