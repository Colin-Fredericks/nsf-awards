 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fixation of atmospheric CO2 by plants and mineralization of the                 fixed C (CO2 production) by respiring biological communities link               the soil and atmospheric C reservoirs in a dynamic equilibrium.                 Resent hydrogeological research has shown that CO2 production also              occurs in subsoil vadose zones and that its short-term and long-                term impacts on the terrestrial-atmospheric C balance can be                    substantial.  Therefore the effort to predict the consequences of               perturbations to the soil C reservoir must now be extended to                   subsoil vadose zones.  This means that controls on CO2 production               in the entire soil-vadose continuum must be identified the                      understood.                                                                     One key control on subsurface CO2 production is the availability                of organic C to support respiration.  Here we will study                        characteristics and mean residence times (MRT) of this C, and how               these parameters vary in two contrasting geologic settings beneath              temperate grasslands.  Determination of the 14C age of the CO2                  produced at various depths will identify modern, pedogenic, and                 ancient C sources, provide estimates of depth variation of MRT of               the C sources, and thereby also provide estimates of the time                   required production in the soil-vadose continuum.  We hypothesize               that it if possible to isolate and characterize a fraction of C in              soil-vadose geologic material which can be identified as                        respiration substrate by its C isotope signature.  Such                         identification would yield new insight into the types of organic                C serving as respiration substrates and their evolution with depth.             It may also provide methodological basis for construction of                    substrate MRT-vs-depth functions using a relatively simple                      isolation procedure.",
