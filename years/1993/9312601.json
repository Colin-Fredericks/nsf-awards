 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312601  Stupp    Over the past sixty years polymer science has focused on synthesis  and physical properties of materials containing the classical  linear chain macromolecules.  In this research program we depart  from the concept of one-dimensional linear polymers and explore the  transformation of polymer molecules to two-dimensional objects  using bulk chemical reactions.  The two-dimensional polymers of  interest are shaped as sheets with thicknesses in the scale of  nanometers and variable surface areas one to three orders of  magnitude greater.  The basic approach is to synthesize self  ordering molecules that can form \"reactive\" liquid crystals,  organized internally according to the thermodynamic principles of  microphase separation.  Research in the program is organized as a  concerted effort in which the essential synthetic work is closely  coupled to both computer modeling and experiments on the physical  properties of these novel materials.  %%%  The scientific importance of the program includes learning about  molecular self assembly and the physical behavior of molecular  objects having specific shape.  In a technological context, two-  dimensional macromolecules could lead to materials that generate  spontaneously a molecularly defined surface or that undergo unusual  phase transitions as their constituent molecular objects change  shape reversibly.  These materials would open opportunities so far  unknown in areas such as adhesion, sensor and membrane  technologies, as well as the use of materials for the controlled  release of chemicals to the environment or the human body.  ***",
