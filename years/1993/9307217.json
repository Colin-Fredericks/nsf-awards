This technique was extended to polysilanes with  phenyl groups to form partially triflated  poly(methylphenylsilylene).  The backbone with electrophilic sites  is used for the attachment of various functional groups as well as  to perform grafting.  In order to enhance stability of polysilanes  with side functional groups, a new technique based on the  connection of the electrophilic reactive site (alkyl triflate) via  a trimethylene spacer will be used.  This method will increase  stability of new polymers although it will limit electronic effects  due to the insulating character of the alkane chain separating  electronically active groups from the delocalized polysilane  backbone.  Additionally, ring-opening polymerization of strained  cyclotetrasilanes with functional groups will be explored.  This  method can provide control of configuration of substituents and  also affect electronic properties.  Thus, the project focuses on  preparation and characterization (NMR, GPC, viscometry, light  scattering, UV, fluorescence, DSC, TGA, X-ray, electron microscopy,  electron diffraction) of polysilanes with new functional groups as  well as corresponding block and graft copolymers.    Polysilanes are new advanced materials with interesting properties  which lead to applications in electronics, optics, and ceramics.   Additional applications are possible when materials with more  diversified structure will be available.  Nearly all known  polysilanes contain only alkyl and aryl substituents, but this  research aims to prepare new types of these materials.  ***",
