 "awd_abstract_narration": "A current problem in evolutionary biology is to                                 understand why some morphological traits of animals and                         plants are plastic and others are rigidly determined.                           A combination of genetic, developmental, and behavioral                         studies is required to solve it.  The proposed research                         will make a contribution to the solution.  A species of                         beetle has been chosen for investigation because it has                         a highly variable trait and because the type of                                 selection it is subjected to is clear.  The goals of                            the research are to assess (1) whether plasticity in                            this trait shows heritable variation and (2) the                                significance of variation in this trait.                                                                                                                        In addition to their value in throwing light on a                               complex evolutionary problem, results of this research                          will have potential benefits to the applied field of                            conservation biology.  An important factor determining                          the persistence of species under threat of extinction                           is its ability to respond ecologically and                                      evolutionarily to a changed environment.  This study of                         phenotypic variation and plasticity will show how                               flexible responses are controlled and expressed.",
