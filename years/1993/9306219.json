 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted on complex fluids, fluids                characterized by components which tend to self-assemble, and are                therefore characterized by several different lengths.  The first of             these fluids to be investigated is the ternary mixture of oil,                  water and amphiphile which produces a uniform, structured fluid in              which oil and water are solubilized but separated by sheets of                  amphiphile; a microemulsion.  Among the properties to be studied                are the behavior in a confined geometry, the low interfacial                    tension brought about between oil and water, the elastic properties             of the amphiphile sheets, and the evolution of this phase into the              sponge phase.  The second complex fluid to be studied consists of               polymers.  The ability of a block copolymer in a ternary mixture to             act as a compatibilizer of homopolymers will be examined.                       %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted on two classes of complex                fluids.  These are fluids which have a number of interacting                    components which produce interesting, and often important, physical             properties.  Examples of complex fluids include liquid crystals,                microemulsions, biopolymers and polymers.  Besides offering                     fundamental challenges in condensed matter physics, these materials             all have important practical applications.",
