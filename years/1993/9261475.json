 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional rock cutting, coring, and metal cutting methods have                serious technical, environmental, and safety limitations for                    underwater applications.  High-pressure abrasive-waterjet (AWJ)                 cutting is currently being demonstrated as a revolutionary                      technique for cutting any material at ocean depths up to 20,000                 feet.  This method is marginal in performance and operational                   reliability, however, and further improvements are not expected.                This research addresses a novel concept for cutting with high-                  velocity abrasive particle beams.  In this concept, the abrasives               are directly pumped through a nozzle, rather than entrained as in               an AWJ nozzle, to form a high-pressure abrasive slurry jet (ASJ).               QUEST demonstrated that cutting rates (under atmospheric                        conditions) can be increased fivefold compared to an AWJ using                  this new method.  In this research we will conduct a feasibility                study on using ASJs for underwater cutting.  A high-pressure                    (50,000 psi) abrasive slurry pump under development at QUEST will               be used in this investigation.  Parametric cutting tests will be                performed on rocks and metals.  Analytical studies will be used                 to support the experimental work.  A conceptual design for an                   ocean floor cutting system will be prepared.",
