 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information moves from the brain to muscle through neurons.  The                transfer of information between neuron and muscle involves the                  release of a chemical called acetylcholine from the neuron and the              diffusion of acetylcholine to the muscle.  Acetylcholine binds to               proteins called acetylcholine receptors on the surface of muscle                cells, transiently opening small ion channels in the cell membrane.             These channel openings initiate muscle contraction.  The electric               organs in invertebrates are extraordinarily rich in these                       acetylcholine receptors and, consequently, are the model system                 used to study the molecular basis of action of acetylcholine or any             other agent that acts on acetylcholine receptors.  Over the last                twelve years, using quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy, Dr.                 Johnson has developed a unique approach for the study of structural             features of intact ligand receptors.  He will continue to use this              approach to delineate the sites of binding of inhibitors of the                 acetylcholine receptor.  Specifically, he will localize the sites               of binding of two noncompetitive inhibitors of the acetylcholine                with respect to the surface and side of the cell membrane, as well              as their orientation when bound to the receptor.  This information              will significantly contribute to the development of a molecular                 understanding of the actions of chemicals on this receptor.                     Moreover, concepts and experimental approaches developed in the                 study of the acetylcholine receptor should easily be exportable to              the examination of other neurotransmitter and hormone receptors.",
