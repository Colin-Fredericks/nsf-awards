 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow the principle investigator to participate               in an internationally-sponsored oceanic baseline survey of                      dissolved trace elements in the Atlantic Ocean.  Primarily, this                investigator will focus on the geochemistry of the element gallium,             though certain other elements such as aluminum, manganese, copper,              nickel, and cadmium will be determined.  There are several                      objectives of this research.  First, the research will answer                   certain questions about the behavior of gallium in seawater.  These             questions include the cause of the high gallium/aluminum ratios                 observed in seawater (compared with continental rocks) and to                   extent of a mid-depth maximum in gallium/aluminum ratios observed               in the North Pacific.  A second objective of the research is to use             gallium as a less-reactive analogue of aluminum in the deep waters              of the Atlantic.  There has been some interesting previous research             using aluminum as a water tracer in the deep Atlantic.  By                      comparing the behavior of gallium with that of aluminum, a key                  assumption involved in the use of aluminum as a tracer                          (conservative behavior in the deep Atlantic) can be tested.  A                  final objective relates to the international focus of the research.             The cruises are sponsored by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic                Commission (sponsored by UNESCO).  The purpose is to put together               baseline information on trace element concentrations and to allow               an international group of investigators to intercalibrate their                 results.  This intercalibration is important because of unresolved              problems relating to the absolute concentrations of certain trace               elements in seawater.",
