 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many important technologies share two features: they are embodied               in durable goods and training, and they are subject to network                  externalities where each user's benefit from using the system                   increases with the number of other users adopting compatible                    systems.  Often, it is not easy to introduce new, improved                      technology while retaining full compatibility with the installed                base without compromising performance.   Frequently, at issue is                when should society switch from an established technology to an                 incompatible, but superior alternative; and how if it all, should               the transition be managed.  Examples of such transitions include                the shift from LPs to compact disks, the change from DOS to OS/2                or Unix in personal computers, the change from black and white to               color TV, and the impending transition to high definition TV.                                                                                                   The purpose of this research is to analyze the transition from                  one generation of technology to the next in markets where network               externalities make it desirable or essential for users to                       coordinate and adopt products that are compatible.  The research                focuses on the problems faced in making a centralized choice of a               new technology.  Such centralized choice may be made by                         government or a voluntary standard-setting organization, as is                  frequently the case.  For a given mew technology, the                           investigators will analyze the path of consumer adoption                        following standard-setting, the effects of granting strong or                   weak intellectual property protection, and the timing of                        standard-setting and technology introduction.  In addition, the                 principles involved in choosing among competing systems will be                 analyzed in light of uncertainty about improvements likely to be                achieved over time and the ultimate cost of rival systems.",
