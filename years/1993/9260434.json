 "awd_abstract_narration": "Head mounted display systems (HMDS) are recognized as a                     valuable tool for synthetic environment simulations.  To maintain               an image of reality, the ideal system should be stereographic and               capable of immediate real-time response to computer-or camera-                  generated imagery.  Unfortunately, stereoscopy has a number of                  inherent weaknesses.  Gross misjudgments of distance, velocity, and             shape occur if unrestrained head motion is permitted, without real-             time regeneration of a matching stereo pair.  Volume approach is a              good solution, and has a much stronger potential for producing a                good device for synthetic imaging than does stereoscopic approach.              Using recent advances in image processing techniques and in LCD                 development, Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes a novel                 volume visualization display.  POC uses a computer-stored image of              a simulated 3-D scene and then rearranges it as a set of 2-D cross              sections (slices).  The display will have a corresponding set of                \"switchable\" layers, whose state can be instantaneously changed                 from transparent to scattering.  POC's device will have full see-               through capability.  A lightweight, full color volume visualization             HMDS prototype will be demonstrated in Phase II.//",
