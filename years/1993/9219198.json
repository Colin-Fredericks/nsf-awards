 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processes of erosion, entrainment, and deposition at                       the beds of glaciers govern the supply of debris available                      for subglacial modification, and thus, play an important                        role in the evolution of subglacially sculpted topography.                      In addition, deformation of subglacial debris directly                          influences the dynamics of many glaciers and ice sheets.                        Despite the strong motivation for studying the physics of                       interactions between concentrated debris, ice, and glacier                      beds, no laboratory experiments under well controlled,                          realistic conditions have been conducted.                                            We propose a series of experiments in which conditions                     at the bed of a temperature glacier will be closely                             simulated.  In some experiments,  a rock bed slid beneath a                     fixed block of temperate ice that contains dense arrays of                      rock particles.  Our goals will be to simulate glacial                          abrasion and debris comminution, and to demonstrate the                         conditions under which basal melt-out and entrainment of                        debris occur.  Experiments to date indicate that these                          processes are strongly affected by the tendency for ice to                      penetrate and flow through debris by regelation.  To better                     understand this process regelation of ice through till will                     be idealized in other experiments by pushing ice through a                      three-dimensional array of spheres.  Results will be                            compared with predictions of an existing regelation theory,                     which we will modify by including the important effect of                       solutes on thermal gradients.  In both series of                                experiments, all pertinent glaciological variables will be                      monitored, including ice and bed temperature, basal melt                        rate, and effective pressure.  These experiments will held                      fill a conspicuous void in the study of glacial geologic                        processes.",
