 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cirrus clouds continuously cover nearly 40% of the earth's                 surface and are now known to have a significant influence on the                global radiation budget.  For example, tropical storms generate                 cirrus anvils that are blown hundreds of kilometers downwind and                limit warming of the sea surface.  This in turn may influence the               subsequent generation of tropical storms and may even play a role               in controlling the Sourthern Oscillation (i.e., the El Nino event).                                                                                                  Limited aircraft observations using crystal collectors and                 replicators suggest that cirrus are composed mostly of ice crystals             with complex shapes that range in size from about 10 um to 1 mm.                However, the collectors and replicators used in these studies are               limited to making coarse spatial observations and do not provide                good measurements of crystal concentration.  The current aircraft               optical imaging probes are not capable of making good measurements              of crystal concentrations for sizes < about 150 um.  This is an                 inherent limitation of conventional optical systems because the                 depth of field (DOF), and consequently the sample volume, decreases             with the square of the crystal radius.                                                                                                                               Here, the PI proposes a new optical instrument using a novel               digital holographic imaging system (DHIS) which increases DOF                   compared to conventional imaging systems by more than a factor of               100.  In Phase I, the PI performs numerical simulations and                     laboratory tests of a DHIS which will provide three-dimensional                 information on ice crystals in cirrus.  The airborne instrument, to             be built and tested in Phase II, could provide digitized 3-D                    holograms at rates up to 100 Hz of ice crystals with diameters from             5 um to 2.5 mm.",
