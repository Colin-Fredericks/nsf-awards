 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309316  Shukla  This project focuses on the structure of a group membership  service, a basic building block for group-oriented distributed  applications.  The objectives of this project are development  and performance characterization of a membership service with  multiple classes of service.  The emphasis is on categorical  definition of service classes to support a wide spectrum of  applications, adaptive status monitoring to minimize wrongly  perceived status changes, a completely decentralized and  hierarchical protocol requiring an overhead proportional to  the quality of the service rendered, and support of a spectrum  of membership semantics in spite of transient network  partitioning.    Techniques will be developed to support seamless distribution  of large groups across a set of heterogeneous networks by  exploiting the attributes of local communication environments  and using topology-based optimizations.  Formal techniques  will be used for specification and verification implementation  of the protocol.  A performance metric will be developed for  characterization of the performance of membership protocols.   Performance will be studied with simulations based on  stochastic modeling of applications, membership protocols, and  underlying networks.  The simulations will be built using  commercial network engineering tools.  The main contributions  expected from this research are a single multipurpose  membership protocol instead of the current application-  specific variety and quantitative performance characterization  which is currently lacking.  ***",
