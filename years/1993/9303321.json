 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stable isotopes such as carbon-13 can be used to analyze diets             of  mammals that inhabited the Amazon River basin during the late               Quaternary period, as well as local habitats and  regional                      climates.  Prior studies of fossil mammals and paleosol carbonates              indicate the Amazon has undergone major change within the last few              to several tens of thousands of years.  This assertion can be                   tested by assessing the types of plants eaten by herbivores of                  ancient ecological communities because: (a) incorporation into                  animal hard tissues (bone, dentine, enamel) of photosynthetic                   carbon is from only two sources  - -  C3 (Calvin cycle) plants or               C4 (Hatch-Slack cycle) plants, and the ratio of each type plant                 gives a clue as to the composition of the prevalent vegetation at               the time; (b) isotopic content of carbon from carbon dioxide can be             measured by mass spectroscopy using pulverized fossil or carbonate              samples.  Analysis of carbonates precipitated in ancient soils and              fossilized bone, some of which was originally hydroxyapatite \u0131Ca10-             (PO4)6-(OH)2!, highly porous and subject to diagenesis (secondary               alteration of the original chemical composition).  More than 25                 species of mammals from several Orders should be available,                     including Edentata (e.g., mylodont sloths, Megalonyx, armadillos,               glyptodonts), Proboscidea such as Haplomastodon, Perissodactyla                 (Tapirus), Artiodactyla, and Notoungulata.                                      %%%                                                                             Results should yield insight into the question of whether the                   present Amazon rainforests were formerly covered at least to some               extent by grasslands.  These findings may in turn reveal to what                extent global changes have been directional or cyclic over extended             time periods.",
