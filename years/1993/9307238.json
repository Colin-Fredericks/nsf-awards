 "awd_abstract_narration": "Renardy  9307238    This chemical research thermal project concerns the shape of the  interface separating two immiscible liquids in chemical and  thermals systems.  Two-fluid exhibit phenomena which are totally  unexpected from a knowledge of one-fluid flows and form a  subject rich in interdisciplinary science.  Industrial  applications include the formation of bicomponent fibers such as  nylons and the production of photographic films.  Theoretically,  there are often many possibilities for the shape of the boundary  separating the two fluids.  In addition, experiments show that  some shapes are preferred over others, so that the selection  mechanisms should be investigated with the goal of lessening the  gap between theoretical prediction and experimental results.   The effect of dissolved additives and temperature gradients, and  the consideration of heat and mass transfer at an interface are  important in many chemical processes.  Physical modeling,  analytical and computational techniques will be used by the  proposer to study the stability of various interface shapes, and  the appearance of new arrangements from unstable ones.  The  mechanical properties of composite materials are strongly  dependent on interface shapes.  Thus, an understanding of the  effects of the component properties on interface shape is of  practical importance.  ***",
