 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductor characterization experiments are being introduced                 into the undergraduate physics curriculum at Macalester                         College.  These experiments are part of an innovative upper                     division laboratory class for physics majors in thin film and                   semiconductor physics.  They also provide opportunities for                     student independent study and faculty-student collaborative                     research.  The experiments being implemented as part of this                    activity are four-point probe measurements, Hall effect,                        transient photoconductivity, and pn junction current-voltage                    and capacitance measurements.  These experiments complement                     existing experiments in vacuum deposition science and                           technology, two-point conductivity measurements, optical                        absorption spectroscopy, steady-state photoconductivity, and                    solar cell spectral response. Together these experiments                        provide a comprehensive laboratory experience in experimental                   physics, through the vehicle of stimulating and topical                         experiments in materials physics.",
