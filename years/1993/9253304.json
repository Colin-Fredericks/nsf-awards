 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maui Economic Development Board, in collaboration with the                  school district administration of Maui, Hawaii, has designed                    a four-year project to revamp the teaching of science in the                    district's 17 elementary schools.  A total of 320 teachers                      will each receive 13 days of professional development, during                   which they would become familiar with four hands-on inquiry                     based instructional kits for their grade level, as well as                      relevant teaching strategies and background content knowledge.                  A science materials resource center will be established by a                    local company, and then spun off as a small independent                         business.  The Maui Chamber of Commerce, the Maui Economic                      Development Board, Cal Tech, and local industry have committed                  financial support to the project, as well as commitment of                      effort by local scientists.  The instructional material and                     teacher training model would be a replicate of the successful                   NSF-funded Project SEED (Science for Early Educational                          Development), a collaborative reform effort by the California                   Institute of Technology and the Pasadena Unified School                         District.                                                                                                                                                       The proposed dissemination of Project SEED from Pasadena to                     Maui will take a successful NSF-funded project and implement                    it in a community with genuine need.  The proposed effort will                  replace the district's current elementary science curriculum                    with an exemplary inquiry-driven hands on approach.  This                       project represents a model partnership between the school                       district and the local business community, and builds on a                      locally funded pilot project in one school.                                                                                                                     Cost sharing on this project represents 334% of the NSF                         contribution.",
