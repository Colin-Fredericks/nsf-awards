 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306375  Straub  John Straub is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and  Computational Chemistry Program to develop new algorithms for  performing many-body classical dynamics and global energy  optimization.  He has recast the classical molecular dynamics  problem into a Liouville operator which operates on a time  dependent phase space distribution represented by a Hartree  product of Gaussian wave packets.  The result is a set of  simple first order equations of motion for the approximate  time-dependence of the distribution at contant temperature or  energy.  This methodology will be applied to studies of the  dynamics of atoms or molecules on surfaces, the simulation of  molecular fluids and biomolecules, and enhanced free energy  perturbation calculations.  In a second but related area of  study, Straub will develop a method for finding the global  energy minimum on a potential energy surface through an  approximate solution to the Schrodinger equation in imaginary  time.  %%%  Computer simulations have provided a number of molecular level  insights into chemical processes which occur in solution and on  surfaces.  The technique is very powerful, but is limited by  statistical sampling problems associated with the speed of  current supercomputers and the time available to perform such  simulations.  Straub is developing a new algorithm for  performing molecular simulations which should be a major  improvement in statistical sampling.  If successful, this new  algorithm could provide a significant decrease in the amount of  computational resources required to obtain meaningful sampling  statistics in molecular simulations.  ***",
