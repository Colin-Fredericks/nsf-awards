 "awd_abstract_narration": "MIT is conducting a second two-week summer workshop for 40                      college and university physics teachers to exchange ideas and                   designs for advanced pedagogical experiments in modern physics                  and to study the experiments currently in use in the MIT Junior                 Physics Laboratory for the purpose of evaluating them for                       possible reproduction and use in similar courses at their home                  institutions. The MIT Junior Lab experiments are designed for                   students who have completed an introductory course in modern                    physics and are taking concurrently an introductory course in                   quantum mechanics. The experiments provide hands-on experience                  with the phenomena of particle, nuclear, atomic, condensed                      matter, statistical, and astrophysics. This second summer                       workshop, like the first one held in 1992, will assist the                      national effort to improve the quality of undergraduate physics                 education.",
