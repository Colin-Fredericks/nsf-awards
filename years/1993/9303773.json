 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theme of this mathematical research is the investigation               of mechanical systems described by systems with memory effects.                 The memory comes in either by a viscoelastic constitutive                       equation of the equation of the material, yielding a Volterra                   type partial differential-integral equation, or by coupling to                  another system which is solved explicitly, so that its                          contribution to the model comes in as a set of boundary                         conditions containing convolution integrals.  The main objective                is the approximation of the convolution kernels in a way such                   that the Volterra type conditions are replaced by a higher                      order differential equation, subject to the constraint that                     the approximating systems are again dissipative, to                             ensure convergence.  In the frequency domain this means a                       rational approximation of the Laplace transform of the kernel.                       In addition to providing numerical tools for                               handling equations modeling phenomena with memory effects, this                 work advances the theory of integrodifferential equations in                    two directions in which the established theory is still weak.                   The first is the analysis of operator valued kernels and the                    second is the study of phenomena where the memory enters the                    boundary conditions.",
