 "awd_abstract_narration": "We plan to identify optimal and efficient statistical                      designs in several commonly used scientific studies. These areas                include, but not limite to, two-level factorial designs for main                effects and selected two-factor interactions; resolution III                    and more two-level fractional factorial designs with (weak)                     minimum aberration; repeated measurements designs for comparative               bioavaliability studies.                                                             Inference based on data collected via poorly designed                      studies is generally misleading and could be invalid altogether.                Good science calls for good data and good data can come only                    through statistically designed studies. This proposal plans to                  identify and build statistically efficient designs/per unit cost                so that better data can be collected and valid scientific                       inference can be made. Our discoveries will have immediate                      applications to many areas of scientific  studies including                     medicine and engineering. We plan to solve design problems which                have been posed to us by scientists at US FDA, and many US                      industries.",
