 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference for which funds are requested is sponsored by the                American Society for Microbiology and is titled \"Multicellular and              Interactive Behavior of Bacteria\". The traditional paradigm of                  bacteria is that they are essentially single-celled organisms that              do not interact with each other in any systematic way. Gradually,               however, it is coming to be realized that bacteria, like most other             living cells interact with each other as well as with other types               of cells, both animal and plant. These interactions are manifested              by their ability to mate with each other and to exchange signals                prior to doing so, to collaborate in their metabolic processes, to              form biofilms on a variety of surfaces, to undergo complex                      developmental processes, to engage in cooperative movements and to              coordinate their pathogenic activities with each other. It has                  become clear that these cell-cell interactions often allow bacteria             to carry out biotransformations that are not possible otherwise.                The conference will bring together investigators working on these               various aspects of bacterial multicellularity and offer the                     opportunity for the exchange of ideas and information. It is the                hope of the organizers of the conference that it will facilitate                the introduction of this new paradigm into the field of prokaryotic             biology.",
