 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long  time-series  studies  have extensively  altered  our  basic               understanding of biological processes in the deep ocean.  We have               established a long time-series station at an abyssal site in  the               eastern N. Pacific (4100 m depth) and, over the past three years,               have  been  measuring particulate matter flux while  concurrently               monitoring the sea floor with time-lapse photography.   We   have               found  a  strong  temporal  relationship  between  the  flux   of               particulate  matter entering the benthic boundary layer  and  the               arrival  and residence of detrital aggregates on the  sea  floor.               The  residence  of  these detrital aggregates spans  a  six-month               period  and  coincides with increased abundance and movements  of               the  epibenthic megafauna.  Our results to date suggest  coupling               exists   between  near-bottom  pelagic  and  benthic   processes.               However, the most important questions still remain regarding  how               and  on  what  time scales the pelagic and benthic processes  are               coupled  in  the  deep  sea, especially in  the  context  of  the               interannual  variability we have observed  over  the  past  three               years.   We  propose  to study the coupling between  the  pelagic               supply  of  organic  matter and its utilization  by  the  benthic               community  using  in  situ measurements  of  detrital  aggregates               superimposed on a continuing time-series study of monitoring  the               benthic  boundary  layer.  Specifically, we  propose  to  address               three  questions.   1) What is the source of detrital  aggregates               observed  seasonally  on  the sea floor?  2)  How  important  are               detrital  aggregates as sites of sediment community activity?  3)               How  important  are  detrital aggregates as sited  of  epibenthic               megafaunal  activity?  This study will improve our  understanding               of the coupling between pelagic and benthic processes and broaden               current  perceptions of biogeochemical cycling  over  interannual               time scales in the deep ocean.",
