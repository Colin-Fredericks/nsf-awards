 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303359  Martin       The long term objective of this research is to elucidate the  function of plant disease resistance (DR) genes.  The interaction  of tomato and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv.  tomato (Pst) provides an ideal system for understanding gene-for-  gene complementarity.  Resistance to Pst in tomato is conferred by  a single, mapped locus, Pto and an avr gene corresponding to Pto  has been isolated (avrPto).  A multi-step positional cloning  strategy has recently been used to identify a yeast artificial  chromosome (YAC) clone that contains the Pto locus.  We now propose  to molecularly isolate the Pto locus from this YAC clone and  characterize its role in resistance.  We will isolate the Pto  bacterial resistance locus; determine the DNA sequence of Pto and  examine its structural features; investigate potential alternate  alleles of Pto that exist in susceptible plants; characterize the  spatial and temporal expression patterns of the Pto gene; examine  the expression patterns of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and  other defense-related using Pto isogenic lines, and determine the  spatial and temporal accumulation patterns of the Pto protein.  %%%  Knowledge of the DNA sequence of the Pto gene and the localization  of its gene product in the plant cell will address fundamental  questions in cell-cell interactions.  In addition, since the Pto  gene will likely be one of the first plant resistance genes  isolated, its characterization may facilitate the isolation of  disease resistance genes from other plant species.  ***",
