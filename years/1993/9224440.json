 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern business cycle theory starts with the view that growth and               fluctuations are not distinct phenomena to be studied using                     separate models.  The first part of this project focuses on                     significant differences found in production data between the                    properties of output variation at the individual plant level and                output variation at the aggregate level.  This project constructs               a general equilibrium model economy that is consistent with the                 features of long run growth observed in aggregate time series,                  but in which production takes place at individual plants that                   operate in a manner consistent with the micro evidence.  An                     aggregate technology is derived that differs from the Cobb-                     Douglas production function assumed in standard models in which                 there are no distinctions between output fluctuations at the                    level of the plant, the firm or the aggregate.  The project                     studies the properties of the aggregate fluctuations exhibited by               the model and compares them with the cyclical properties of a                   standard real business cycle model.                                                                                                                             This research promises both methodological and substantive                      contributions to our understanding of economic growth.                          Methodologically it improves the microeconomic foundations of the               basic model of economic growth.  Substantively, it improves our                 understanding of the way different micro-level technologies                     influence the variability and the level of economic growth.  This               basic research eventually could prove significant for the                       scientific credibility and the accuracy of studies of the long-                 term consequences for economic growth of technologies for                       mitigating global environmental change.                                                                                                                         The second part of the project explores the welfare consequences                of economic policy reforms in dynamic general equilibrium models.               A \"base policy\" is derived by calibrating the model to features                 of actual policies.  For the U.S., this means heavy reliance on                 capital and income taxation.  The next step is to evaluate policy               changes from this base regime.  Examples include a shift from                   capital income taxation to labor or consumption taxation, a shift               to heavier reliance on inflation taxation, and how the government               responds in periods of high government consumption (such as wars)               or periods of bad technology shocks such as an unexpected                       increase in energy costs.  This research will sharpen our                       understanding of the welfare gains associated with policy reforms               that involve moving from existing policies to optimal or                        plausible sub-optimal policies.",
