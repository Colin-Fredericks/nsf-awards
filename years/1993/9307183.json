The primary focus of this project is to improve the technological and operational aspects of CICNet and extend and expand the value of CICNet and of the many resources to which it provides access.  Current support for CICNET provides benefits for a set of academic institutions throughout seven states with a combined student population of over 715,000, a combined faculty combination of 52,000, and combined additional researchers and staff of approximately 150,000.  The initial award to the University of Illinois for the start of CICNet has provided two years of operation during which time CICNet has provided high ba ndwidth connectivity (1.544 million bits per second) for the midlevel region from Ohio to Minnesota to the NSFNET Nationwide Backbone Network.  Continued support for the region's network infrastructure is essential to both the ongoing commitment to the region's research and education needs and central to the success of efforts to expand services and rural access.  The region's bandwidth requirements will continue to grow as the region constitutes 20% of the Ph.D.'s in the nation's supply of science and engineering researchers.",
