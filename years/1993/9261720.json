 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millions of tons of mine tailings and dump wastes occur                         throughout the United States that contain residual metals of both               commercial and environmental interest.  Many of these materials                 contain economic concentrations of copper, silver, and other                    metals.  Other heavy metals such as lead, zinc, and cadmium are                 found in these materials that may leach into surface and ground                 water supplies.  Many of these tailings and dumps have been on                  site for many years and have been weathered or oxidized.                        Therefore, classical biooxidative leaching is not appropriate for               these materials.  MBX Systems Inc. has shown that bioreductive                  bacteria can solubilize metals from oxide minerals.  MBX Systems                Inc. proposes to use these nonacid-generating bacteria to                       biologically reprocess these waste materials recovering                         marketable metals to support the operations and removing other                  metals that are toxic to the environment.",
