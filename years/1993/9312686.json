 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312686  Katz       The modeling and analysis of the climate system is a complex  problem that challenges the statistical, mathematical, and  geophysical sciences.  Increased collaboration among these  sciences would result in more efficient analyses and more  accurate interpretation of data from the climate system and its  models, and in a more reliable assessment of accompanying  uncertainties.  It is proposed that a team of statistical  scientist be assembled at the National Center for Atmospheric  Research (NCAR) to help foster such a collaboration. NCAR,  basefunded by the National Sciences Foundation, is a focal point  for basic research on the atmosphere and has strong links to  universities throughout North America.  With the addition of more  statistical and mathematical expertise, it could serve as well as  a focal point for promoting collaboration among geophysical,  statistical, and other mathematical sciences.       The general objective is to develop and utilize new  techniques of data analysis that arise from the collective  understanding of physical scientists, mathematicians, and  statisticians.  The climate system has a very large number of  degrees of freedom and exhibits some chaotic behavior.   Consequently, the specific focus of the collaborative research  would be on the development of inferential methods appropriate  for high-resolution analysis of the climate system.  Such  analyses are appropriate both because realistic models of the  climate system require the treatment of smaller scale phenomena,  and because assessments of societal impact of climate require  information on regional or smaller scales.  Besides the immediate  benefits to the scientific fields directly involved, improved  understanding of the climate system would result in potential  benefits to society that would be accrued indefinitely into the  future.  For instance, it could lead to improved weather and  climate forecasts over a wide range of time scales from hours to  seasons in advance, as well as  to more realistic scenarios of  future changes in climate.  Such improvements would be of  substantial value to decision makers and policy analysts.",
