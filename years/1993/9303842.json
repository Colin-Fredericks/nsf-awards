The energy  required for light emission is supplied by the oxidation of a  luciferin catalyzed by a specific luciferase, or through a reaction  involving a photoprotein.  The light-emitting reactions of  different types of organisms are often significantly different,  thus there are a number of different luminescence systems.  The  ultimate goal of this project is the complete biochemical  understanding of bioluminescence and its roles.  To achieve this  goal, it is essential to identify the necessary key components and  determine their chemical structures in various different types of  bioluminescence system and also to elucidate the mechanism of the  light-emitting reactions.  The knowledge on bioluminescence  presently available includes the chemical structures of 8 different  luciferins and significant information on 19 different  bioluminescence systems, of which the P.I. contributed to 5 of the  luciferins and 12 of the bioluminescence systems, including the  system of the photoprotein aequorin.  Studies will be carried out  on bioluminescence in fungi and euphausiid shrimp (krill).  The  mechanism of oxygenation in bioluminescence reactions will also be  studied.  %%%  The long-range objective of this research is the complete  biochemical understanding of bioluminescence, which encompasses the  fundamental reaction mechanism of light emission and the roles of  bioluminescence reactions in living organisms.  In this research,  it is of primary importance to determine the chemical nature of the  key substances and to elucidate the mechanism of the reactions  involved, in various different bioluminescence systems that occur  in diverse types of organisms.  ***",
