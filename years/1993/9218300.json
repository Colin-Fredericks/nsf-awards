 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Institute of Mechanics and Materials (IMM) is being                          established at the University of California at San Diego to                     integrate research and industrial applications in mechanics and                 materials.  The Institute will foster interdisciplinary                         communication and liaison between academia, industry and                        governmental organizations.  The principal activities will                      include short courses on frontier, interdisciplinary areas;                     workshops on specific industrial problems and innovative                        materials; and short and intermediate length visits of graduate                 students, post-doctoral fellows, faculty members, and scientists                and engineers form government laboratories and industrial                       organizations.  The Institute will not conduct extensive research               projects, per se, but will aim to serve as an intellectual forum                to catalyze the formation of research groups when new areas or                  methods of approach are identified.  This will include novel                    techniques for materials development, synthesis and processing;                 characterization and identification of properties-microstructure                relations; physically-based micromechanical and computational                   modeling; and constitutive relations for nonlinear response and                 failure analysis; as well as design and performance analysis of                 complete structural entities.  Timely topics will be discussed in               think-tank-style workshops which will also be used for periodic                 assessments of long-term goals in mechanics and materials science               and engineering.  An external Board of Governors of prominent                   senior scientists and engineers will direct the Institute                       activities through action subcommittees and regularly assess the                Institute's progress.  The educational efforts of the Institute                 will include all levels of engineers and scientists in academia,                industry and government (both national and international); and a                strong outreach program to high school students and their                       teachers on a nationwide basis wherever there is interest, with a               deliberate effort to reach minorities and under-represented                     segments of the population, as well as the gifted.",
