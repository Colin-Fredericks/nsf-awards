 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miniemulsion polymerization is used to describe heterogeneous                   polymerization in those systems in which monomer droplets are                   substantially smaller than found in a typical conventional                      emulsion polymerization.  These polymerizations exhibit some                    characteristics of suspension and emulsion polymerization                       systems.  In each type of polymerization, monomer droplets are                  dispersed in a continuous aqueous phase in which the monomer                    is insoluble or only slightly soluble.  Surfactants and other                   colloidal stabilizers are used to stabilize the droplets and                    prevent particle agglomeration.  While both suspension and                      emulsion polymerizations are free radical reactions, each                       proceeds by a unique mechanism.  Initiators for free radical                    suspension reactions are oil-soluble.  The monomer droplets                     are approximately 1 mm in diameter and each behaves as a small                  batch reactor, with the monomer reacting to produce polymer.                    Since the number of free radicals per particle is quite high,                   the kinetics are those of a bulk free radical polymerization.                                                                                                   In conventional emulsion polymerization moderate shear in the                   presence of surfactant leads to the formation of a stable                       emulsion containing 10 micron monomer droplets and surfactant                   micelles about 0.01 micron in diameter.  These micelles are                     formed from excess surfactant in the continuous phase and                       contains a small amount of monomer.  Because of their relative                  size and number, the total surface area of micelles is much                     greater than the total surface area of the droplets.  Thus                      free radicals in the aqueous phase enter micelles much more                     frequently than droplets, resulting in particle nucleation                      primarily from micelles.  The primary locus of polymerization                   is the polymer particles thus formed.  The particles                            eventually grow to a size of about 0.10 micron forming a final                  product, referred to as a latex which is a stable dispersion                    of polymer particles in the continuous aqueous phase.  In                       miniemulsion polymerization, high shear is used in combination                  with surfactants and cosurfactants to produce a fine emulsion                   of monomer droplets.  The monomer droplets are substantially                    smaller than those found in a typical emulsion polymerization.                  Reduction of the monomer droplet diameter causes a                              corresponding increase in the total droplet surface area.                       This has the effect of making the monomer droplets competitive                  with the micelles for radical capture since radical absorption                  is competitive on the basis of relative surface area.                                                                                                           The objective of this research is to investigate applications                   of miniemulsions to: (i) produce current latex products with a                  higher level of efficiency and uniformity, and (ii) develop                     new latex products based on miniemulsion technology.  Specific                  areas which will be investigated are: (1) the use of polymer                    as a cosurfactant; (2) the use of droplet nucleation to effect                  more robust particle nucleation in systems in which micellar                    nucleation tends to be unstable with respect to impurities;                     (3) the use of the miniemulsion process to produce polymers of                  narrow copolymer composition distribution from monomers which                   are highly water-insoluble; (4) the use of simultaneous                         micellar and droplet nucleation to produce lattices with                        unique particle size distributions; and (5) the impact of                       \"accidental\" cosurfactants such as dodecyl mercaptan on                         conventional emulsion polymerization processes.",
