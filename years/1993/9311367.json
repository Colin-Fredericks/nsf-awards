 "awd_abstract_narration": "Self-organizing data structures, which dynamically maintain                a file of records in easily retrievable order while using up                    little memory space, have been investigated by probabilists and                 computer scientists for more than 25 years.  Such self-organizing               systems have been applied to problems in very large-scale                       integration (VLSI) circuit simulation, data compression, and                    communications networks.  The goal of the proposed research                     project is to apply techniques for analyzing Markov chains, some                only recently developed, to the study of self-organizing lists                  and other data structures. The work will focus on furthering the                analysis of certain modifications of the standard schemes for                   list rearrangement.  Some of these modifications, such as the                   Markovian access model for \"locality of reference,\" are designed                to model more closely the behavior of the rules on data                         encountered in applications.  In other cases, such as stochastic                algorithms, the rule itself is modified in an effort to improve                 performance.                                                                         A structure for maintaining a file of records is called                    self-organizing if the rule for replacing a retrieved item                      depends only on the location from which the item was retrieved.                 The idea is that the file will organize itself, with frequently                 retrieved items tending to gravitate toward the front of the                    file.  Self-organizing structures are commonly used for storing                 data in a computer.  Probabilists and computer scientists have                  investigated certain performance characteristics of self-                       organizing data structures for many years.  This research will                  continue such investigations.",
