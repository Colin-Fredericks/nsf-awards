 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate several different, yet mutually                    connected problems in number theory.  One part will focus on the                asymptotic behavior of integral solutions to inhomogeneous Pell                 inequalities.  Another part of this proposal deals with the study               of the global version to the part just described, namely, counting              the number of lattice points in tilted rectangles.                                   This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
