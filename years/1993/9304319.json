 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Spangler proposes to study the molecular basis for recognition              of receptor ligands by bacterial toxins, characterizing the amino               acid residues and structural conformation of the toxin's receptor-              binding site and modeling the receptor-toxin interaction with                   conformationally restrained peptides.  This goal will be                        accomplished in part by a combination of computer-assisted                      molecular modeling and experimental binding studies of specific                 peptide fragments recently shown to inhibit pertussis toxin binding             to receptor analogs.  To initiate this study and facilitate the                 molecular dynamics portion of the project, three-dimensional                    structural information for these peptides will be required, coupled             with an experimental determination of the binding characteristics               of the peptides.  The proposed preliminary study will consist of:                    (a) peptide structure prediction by computational methods                       (b) peptide structure solution by NMR methods                                   (c) computer modeling of peptide interaction with receptor                          analogs                                                                     (d) experimental verification of the ability of the peptides                        to bind receptor analogs and to block the binding of the                        intact toxin                                                           %%%                                                                             The long range goal is to explore protein-ligand interactions and               provide a rational basis for understanding and manipulating                     molecular                                                                       recognition in both binding functions and protein folding.  The                 techniques and information developed are of value in prediction of              receptor structures to aid design of drugs, herbicides or                       pesticides; antigens in vaccine design; or novel molecules, such as             catalytic antibodies and new molecular electronic devices based on              proteins, that can be developed by protein engineering to provide               a template for catalysis or electron transfer.",
