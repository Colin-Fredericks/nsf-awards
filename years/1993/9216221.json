 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Chi Ho Mak is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                     and Computational Chemistry Program to study electron                           transfer reactions occurring in various chemical and                            biological systems.  Fully quantum mechanical theories will                     be used to study nuclear tunneling as manifested in the                         isotope effect in aqueous electron transfer reactions in the                    inverted region and highly nonadiabatic reactions in the                        normal region.  The mechanism of coherence-mediated                             transfers involving a possibly highly delocalized electron                      will be investigated by direct simulations to understand the                    spectroscopic properties of Creutz-Taube compounds.                             Finally, questions concerning the possible role of coherence                    and the effects of an intermediate state in the                                 photosynthetic reaction center will be addressed by fully                       dynamical quantum Monte Carlo methods.                                          %%%                                                                             Electron transfer reactions are ubiquitous in many chemical                     and biological processes.  Underlying all oxidation                             reduction reactions is a process in which an electron is                        rapidly transferred from one chemical species to another.                       One very important electron transfer system occurs in the                       photosynthetic reaction center of plants and some bacteria.                     Since the electron is a very light particle these transfer                      processes must be treated using quantum theory to account                       for the nonclassical tunneling which takes place.  Mak's                        research will help to elucidate the quantum mechanical                          nature of this tunneling electron transfer process.",
