 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311269  Orin  The Department of Electrical Engineering at  The Ohio State University will purchase a  High Performance Graphics Platform which will  be dedicated to support research in  engineering.  The equipment will be used for  several research projects; each project  addresses a critical problem associated with  unmanned underwater robotic systems.   Interest in underwater robotics is growing  because of its potential  for use in a range  of applications, including ecological  studies, salvage operations, geophysical  exploration, rescue and recovery operations,  and maintenance and repair of man-made  underwater structures.    In particular the supported projects focus on  issues related to the simulation, control and  monitoring of underwater robotics in  hazardous and unstructured environments.  The  primary projects are: 1) real-time dynamic  simulation of an unmanned underwater vehicle  and manipulator system and its associated  controller, 2) real-time dynamic simulation  of an underwater walking vehicle, 3) dynamic  simulation and neural control of enveloping  power grasps, and 4) real-time display of  video data compressed using a technique which  employs artificial neural networks.",
