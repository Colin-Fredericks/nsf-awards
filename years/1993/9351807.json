 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project goal is to develop students' life-long team problem                 solving and communication skills through active learning                        experiences that simulate industrial situations. These                          experiences create team design activities that integrate                        problem solving, project planning, and oral and written                         communications.The project objectives require curriculum reform                 that revises two upper level courses and creates a new senior                   project design course. Both the instructional technique and the                 content of the two upper level courses  change to prepare the                   student for the new senior project design experience.The                        instructional method focuses on supplementing traditional                       lectures with instructor-guided collaborative learning using                    computer control technology. Course content in a revised                        microcontroller course introduces modern technology such as C                   programming, logic analyzer use, and embedded design. An                        industrial electronics course now covers programmable logic                     controllers, data acquisition, and test instrument interfacing.                 These changes in course content require the purchase of control                 computers, data acquisition and logic analyzer boards, test                     instruments, and software.The senior capstone design course                     reinforces the skills that are developed in the team approaches                 in the two revised courses. Senior students will use the new                    equipment in team design projects that simulate graduates first                 assignments in industry.Throughout the three courses students                   use computer related projects as a vehicle to learn team                        communication and problem solving techniques. Group                             communications skills include written and oral exams,                           communication of team findings, generation of student                           portfolios, and final presentations.",
