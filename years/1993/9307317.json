 "awd_abstract_narration": "The size of the hippocampus, a brain structure known to mediate                 spatial learning, is correlated with spatial behavior in wild                   rodents.  In this career advancement award, a comparison will be                made of the spatial learning ability of different species on                    abstract learning tasks.  Using operant methods, pairs of species,              known to differ in hippocampal size, will be compared on two                    operant tasks known to involve the hippocampus (spatial delayed-                nonmatch-to-sample, simultaneous odor discrimination) and two tasks             that do not require an intact hippocampus (auditory discrimination,             successive olfactory discrimination).  Two species of kangaroo rats             (Dipodomys) and two species of voles (Microtus) will be compared.               It is predicted that, within each genus, the species with a larger              hippocampus will show superior learning ability on hippocampal                  tasks, particularly the spatial task, but that there should be no               species differences on nonhippocampal tasks.                                                                                                                    The proposed study will be significant for several reasons.  It                 will be the first comparative study of different types of memory in             wild rodents.  Because our understanding of the physiology of                   memory in mammals is largely based on the laboratory rat, it is                 important to know if laboratory rats show typical rodent behavior.              More importantly, comparative studies of closely related rodent                 species can identify what features of a species's habitat can lead              to increases in learning and memory capacity.  Not only can this                study help us to understand the evolution of animal memory, but it              can also help us to understand the hippocampus, a structure                     critical in both animal and human memory.  For example, no other                animal study has attempted to compare performance of different                  tasks involving the hippocampus (maze learning, odor                            discrimination).  Thus, this study will shed light not only on the              evolution of memory, but on the function of the hippocampus, a                  structure of clinical importance.",
