 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research effort attempts to develop a                              technique to model and study the effects of                                     uncertain environmental factors in the electric                                 utility planning process.  The electric utility deals                           with uncertainties with respect to the availability                             and costs of alternative generation, fuels, and new                             emission reduction technologies.  There are also                                uncertainties in demand an energy projections, and                              the impact of demand side management programs.                                  Emissions caps and emissions trading features                                   provide for by the Clean Air Act Amendments                                     (CAAA) of 1990 have added a new dimension to                                    the problem of uncertainty.  There are wide                                     variations in estimates on the market price of                                  emission allowances.  At the same time experts                                  disagree on the extent to which government                                      legislation and regulations should and will be used                             to limit emissions.  In the light of those                                      uncertainties, the utility planner must explore a                               variety of probable scenarios in order to settle on a                           robust generation plan.  The evaluation tools which                             are currently being applied assume the availability                             of the measures of uncertainty and of experts                                   furnishing them.  This is obviously not always the                              case.  The proposed technique is designed to                                    facilitate the strategic power system planning under                            uncertainty by generating probability estimates for                             expert opinions using the interdependent data                                   analysis (IDA) technique being developed at                                     Virginia Tech.  This enables the decision maker to                              model opinions which are still forming.  Applied                                with decision tree/influence diagram analysis, this                             can result in a robust methodology to quantify                                  uncertainties related to environmental factors in the                           utility planning process.",
