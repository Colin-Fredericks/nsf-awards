 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Kevin Lehmann of Princeton                           University will develop two spectroscopic tools to aid in                       studying intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR)                 in small polyatomic molecules.  The first technique is an                       optical-optical double resonance method which allows very                       highly vibrationally excited levels of the ground state to be                   populated in order to study the effect of the large                             anharmonicity on the vibrational motion.  The other technique                   is a time-resolved, infrared-pump/Raman probe method for                        exploring the final IVR distributions after vibrational                         excitation of hydrogen atom stretches.  Finally, Lehmann will                   develop theoretical tools to interpret the newly acquired                       spectra.                                                                        %%%                                                                             An understanding of the effects of large amounts of vibrational                 excitation in a molecule directly impacts our understanding of                  the fundamental processes by which many types of reactions                      occur.  In this research Lehmann will study the effects of                      vibrational energy on the motions of bonds in a molecule as                     well as the elucidation of the pathways by which this excess                    energy is dissipated.  This information has impact on the basic                 understanding of many reactive processes, from atmospheric                      chemistry to combustion to synthesis using plasmas.",
