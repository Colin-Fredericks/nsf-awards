To preserve their society, they twice enacted new                               demographic regimes which were accompanied by a change in                       ethnic group membership.  This project hypothesizes that the                    first regime, developed in the 18th century, was                                necessitated by the low fertility and high mortality of the                     frontier situation, and emphasized the acceptance of in-                        migrants from societies being fragmented and dispersed by                       the expansion of the colonial frontier,  The second regime                      was enacted in Indian Territory where the possibilities for                     in-migration were limited, and this regime emphasized the                       attainment of a fertility level sufficient to balance                           mortality.  These hypotheses will be tested by reference to                     nineteen censuses and enumerations of the Creeks taken from                     1812 to 1910.  Historical and ethnographic information will                     be used to put the enumerations into context, and to                            determine how cultural institutions were organized and                          reorganized to support the demographic regimes.",
