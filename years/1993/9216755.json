 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.s.-France cooperative research                 in mathematical physics between Daniel Boyanovsky, University                   of Pittsburgh, and Hector J. de Vega, Theoretical Physics                       Laboratory, University of Paris VI.  The main objective of the                  proposal is to investigate current topics in quantum field theory               and statistical mechanics, in particular the early stages of phase              transitions, tunneling and metastability in field theory,                       relationship between quantum integrability and renormalization.                 These topics have applications to a broad range of problems in                  cosmology (early stages of evolution of the early universe),                    particle physics, condensed matter physics (superconductivity) and              statistical mechanics.                                                                                                                                          The investigators bring to this collaboration their complementary               expertise on these diverse topics.  Dr. Boyanovsky has been                     working on problems in mathematical physics from the point of                   view of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and               field theory.  The French investigator is well-known for his                    expertise in non-perturbative field theory methods and techniques               for studying physics at finite temperature.",
