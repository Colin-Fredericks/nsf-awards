 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thom Dunning is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                   and Computational Chemistry Program to organize a workshop on                   High Performance Computing in Chemistry: Opportunities and                      Challenges.  The workshop will be held from March 8 through                     March 10, 1993 at the National Institutes of Health Campus in                   Bethesda, MD.  The workshop will focus on three primary issues:                 1) survey of current work in chemistry on parallel computers                    with a special emphasis on massively parallel computers; 2)                     details of chemical problems which are likely to benefit                        substantially from the use of massively parallel computers; and                 3) impediments, both programming and otherwise, which might                     prevent the migration of existing codes to, and the development                 of new codes for, massively parallel computers.                                 %%%                                                                             In order for chemists to make the best use of the opportunities                 afforded by the emerging massively parallel computer                            architectures, they will have to overcome a number of obstacles                 which are primarily associated with crude operating systems and                 specialized algorithm development.  It is important during this                 early stage of development that chemists working in the area                    share their experiences with each other and with computer                       scientists in an effort to surmount these obstacles.  The                       workshop which is supported by this grant will help to                          disseminate this sort of information to a large community of                    computational chemists, and help to circumvent several of the                   difficulties which chemists may have in migrating their                         computational codes to massively parallel computers.",
