 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306217  Luke       Amur honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii, is a shrub native to northeastern Asia but  has become an invasive weed in many midwestern states.  It initially colonizes a wide  range of disturbed habitats.  In northern Kentucky, forests presently exist in which the  understory is a dense thicket of Amur honeysuckle with few other plants present.   Succeeding generations can also become established and grow in the shade of parent  plants.  It is not known whether this ability to become established in deep shade is the  result of natural selection for shade tolerance, or of high phenotypic plasticity (non-  genetic acclimation).  This research will assess how succeeding generations of Amur  honeysuckle growing in the shade of parent plants in forest understories differ from  their parents in shade tolerance and plasticity.  %%%  This work will have implications not only for understanding the basic biology of this  introduced species, but for better understanding of the mechanisms by which invasive  weeds are able to dominate natural and agricultural areas.***",
