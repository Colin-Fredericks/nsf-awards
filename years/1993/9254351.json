Instructional packets and laboratory experiments will be                        prepared for use by college and university faculty who have                     little or no prior experience in the polymer area.  The project                 utilizes and extends the organization and infrastructure                        developed in a related earlier grant.  The three regional sites                 established in the earlier grant (Rennselear Polytechnic                        Institute, the University of Southern Mississippi, and the                      University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point) again will host the NSF-                 POLYED Scholars who are developing polymer curricular materials                 during summer residencies at these sites.  In addition,                         instructional videotapes will be prepared at the University of                  Wisconsin-Stevens Point.  Regional workshops will be offered at                 the three regional sites to begin dissemination of the                          curricular materials developed. The effort also will move                       beyond general chemistry to include the preparation of polymer                  curricular materials for the organic sequence.  The materials                   will be field tested and then disseminated widely through the                   proposed workshops, through publications, and from the POLYED                   National Information Center for Polymer Education.",
