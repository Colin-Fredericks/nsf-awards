The  workshop, organized by Professors Joachim Singelmann  and  Charles  Tolbert of Louisiana State University,  and  Professors  Humberto Munoz of  the  Universidad  Autonoma Nacional de Mexico (UNAM) and Orlandina  de  Oliveira  of  the El Colegio de Mexico,  will  bring  together  scholars  with expertise  in  quantitative  measures  of  labor market areas and in  case  study  approaches.   The primary objective of the  workshop  is to build collaborative ventures in both countries  that will enhance opportunities for joint research.    Though  labor  market  research  programs  are  well  established  in  both  Mexico  and  the  U.S.,   the  research traditions on both sides of the border  are  very  different.   The  Mexican  approach  primarily  consists of rich case studies of local market areas,  whereas  the U.S. research tradition has  emphasized  broad   labor  market  areas  that  can   serve   as  statistical units of analysis  While the Mexican and  the U.S. approach are complementary, there have been  few   attempts  to  combine  their  perspective   in  comparative  work.   This workshop  will  contribute  toward  that  goal by bringing together Mexican  and  U.S.  sociologists to discuss collaboration on labor  market  research.  This cooperation is  critical  if  the social science communities of both countries are  to  monitor  and  assess the effects  of  the  North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  ***",
