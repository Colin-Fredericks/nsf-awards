Farish Jenkins/Laura MacLatchy   SBR-9300671    For decades, the functional properties of the hip joint in humans and other primates (including their fossil remains) have been studied by anthropologists in an attempt to understand the peculiarities and evolution of our singular pattern of locomotion - erect bipedal walking.  Walking evolved early in human evolution, certainly prior to the great expansion in brain capacity and competence, and was a key to leaving a life-style dependent on the forests.  Yet the comparative studies of hip function to date have been inadequate to resolve a number of disputes in this area.    This project will use some new 3-dimensional quantification techniques to document differences among primate species more accurately than has been attempted previously.  These will provide a basis for functional interpretation of behavioral differences in locomotion which in turn will make for more accurate delineation of fossil primate patterns.  The study should have some clinical relevance, as well.  The graduate student and P.I. are extremely well qualified to carry out this research.   ***  P\\anthro\\jfried\\9300671.abs     >R  t 8 R t     u+3        R  N  F    rx R       Ea (a       \\ >           ,a  F   \\   \\. *\\  \\ ,\\  \\ F  aa       v              r   p   6v   x  k      \"  -    =  t =  t  ^2  o      q    ~   \\  -  o     _2=  t =& t  >o  ue  o    \"  -  b C  o tO M  N <:t <\\t   \\A D  3   b    <At <Bt         : u   * h   1     b Ea D    * b  >   t     7*3        R    \\. >o    o    \u00d5  ^Y X  1   3  SW  .s6  +  \\ ? t 9 t       G   \\     K   \\ |  t  D     D   @               Bt( \"    \"t  (   (t  5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         !         !         !
