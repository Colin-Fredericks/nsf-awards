 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357951  SWAIN  This award provides support to Dr. Carol Swain under the National  Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.  The  objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty  in science and engineering, to enhance the academic career of  recent PhD recipients by providing flexible support for research  and educational activities, and to foster contact and cooperation  between academia, industry, and institutions that support research  and education.  Dr. Swain has already made significant research  contributions to the field of political science, and she has the  potential to become a leader in academic research and education.    This award will allow the investigator to build on her existing  research and conduct an extensive study of legislative races where  black candidates have run against white opponents in majority-  white districts.  She will examine personal traits, resources,  campaign styles and strategies, and compare and contrast the  results with existing knowledge.  Data sources and methods include  historical analysis, interviews, field research, statistical  analysis, and experiments using computer assisted interviewing of  a representative sample.    Although it continues to be the case that the majority of blacks  win public offices in heavily black districts, the past decade has  seen a conspicuous trend in the elections of black public officials  in predominately white constituencies.  The electoral psychology  that sometimes leads voters to ignore racial differences and other  times to vote along racial lines remains unclear.  This research  promises to significantly advance knowledge in this area.  The  results should have implications for both theory and practice.  ***",
