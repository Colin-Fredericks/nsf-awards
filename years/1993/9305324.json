The objective is to produce several 30-to-150  year proxy records of seasonal climate variability in Indonesia for  different time intervals in the last 150,000 years.  The data will  be used to assess the influence of paleogeography caused  by  changes in sea level on the intensity of seasonal climate  variability, as well as the frequency and intensity of El Nino  events as they are manifested in Southeast Asia.  Preliminary  analyses of hand samples collected during a reconnaissance trip to  Sumba last summer indicate that the proposed study is feasi ble;  massive corals on Sumba are well preserved, and would provide  reliable information on seasonal variability of salinity and sea  surface temperature.  The radiocarbon ages of samples from one of  the terraces on Sumba place the growth of the coral at a time when  sea level was 50 meters lower than it is today.  the data produced  from this study will help unravel the specific mechanisms of how  oceanographic change affects regional and global climate change  during time period with significantly different boundary  conditions.  ***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ar",
