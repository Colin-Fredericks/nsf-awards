 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, we propose to consider problems in Bayesian asymptotics, design,  inference, and the question of synthesis with classical procedures. In  asymptotics, we propose to consider the limiting behavior of the posterior in  nonregular problems. Design of experiments will be considered in nonlinear  models, when prior information is available about parameters of the model. Such  nonlinear models typically are hard to deal with because of dependence of the  design on the parameters themselves. In particular, we will try to use the rich  linear theory by approximating nonlinear response functions by linear functions,  such as polynomials. We also will derive designs that give a preexperimental  guarantee of pos data accuracy, uniformly in the data whenever possible. Finally,  in canonical Exponential family problems, we will derive priors for which the  implied Bayes procedure has classically satisfactory property.  Much of existing statistical methodology has evolved from methods of so called  classical statistics. In comparison, the alternative methods known as Bayesian  methods are still growing.  Nevertheless, it is now recognized by the community  as a whole that Bayesian methods can be very useful as tools for statistical data  analysis. In this project, our goal is two fold:  first, to study alternative  Bayesian methods in important classes of statistical problems, such as designing  statistical surveys, and second, to bridge the two methods of statistical  analysis together by studying Bayesian methods which are also acceptable  according to classical criteria.",
