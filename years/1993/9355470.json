It consistently attracts strong  participation from engineering faculty directly involved in  classroom and laboratory instruction, from department chairs  and deans of engineering and allied sciences, and from research  organizations and government agencies supporting educational  programs.  This conference is the ideal forum for the direct  dissemination of results from NSF-sponsored engineering  curriculum developments to the faculty who can adapt these  developments in their own programs.  Among the major presenters  at the conference are members of the NSF-sponsored Engineering  Coalitions.  This project will 1) expand the distribution of program  announcements to faculty in all engineering disciplines, 2)  provide travel grants to allow principal investigators of  particularly compelling projects to present their work at the  conference, and 3) provide travel grants to allow allow up to  50 K-12 teachers to attend the conference and lend their  expertise in teaching to the conference participants while they  gain increased understanding of the engineering disciplines.  ***",
