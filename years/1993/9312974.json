 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an international travel grant jointly supported by the                                                                                                  Polar Earth Sciences and Artic Programs and the Interfacial,                    Transport, and Separations Program.  The purpose of this                        international travel grant is to allow the traveler to                          interact with academics in the Peoples Republic of China.  The                                                                                                  activities include: (1) presentation of a paper at the Sixth                    International Conference on Permafrost in Beijing on July 5-                    9, 1993; (2) participation in a field excursion tot he Tibet-                   Qihai Plateau from July 10-24, 1993; and (3) a visit to two                     research institutes:  the Central Research Institute of                         Science and Technology of th Ministry of Chemical Industry;                     and, the Lanzhorn Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology.                      The common thread in these activities is the relation of                        interfacial and transport phenomena to behavior of soil in                      polar and other low temperature climates.  The traveler is an                   expert in predicting differential frost heave.  This phenomena                                                                                                  has engineering importance since its occurance can cause                        significant damage to raods, airport runways, pipelines, and                    buildings.",
