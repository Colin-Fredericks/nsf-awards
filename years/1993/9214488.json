 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shu  9214488  The objective of this proposed  research is to develop accurate and  stable algorithms, based on the  essentially non-oscillatory (ENO)  methodology, which were originally  designed for general hyperbolic  conservation laws and in particular  for the compressible Euler  equations in gas dynamics, to  device simulations in two and  eventually in three space  dimensions.  The emphasis will be   on simulating the hydrodynamioc  (HD) model and the recently  developed Energy-Transport (ET)  model and investigating their  physical applications.  Issues  related to device simulations, such  as the choice of boundary  conditions based upon physical as  well as numerical considerations,  the adequate handling of boundary  and inner layers (high gradient  regions), the adequate handling of  mild singularities in the potential  due to the boundary conditions, the  adequate handling of possibly stiff  source terms, and parallel  implementation of the algorithm  will be investigated.  The eventual  goal of the effort is to develop a  numerical algorithm which is  accurate and robust, suitable for  device simulations using not only  the HD and ET models but also other  models as well.  Physical  applications of related models will  also be investigated in  collaboration with other applied  mathematicians, device physicists  and engineers.  ***",
