 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320042   Staman       CICNet, a midlevel network supplying high level connectivity  to the universities of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation  (CIC) (which includes the universities of Ohio State, Michigan  State, University of Michigan, Indiana University, University of  Chicago, Purdue University, University of Illinois, Northwestern  University, University of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, and  University of Iowa) and establishing cooperative working  agreements with state networks in its region, requests support  for a major initiative of providing ubiquitous access to the  Internet.        Although the phrase \"rural datafication\" has been used to  describe this project succinctly, the primary focus of this  project is to extend Internet access and all the services it   provides to under-served constituencies wherever they may be  located in rural and geographically remote areas.       The project will focus on three key areas: 1) selecting and  proving standard hardware and software that can handle dial-up  and dedicated, low-speed internet connections; 2) high quality  documentation, training, and associated materials that will  reduce the amount of effort and time to connect participants; and  3) expanding network connections and services to traditionally  difficult to reach and difficult to serve user communities.  ***",
