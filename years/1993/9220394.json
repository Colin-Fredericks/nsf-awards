 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) is a heterodimeric enzyme that              post-translationally modifies proteins by attaching an isoprenyl                moiety to a C-terminal cysteine.  This modification, identified in              yeast and animals, is required for membrane association and in vivo             activities of many regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle                   control and differentiation.  The major focus of the proposed                   project is to elucidate the role(s) of FTase and protein                        prenylation in mediating plant developmental processes.  In recent              experiments, a cDNA clone encoding a pea FTase beta subunit has                 been cloned and characterized, protein prenylation has been                     demonstrated in plant cells, and FTase transcript levels have been              analyzed in apical buds of pea seedlings and suspension-cultured                tomato cells.  In both experimental systems, a rapid, transient                 increase in FTase mRNA was detected preceding the onset of active               cell division.  These results are consistent with the hypothesis                that FTase mediates the activity of critical components of the                  signal transduction pathways controlling cell division in plants,               analogous to its key role in cell cycle control in fungal and                   mammalian systems.  To test this hypothesis, a cDNA for the FTase               alpha subunit will be cloned from pea and biochemical and                       physiological properties of pea FTase will be delineated using both             in vitro assays and in vivo plant cells transiently expressing                  protein prenylation substrates.  Detailed analyses of the temporal              and spatial patterns of pea Ftase gene expression will be performed             to provide clues as to its functional significance in plant                     development.  Plant cells and stably transformed plants, inhibited              in Ftase expression by antisense RNAs or competitive peptide                    inhibitor, will be monitored for phenotypic, cellular, and                      molecular changes to directly assess the role of FTase in                       regulating plant cell division and differentiation.                             %%%                                                                             It has recently been discovered that certain proteins are modified,             under some physiological conditions, by covalent attachment of                  isoprenyl groups to a specific C-terminal amino acid.  Isoprenyl                groups are a type of organic molecule that tends to be more soluble             in fats or oils than in water.  This modification, then, has the                effect of allowing proteins that would otherwise remain dissolved               in the watery cytoplasm of a cell to attach to cellular membranes.              which are composed of fatty materials.  It is now becoming clear                that the association of particular proteins with membranes is a                 critical event in a chain of biochemical events that regulate cell              division, membrane fusion, and a variety of other cell biological               processes.  This important regulatory mechanism has been described              and is actively being studied in mammalian cells and in yeast, but              until now nothing has been known of its possible existence or role              in higher plants.  This is the subject of this research.  These                 investigators have identified the gene for one part of the enzyme               that carries out addition of isoprenyl groups to proteins in peas               and will use techniques of molecular biology to characterize the                enzyme further and to study its possible function in plants.",
