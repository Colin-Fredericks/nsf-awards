 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are a number of models describing bargaining behavior and                 conflict resolution in the face of uncertain outcomes.  This                    study will use laboratory experimental methods to evaluate the                  predictive capacity of two alternative models of bargaining in                  the context of an incomplete contract.  In its most simple form,                parties in the first stage of an incomplete contract first make                 some form of relationship-specific investment that enhances value               or reduces costs in the second stage, when uncertainty is                       resolved.  Once the state of the world is known, parties to the                 incomplete contract realize a surplus to be divided among                       participants.  Bargaining divides surplus and completes the                     contract.  The subgame perfect equilibrium bargaining hypothesis                predicts that surplus divisions from bargaining are independent                 of sunk costs, i.e., in this case, relationship-specific                        investments.  Alternatively, an equity-theoretic model predicts                 that bargaining will divide surplus proportionately with each                   party's share of total investment when individual investments are               observable.  When this information is not available, outcomes are               equivalent to those predicted by the perfect equilibrium                        hypothesis.                                                                     The predictive power of these alternative bargaining hypotheses                 will be tested by systematically varying bargainers' information                on relationship-specific investments.  Moreover, since investment               incentives in contracts are determined by bargaining outcomes,                  and since the hypotheses to be tested imply different bargaining                outcomes, this study will also contribute to our understanding of               the linkage between bargaining behavior and contractual                         performance.",
