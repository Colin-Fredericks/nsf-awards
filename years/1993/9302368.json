The topic of the                          conference is the interaction of ergodic theory with                            harmonic analysis. Participants will come from the Middle                       East, Europe, and the U.S. Prior to the start of the                            conference (May 17-22), a series of short courses in                            Ergodic Theory, Harmonic Analysis, and Number Theory                            will be held in order to provide the necessary background                       for mathematicians who have not been introduced to this                         new and exciting area of research.  This proposal supports                      the participation of approximately 10 U.S.                                      mathematicians. Conference participants will present                            papers that will be compiled and published as a                                 conference volume.                                                                                                                                              This conference in mathematical sciences fulfills the                           program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                          enabling leading experts in the United States, Egypt and                        elsewhere to combine complementary talents and present                          research results in areas of strong mutual interest and                         competence.  This conference has an educational and                             outreach effort that has the potential for generating new                       scientific activity and new international linkages.",
