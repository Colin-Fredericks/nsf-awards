 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311880  White    Under the direction of Dr. Randall White, Mr. Brooke Blades will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study three  archaeological collections which are housed in French institutions  and are attributable to the Aurignacian culture of Vezere Valley in  Southwest France. These materials are all from carefully controlled  excavations at well dated sites and span the major interval when  these early modern humans inhabited Europe and the Near East. Mr.  Blades will conduct several studies. First he will examine the  technologies by which these tools were produced and shaped to  produce their final form. In particular he is interested in the  intensity of utilization of raw material and the efficiency with  which it was used. Secondly, based on visual analysis he will  attempt to match the raw material - mostly flint - to the source of  origin and in this way reconstruct patterns and extent of  prehistoric movement. Finally, in collaboration with researchers at  the University of Missouri, he will obtain trace element data on  one subseries to characterize source areas and chemically match  excavated artifacts to them.    The goal of Mr. Blades work is to understand the subsistence  strategies practiced by Aurignacian peoples. During the millennia  when the Aurignaican occupied Western Europe, glaciers advanced and  retreated and climate changed dramatically. These shifts have been  reconstructed through the paleoenvironmental record and Dr. Blades  wishes to understand how Aurignacian subsistence and ranging  patterns varied accordingly.     This research is important for several reasons. The Aurignacians  are the earliest anatomically modern people in Europe and this work  will shed new light on their cultural competence and strategies. It  therefore sets a baseline against which later accomplishments can  be judged. The work also increases our understanding of human-  environment interactions and will show how people with relatively  simple technologies adapted to  a rapidly and markedly changing  environment. Finally the project will contribute to the training of  a promising young scientist.  ***",
