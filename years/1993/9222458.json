Telephone                     interviews offer a rapid and inexpensive method of sampling broad               geographic areas with a sampling density proportionate to the                   variation in the data.  The survey will establish a network of                  native speakers who are available for repeated interviews  to                   obtain both phonetic and phonological information on a wide range               of variables.  The data obtained will be used to investigate                    general questions in the theory of language change, as well as                  provide national maps of the regional features of English.                           Current research on English dialects shows continued change                and increasing diversification of broad regional patterns through               chain shifts, mergers, lexical splits and the vocalization of                   liquids.  A number of principals have been proposed to account                  for the geographic spread and transmission of these changes                     across generations, including specific quantitative models for                  areal diffusion.  Efforts to confirm these models have been                     limited so far to sociolinguistic studies of small areas; the                   regional data that has been gathered is dispersed over time and                 space in ways that inhibit comparison.  Furthermore, the                        traditional methods of dialectology do not gather the information               on perception and categorization of speech needed to investigate                the mechanism of phonological change, and the traditional focus                 on rural communities does not provide the data needed to                        investigate the correlation between community size and the                      advancement of change.                                                               Results of a pilot survey of the North Central States show                 considerable success in recruiting a number of subjects and in                  obtaining phonetic and phonological information that shows clear                regional differentiation of sound changes in progress.  Current                 methods of instrumental analyses of telephone recordings provide                data of sufficient quantity and internal reliability to map                     individual vowel systems.  An extended survey of the Middle                     Western United States will be conducted from the eastern boundary               of Ohio westward to the Continental Divide and from the Ohio                    River northward to the Canadian border.  The survey will gather                 data that will trace the progress and mechanism of the Northern                 Cities vowel shift, its relation to the southern vowel shift, the               merger of long and short open /0/, ongoing mergers before liquids               and nasals, and the lexical distribution of the tensing of short                a and o in those regions where splits have occurred in the past.                The sample will be representative of both geography and the                     population size of communities.  The basic unit of sampling will                be areas of influence of the largest urbanized centers as                       established by newspaper circulation.",
