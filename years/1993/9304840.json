 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to characterize the hydrology, hydrogeology, and             geochemistry of the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.  Northern               Yucatan is an emergent platform in which karst features are                     developing in rocks whose mineralogy is strongly dominated by                   limestone and dolomite.  Low content of argillaceous minerals and               high permeability insure a rapid throughput of groundwater in the               system.  Mixing of fresh and salt water result in a significant                 zone of dispersion between the fresh groundwater lens and the                   underlying saline intrusion; and this zone of dispersion can                    significantly affect carbonate diagenesis.  Simple stratigraphy and             mineralogical composition, accessibility, and lack of human                     development make the northern Yucatan Peninsula an excellent                    natural laboratory.  The study area will be divided into four                   distinct zones characterized by strong differences in permeability.             Proposed research involves drilling holes (in collaboration with                Mexican ion content, environmental isotopes, saturation indices,                and Sr content), and making and calibrating electrical resistivity              surveys.  Interface behavior and its relation to diagenesis and                 corrosion will be studied.  Data will be mapped or contoured and                used in numerical simulation of groundwater flow.",
