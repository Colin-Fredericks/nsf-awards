 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports six projects in invariant theory and                   representation theory.  Four of these projects are focussed on                  questions in invariant theory, related to the dual pairs and the                \"method of multiplicity-free actions\".  They all are concerned                  with extending the range of examples in which one can effectively               compute quantities of interest.  Specifically, they are concerned               with tensor products, weight spaces, plethysms, counting lattice                points in certain polyhedra, generalized spherical harmonics, and               multiplicity-one phenomena in restrictions of representations.                  A fifth project concerns the computation of explicit structure of               principal series representations of real reductive groups.  A                   sixth project involves the study of structure in congruence Hecke               algebras on p-adic groups and its implications for the existence                of minimal K-types in p-adic representation theory.                                  The research support concerns the representation theory of                 finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study                    transformations.  Because of this, group are a fundamental tool                 in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as                           mathematics.  Representation theory is an important method foe                  determining the structure of groups.",
