 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonparametric methodology is widely used in one and two                    dimensions, but not in high dimensions.  This research proposal                 focuses on the mid-range dimensions in an attempt to foster a                   deeper understanding of the implications of the curse of                        dimensionality.  Particular emphasis will be given to                           multivariate regression and density estimation problems, and                    closely related applications.  Anecdotal evidence suggests a gap                exists between the apparent successes of nonparametric                          methodology and the poor performance predicted by theory.  We                   will examine new points of view, especially related to adaptive                 estimation.  Higher quality estimation has often required use of                negative kernels, but recent research and shown that equivalent                 gains are possible in regions where the Hessian is indefinite,                  often in the tails which dominate in higher dimensions.  Other                  recent work suggests that cross-validation algorithms which are                 considered of marginal practical value in one dimension, improve                dramatically in the multivariate case.  We have found the many                  bandwidth selection algorithms cluster into two cases, and                      propose to characterize and investigate these classes. Dealing                  with medium dimensional data gives rise to many problems in data                visualization which we propose to investigate. Multivariate                     visualization requires aids and guides such as cognostics.  We                  plan to extend our density estimation visualization capabilities                to regression surfaces as well as applications such as visual                   clustering and discrimination. We propose to extend univariate                  ideas of mode estimation and testing based on the mode tree and                 simulation to several dimensions.  Algorithmic development for                  multiprocessor and parallel architectures will be briefly                       considered. Nonparametric methodology seems to work well in the                 hands of experts, and this research is designed to not only aid                 the expert but to facilitate the use of the methodology by a                    wider audience.                                                                      The proposer has recently completed a book on the topic of                 multivariate density and regression estimation, and related                     applications, particularly focusing on histograms and their                     logical extensions (Scott, 1992).  Difficult theoretical problems               with practical consequences still abound.  However, widespread                  application reflects the general acceptance of nonparametric                    methodology.  The growth in the field of scientific visualization               is fertile ground for these exploratory procedures.  This project               attempts to capitalize on existing investments in large data                    bases, by developing flexible techniques that attempt to extract                the maximum amount of information and structure hidden in the                   high dimensional data.",
