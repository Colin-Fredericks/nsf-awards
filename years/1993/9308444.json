 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Paul L. Speckman will investigate several statistical  problems in nonparametric curve and surface estimation, the  problem of recovering smooth curves and surfaces from noisy data.   There are a number of general methods for curve estimation which  have been extensively studied including kernel estimators and  smoothing splines.  This project is aimed at applications of  these methods in two specific areas, constructing confidence sets  for curves and estimating change-points (or breakpoints) in  otherwise smooth curves.  The first part of the project is aimed  at developing reliable, practical confidence bands for unknown  smooth curves.  The investigator will derive the necessary  asymptotic theory to construct confidence bands based on  cross-validated or otherwise data-driven smoothers, and he will  study their finite sample properties by computer simulation.  The  second part of the project will employ related distibutional  theory to develop methods for detection and estimation of  change-points and estimation of the magnitude of the change.  In  this context, change-points are defined to be points where jump  discontinuities in an otherwise smooth response function or its  derivatives occur.  These change-point models are useful in a  variety of applications including longitudinal studies of  patients in certain kinds of clinical trials.  Professor Paul L. Speckman will investigate several statistical  problems in an area known as nonparametric curve and surface  estimation, the problem of recovering smooth curves and surfaces  from noisy data.  Such problems arise in a wide variety of areas  of science such as economics, atmospheric sciences, engineering  and medicine.  There are a number of methods currently available  for estimating such curves.  The first problem to be addressed by  Professor Speckman will be that of giving realistic and practical  error bounds for these estimates.  This will enable investigators  using nonparametric curve estimators to know how good their   results are.  Theoretical results will be obtained and their  applicability will be studied through computer simulation.  The  second problem to be studied, known as a change-point problem,  pertains to situations where there is a sudden change in an  otherwise smooth process. One example is an industrial process  when there is a sudden shift in the quality of the output.  Other  examples come from the study of certain diseases in humans.  One  specific case in which the new methods will be tested is a  certain form of muscular dystrophy where muscle strength abruptly  begins to decline at the onset of the disease.  Techniques to be  developed in this project will enable researchers to detect when  such change-points have occurred and to estimate the size of the  change.",
