 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352329  Alexander  The University of Mississippi's Department of Mathematics is  implementing a new calculus curriculum, Project CALC (Calculus  As a Laboratory Course). The University is the first  comprehensive public university utilizing materials and methods  of Project CALC, developed and first implemented at Duke  University. After extensive review of its mathematics  curriculum, the Department selected Project CALC to test as an  alternative curriculum and teaching strategy in the  undergraduate curriculum. Project CALC is an innovative  calculus program which emphasizes more applications, numerical  and graphical techniques, modeling, use of current technology,  and collaborative learning. After the initial one year trial  period, the Department is pursuing implementation of Project  CALC in all of its calculus sections.  The objectives of this  project are: 1) to enable continuation of a phased  implementation of Project CALC at the University of  Mississippi, 2) to refine the materials and implementation  strategy where necessary to better suit the environment at a  comprehensive state university, 3) to afford students an  opportunity to have an innovative and exciting new learning  experience; especially underrepresented minorities, for whom  the strategies of Project CALC seem to be particularly  successful, and 4) to share with the broader mathematical  community experiences in order to facilitate calculus reform in  environments similar to the University of Mississippi. This  project ties in closely with the Mississippi Alliance for  Minority Participation.  ***",
