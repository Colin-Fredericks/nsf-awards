 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will use grid-based statistical data to develop              a model that explores the integration of local plant interactions,              community development, and ecosystem processes.  Analyses will                  involve data from a gridded plot on Mt. St. Helens during recovery              from the eruption, 1983-1993.  Growth, survival, and reproduction               of individual plants of various species will be used to construct               a computer simulation model on a cellular grid that represents                  local plant interactions.  Manipulation of significant influencing              factors will indicate the degree to which these factors affect                  community development and ecosystem processes, such as nitrogen                 fixation.  These simulations will be compared to observations of                plants in the field during this award period as a means of model                evaluation.                                                                     %%%                                                                                  Understanding the relative contributions of various                        environmental factors to local plant population dynamics and                    interactions, community development and ecosystem processes during              recovery from disturbances is major goal of ecological study.  The              linkage between population, community and ecosystem processes has               become a particularly important topic as the functional importance              of biodiversity, population interactions, and community development             to ecosystem function and recovery from disturbance has been                    recognized.  This research will link field observations and                     simulation modeling to develop an ecological framework for                      integrating these processes and levels of organization.",
