 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between krill and its consumers is considered                  crucial to the dynamics of the Antarctic ecosystem.  To date,                   most studies of this relationship have concentrated on simply                   describing patterns of association.  This research will go beyond               a descriptive approach, and probe the mechanisms that generate                  patterns of association between selected seabirds and patches of                krill.  The focus is on seabird species that are abundant at                    South Georgia in winter and that are known to feed heavily on                   krill: Gentoo Penguins, Common Diving-Petrels, Kerguelen Petrels                and Blue Petrels.  The study includes several components.  These                include the quantification of seabird distribution relative to                  the location and size of krill patches and the quantification of                individual behavior of seabirds as a function of krill density,                 krill patch size, distance from krill patches and abundance of                  other consumers.  Data on individual behavior will be used to                   construct partial differential equation models of seabird                       distribution.  Patterns of association predicted by these models                will be compared to observed patterns of association.  Finally,                 an assessment of how birds actually capture prey such as krill,                 and how the potential cost of foraging increases as weather                     conditions become severe, will be made.  This research will unite               several lines of investigation into a synthesized portrait of how               birds respond to spatial and temporal variability in resources                  within the Antarctic environment.",
