This investigation starts from the simple observation that many  wars have involved the same set of states, such as India and  Pakistan, or Israel and its Arab neighbors.  India and Pakistan  have fought three wars in the last forty-five years, with the  outcomes of the first wars arguably having a strong influence on  the occurrence and timing of the wars that followed.  Similarly,  Israel and Arab states have clashed over territory four times since  1948.  From these examples, the proposition that one conflict  should be viewed in the historical context of previous conflicts  seems plausible.  The researchers propose to investigate how the  enduring rivalry context interacts with, is the cause of, and is  the effect of power relationships and system structure.  Thus, they  are concerned with how enduring rivalries begin, when they escalate  to war, how they end, and what factors affecting enduring rivalries  are manipulable by national decision makers.    Given the importance of enduring rivalries in the international  system, this project investigates a total of forty-five enduring  rivalries over the period 1816-1986.  Several major themes run  throughout this research project:  1) the concept of enduring  rivalries emphasizes the interconnection of international conflict  over space and time, 2) enduring rivalries have a \"life cycle\" -  they begin, develop, and die, and 3) state-level and dyadic  processes interact with system level phenomena.  Specifically, the  researchers address the following questions:  1) how do enduring  rivalries begin?  They look at how states become entangled in  recurring conflict in contrast to those that are able to resolve  their differences quickly and effectively; 2) how do enduring  rivalries end?  They are concerned with when enduring rivalri es are  terminated and the conditions (peaceful or violent) surrounding  that end; 3) what are the dynamics of enduring rivalries?  The  specific foci here are understanding the timing of war in rivalries  as well as how conflict in enduring rivalries is influenced by past  (and the prospect of future) conflict and outcomes; and, 4) what  effect do enduring rivalries have on other conflict?  Here, they  look at how an enduring rival's relationships, and the propensity  for conflict, with other states is affected by their participation  in an intense competition (e.g., what effect did the Cold War have  on U.S. relations with other states?)",
