 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will assist in the development of a mathematics                    laboratory classroom for preservice elementary education                        students and for a college geometry course for prospective                      secondary mathematics teachers.  The computers and software                     acquired as a result of this proposal will provide a                            technological environment which students will use to enhance                    their mathematical explorations. The course for which this                      laboratory is being designed serves approximately 300 students                  per year and is currently undergoing major curriculum                           development to provide a true laboratory experience in                          mathematics. This project will make it possible for students to                 integrate technological approaches with their activity-oriented                 and manipulative-based approach to learning mathematical                        concepts. As suggested by the NCTM's Professional Standards for                 Teaching Mathematics, it is essential that preservice teachers                  have these kinds of mathematical experiences in their                           undergraduate courses. It is unreasonable to expect these                       future teachers to provide, for their students, mathematical                    experiences which involve, for example, problem solving,                        communication, and the use of technology if they have not                       experienced that mathematics themselves. The technology                         available in this laboratory will not only be used to enhance                   the preservice teacher's expertise, but will also have an                       important impact on the curriculum development of the                           elementary laboratory course. Dissemination plans involve use                   of the developed-curriculum in subsequent courses, inservice                    workshops for teachers In the region, and the availability of                   a laboratory manual to help implement the curriculum.",
