 "awd_abstract_narration": "The topic of this conference is on numerical linear algebra,               and area of computational mathematics that has wide and important               applications in many fields of science and engineering.  The                    reason is quite simple: when simulating physical laws on a                      digital computer, the physical model is reduced to an algebraic                 model which the computer then manipulate and solve to provide an                approximation to the physical solution.  In models with long                    range couplings, e.g. molecular dynamics and the flow around an                 airplane, the numerical solutions of this algebraic model is the                most time consuming part of computation.  Thus, numerical linear                algebra lies at the critical juncture between the science and the               computer within the field of scientific computing.                                   The Householder Symposium is widely recognized as the                      premier conference in the field of numerical linear algebra.  it                has been held once every 3 years since the 50's with the venue                  alternating between North America and Europe.  It draws the best                people in the field from all over the world.  The location is                   usually in a secluded retreat, away from urban distractions, to                 promote an intimate environment conducive to exchange of ideas.                 This year the venue is at the UCLA Lake Arrowhead Conference                    Center near Los Angeles, a first class conference center, with                  excellent facilities and yet offers attractive rates for the                    participants.  We think it fits the tradition of this conference                series perfectly.  The date is set at June 13-18,1993.",
