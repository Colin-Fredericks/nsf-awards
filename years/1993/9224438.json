 "awd_abstract_narration": "Production of offspring in plants can involve pollen                            produced within the same plant or pollen from other                             plants.  The balance between these two modes has a                              profound influence on the distribution of genetic                               variation in the population and also its evolutionary                           dynamics.  The proposed research will examine the                               extent to which individuals in a natural population                             reproduce via self-pollen, and examine the relative                             importance of several factors that favor low to                                 moderate levels of self-pollination.  These include a                           decline in fitness of offspring derived from self-                              pollination relative to those that result from cross-                           pollination and the potential for competition between                           self and cross pollen.                                                                                                                                          Agriculturally important traits are often selected                              through breeding programs that involve many generations                         of self-pollination.  In some cases, lines of                                   agricultural plants have been selected for their                                propensity to self-pollinate since this prevents the                            dilution of desirable genetic traits by genes from                              unselected plants.  The genetic implications of imposing                        higher than usual rates of self-pollination on plants                           are poorly understood.  The proposed research will                              investigate some effects of self-pollination and                                contribute to our understanding of long term                                    agricultural selection programs.",
