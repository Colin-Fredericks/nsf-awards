 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                   in theoretical physics between Tomasz Taylor of Northeastern                    University and Ignatios Antoniadis of the Ecole Polytechnique,                  Paris, France.  The investigators will study a theory of particle               physics based on four-dimensional superstrings.  Their principal                objective is to determine the derivation of actions that describe               the physics of string excitations at low energies.  They will                   achieve this by computing the relevant string scattering                        amplitudes.  The results will be applied to studies of non-                     perturbative effects in superstring theory and to the problem of                supersymmetry breaking.                                                                                                                                         Both investigators have been involved in research on supergravity               and superstring theory.  Dr. Taylor brings to this collaboration                his background in the phenomenological aspects of superstring                   theory and expertise on supersymmetry breaking and space-time                   symmetries.  This is complemented by Dr. Antoniadis expertise                   on superstring modes and theories and his involvement in the                    first constructions of four-dimensional string theories and their               properties.  Their combined effort will contribute to our                       understanding of superstring theory and string/particle interface.              Superstring theory is important to the fields of particle physics,              modern mathematics and condensed matter physics.  It provides                   a framework of unification for fundamental interactions of nature               and holds great promise as a theory of quantum gravitation.",
