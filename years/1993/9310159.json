Furthermore, it is  believed that most of these plasmas carry electric currents.  In-  situ measurements of plasmas in the earth's ionosphere, cometary  tails, and planetary magnetospheres have confirmed these plasma  currents.  The recent discoveries of helical and filamentary plasma  structures in the galaxy and double-radio sources are indicative of  magnetic configurations which result from plasma currents.  Also,  the great majority of laboratory plasmas (e.g. fusion research  experiments such as Tokamaks, Reversed Field Pinches, Spheromaks,  etc.) are current-carrying plasma.  The frequent occurrence of  plasma currents and the fact that the interaction of two current  filaments is a basic plasma physics process warrants a thorough  investigation of this mechanism, because recent experiments show  that the physics of the merging of two plasma current channels is  not well understood.  However, a new theory has been proposed which  challenges and extends the existing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)  description, and therefore deserves an experimental test.  This  proposal is a request for funds to do laboratory research at  Dickinson College to help clarify the physical processes occurring  during plasma current merging using a novel diagnostic method in a  new plasma chamber.  The technique of correlating the probe data of  localized magnetic and electric fields with the computer controlled  placement of the probe tip within the plasma volume will result in  a set of three-dimensional data that should be able to advance our  knowledge of current merging and also distinguish between  theoretical predicitions of MHD phenomena.    We plan to use our experimental vacuum chamber equipped with our nw  computer-controlled probe drive diagnostic and data acquisition  system to perform a detailed investigation of  plasma current  channel interaction.  The initial experiment will involve the  generation of a pulsed current that will interact with the fisex  axial current rod and the uniform external magnetic field.  We will  observe the complex interaction of the current in this field  configuration to learn how these simplified structures behave.  The  next step will be to introduce two or more pulsed current beams  without any fixed current.  Finally, pulsed current beams will be  injected into a pre-existing magnetoplasma environment and we will  relate all these plasma current results to both MHD and the  Salingaros fiber theory.  With our new experimental apparatus, the  previously observed complexity of the interaction will be  controlled and then diagnosed in greater detail than heretofore  possible, a necessary condition for a better understanding of the  physics of this universal phenomena.  ***",
