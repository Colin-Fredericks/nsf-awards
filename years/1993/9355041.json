 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355041  Henderson    The University of Utah offers the unique combination of researchers  who design and prototype advanced, teleoperated, dextrous robots  with those who design and develop intelligent control methodologies  for such robots.  We believe that more research is necessary for  the development of theory and engineering practice in the use of  such advanced mainpulators as interfaces to complicate machine  systems (e.g., from drug design systems to nuclear waste handling  systems).  We propose to develop a close relationship with North  Carolina A&T (a historically black college) to give the opportunity  for minority undergraduate students to visit and work in our  research laboratories with the ultimate goal of recruiting them  into the Traineeship program.  We have also arranged for the  graduate Trainees to spend time at the Advanced Robotics Laboratory  at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.  Finally, we have also  negotiated a coop arrangement with Sarcos Research Corporation  (which builds and sells dextrous arms) to give some industrial  experience for both the undergraduate and graduate participants in  the program.  ***",
