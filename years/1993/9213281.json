 "awd_abstract_narration": "9213281  Cipriano    A variety of related plant and animal taxa, both marine and  terrestrial, are found to the north and south of an apparent  tropical barrier.  The variety of these \"antitropical\" taxa  includes many supposed populations or species pairs of whales,  dolphins and porpoises.  This project will study the relationships  and divergence between dolphin species of the genus Lagenorhynchus  found in northern and southern temperate oceans and will test  alternative hypotheses of Pleistocene glaciation or mid-Miocene  warming as explanations for the currently observed anti-tropical  species distributions.    Sequence analysis of portions of dolphin mitochondrial DNA, with  supplemental use of nuclear DNA markers, will be used to establish  relationships within the genus, and for comparison to related  outgroup genera also within the the Family Delphinidae. In order to  place amounts of genetic divergence found between Lagenorhynchus  species into perspective, it will be necessary to sequence  specimens from populations within Lagenorhynchus species to provide  a yardstick for interpreting interspecific divergence.  This  project will also investigate the population structure of white-  sided dolphins (L. obliquidens) found continuously distributed in  the North Pacific, and of widely separated populations of dusky  dolphins (L. obscurus) from the southern oceans.  This would be the  first attempt to establish genetic criteria for distinction of  stocks of these species, or to recognize potential specific status  of L. obscurus from different areas. This information may be useful  to determine whether particular stocks are at risk form fishing  activities in certain regions.    In order to assess the approximate timing of the divergence between  Lagenorhynchus species, genetic distances will be interpreted using  the perspective provided by population structure analysis,  comparison to published sequences for outgroups, and comparison to  genetic distances of other taxa known to have div erged in Miocene  and Pleistocene times. Because of the large difference between the  time scale of the two alternatives, identification of the  congruence of Lagenorhynchus divergence timing with one should thus  be possible even without a rate calibration.  ***",
