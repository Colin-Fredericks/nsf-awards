 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                   between Professor Richard Boyd of Ohio State University and Dr.                 Isao Tanihata of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research                (RIKEN), Japan.  The project is designed to measure cross sections              using the radioactive beam facility at RIKEN, which are of interest             to predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis.  These predictions                are crucial in testing the veracity of such models.  The specific               cross sections to be measured are aimed at improving our                        understanding of the primordial nucleosynthesis of nuclides                     somewhat heavier than those usually discussed in this context, but              which are readily observable by astronomers, even at very low                   abundance levels.                                                                                                                                               Also involved in the project are Professor James Kolata of the                  University of Notre Dame, and two postdoctoral fellows and one                  graduate student in Dr. Boyd's laboratory.  All five scientists                 will undertake visits to RIKEN to carry out the project.",
