 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been demonstrated that cotyledons from developing peas                 provide a rich source of clathrin coated vesicles (ccvs).  It                   appears that, in similarity to mammalian ccvs, those from plants                are composed of a clathrin cage consisting of heavy and light                   chains, adaptors, and a membrane vesicle component containing                   receptors to which cargo proteins are complexed.  The ccvs isolated             from cotyledons are primarily of trans-Golgi origin, and their                  adaptors are expected to differ from those of the better                        characterized mammalian ccvs which are principally of plasma                    membrane origin.  It is planned to extend on the preliminary                    findings which have shown a different peptide composition of the                adaptor fraction from plant ccvs.  A potential receptor protein                 which interacts with the N-terminal targeting peptide of vacuolar               proteins has been identified.  This receptor will be characterized              and its role in selecting protein body proteins, along with its                 interaction with ccv components, will be investigated.  The                     information accumulated will provide crucial information to the                 understanding of vesicular transport of proteins in plants and will             provide a basis for extended comparative studies with animal and                other systems.                                                                  %%%                                                                             A key feature of all eukaryotic cells is that they are physically               compartmentalized.  That is, cytoplasm is not a uniform mixture of              cellular components, but rather it is highly organized in such a                way that specific functions, and the components that carry out                  those functions, are localized in discrete regions of the cell, or              even external to the cell (e.g., secreted materials, cell walls,                etc.).  Some of these functionally distinct compartments are                    bounded by membranes.  It follows that there must be mechanisms to              ensure that specific proteins get to their particular subcellular               locations.  The coated vesicle system is part of this mechanism.                Coated vesicles are shuttle vesicles, or transporters, of proteins              contained within them.  In mammalian systems, the role of coated                vesicles in endocytosis (the transport of external proteins into                the cell) and in intracellular movement of newly synthesized                    proteins from the Golgi apparatus to pre-lysosomal or pre-secretory             compartments is well-studied.   In plants, relatively little is                 known about coated vesicle function or structure, and some of the               available information is the subject of controversy in the field.               Coated vesicles are very likely to play significant roles in the                transport of specific proteins to the vacuole, to seed storage                  bodies, and to the growing cell wall.  As such, a detailed                      understanding of their structure and function will be critical to               agricultural biotechnology.  This project promises to yield solid,              reliable information about a very important plant biology subject.",
