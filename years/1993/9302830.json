 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports mathematical research on nonlinear waves               inhomogeneous media, focusing on properties of wave front                       phenomena arising in nonlinear partial differential equations. In               particular reaction-diffusion equations and porous medium type                  equations will be treated.  These equations come from premixed                  flame propagation problems in combustion theory and solute                      transport problems in underground water flow.  Work will be done                investigating general reaction-diffusion front propagation in the               presence of periodic coefficients under the small diffusion                     fast reaction limit.  Also to be studied is the                                 reaction-diffusion front quenching problem in two dimensions from               a numerical point of view and investigations into the existence                 of reaction-diffusion front propagation in quasiperiodic and                    random media. The concentrate front propagation for solute                      transport in homogeneous and inhomogeneous media will also be                   taken up.                                                                             Partial differential equations form a basis for                           mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of                       mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as                 it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about                 the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about                     uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often                 develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on                the accuracy of these approximations.",
