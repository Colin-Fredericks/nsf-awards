 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308103  Chaudhuri  The time and space complexity of a variety of problems that arise in  distributed systems where processors have inexact timing information  shall be studied. In particular, each processor is modeled to have a  local  clock, and to take steps at each tick of its clock.  However,  the local clocks of all processors may not be synchronized with each  other,  and  may run at different speeds. Also, in a message-passing  system  of communication, messages may take varying amounts of  time  to be delivered. Processors therefore have uncertain knowledge about  the  time  for  processor  steps  and  communication.  A  number  of  different  ways in which to model this timing uncertainty  shall  be  considered. These models will more closely imitate real systems than  either  the  synchronous or the asynchronous models  of  distributed  computing.    A  number  of combinatorial problems like consensus, set  consensus,  resource  allocation,  and renaming, network problems  like  message  transmission will be studied, as well as implementations  of  shared  data  objects. Obtaining upper and lower complexity bounds for these  problems  is a goal, taking into consideration a variety of failures  and  exploiting different timing assumptions. In most cases,  robust  algorithms  that  perform  well whenever the  system  satisfies  the  timing  restrictions specified will be of interest, but  correctness  shall not be compromised in case they are not.    The  main goal of this research is to understand the power of making  inexact  timing assumptions in solving these canonical  problems  in  distributed  computing. Some of the same questions  that  have  been  previously  studied will be examined, but in the context of  certain  timing  assumptions. One goal of the research would  be  to  develop  general  techniques which permit simulation of arbitrary synchronous  (possibly   round-based)  fault-tolerant  algorithms   for   various  problems  in  the model with timing uncertainty. At a mo re  abstract  level, developing novel techniques for exploiting timing assumptions  in   both  algorithm  design  and  in  obtaining  lower  bounds  and  impossibility results is desired. A second goal will be to develop a  complexity hierarchy of shared objects in a timing-based distributed  system.  The  ultimate objective will be to understand in  a  formal  sense  the  advantage that can be gained by considering timing-based  models  for distributed computing over asynchronous models, and  the  disadvantage they represent in relation to fully synchronous models.  ***",
