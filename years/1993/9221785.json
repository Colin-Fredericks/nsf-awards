 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is based on the theme of using algorithmic  techniques to enhance the performance and flexibility of parallel  architectures.  Specific projects span a spectrum from  traditional topics, such as task scheduling and load  balancing, to less  familiar ones, such as using  emulations to achieve architectural flexibility  (e.g.,  reconfigurability);           from foundational questions concerning the  potential and  the limitations of various modalities of computation and  communication (e.g., the limitations of bufferless  communication), to more  immediately applicable studies of  algorithmic techniques that endow a parallel  architecture  with facilities that would be prohibitively expensive to  provide  in hardware (e.g., a multigauging capability).    The program is motivated by  three observations: (1) the speed of  processors in parallel architectures   increases faster than  the speed of the communication subsystem; (2) the  potential of  parallel computation is realized only when programmers are  liberated from having to manage the detailed physical resources  (number of  processors, interconnection topology, etc.)  of their  machines; (3)  technological developments are continually creating  new modalities of parallel  computation.  All three of these  phenomena increase the importance of  developing algorithms that  enhance the computing power of parallel  architectures.  Observation (1) suggests that we can now relegate to software  chores that previously demanded the speed  and concomitant cost  of hardware  implementation.  Observation (2) points out the  increasing need for algorithms  that enhance the portability of  parallel programs.  Observation (3) suggests the  need to  understand emerging modalities of parallel computation, in order to  exploit them effectively.",
