 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305858  McCarrey    This is an application for renewal of an ongoing project to study  the regulation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) during  spermatogenesis and oogenesis in mammals using the laboratory mouse  as a model experimental system.  The goal of these studies remains  to understand the role of XCI during mammalian gametogenesis, and  its relationship to meiosis and to the development and  differentiation of functional gametes.  Results from the previous  grant period suggest that XCI in germ cells (gcXCI) of both sexes  may differ from that in somatic cells (scXCI), especially in the  stringency of repression of transcription from affected X-linked  structural genes.  This may, in turn, be related to the fact that  gcXCI is a developmentally transient phenomenon, whereas scXCI  leads to terminal repression of affected genes.  Additional results  indicate that a gene that may regulate XCI, the Xist gene, is  expressed both in germ cells and somatic cells, suggesting that the  primary mechanism of XCI may be similar in both cell types.  In  this application, we have proposed experiments focused at the  molecular level to learn more about both the mechanism of  transcriptional inactivation of X-linked structural genes and the  mechanism by which gcXCI is initiated and terminated during germ  cell development.  We will examine two exemplary X-linked genes  encoding common metabolic enzymes, phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk-1)  and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt).  We will  measure parameters at the molecular level, including cessation of  active transcription in spermatogenic cells and re-initiation of  active transcription in oogenic cells, and potentially associated  changes in nuclease sensitivity, protein-DNA interactions, and  methylation at CpG dinucleotides in the promoter regions of these  genes in premeiotic and meiotic germ cells.  This will allow us to  determine whether gcXCI affects genes in a similar manner in the  germ cells of each sex, and to what extent thi s resembles the  effects of scXCI in XX somatic cells.  To learn more about the  potential mechanism of gcXCI, we will study the Xist gene at the  molecular level, including its regulation, its expression, and the  developmental relationship between Xist expression and the  occurrence of gcXCI.   ***",
