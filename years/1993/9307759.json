 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307759  Fulton    The ultimate goal of this laboratory is to elucidate the  orchestration of causal pathways during cell differentiation.  The  paradigm employed for this purpose is the 100-minute change of  Naegleria gruberi from amoebae to flagellates--from one eukaryotic  motility form to another--a differentiation that is exceptionally  accessible for analysis except for lack of molecular genetics.  The  quest continues via three ongoing studies, each of interest  separately but all converging toward the goal.  1) Surprisingly  this quick change has two \"checkpoints,\" at 10 min and at 20 min,  at which the strength of some signal(s) is evaluated and decisions  are made whether to progress toward differentiation or to \"hold.\"   Experiments are planned to define these checkpoints.  2) Certain  conserved proteins are synthesized during differentiation in  processes that involve signals regulating gene expression, mRNA  stability, and localization of these proteins in flagella and  associated organelles.  These proteins include four calcium-binding  proteins:  a flagellar and a cell-body calmodulin, calcineurin B  and centrin (a.k.a. caltractin), which becomes associated primarily  with the basal bodies when these organelles form de novo during  differentiation.  Studies are continuing to define these calcium-  binding proteins by examining gene expression, sequence, and  protein localization.  3) The essential tool of DNA-mediated  transformation of Naegleria is being developed using an homologous  selectable marker, the OMP decarboxylase gene.  The description of  checkpoints and the study of conserved localized proteins is  expected to yield results of immediate interest while the molecular  genetic system is achieved.  Once gene introduction is possible in  Naegleria, the information from the first two aims will make it  feasible to determine causal pathways for signals from initiation  of differentiation to assembly of components into basal bodies and  flagellae.  %%%  This research takes  advantage of a unicellular organism, Naegleria  gruberi, to study the principles involved in cellular  differentiation.  In response to chemical, mechanical, or physical  changes in its environment, this organism, within one hundred  minutes, can change from an ameba to an actively swimming,  streamlined form with two flagellae.  These two forms move by two  very different mechanisms which involve very different sets of  cellular machinery .  This quick change represents an excellent  model to study the biochemical signal pathways and changes in gene  expression involved in a well-defined developmental process.   The  results should shed light on the mechanisms of cellular  differentiation common to all living things, and will also expand  our knowledge of the diversity of mechanisms by which a variety of  organisms respond to environmental signals.  ***",
