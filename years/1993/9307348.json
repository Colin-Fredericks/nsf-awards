 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307348  Thomashow  Plants have evolved mechanisms that enable them to acclimate to,  and survive, a variety of environmental stresses.  Understanding  how these mechanisms operate is fundamental to our knowledge of  biological adaptation and may suggest novel approaches to improve  the environmental stress tolerance of important crop and  horticultural plant species.  The primary interest of this award is  in understanding the molecular basis of cold acclimation, the  process whereby plants increase in freezing tolerance in response  to low nonfreezing temperatures.  Most of our work is with the  small flowering plant Arabidopsis.  It has been shown that  Arabidopsis is capable of cold acclimating and that changes in gene  expression occur during the cold acclimation process.  A major goal  now is to determine whether the cor (cold-regulated) genes have  critical roles in freezing tolerance or some other aspect of low  temperature survival.  To address these issues, Dr. Thomashow and  his colleagues have isolated cDNA and/or genomic clones for five  Arabidopsis cor genes.  The initial characterization suggests that  certain of these genes may encode cryoprotective polypeptides.   Many of the proposed experiments are directed at testing this  hypothesis.  In addition, experiments are proposed that will  increase our knowledge of the magnitude and nature of the changes  in gene expression that occur during cold acclimation.  Taken  together, these studies should not only add to our understanding of  how plants acclimate to low temperature, but may also result in the  identification of genes that can be used to manipulate the freezing  and/or chilling tolerance of plants.  ***",
