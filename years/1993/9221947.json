A  multidatabase system (MDBS) consists of a number of sites which run  distinct commercial database management systems (DBMSs). The goal  of an MDBS is to integrate the DBMSs, allowing applications to  access data from, without requiring modifications to, the  individual DBMSs. The autonomous user organizations in a  multidatabase system generally have invested substantial capital in  the DBMS and may, rightly, be unwilling to modify or lose control  over their DBMSs. Therefore, it is imperative to develop  multidatabase transaction processing methods that allow a high  degree of local autonomy, but support users' data in a consistent  and reliable manner. This research investigates how to manage and  guarantee consistency of data residing in heterogeneous DBMSs,  while adhering to the autonomy requirements of the participant  DBMSs. The MDBS transaction management schemes developed in this  research have the following characteristics: (1) adapt to MDBS  environments, existing techniques for ensuring database consistency  based on preserving transaction atomicity and serializability; (2)  utilize alternate correctness criteria that relax the  serializability and atomicity requirements.  Pilot systems  developed for both the serializability and the relaxed  serializability models are used to conduct performance evaluation  to ascertain that the developed schemes permit a high degree of  concurrency.  The results of the research will provide the basic  transaction management mechanisms necessary for the development of  a complete multidatabase management system.  ***",
