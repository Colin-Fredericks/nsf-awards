The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Diane H.                                     Sonnenwald of Rutgers University to work with                                   Dr. Annelise Mark Pejtersen at Risoe National                                   Laboratory in Roskilde, Denmark for ten months                                  and with Dr. Heinz-Dieter Boecker at GMD-IPSI                                   in Darmstadt, Germany for two months.                                                                                                                           Their research project proposes to validate a                                   descriptive human computer system design model                                  (Sonnenwald, 1992) that characterizes                                           communication among users, designers, and                                       developers and expand it to include strategies                                  which may help design participants interact                                     more effectively while creating human computer                                  systems.  The model, developed through a                                        qualitative analysis of an expert system design                                 project and telecommunications network                                          management system design project, describes                                     design roles, themes, and intra- and intergroup                                 communication networks and their evolution                                      during the design process.  Hypotheses, based                                   on the model, will be generated to predict                                      participants' interactions in design                                            situations.  An empirical test strategy, using                                  multiple groups in real design projects, will                                   be used to determine the validity of the                                        predictions.  The result will be a proposed                                     predictive design model that may ultimately                                     improve the quality of design outcomes and lead                                 to the development of a more comprehensive                                      design curriculum.                                                                                                                                              The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel, a stipend for                                       twelve months, a dependent allowance for Dr.                                    Sonnenwald's family, and an allowance for                                       travel within country to meet with study                                        participants.",
