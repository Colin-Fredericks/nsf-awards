 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310945  Juraska    Dramatic neuroanatomical differences have been found between the  sexes in brain regions that are involved in reproductive  function. More recently, sex differences in neuronal organization  have been reported in parts of the brain that are associated with  cognitive rather than reproduction function.  Indeed, the  hippocampus, and the cerebral cortex, including the corpus  callosum, exhibit sexual dimorphisms at the cellular level.  Much  excitement has been generated about the possibility of sex  differences in the size of the corpus callosum since this  structure is the bundle of nerve fibers that connect the left and  right hemispheres of the brain.  While some laboratories report  striking sex differences in its shape and size, others find that  extensive individual variability hinders any meaningful  interpretation.  Dr. Juraska, during her previous NSF support,  reported that the gross size of the corpus callosum in rats did not  differ between the sexes, however, females have more axons in a  specific region, the splenium, of the corpus callosum than males.   These findings suggest that the cellular differences between the  sexes are more complicated that the size difference indicates.   Dr. Juraska also found that the number of neurons within the  binocular region of the visual cortex is sexually dimorphic.  She  will now continue her work to understand sex differences in the  neuronal organization and behavioral function of the largest area  of the rat brain, the cerebral cortex and its major interconnecting  pathway, the corpus callosum.  Dr. Juraska will determine whether  there is a hormonal basis for the observed sex differences and  the role that cell death plays as a mechanism underlying the  development of the observed dimorphism.  Moreover, she will  initiate a search for the functional significance of the  morphological sex differences.  This remains a controversial but  important area.  Her results will have broad implications for  understanding the import ance of lateralization and its  relationship to possible sex differences in verbal and spatial  learning abilities in humans.  ***",
