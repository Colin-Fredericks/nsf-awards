 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352699  Awad        A Fiber Optics Laboratory is being enhanced through the  acquisition of equipment which allows the offering of a much  more comprehensive curriculum that reflects current advances in  this emerging technology. The addition of research- quality  instrumentation  enables students to make measurements of a  critical nature to verify classroom theories and principles.  Also, the enhanced facility  enables students to grasp advanced  concepts in optics, polarization, semiconductor physics, fiber  optics and fiber optic instrumentation and related techniques.      This program is a part of the course study in the  Electrical/Electronics Department and  benefits courses open to  students in the electrical, electronics, computer, mechanical  and technical management programs. In addition, students use  the facilities to do independent studies to complete a  comprehensive investigation, or the design and assembly of an  optic communication or optic transducer system.     Also  conducted are small-group workshops for high school and college  faculty and their students in cooperation with representatives  from the fiber optic industry to ensure the new laboratory  facilities are used to their fullest.  ***",
