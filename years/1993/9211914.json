 "awd_abstract_narration": "9211914  Turner  Ocean science has a critical role in understanding the  biogeochemical processes involved in global change, and long-  range autonomous underwater vehicles (LRAUVs) are one of ocean  scientists' most promising tools.    However, the state of the art in intelligent control has not seen  application in real physical devices; that which has, been used  in highly-constrained environments.    This research is aimed at studying the problem of designing and  building an embedded, intelligent, reactive controller for long-  range AUVs.  This program, called ORCA, will be developed to  control the Marine Systems Engineering Laboratory's (MSELs) long-  range AUV, currently under development.  ORCA will build on  existing work in intelligent control, primarily drawing on the  artificial intelligence subfield of reactive planning.  The  investigator's previous work in schema-based reasoning, a  reactive planning method, will be augmented by other work in  planning, reasoning under uncertainty, and intelligent control.   ORAC will be able to create and follow mission plans to achieve  users' (scientist') goals, revising its plans and taking actions  as needed to cope with unanticipated events and the other effects  of incomplete knowledge, uncertainty, and interacting with a  changing world.",
