 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350836  Sauer  This project upgrades and augments the use of a ten station  physics laboratory by allowing students the use of computers  and other state-of-the-art equipment.  In these laboratories  students examine the physical laws and concepts of physics not  only by experimentation during laboratory sessions, but also on  an individual basis from assignments made in the classroom or  honors class.  By the use of the computer and computer  interfacing with sensors, they are able to more quickly and  more carefully analyze data while controlling the variables in  their experiments.  By using CD ROM and interactive computer  software, they will be better able to study the concepts in  their honors projects or the concepts presented as classroom  activities.  The project is structured to help increase the  students' analytical abilities, to augment their understanding  of the physical laws of nature, and to develop their skill in  using modern scientific apparatus. With the integration of the  new equipment in the laboratory the students gain experiences  that go well beyond those that they would have received in  traditional general and introductory physics laboratory  programs.    ***",
