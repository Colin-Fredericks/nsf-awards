 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310582  Ashe    When one learns to associate a tone with a reward, the cells in the  cerebral cortex of the brain that normally respond on hearing that  tone become more discriminating. That is, the cells become more  likely to respond to the rewarded tone, and less likely to respond  to other tones that are not associated with reward. The sharpness  of tuning of their receptive field improves. This type of receptive  field tuning may be the cellular basis for many types of human  learning that are dependent on the cerebral cortex. In this renewal  of an NSF grant, Dr. Ashe will continue his investigations of the  cellular mechanisms responsible for this receptive field  sharpening. A particular strength of his approach is that he will  use similar approaches both in vitro and in vivo.  He will use  newly developed pharmacological agents and physiological techniques  to identify the complementary roles of three neurotransmitters in  facilitating adaptive neuronal plasticity. The results should  provide basic data on how learning occurs, and also help in the  development of pharmacological treatments for memory loss due to  aging, degenerative disease or head trauma.   ***",
