This study investigates different aspects of a  controversy that has developed in recent years over the use of DNA  fingerprinting evidence in U.S. criminal trials.  The objective is  to describe and explain how the legal setting frames a controversy  over the design and dissemination of a scientific technique.  The  study will examine how claims about scientific facts, consensus,  expert authority, and technical reliability are presented and  evaluated in different research contexts, in the courts and in the  science press.  To place the current controversy in a legal and  historical context, the study will examine the history of relevant  legal decisions and legislation, and will compare DNA  fingerprinting with the cases of (non-DNA) fingerprinting and  polygraph analysis.      The study will combine ethnographic interviews, analyses of texts  and court testimony, and legal and historical scholarship.  The  interviews will explore the understandings of the techniques and  controversies from the points of view of different participants,  including: population geneticists and other university scientists;  staff scientists, case examiners and administrators at the FBI  laboratories; and research staff and managers at a private  forensics firm.  Records of court cases and transcripts of  testimony will be analyzed to show how expertise, consensus, and  technical reliability are represented in the legal setting.   Preliminary evidence indicates that researchers from different  disciplines and in different contexts design the \"same\" molecular  biological techniques in very different ways, and find them more or  less reliable under different organizational circumstances.  These  differences, and others related to the social construction of  authority, may influence discrep ant assessments about the  techniques made by judges and juries, when scientists appear as  expert witnesses in trials.      Few studies of scientific and technological controversies have  explored questions on how the legal setting constructs scientific  controversy, by providing a forum in which expert testimony is  solicited in adversary disputes about the reliability of  techniques.  Besides contributing information about how parties in  these controversies construe the legitimate and ethical use of  expert authority, as well as the cultural commitments with which  the divergent positions are infused, the present study will reveal  substantive implications and differences in the development of  scientific and social consensus, and in the negotiations over  boundaries in science and the law, and over what constitutes  expertise.  ***",
