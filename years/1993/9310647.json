 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310647  Barff       Little is known about how flows of immigrants to a  particular destination affect the decision to leave or the  destination choice of native migrants.  That is, are flows of  immigrants into the United States linked to internal flows of  population, and does this activity form part of a broader system  of interregional labor exchange?  If so, then the hypothesis that  population movements within a country are unaffected by immigrant  streams must be reassessed.  Additionally, previous research  measuring the effect of immigration on the welfare of natives in  impacted labor markets also requires reevaluation.  Failure to  recognize important linkages between immigration and internal  migration of natives may result in serious underestimation  of  the effects of immigration on the welfare of natives since many  immigration impacts be dissipated within the migration system.  This project will measure the stability of the native migratory  response to immigration over time by developing a series of  migration models for the United States between 1965 and 1990.  The models will test the linkage between immigrant flows and  internal migration streams by occupation for all metropolitan  areas.  The 21 largest metropolitan areas will be examined in  detail in order to illuminate the contextual subtleties of  immigrant and migrant impact on each city's employment structure  through time.  A series of econometric models of migration will  be estimated using public use microdata samples from the U.S.  Census of Population for the time period in question.       In 1965, landmark legislation was passed which relaxed the  upper limits on the volume of immigration to the U.S.  Econometric research so far has uncovered no instance where an  increase in the supply of immigrants significantly and adversely  affected the earnings or employment opportunities of natives.  This research project extends the analysis of immigrant impacts  to the question of whether immigrants cause native workers  to  move to other locations and what affect this movement has on the  employment situation of both groups.  It involves finding out if  the migration response to immigration is even across space, which  will add important new knowledge about the spatial context of  immigration into the United States.  ***",
