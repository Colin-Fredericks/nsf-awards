 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307034  Small    This project combines laser-based techniques with a new, practical  methodology for reproducible, well-defined fabrication of thin  (tens of micrometers or less) hyperquenched glassy films.  New,  powerful experimental techniques such as spectral hole burning and  coherent time domain spectroscopies will be used to develop an  adequate understanding of the physics of amorphous solids.  The  research deals with various aspects of the disorder, low-energy  excitations and low-temperature configurational relaxation  (tunnelling) processes of amorphous solids.  A select number of  organic liquids and waater will be utilized in the experimental  studies.  The proposed investigation can be divided into three  parts:  1) studies of disorder and relaxation phenomena in  hyperquenched glassy and other amorphous solid films; 2)  examination of temperature dependencies of thermal conductivity and  spectral diffusion; and 3) the probing of special disorder-induced,  low-frequency vibrational modes of amorphous solids.  These studies  on amorphous semi-conductors and superconductors and metal glasses  have found and will continue to find technological applications,  particularly because human proteins have much in common with  amorphous solids, and that the solution to the nuclear waste  problem may well rest on safe, million-year containment in doped  glasses.  Also, the results from these studies in organic systems  will impact experimentalists and theoreticians working on other  materials.  ***",
