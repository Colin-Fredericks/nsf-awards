 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309691     Chiel    In order to survive and reproduce, animals must pursue specific  goals while continuously modifying their behavior in response to  changing internal and environmental conditions.  Over periods of  hours or days, animals must choose among different mutually  exclusive behaviors, such as feeding or mating.  As they engage in  a particular behavior over minutes or hours, they must select among  different behavioral responses in order to continue to perform that  behavior (e.g., rejecting an inedible piece of food in order to  continue feeding).  They must also rapidly alter their behavioral  responses within seconds to cope with changes in the environment  (e.g., biting harder on tough food).  What are the neural  mechanisms underlying the ability of animals to generate adaptive  behavior?    In order to address this question, the principal investigator  proposes to study a behavioral switch in the marine mollusc Aplysia  californica.  Preliminary results indicate that Aplysia is capable  of switching among different behavioral responses as environmental  conditions change.  Specifically, the animal can switch from  ingestive to rejection responses if it attempts to ingest inedible  material.    The investigator proposes to use intracellular recording from nerve  cells in vivo and in vitro (1) to identify and characterize the  properties of premotor neurons and interneurons that cause the  switch in the timing of the activity of these motor neurons, as  well as (2) to identify and characterize the properties of sensory  neurons that trigger these different patterns of activity.  Using  these data, he will (3) simulate and analyze the neural network  responsible for the behavioral switch.  These three specific aims  will allow him to test different hypotheses about the neural  organization of a behavioral switch:  is it due to dedicated neural  circuits, to a distributed neural circuit, or to circuits that have  some shared and some distinct neural elements?  It will also allow   him to develop a more abstract description of behavioral switching,  based on concepts from dynamical systems theory.***",
