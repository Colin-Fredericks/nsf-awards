 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300058   Taaffe        This research is concurrent with creating methodology and   software for efficiently analyzing models of manufacturing systems,  including complexities such as assembly, blocking, and time   dependence.  We obtain efficient analysis by combining the speed  and efficiency of queueing network approximations with the details  and generality of computer simulation experimentation.  Our   combined approach, which we refer to as Correlated-Decomposition  Approximation and Simulation (CDAS), allows the strengths and   weaknesses of these two methodologies to complement each other.        The approximations and simulation can work together by using  the approximations as control varieties or the our newly developed  more general biased-control varieties, for the simulation.  The   goal is to improve analysis efficiency by two or three orders of  magnitude compared to ordinary simulation experiments.  The   combined CDAS methodology should analyze the behavior of large    complex manufacturing systems in a matter of seconds or minutes   rather than the hours or days that simulation alone can require and  to do so with accuracy beyond that possible in present queueing   network approximation software.",
