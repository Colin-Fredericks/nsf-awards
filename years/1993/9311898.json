 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311898  Chen  A theoretical investigation will be carried out on the  thermodynamics and kinetics of continuous phase transformations and  on the possibility of stable nanoscale structures in multicomponent  ceramic materials.  The main objective is to develop theories and  computer simulation techniques for understanding the fundamental  thermodynamic and kinetic origins leading to the formation of an  important class of self-assembled nanocomposites which resist  continuous coarsening.  To reach this objective, systematic phase  stability analysis and phase diagram calculations for ionic systems  with stable nanoscale structures will be performed.  The key  structural and thermodynamic factors leading to the formation of  thermodynamically stable nanoscale phases will be identified.  Extensive computer modeling will be conducted of the kinetics of  atomic ordering, compositional clustering and microstructural  coarsening in systems involving both short-range chemical and long-  range Coulomb interactions.  A computer simulation technique will  be developed which can describe the coarsening dynamics of domains  interacting with each other through electric dipole-dipole  interactions, elastic interactions and Coulomb interactions.  The  focus will be on the diffusional transformations in the self-  assembled relaxor nanocomposites.  The relation of atomic ordering  and compositional clustering tendencies to the atomic sizes and  charge valences of cations will be investigated through a  combination of modern statistical mechanics theory of order-  disorder transformations and atomistic computer simulations using  shell-model interatomic potentials.   %%%  This theoretical research grant involves both analytical theory and  computer simulation to study the properties of ceramic materials  which undergo changes of phase into materials having novel  structures.  The research will identify the conditions which  control the formation of these structures during the phase change.   The research is com plicated by the fact that the materials are  ionic.  This causes additional forces over long distances which are  difficult to handle theoretically.  However, the results of this  work will have important ramifications for understanding and  processing these technologically important materials.  ***",
