 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genetic divergence of populations is considered an                     important step towards speciation.  However, the degree to which                natural plant populations have diverged for quantitative traits is              unclear because of maternally biased estimates of differentiation.              The goal of Dr. Kelly's research planning grant is to use an                    elevational gradient to determine whether life history,                         morphological, and fitness traits have evolved in response to                   climatic variability in the goldenrod species Solidago macrophylla,             a native perennial plant of northeastern North America.  Clinal                 variation in plant phenotype will be correlated with elevational                variation in environmental conditions that may be acting as                     selective forces for the evolution of fitness-related features of               plant size and reproductive condition.  Subsequent research will                consist of a series of reciprocal transplant experiments that are               designed to distinguish paternal (pollen) effects from maternal                 contributions (chloroplast, mitochondria, endosperm) to phenotypic              variation both within and among populations.  The latter research               component is a novel and important addition to traditional                      reciprocal transplant studies that have usually failed to control               for local versus long-distance pollination.                                     %%%                                                                                  Research on Solidago macrophylla will be the first to estimate             the level of genetic differentiation for quantitative traits among              populations while controlling for maternal bias (effects of local               sources of chloroplasts, mitochondria and endosperm).  The results              of the study will augment understanding of the degree to which                  quantitative life-history traits in plants have evolved in response             to natural selection.  In addition, the results will clarify                    patterns of genetic diversity among populations for quantitative                traits, information that is necessary for effective conservation of             rare and endangered plants.",
