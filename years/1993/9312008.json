 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312008  Takoudis    This is an exploration of the utility of surface-enhanced Raman  spectroscopy (SERS), in conjunction with mass spectrometry and  other methods, for the in-situ molecular characterization of  transition-metal surfaces involved in gas-phase catalytic  reactions.  In particular, the program exploits the ability to  prepare ultrathin films of transition metals and other materials by  electrodeposition onto gold and the fact that such films exhibit  remarkably stable and intense SERS activity.  This approach allows  the measurement of vibrational spectra for a variety of species on  transition-metal surfaces to be obtained rapidly, with high  sensitivity, over a wide frequency range, at pressures of ambient  or higher, and at moderately high temperatures.  Coupling real-time  SERS measurements with  simultaneous mass-spectrometric assay of  the gas-phase composition enables linking of the molecular state of  the surface under working conditions with reaction rates under  either transient or steady-state conditions.  Initial studies are  on surfaces of platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, and palladium;  reactions of interest include the oxidation of carbon monoxide by  nitric oxide or by oxygen, the production of dicyandiamide from  ammonia and carbon monoxide, the formation of methane from carbon  dioxide and hydrogen, and the oxidation of alcohols and unsaturated  organics.  Parallel studies using SERS and X-ray photoelectron  spectroscopy or scanning force microscopy permit association of  vibrational bands with surface structures.       This study is devoted to the elaboration of a new method to study  surface-mediated chemical processes.  Although the present effort  is devoted  to heterogeneous catalysis, the approach should be  applicable to a family of related processes, including  electrochemical transformations, thin-film formation, and  corrosion.",
