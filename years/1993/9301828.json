 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301828  SWIFT    Recent field studies have shown that atmospheric aerosol samples  can stimulate the growth of natural phytoplankton populations, just  as iron can, in locations that are depleted in iron but contain  major nutrients at measurable levels. Computations indicated that  atmospheric sources supply a significant amount of iron to the  euphotic zone. Aerosol studies have shown that the composition of  marine aerosols (remote from continents) includes many trace metals  besides iron with biological significance, even though aerosols are  not uniform in their composition. This career advancement for women  project will undertake a pilot study examining laboratory growth of  phytoplankton exposed to aerosol as an iron or trace metal source.  Unique features of this project include: 1. the design of the  growth medium and treatment of the sea water so that it can be  chemically modeled for metal speciation, and 2. the use of algal  growth (known cultures of phytoplankton) as a measure or assay of  a particular metal content. The immediate goal is to quantify an  aerosol as a source of biologically significant trace metals,  particularly iron, for growth of phytoplankton.  ***",
