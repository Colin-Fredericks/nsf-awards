 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352033  Toot  An image processing facility is being used in an observatory  for introductory astronomy laboratories. Five telescopes,  ranging in diameter from 9 to 32 inches, serve as an excellent  base for efforts to expose science students and non-scientists  alike to both the practical side and the beauty of  observational astronomy. However, in a desire to convey the  quantitative aspects of astronomy more fully, as well as to  show the current state of the field, more on electronic image  acquisition and analysis is being included. Our experience with  a relatively inexpensive CCD (the ST-6 from Santa Barbara  Instruments Group) convinces us that this goal can be  accomplished on a relatively small budget while maintaining  quantitative rigor. A useful and innovative program can be put  in place with a second of these CCD's and the installation of  a computer laboratory so that students can be taught the  appropriate software efficiently and also have access to the  computers for data analysis. Using a set of projects which  demonstrate the importance of quantitative measurements, while  at the same time allowing for a wide range of mathematical  skills, students can obtain a valuable exposure to the workings  of modern science.  ***",
