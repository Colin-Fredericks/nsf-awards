 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flagella and cilia of eukaryotic cells are based on the axoneme,             an internal arrangement of nine doublets and a central pair of                  microtubules.  This highly conserved structure is widely utilized               for producing movement in both plants and animals.  The goal of                 this project is to understand how elements of the flagellar axoneme             interact to produce the flagellar beat.  Bull, rat and mouse sperm              will be used to study flagellar beating and axonemal function.                  Experiments to observe and compare microtubule activation in all                three species will be performed on sperm flagella treated (by one               of four previously developed methods) to permit disintegration by               microtubule sliding.  The extent and rate of microtubule sliding                will independently be determined in actively swimming, detergent-               extracted sperm models by videotape recording and computer-assisted             analysis of the flagellar motion.  Agents with known effects on                 flagellar motility, such as nickel, calcium or cadmium ions,                    vanadate, and cyclic AMP, will be tested for their selective                    effects on microtubule sliding in both disintegrating and intact                (motile) flagella.  Additionally, genetically dysfunctional mouse               sperm will be examined for abnormalities in axonemal function.                  Sperm from M. domesticus carrying two different haplotypes of the               T-complex, and sperm from M. domesticus carrying one haplotype plus             DNA from M. spretus at the homologous T locus will be examined, to              attempt to link specific axonemal functions to genetic loci.                    %%%                                                                             Flagella are slender extensions of the cell which \"beat\", i.e.,                 wave back and forth in a specific and characteristic way.  They                 represent a highly conserved mechanism for either propelling a cell             through its environment or moving the environment in the vicinity               of the cell.  Examples of such motility include the swimming of                 sperm in the uterus or of protozoans in ponds, the movement of                  mucus and inhaled particles in the trachea and bronchi of the                   lungs, and the intake of food particles by protozoans.  Flagella                consist of highly ordered arrays of microtubules, termed axonemes,              which run the full length of the cilium or flagellum.  Other                    microtubule-associated proteins, notably dynein, are involved in                the transduction of biochemical energy (ATP) to mechanical energy               (movement).  The axonemal beat is the result of certain of the                  microtubules sliding longitudinally past others, within the                     membrane-bound constraints of the flagellum, resulting in a bending             of the organelle.  The goal of this project is to understand how                the microtubular elements of the axoneme interact to produce the                flagellar beat.  The Principal Investigator has developed several               unique experimental methods to examine various aspects of these                 interactions, which will be further exploited in the course of the              work.  The experimental results, together with a computer                       simulation of flagellar beating which has been developed by the                 Principal Investigator, will lead to a working model of axonemal                function.  This work could have significant impact on the                       development of novel materials based on biological models.",
