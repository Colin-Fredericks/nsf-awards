 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be aimed at understanding the static and              dynamic fluctuations of a variety of polymers, surfaces and                     networks.  The many interesting and fundamental issues that can be              probed are relevant to a diverse variety of subjects which can be               broadly placed into the following categories: (1) Extended                      networks, such as polymers, membranes and gels, fluctuating in a                higher dimensional space.  The interplay between entropic                       elasticity, rigidity, and microscopic interactions leads to a                   number of unusual macroscopic phases. (2) Dynamic evolution of                  surfaces and paths far from equilibrium cannot be described by a                Hamiltonian, and is instead probed by appealing to symmetries and               conservation laws.  Evolution equations relevant to roughening of               crystal facets, moving lines, and flowing sandpiles are constructed             and their dynamic steady states are explored. (3) Path integrals in             random media are relevant to tunnelling of localized electrons,                 wave propagation in inhomogeneous media and pinning of vortex lines             in superconductors.  Numerical and analytical methods are developed             for performing these path integrals. (4) Substrate roughness and                its influence on adsorption and surface phase transitions is                    investigated.                                                                   %%%                                                                             The theoretical research to be conducted on this grant probes the               behavior of extended objects such as surfaces and chains, including             how these objects grow into various structures.  The general                    treatment is then applied to such systems as polymers, membranes,               interfaces and surfaces.  The results have wide applicability in                materials research and are also fundamental to modern condensed                 matter physics.",
