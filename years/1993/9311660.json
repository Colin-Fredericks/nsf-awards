However, access to real  juries is restricted by law and as a result many jury researchers  use simulated juries as the basis for their studies.  Simulated  juries have the advantage that researchers can carefully control  and systematically vary the content of their simulation to maintain  experimental research controls not typically available in real  courtrooms.  Critics within the social science and legal  communities argue, however, that the decision-making observed in  jury simulations may not generalize to actual trials and that it  may be unwise to base policies on the results of simulation  research.  This project will test whether the research methods used  (those features of jury studies that arguably make them more or  less applicable to actual cases) are systematically related to the  size and nature of the results.  A number of variables (such as  jury size, jury decision rules, jury comprehension of legal  instructions, and pretrial publicity) that have been examined using  both simulations and field observations of real juries will be  examined.      The project will include a number of stages.  First, a search will  be undertaken to identify all relevant studies.  Second, existing  reviews of the jury literature and theoretical articles on jury  behavior will be reviewed to identify variables for coding.  A  coding scheme for all included characteristics will be developed  and tested.  Then all of the studies will be coded according to the  coding scheme.  These data will be analyzed to test the average  effect sizes produced by the independent variables in the full data  set and the average effect sizes for specific research domains  within the full data set.  The relationships among the various  research methods and the magni tude of the effect sizes will then be  tested in both the full data set and the specific research domains.   The goal is to identify any methodological variables that moderate  the influence of the independent variables and thereby limit the  generalizability of results from simulation studies.   ***",
