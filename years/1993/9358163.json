 "awd_abstract_narration": "9358163  May       The research involves applying implementation of computer-  integrated manufacturing (IC-CIM) techniques to two critical  fabrication processes used in the production of high performance  multichip modules and other integrated circuits: plasma-enhanced  chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and reactive ion etching (RIE).   These precesses are used in the process sequence to deposit and  etch silicon dioxide dielectric layers.  Several aspects of  computer-integrated manufacturing successfully applied to other  etching and deposition processes.  For these applications,  traditional statistically-based approaches to process modeling,  control and diagnosis represent the predominant methods to achieve  IC-CIM objectives.  However, more recent efforts have shown that  neural networks offer great promise in process modeling.  In fact,  neural process models have been shown to be both more accurate and  more robust than their statistical counterparts.  This is due to  the high degree of parallelism and connectivity in these networks,  which crudely mimics the architecture of the human brian.       It is anticipated that the innovative use of neural networks  will also have a significant impact in process monitoring, control,  and equipment diagnosis as well.  This program of research will  investigate and implement several novel neural network based  approaches to the monitoring, modeling, control, and diagnosis of  RIE and PECVD.  These techniques will be applied specifically to  a high performance multichip module program, but the methodology  developed will be generic and readily applicable to other  electronics manufacturing processes and equipment.",
