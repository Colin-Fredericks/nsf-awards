 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funds from a private donor the University of Nebraska                      department of Physics and Astronomy has been able to purchase                   a CCD with photometric head and a computer. It is not able to                   be used to its full potential because the telescope which the                   department has on campus is inadequate.  In this project a                      permanently mounted 16\" Cassegrain/Newtonian telescope is used                  to allow the CCD system to be permanently mounted and readily                   available for use by a wide range of classes. The telescope                     allows long exposures which let undergraduates get hands on                     experience observing just about every class of astrophysical                    object. This enhances the astrophysics major program in the                     following three ways: first, it greatly improves the teaching                   of observational techniques by allowing students to try things                  on their own and at their own pace; second, it allows the easy                  introduction of relevant observational activities into all of                   the other courses for majors; and third, it lets students carry                 out an enormous range of independent research projects with                     relatively little supervision.",
