 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a symposium on scientific issues in the                flow and fracture of ceramic and geological systems.  As the issues             have attracted the efforts of both the materials science and                    experimental and theoretical geophysics communities, this symposium             will specifically emphasize topics of mutual interest and activity,             seeking primarily to foster communication and continued interaction             amongst the communities.  Topics to be addressed at the symposium               are many, but include (1) the nature of brittle fracture, including             mechanisms of toughening and of slow crack growth, (2) the                      mechanical properties of granular (porous and non-porous)                       aggregates, (3) polyphase rheology, including factors affecting                 engineered polyphase structures (e.g., fiber composites).  A group              of eminent scientists in both communities will contribute to the                symposium; further, the symposium itself is being organized by a                small committee that additionally represents the interface between              the two communities.",
