 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fast and high sensitivity time-resolved spectrofluorometer is                 proposed to develop into a commercial project.  In contrast with                the classical fluorometric method, such as time-correlated single               photon counting and phase modulation, the novel instrument is                   based on the introduction of two recently developed techniques:                 a) single pulse laser excitation and nanosecond waveform                        analyzing by electronic imaging, and b) acoustooptical tunable                  filter as an electronically controlled monochromator.  The                      instruments have the capability of simultaneously acquiring a                   complete set of decay and spectral curve sufficient for the                     construction of a 3-D manifold within 1 second.  The sensitivity                of the instrument can be as high as at femtomole (10-15 mole) and               attomole (10-18 mole) level.  These are far beyond the                          capabilities of current instruments.  The instrument is compact,                lightweight, low-cost, suitable for and will facilitate wide                    applications of the fluoroscopic method.  Phase I will                          demonstrate the feasibility and Phase II will develop a                         prototype.  The long-term goal is to use the method to develop                  numerous specialized instruments for basic research as well as                  for clinical and industrial applications.",
