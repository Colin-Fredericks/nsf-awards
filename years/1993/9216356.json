Since the 1960's, it has been readily accepted                 that the mechanism of steroid hormone action is by a genomic                    route.  However, in some circumstances, hormones can have effects               within seconds to minutes.  Until recently, these data were                     ignored because it did not fit the dogma.  Now it has become                    clear that steroid action in the brain is more complex than that                previously thought.  Indeed, steroid action is mediated by both                 genomic and non-genomic routes.  The conference will address the                mechanisms through which steroid hormones and thyroid hormones                  act on excitable cells.  The presentations will highlight the                   exciting recent work on (1) the modulatory action of steroid on                 amino acid receptors in the hippocampus; (2) the use of simple                  model systems as means to examine the actions of hormones on                    identified, voltage-clamped, ion currents; (3) novel hormone                    receptors; and (4) the molecular and biochemical actions of                     steroids.  These are fundamentally important questions                          in an field that is rapidly advancing and changing.  This                       Satellite Symposium offers a forum for sharing of ideas on this                 subject which may ultimately lead to breakthroughs in                           understanding the mechanisms of steroid hormone action.",
