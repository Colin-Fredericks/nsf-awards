 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305133  Andersen  The aim of this research project is to further understand  the fundamental behavior of gravity retaining walls subject  to earthquake loading; in particular, the effect of coupled  sliding and tilting on a gravity earth retaining structure  (current design practice neglects rotational motion and its  effect on earth forces); the effect of obstructed motion  (that is, a retaining wall coming in contact with a fixed  object such as a bridge abutment and a bridge deck); and  the effect of repeated loading.  The focus is on gravity  retaining walls, as these can provide the basis for  understanding more complex earth retaining systems.    The specific objectives are to:    1. Complete the data reduction and analysis of a prior  centrifuge modeling study that focused on the tilting  behavior of gravity retaining walls;    2. Conduct a new study on gravity retaining walls with dry  sand backfill that is capable of coupled sliding and  tilting, obstructed motion, and repeated loading behavior.  This involves experiments on a scale-model retaining wall  mounted on a geotechnical centrifuge which is capable of  simulating earthquake strong motions.    These studies will be used to assess the utility of  currently proposed techniques for describing coupled sliding  and tilting, obstructed  motion and repeated loading  behavior of earth retaining structures.  ***",
