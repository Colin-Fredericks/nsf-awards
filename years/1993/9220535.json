 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed studies is to identify amino acids involved             in base-specific contacts in the yeast DNA-binding protein RAP1.                The RAP1 protein is essential for viability in yeast and functions              in both regulation of transcription (as either a repressor or                   activator) and maintenance of telomere structure.  The DNA-binding              domain of RAP1 (A central 250 amino acid region) has no similarity              to known DNA binding motifs and thus may represent a novel class of             DNA binding proteins.                                                           The proposed research builds upon a genetic selection in yeast,                 based on the ability of RAP1 to activate transcription, to isolate              mutant proteins with altered DNA binding specificity (ABS mutants).             Such mutants are identified as dominant suppressors that allow a                non-consensus (mutant) binding site to function as an activation                element.  Mutant proteins whose function is specific to changes in              only one position in the binding site will then be characterized                biochemically to determine precisely their sequence specificity of              binding.  Inferences from initial suppression studies will be                   extended by alanine substitution mutagenesis of small segments of               the DNA-binding domain (-10-15 amino acids) in a systematic search              for \"missing contact\" mutants.  Results from these experiments will             be used in saturation mutagenesis experiments designed to obtain                further quantitative information concerning specific amino acid-                base contacts.                                                                  %%%                                                                             Regulation of transcription in eukaryotics is of fundamental                    importance in both development and in an organism's response to its             environment.  This study relates to the role of sequence - specific             DNA binding regulating proteins in transcriptional regulation.",
