 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317709  Sundaresan    It was proposed to provide partial support to 12 professors and   students from U. S. to participate at the Fourth International  Conference on Circulating Fluid Beds, which will be held in  Somerset, PA, during august 1-5, 1993.  The meeting will bring  together researchers from universities and  industry, almost in  equal number.  The exposure of university researchers to operating  experiences, industrial research needs, new applications and system  configurations is particularly useful because of the large gap  currently existing between applications and theory.  The peer  reviewed proceedings will be distributed to the scientific and  industrial community working in the field of circulating fluid  beds. The participants (4 professors and 8 graduate students) to be  partially supported from the NSF award are leading researchers or  do research in leading research groups.  The exposure of eight   graduate students to industrial issues and international community  will be beneficial to their training and future carrier.  ***",
