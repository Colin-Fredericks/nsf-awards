 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9350528  UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School  Newark, NJ  Gona, Ophelia      \"NJMS Summer Science Camp\"    As a means of stimulating minority youth to stay in school and  pursue careers in sciences, engineering or mathematics (SEM), a  multidisciplinary Summer Science Camp for rising ninth graders will  be established at New Jersey Medical School.  Specific objectives  address the acquisition of certain SEM skills and familiarity with  professions and professionals of these disciplines.  The camp will  provide an almost total immersion and integrated experience in SEM  for participants.  A novel, Fantastic Voyage, by Isaac Asimov, will  provide the central theme for camp activities which will include:  field trips, visits with SEM professionals, hands-on  experimentation and exploration, and computer use.  Built into the  design are activities to encourage and enhance basic skills.   Numerous opportunities will exist for campers to meet SEM  professionals.  Various activities will explore the training  necessary for SEM careers.  Parents will be active home partners in  their children's summer experience and will have opportunities to  visit the camp and take field trips with campers.  Participants  will be academically capable minority students.  Staff will include  the Director, Counselors (teachers from local high schools), and  Junior Counselors (rising college freshmen who have interest and  ability in the sciences or mathematics), all of whom will be  underrepresented minorities.  Achievement of the camp's objectives  will be assessed by techniques such as pre-and post-testing,  anecdotal records, etc.  Long-term monitoring and follow-up of  participants will be achieve by twice yearly Science Days and by  biannual communication with parents and participants for four years  following the camp experience.  Long-term goals are for  participants to graduate from high school four years after the camp  experience, to attain a grade of B or better in each of three high  school science courses an d three mathematics courses, and to be  admitted to a college at the end of high school with a major in one  of the SEM disciplines.",
