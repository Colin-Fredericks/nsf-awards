 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monmouth College is establishing a computer configured                          classroom for teaching calculus. The ACM/GLCA Calculus Reform                   in Liberal Arts Colleges and other calculus reform projects                     have produced materials which make use of mathematical                          software. The Monmouth Calculus Classroom is providing an                       setting designed to use these materials in a cooperative                        learning environment with groups of two to three students                       sharing 15 networked PCs. Students are able to interact with                    Calculus as the classroom is used in one of three modes. In a                   Lecture Mode, the professor is able to show examples to                         reinforce concepts and demonstrate solutions to problems as                     students observe the output on their monitors. The Interactive                  Mode allows students to experiment and interact with material                   while the professor supervises their work by walking around the                 classroom or from the control station. In the Reverse Control                   Mode, students share their discoveries with the class as the                    student workstation assumes the role of the control station.                    Additionally, the classroom is used as a mathematics laboratory                 in an Independent Mode. This project is providing a student                     centered learning environment which utilizes the capabilities                   of mathematical software. Equipment includes IBM/compatible 486                 student workstations and one control station, a network server,                 Novell Netware 386, a LAN bridge, Mathematica, Microsoft                        Windows, and an enhanced version of LANschool.",
