 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. David O'Connor, Mr. Matthew Adams, a                 graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, will collect                data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze material from               ongoing archaeological excavations at the site of Abydos which is               located in the Nile Valley of Upper Egypt. During previous work at              the site Dr. O'Connor discovered a group of houses which were                   destroyed by fire and not reoccupied. The result of rapid burning               was extraordinary preservation. For example, the team has uncovered             ceramic vessels with contents such as grain and figs intact. Ovens              were discovered with bread moulds and the bread within still in                 place. The site thus provides a unique opportunity to examine daily             life. In addition, large quantities of lithics, seals and ceramics              were also recovered. Mr. Adams will analyze these remains as well               as other materials from adjacent time periods to determine how                  social organization changed over time.                                                                                                                          Abydos is important because of its geographically marginal                      position. It lies at the boundary between the Upper and Lower                   Kingdoms and as centralized authority waxed and waned over time,                the political, social and economic position of Abydos was directly              affected. Mr. Adams is focussing his work on the First Intermediate             Period when centralized rule was in a decline and he wishes to                  learn what kinds of adaptations took place at a local level. He                 will examine the extent to which regional networks continued to                 exist and whether or not a hierarchical political and settlement                organization was maintained in this provincial region. He will also             examine changing economic relationships within Abydos itself to see             whether occupational specialization declined.                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons. While much is known             about how complex societies develop, archaeologists have relatively             little understanding of the reverse process when large scale units              fall apart. The work will increase our understanding of an                      important but little known site and provide data of interest to                 many archaeologists. It will also aid in the training of a                      promising young scientist.",
