 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years there has an increasing demand for the                          preparation of ultrafine magnetic oxides of uniform size which                  are mainly used in computer data storage, audio and video                       recording, magnetic fluids and fabrication of certain                           microwave devices.  The primary objective of the proposed                       research program is to synthesize nanoparticles of magnetic                     oxides using microemulsion processing and intravesicular                        precipitation.  These are unique methods which can be used to                   produce ultrafine, microhomogeneous particles with a narrow                     size distribution, which cannot be achieved by conventional                     methods such as solid-state reaction, bulk precipitation, sol-                  gel processing and spray drying.                                                                                                                                Microemulsion processing consists of the precipitation of                       precursor hydroxides or carbonates of magnetic oxides within                    the aqueous cores (typically 10 - 50 nm in size) of water-in-                   oil microemulsions.  These nanosize precursors would then be                    further processed and calcined to produce the magnetic oxides.                  Intravesicular precipitation consists of aqueous phase                          precipitation or reduction inside organically constrained                       microdomains defined by vesicles.  Each vesicle becomes a                       submicroreactor of dimensions of the order of a few hundreds                    of angstroms.  Cations trapped in the intravesicular spaces                     will react with anions permeating through the vesicle wall                      from the extravesicular region or be photolytically/chemically                  reduced to form the product.  Intravesicular coprecipitation                    as well as precipitation upon encapsulated seed particles will                  be used to create nanocomposites, opening up the possibility                    of tailoring the functionality of products by manipulating                      both their morphology and composition at a near molecular                       scale.  The results of the research would delineate the                         similarities as well as differences between the two processes                   (microemulsion processing and intravesicular precipitation) in                  relation to the mechanisms involved and the products formed in                  them.",
