 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Diane and Arlen Chase             will continue their archaeological research at the site of Caracol              located in Belize, Central America. At an altitude of over 500                  meters it is among the highest sites in the Maya lowlands. The site             was rediscovered approximately 55 years ago and until the Chases                began their project little was known about it. Survey work has                  shown the site to be quite large. The core is conservatively                    estimated at 88 square kilometers. It contains at least 10 intra-               site causeways which run outward like the spokes of a wheel from                the site core. Over 3000 structures have been recorded and the                  number is far from complete. Excavations have provided evidence of              occupation from ca 300 B.C. to ca. 1150 A.D. and it is clear that               Caracol played a major role in the Mayan prehistory of the region.              What makes the site especially interesting are the carved stelae or             written tablets which have been recovered. These permit a partial               historical reconstruction and indicate Caracol emerged victorious               in two major battles. The two principal investigators plan to focus             their efforts in one of the city's sectors and conduct survey work              as well as both trial and extensive excavation. What they wish to               do is use these data, in conjunction with other information to                  reconstruct the demographic history of the site and to search for               relationships between periods of construction and warfare.                                                                                                      While much work has been done on large Mayan sites, archaeologists              still do not know whether they functioned as true integrated                    cities, how much of them were occupied at a single moment in time,              and how their growth and development were integrated into a larger              regional and political context. The only way to answer such                     questions is through large scale, long term excavation and the                  Chases have pursued just that goal for many years. The additional               data they plan to collect will help to illumine both the history                and functioning of this major Mayan site.                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data about a major Mayan center and shed new light on the factors               which led to the rise of urban civilization.//",
