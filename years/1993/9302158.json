 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302158  Tanner       This luminescence microspectrometer will be capable of making  measurements of either photoluminescence (PL) or  electroluminescence (EL) spectra on microscopic size areas of  luminescent materials.  The instrument is built around a high-  quality optical microscope combined with two monochromators, light  sources, and detectors.  One monochromator measures the spectrum of  light emitted from the sample under study-as small a micrometer in  size-can be over the 240-800 nm range.  The sample is illuminated  by means of the second monochromator, with the illumination  wavelength independently adjustable over the same 240-800 nm range.   Thus, the instrument may be used for photoluminescence spectroscopy  by fixing the illumination wavelength, for electroluminescence  spectroscopy by blocking the illuminator and connecting the EL  sample to a voltage source, and for transmittance and reflectance  studies by scanning the monochromators together or bypassing one of  them.       The equipment will be used in several research projects in  condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, and polymer  chemistry.  In particular, it will enhance substantially two  projects for the study of luminescent properties of polymers.  One  project is developing radiation-hard scintillators for use in  particle detectors.  The luminescence micro-spectrometer will be  used to characterize the emission of light from fibers of dye-doped  polymers, to monitor spatially-distributed radiation-induced  damage, to follow recovery of damage, and to investigate  aggregation and mobility of the dopant materials.  A second project  studies the electroluminescence and photoluminescence in conjugated  polymers. These materials have applications in EL display devices.   The spectrometer requested here will be used for measuring the PL  and EL spectra of these materials, including characterizing the  effect of polymer orientation on the spectra.  Thus, this  instrument will  contribute to advancing state-of-the- art knowledge  in the development of particle detectors and light-emitting  devices.  ***",
