 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine patterns of variation in body                           form among populations of an endemic radiation of                               threespine stickleback from Cook Inlet, Alaska to test                          current models of phenotypic evolution.  Stickleback                            along the west coast of North America are of interest                           to the evolutionary biologist because of the recent                             (<22,000 years) colonization of diverse freshwater                              habitats from a marine ancestral population and                                 subsequent differentiation of trophic and locomotor                             morphology among the populations.  Body form will be                            measured using two-dimensional (x,y) coordinates of                             anatomical landmarks that permit the use of the most                            powerful methods available to describe and analyze                              shape.  Three hypotheses of a functional integration                            model will be tested: 1) patterns of genetic and                                phenotypic correlations reflect functional integration                          (i.e. suites of characters that function in concert                             should have higher correlations than functionally                               unrelated characters).  2) patterns of phenotypic                               correlation are similar among populations. 3)                                   interlocality and intralocality patterns of phenotypic                          correlations are similar.  Biomechanical models and                             trophic and locomotor performance measures will be used                         to construct a priori hypotheses to test for functional                         integration.  It is anticipated that results from this                          study will provide some of the critical empirical data                          necessary to resolve conflicting hypotheses on the role                         of constraints influencing phenotypic divergence among                          closely related populations.",
