In this research, the focus will be  on a family of eight classic experimental paradigms in cognitive  psychology.   According to the taxonomy derived from Kornblum's  recently published model, the dimensional overlap model, these  paradigms are all variants of either stimulus-stimulus and/or  stimulus-response compatibility.  Fundamental problems come to  light in the course of attempting to identify the processing  mechanisms that mediate the facilitation and interference effects  observed in performance with those tasks.  According to the model,   these effects are consequences of the dimensional overlap (i.e.,  the similarity) between the sets of stimuli and responses, and/or  the relevant and irrelevant aspects of these tasks.  The  experiments will test specific predictions of the model.  In  particular, the first experiment will test the model's predictions  concerning the effects of irrelevant dimensions in four related  paradigmatic tasks, while the second experiment will seek to  identify the limits within which the model applies in single  response tasks.  The results will not only contribute to our  understanding of the cognitive and attentional processes involved  in performance, but will enable us to assess the consequences of  varying work load in these and other similar tasks.    ***",
