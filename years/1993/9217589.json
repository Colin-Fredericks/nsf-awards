 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six faculty members of the Worcester Foundation for                             Experimental Biology request funds to purchase a                                phosphorimager. Use of this instrument would obviate the                        need for prolonged autoradiographic exposure and                                quantitation by scanning densitometry or gel slicing and                        scintillation spectrometry currently necessary for several                      of the projects discussed herein. One project (Richter)                         deals with translational control during early development.                      Cis sequences and trans binding proteins that control                           translation have been identified and their isolation and                        cloning would be facilitated by the phosphorimager. Another                     project (Baril) examines the factors involved with DNA                          replication in human cells. Detailed analysis of the                            enzymatic activities of the many factors involved in                            replication         requires the sensitivity of a                               phosphorimager. The goal of a third project      (Vallee) is                    to understand how the mechanochemical protein dynamin                           produces the force required for organelle movement. Recent                      evidence suggests that phosphorylation plays an important                       role in this process and the         phosphorimager would be                    critical for examining this posttranslational                                   modification. A fourth project (Witman) deals with the                          generation and         control of flagellar motility in                         sperm and Chlamydomonas. Phosphorylation         of dynein                      and other proteins appears to be necessary for cell                             motility, whose study would be enhanced with a                                  phosphorimager. RNA processing is studied in the fifth                          project (Pederson). The activity of some proteins in  the                       splicing apparatus is regulated by phosphorylation, which                       would be analyzed more reliably and with greater speed with                     a phosphorimager. The sixth project deals with how protein                      kinase activity in Alvsia neurons affects channel function.                     Analysis of this function would be facilitated with a                           phosphorimager.",
