 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308168  Suits  This work addresses fundamental issues of atomic and electronic  structure and the deformation mechanism in cluster-assembled  nanophase metals.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) techniques will  be applied to metallic samples prepared by consolidation of small  clusters.  These nanophase samples will have a grain size of a few  nanometers and can be up to five times stronger than the same      material with a larger grain size.  The atomic scale effect on the  nmr response and the site-selective nature of the nmr measurements  will provide a new and unique view of the structure of these  materials.  The NMR work is performed in conjunction with sample  preparation performed at Argonne National Laboratory.  %%%  Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) provides information on the  structural and electronic properties of materials as seen by  individual atoms.  Metals produced by consolidation of very small  crystalline particles (10 to 30 atoms across), referred to as  nanophase metals, have significantly enhanced mechanical properties  compared to the naturally occuring material.  This work will apply  techniques of NMR to help understand the enhanced mechanical  properties from an atomic viewpoint.  This will aid in the  development of new materials and new uses for these materials.  The  NMR work is performed in conjunction with sample preparation  performed at Argonne National Laboratory.  ***",
