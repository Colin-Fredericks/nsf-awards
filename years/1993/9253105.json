 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enantiomeric (D/L) values of amino acids preserved in the organic               matrix of molluscan fossils are used to characterize Quaternary                 stratigraphic units, and provide a basis for correlation of strata              and estimation of relative age.  D/L values increase as a function              of time (termed racemization), at a rate controlled to some extent              by post-depositional thermal history of the fossil.  Protein                    hydrolysis also exerts a rate-controlling effect on amino acid                  racemization, because amino acids on protein termini racemize                   preferentially  to those located within the protein chain.                      The extent to which hydrolysis affects D/L values preserved in                  mollusc shell protein is not well-defined.  Leaching of hydrolyzed              amino acids (primarily D-enantionmers) can affect resolution of the             amino acid racemizaton (AAR) dating method.  The focus of this work             is how the physical and chemical condition of fossil mollusc shell              protein affects resolution of the AAR method.  Fossil organic                   matrix will be studied using molecular weight separation methods                to define \"resistant\" versus \"labile\" components.  Enantiomeric                 values will be determined in each component using HPLC methods, to              understand the influence of hydrolysis on diagenetic racemization.              Physical evidence of leaching will be observed using scanning                   electron microscopy.  This study will focus primarily of molluscan              fauna from Quaternary units of the southern High Plains, which                  represent a long geologic record during which protein diagenesis                can be studied.",
