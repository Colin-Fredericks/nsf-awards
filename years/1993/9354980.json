 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354980  Tlusty    The Machine Tool Research Center (MTRC) at the University of  Florida will establish a three phase Machine Tool Research Graduate  Traineeship program designed to lead students from the B.S. to the  Ph.D. in a five year period.  During the first phase of the  program, the students will concentrate on coursework.  They will  identify an area of research interest and complete a non-thesis  Master's research project which will serve as the basis for their  eventual doctoral research.  Following the completion of the M.S.  degree in the second year, the students will enter the second phase  of the traineeship which consists of a one-year, off campus  internship at an industrial site or an internationally recognized  research lab.  The internship will be arranged carefully to  coincide with the student's research area.  Following the  internship, the trainees will return to the MTRC to concentrate on  their doctoral research.    The NSF Machine Tool Research Traineeships will be nationally  advertised.  Particular emphasis in recruitment will be placed on  women, minorities and the disabled.  Institutions which are the  leading producers of women, minority, and disabled B.S. level  Mechancial or Manufacturing Engineering graduates will be  identified.  MTRC faculty will make recruiting visits to at least  four of these institutions.  Eight of the most promising candidates  identified will be invited to visit the UF campus to meet with MTRC  faculty and students at departmental expense.    Recent expnsion of the MTRC necessitates an increase in the number  of graduate students.  The Mechanical Engineering department is  currently restructuring its graduate programs to place an increased  emphasis on the Ph.D. degree.  The Machine Tool Research Graduate  Traineeship program will allow the MTRC to significantly increase  its Ph.D. productivity.  ***",
