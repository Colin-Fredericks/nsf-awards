 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316015  Aupperle      This proposal requests $586,000 for twelve months to establish a  node (\"CNSS\") on the ANSNET Backbone at Albuquerque, with tail  circuits to end-nodes (\"ENSS\") at Phillips and SNLA.               Funding for this effort is being provided entirely by the Air Force  and the Department of Energy.    Since the traffic to be carried over this segment of the ANSNET  Backbone is entirely for the purposes of research and education  consistent with the NSFNET Backbone Services Acceptable Use Policy,  full connectivity will be established with the rest of the NSFNET;  the node in Albuquerque becomes therefore essentially another  connection for the NSFNET Backbone Service.    IN addition to supporting the open networking needs of its sponsors  (USAF and DoE), this project is intended to be used by New Mexico's  higher education, pre-college, and informal education communities  to support the general  goals of the National Research and  Education Network (NREN) program; it is also consistent with  Presidential and Congressional intent for the National Information  Infrastructure.",
