 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop computationally efficient, robust,               affine-equivariant estimators of multivariate location and shape                for use in multivariate analysis and for identification of high                 leverage points in robust regression.  This problem has proved to               be computationally quite challenging---reliable solutions were                  possible with previous methods only for small samples and low                   dimension.  We have developed methods that greatly increase the                 effectiveness of these procedures and propose to develop these                  methods further, including the adaptation to massively parallel                 architectures.  The goal, which seems to be in reach, is to                     obtain reliable, estimates in a few seconds, compared to the many               hours of computation time now required.                                              The detection of unusual observations and clusters of                      observations is an important part of any effective statistical                  analysis.  Such observations may be mistakes or may represent                   important new phenomena.  For data that consists of many                        simultaneous measurements, this goal has to date been out of                    reach of the best statistical methods.  We have developed                       techniques that make this goal practical, and, under this                       project, we will further develop them, together with their                      computer implementations.",
