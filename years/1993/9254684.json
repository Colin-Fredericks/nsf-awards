The traveling version will consist of:  an introductory panel;                  16 Easy-View microscopes exhibiting living microbes; units                      dealing with size, scale and magnification; two interactive                     computer programs entitled \"Understanding AIDS\" and \"How Your                   Body Fights Disease\"; a video microscope for the Microscopic                    Life demonstration; units on virusesand bacteria; a mosaic of                   color transparencies of different microorganisms; one Optech                    (BYOB) interactive video microscope; three zoetropes                            illustrating mcrobial movement; and a mini-laboratory room                      containing all the equipment and materials necessary for                        maintaining the exhibit and presenting the MICROLAB workshops                   to students and teachers.  The 1,500 square foot exhibit will                   travel to nine sites over three years.                                                                                                                          The new York Hall of Science will provide on-site training in                   estasblishing and maintaining the exhibit, a weekly shipment                    of microrganisms and supporting materials, an exhibit catalog,                  an 11-minute video featuring living microbes, pre- and post-                    visit materisla for schools with suggested activities , and                     programs for student and teacher workshops.  A novel feature                    of this traveling exhibition will be the opportunity for the                    host museum to retain, on a cost-share basis, the mini-                         laboratory with its equipment and four Easy-View microscopes                    which can become the core of a microbiology program.
