 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ascorbic acid is maintained in some mammalian tissue cells at                   concentrations almost 20-fold higher than in plasma.  In the                    mammalian system, ascorbate exists in either of two states;                     ascorbic acid, the reduced form, which may autooxidize to produce               dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA).  DHAA is toxic, and when it is taken               up by cells, it is stored intracellularly in the reduced form.  The             mechanism of DHAA reduction to ascorbic acid inside cells is not                clear. DHAA may be reduced nonenzymatically by a variety of -SH                 containing compounds, such as reduced glutathione, glutathione                  together with NADPH, or NADPH alone. In some cells, however, the                rate of DHAA reduction to ascorbic acid is 2-5 times above the rate             of the glutathione-dependent chemical reduction reaction.  This                 suggests that a specific DHAA-ascorbic acid reduction system may be             at work in some cells.  In this laboratory, unique reducing                     activities have been detected in at least one type of tissue.                   Preliminary data indicate that DHAA-reduction activities are                    attributable to at least two separate proteins; one protein appears             in the cytosol and the other is membrane associated.  In the                    present proposal we will attempt to isolate and characterize the                action and synthetic regulation these presumptive DHAA-reduction                proteins and determine their role in normal cell function.                      %%%                                                                             Ascorbic acid is as important compound in animal cells.  However,               on the way to the cells, ascorbic acid may react with oxygen and                form a toxic derivative called dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA).  To                 protect themselves, when the cells take up DHAA, it is converted to             ascorbic acid.  The question arises whether ascorbic acid is formed             from DHAA by a chemical reaction inside cells, or whether there is              a specific enzyme system the causes the reaction to occur.  The                 latter case may be correct, because some cells can convert DHAA at              a faster rate than can be explained by just an ordinary chemical                reaction.  Preliminary results in this laboratory suggest that two              proteins do exist in certain cells, which may form a system to                  change DHAA to ascorbic acid.  One protein exists in the cell                   cytoplasm and the other one seems to be bound to cell membrane                  material.  We will try to purify these two proteins and determine               how they operated to change DHAA into ascorbic acid.  We will also              try to determine what causes the cell to form these proteins and                whether they are important for the cell to have.",
