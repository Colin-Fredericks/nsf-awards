 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309805  Holekamp    Drs. Holekamp and Smale will continue their field study of behavioral development in free-  living spotted hyenas.  Their goals are (1) to initiate study of the hormonal correlates of  aggressive and sexual behaviors in this species as these change at puberty and during adult  breeding cycles, and (2) to evaluate effects of social rank on reproduction.  The animals  being studied are members of one large hyena clan in the Masai Mara National Reserve,  Kenya.  Age, sex, kin relations, and social status are known for all clan members, and  detailed social histories are known for all cubs and subadults currently present in the  population.    Using observational study, radio telemetry, and laboratory analyses of hormone levels in  various biological fluids produced by the study animals, Drs. Holekamp and Smale will  collect longitudinal behavioral and hormonal data from both pubertal and adult animals.   Endocrine and behavioral data will be used together to test hypotheses about mechanisms by  which social rank influences reproductive performance.  While the study of reproduction is  being initiated, observational and telemetric data-collection will also continue germane to  understanding both male dispersal and reproductive success in both sexes.    This research project will generate useful information in at least four ways:  It will (1)  contribute importantly to elucidation of carnivore reproductive biology, (2) provide detailed  data on behavioral development and reproductive endocrinology of animals experiencing the  full complexity of their natural habitat, (3) enhance understanding of the relationship between  hormones and aggressive behavior in female mammals, and (4) yield valuable comparative  data revealing how physiological, developmental, functional, and phylogenetic factors interact  to shape mammalian social behavior.",
