 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czechoslovakia Joint Fund award is for research on                    \"Semantics of English and Czech\" by Dr. Eva Hajicova of the                     Institute for Formal & Applied Linguistics, Charles University,                 Prague, in cooperation with Dr. Barbara H. Partee of the                        University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  The researchers will focus                on theoretical and descriptive issues in the comparative semantics              of English and Czech, particularly the relation between formal                  semantic structure and informational structure.  The collaboration              builds on prior work by Hajicova and her colleagues in Prague on                topic-focus articulation and functional sentence perspective, and by            Partee and her colleagues in the U.S. on cross-linguistic semantics             of quantification and related issues in formal semantics.  One                  central issue to be investigated is the extent to which theoretical             differences between the approaches to semantics developed in the                two countries may partially reflect differences in those aspects of             meaning and information structure that are grammaticized in                     English and Czech.  Results would have important consequences                   for semantic theory and semantic typology, as well as practical                 benefits for both traditional and computational applications in the             domains of translation, pedagogy, and information retrieval.                                                                                                    This research in linguistics fulfills the program objective of                  advancing science by enabling leading experts in the United States              and Czechoslovakia to combine complementary talents and pool                    research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                       competence.",
