 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economy-wide fluctuations of employment investment and output can               occur because of the way information flows in the economy, and                  the incentives individuals have to restrict those flows.  This                  phenomenon is studied by bringing together mathematical building                blocks developed separately in the investigator's earlier work.                 The first building block uses contract theory to show how                       information flows in asset markets.  The second building block                  uses contract theory to show how feedback of information about                  economy-wide fluctuations of output flows to individuals.                                                                                                       The novel element in this research is that a theory of assets is                embedded in a rational expectations based model of aggregate                    fluctuations.  This permits the investigator to study long                      standing questions about the relationship between asset behavior                and business cycle fluctuations.  Joining the two building blocks               causes spillover effects in the form of economy-wide                            fluctuations-the business cycle-that cause asset markets to                     function less efficiently than they would in the absence of the                 fluctuations.  Despite their adverse effect on asset markets, the               fluctuations might nevertheless be desirable, and it might also                 be desirable that the fluctuations be long lasting, because they                improve the flow of information.",
