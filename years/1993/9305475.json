Spontaneous mutations arise  from a multiplicity of kinds of errors, whose properties are  largely undefined.  Among spontaneous frameshift mutations, only a  fraction of frameshift sequence changes can be mechanistically  described in the most general way; the basis of the remainder is  totally unknown,  In these unexplained cases, no model connects the  mutations to the specific DNA context in which they arise and no  dependence on a specific enzyme, metabolic process or DNA damage is  yet identified.  Low frequencies of spontaneous mutations have led  some to think of their patterns of occurrence as random.  However,  when mechanistic studies have identified underlying causes,  mutagenesis specificity has been found to be nonrandom and to  directly reflect characteristics of the underlying mutational  mechanism.  Spontaneous frameshift spectra are complex because  multiple mechanisms contribute to the total.  The particularly  powerful genetics and frameshift detection system of the  bacteriophage T4, coupled with complementary in vitro approaches,  have been successfully used to separate and characterize distinct  frameshift mechanisms.  This work is presently incomplete.   Identifiable subsets of frameshift specificities have not yet been  studied and thus, remain mechanistically unexplained.  Previous  work has demonstrated that mutagenic specificity can be related to  the specificity of the enzymes participating in mutagenesis and /or  to non-standard DNA structures associated with particular DNA  sequences.  This research investigates the enzymology and DNA  structures involved in spontaneous frameshift mutagenesis  associated preferentially with palindromic DNA sequences.  We are examining the molecular basis of frequent frameshift arising  spontaneously in vivo, focusing on frameshifts arising at the bases  of DNA hairpins.  Our attention was drawn to this context  by two  observation: (1) spontaneous +2 bp and -2bp frameshifts share this  context feature, but no other context previously recognized as  associated with high frequencies of frameshift, and (2) the  serendipitous discovery of a new hotspot for 2bp duplications  associated with a local context change which produced a hairpin.  We will use DNA sequence manipulation to confirm the relationship  between frameshift hotspots and their hairpin contexts.  We will  also use frameshift mutagenesis in the hotspots as a specific assay  for identifying the enzyme(s) involved in this type of spontaneous  mutagenesis.  If a clear association of frameshift hotpots with DNA  hairpins is demonstrated a major hypothesis to be tested is whether  the frameshift specificity in vivo arises because the DNA hairpin  stems, analogues of DNA recombination intermediates, serve as  substrates for misprocessing by the T-4encoded Holliday-junction  resolvase in a manner that leads to frameshifts.  %%%  This research will contribute to our understanding of how mutations  occurs in the absence of agents known to damage DNA.  ***",
