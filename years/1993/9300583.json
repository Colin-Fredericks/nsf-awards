 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental study for assessment of the applicability of laser-             induced second harmonic generation (SHG) for measurement of                     temperatures of hot metallic surfaces will be carried out.  The                 immediate goal of this research is to obtain sufficient data to                 either eliminate SHG as a candidate diagnostic or create further                interest in the development of SHG thermometry.  In this study, the             main surface of interest will be platinum (rough and polished                   surfaces) deposited on a tantalum or ceramic substrate.  Three                  separate research tasks will be performmed.  First, a repeatable                calibration plot of SHG signal versus temperature at surface                    temperatures from 300 to 1000 K will be sought using samples heated             in an electric furnace, with (hopefully) demonstration that the                 relative SHG signal is independent of surface roughness.  Next, the             calibration plot will be extended to 1800 K in either a high-                   temperature furnace or a combustion environment.  Finally, dynamic              response of the SHG measurement technique will be investigated.                                                                                                 The ultimate goal of the proposed research direction is development             of SHG thermometry for practical high-temperature applications in               the fields of combustion, heat transfer, and materials processing,              with particular application to on-line control of manufacturing                 facilities.",
