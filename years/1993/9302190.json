 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with an analytical and experimental                 study of friction in machine tools. The experimental aspects                    include the design and fabrication of a double-shear friction                   apparatus for active control of both sliding velocity and normal                force, and the collection of data at the friction interface for a               variety of materials and lubricants. The analytical component of                the research project utilizes the test data for developing history-             dependent friction models. There models are used to study the                   design and analysis of controllers for high-fidelity motion,                    including the development of stability  criteria, and design of                 model-based and adaptive compensators. These models are applied to              the design and performance evaluation of passive and active                     friction dampers and structural joints. Analytical techniques such              as perturbation theory and nonlinear dynamical system theory are                used. The results of this research lead to a better understanding               of low-velocity motion control such as required for high-precision              machines in manufacturing, and improvements in the performance of               friction dampers used in turbo  machinery and damping joints used               in flexible structures.***    //",
