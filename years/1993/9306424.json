Specifically, crystalline esterase and lipase enzymes will be crosslinked with glutaraldehyde to  form immobilized enzyme particles which can be lyophilized and stored. These CLECs will  remain catalytically active and retain their mechanical integrity under harsh manufacturing  conditions. CLEC particles are individual crystals and will not require inert support structures.  Their well-defined facets will promote the formation of monodisperse suspensions that will  facilitate the scale-up of enzyme-based processes to commercial volumes, particularly in organic  solvents. The research will focus on CLECs of lipase and esterase enzymes used by the chemical  industry in the manufacture of chiral intermediates and pharmaceuticals.  %%%  This SBIR Phase II project will continue the advances initially started in the Phase I studies. An  important goal of the SBIR Program is the ultimate conversion of NSF-supported research into  technological innovation and commercialization.  ***",
