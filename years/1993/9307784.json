 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307784  Stanish    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Charles Stanish will  continue his archaeological research in the Lake Titicaca Basin of  Southern Peru. The work focuses on the Lupaqa, a prehistoric group  which survived into early historic times and was described in  Spanish chronicles. The Lupaqa consist of a distinct, spatially  limited, regional group which maintained its identity although it  was conquered by and incorporated into successive Tiwanaku and Inca  empires. Building on his prior work, Dr. Stanish will expand his  survey for sites and will excavate several of them. On this basis  he will reconstruct how this group developed and responded to  influences from the broader Andean region.    Archaeologists wish to understand how large complex entities such  as empires expand and maintain their control over subject  populations. There is much disagreement about the extent to which  direct force of arms is involved and the strategies used not only  to establish but also to maintain power. Because the Lupaqa  constitute such a \"marginal\" group and because they were  consecutively incorporated into two such kingdoms they provide an  excellent context in which to examine this issue.    This research is important for several reasons. The basic forces  which shaped Andean prehistory are evident in the world today. Many  countries consist of diverse ethnic groups brought together under  a strong central rule. An archaeological case such as the Lupaqa  permits one to examine the interplay of central and regional forces  over a long period of time.  ***",
