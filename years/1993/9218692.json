The University is committed to providing the remaining              funds needed.                                                                        The new X-ray diffractometer will replace an obsolete twenty-              year old unit. The characterization of materials by X-ray                       diffraction is a routine requirement in the research projects and               teaching curricula of the departments of Geology, Chemistry and                 Forensic Sciences, as well as the School of Civil, Mechanical and               Environmental Engineering and the Materials Sciences Section at                 George Washington University. The X-ray diffractometer will also                be accessible to regional users including undergraduate students                from the University of the District of Columbia and research groups             from the Smithsonian Institution.",
