 "awd_abstract_narration": "A preliminary study of the insitu heating behavior of single-                   crystal cubes of 100-300 nm MgO smoke particles has shown that the              stability of neck formed between 2 sintering single-crystal cubes               is directly related to the contact geometry of the particles.  This             research project is a logical extension of the initial MgO cube                 study.  It will focus on the following objectives:  determination               of the specific mechanism(s) responsible for mass transport in                  vacuum heated, sub-micron-sized MgO single crystal cubes; insitu                TEM heating studies of coalescence and material transport in                    isolated pairs of nanoscale, single crystal, spherical particles of             ceramic oxides; insitu heating studies of larger arrays of                      nanoscale particles; and exsitu heating studies to examine the                  effects of the sintering atmosphere on neck morphology and                      stability.  The neck instabilities observed in the preliminary                  studies have never before been observed or predicted.  This                     research will develop our understanding of this phenomena, and                  further insitu experiments are likely to lead to additional new                 insights into the sintering of fine particles.                                                                                                                  Interactive activities at the host institution include:  organizing             and teaching two new courses (one course will study noncrystalline              solids by examining both bulk and thin-film glasses, and the other              course will be an engineering/technology survey course for non-                 engineers, based on materials science topics); and participation as             a discussion leader in Women in Science and Engineering, an                     organization for women undergraduates.                                                                                                                          This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
