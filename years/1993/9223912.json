 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of primatologists contend that primate and human                  intelligence evolved in the context of exploiting \"patchily\"                    distributed, high quality food, such as fruits, as against                      leaves. Among primates, species that rely on patchy resources do                exhibit larger brains relative to body size than those that rely                on evenly distributed foods.  This relationship suggests that the               distribution of food has been important in the evolution of                     increased brain size and its presumed cognitive correlates.                     However, the extent to which primates exhibit particular                        cognitive skills adapted to specific foraging problems rather                   than a general purpose intelligence suited to a broad range of                  tasks, is still open to investigation.                                                                                                                               This dissertation project will investigate the relationship                of dietary preferences and spatial memory in two primate species.               The graduate student will compare a leaf eating and a fruit                     eating prosimian is a series of sophisticated laboratory tests                  involving spatial memory - defined as their ability to find and                 relocate objects in space (the fruit eaters should be superior).                Then, the species will be tested for non-spatial memory, where                  they would not be expected to differ.  Finally, experiments have                been devised which may examine the mechanisms underlying spatial                memory in the different species.",
