Using a                        virtual reality environment of the human cell, they will                        test to determined:  1) if people gain a physical                               understanding of the human cell, including a sense of scale,                    the shape and location of elements, and the physical                            relationship between elements, and 2) if people gain an                         understanding of the concept of a system by interacting in                      the virtual world of the human cell.                                                                                                                            The PI will be David Greschler, Exhibit Developer at the                        Museum.  He has developed two major exhibits at the Museum,                     has worked at the MIT Media Laboratory, and has taught                          educational software design at the Harvard Graduate School                      of Education.  Eben Gay will be co-PI and will have                             oversight for the software development of the virtual                           reality.  He has been Principal Engineer at Digital                             Equipment Corporation since 1980 and has been building                          virtual realities since 1982.",
