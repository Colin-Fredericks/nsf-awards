 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Argentina Cooperative Science award                                     supports the collaboration of Hugo Ernst of the                                 Georgia Institute of Technology and Eduardo                                     Asta of the National Technological University                                   in Argentina.  The project aims to better                                       understand the phenomenon of crack growth in                                    the presence of extensive plasticity, using                                     nonlinear fracture mechanics methods.                                                                                                                           The researchers seek to improve methods of                                      fracture toughness tests, study proposed                                        parameters for toughness characterization and                                   their limitations, assess effects of specimen                                   size and constraint, describe fracture past the                                 fracture mechanics regime, and determine                                        relations between microstructural                                               characteristics and mechanical properties.  The                                 project will be comprised of testing, analysis                                  of experimental data, and analytical studies.                                   Two Argentine groups besides Asta's will                                        participate:  one led by Dario Jinchuk of the                                   Institute for Nondestructive Evaluation, the                                    other by Juan Perez Ipina of the University of                                  Comahue.  The Argentine side will benefit from                                  exchange with US researchers working at the                                     frontier of fracture mechanics methodology.                                     The US side will gain knowledge about the                                       application of fracture mechanics methods and                                   access to large experimental data banks that                                    are increasingly expensive to obtain in the US.                                 Both sides will accrue expertise in structural                                  reliability under severe                                                        loadings, causing crack growth under elastic                                    plastic conditions.",
