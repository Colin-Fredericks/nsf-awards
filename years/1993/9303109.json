 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Boxer of Stanford University will use Stark effect                    spectroscopy to investigate charge-transfer processes in simple                 molecules, with support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                   Organometallic Chemistry Program.  The technique entails                        subjecting the sample (a thin film containing the molecule of                   interest) to a high and variable electric field, and observing                  the effect of the field on the absorption or emission of light.                  Characteristic lineshapes are obtained that yield information                  regarding the relationship between the transition dipole and                    the molecular axes.  Processes to be investigated include LMCT                  transitions, intramolecular electron transfer reactions, proton                 transfer reactions, and vibrational transitions.  Of particular                 interest is the influence of driving force on electron transfer                 rates.  Molecules to be investigated include coordination                       complexes such as tris(bipyradyl)ruthenium(II) ion and related                  mixed-valence species, covalently-linked                                        benzophenone/naphthalene derivatives, porphyrin/quinone                         species, certain rhenium complexes, and bromobenzene.  This new                 technique should add an important new dimension in the                          understanding of molecular dynamics.                                            %%%                                                                             A particularly nettlesome problem is to understand the flow of                  charge within molecules.  For example, if a molecule absorbs a                  photon of visible light, how do the electrons within the                        molecule respond spatially?  Professor Boxer has developed a                    potentially powerful new technique, called Stark effect                         spectroscopy, to answer such questions.  Essentially, the                       molecules are subjected to high electric fields while their                     interactions with light are measured.  The results to be                        obtained will reveal how different parts of a molecule                          \"communicate\" and will improve understanding of the                             charge-separation processes so important in photosynthesis and                  related phenomena.",
