 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Royer will use a combination of steady-state and time-resolved              fluorescence spectroscopy in order to study the effect of amino                 acid substitution on the high pressure denaturation and native and              denatured state dynamics of staphylococcal nuclease (Snase).  Dr.               Royer will characterize the contributions of the exposure of                    hydrophobic surface area in the denatured state and internal                    cavities and proline cis/trans isomerization in the native state to             the pressure stability, internal dynamics and function of the                   protein.  Three categories of mutant Snases will be investigated;               1) mutants which exhibit large changes in the cooperativity of                  unfolding by guanidine hydrochloride; 2) cavity mutants, in which               large hydrophobic residues have been replaced by alanine or                     glycine; and 3) mutants in which the native stat cis/trans                      isomerization about the peptide bond preceding proline 117 has been             altered or mutants in which the number of proline residues has been             altered.  For the third class of mutants Dr. Royer will perform                 kinetic studies of the pressure denaturation/renaturation                       reactions.  Finally, she will use time-resolved and steady-state                fluorescence intensity, energy and anisotropy measurements to                   characterize the native and denatured states of all three classes               of mutants.  These results will be correlated to the enzymatic                  activity of these proteins.                                                     %%%                                                                             Proteins are increasingly being used in many areas of                           biotechnology.  It has become apparent for a number of reasons that             the industrial uses of proteins would benefit from a better                     understanding of the structural and dynamic factors affecting the               stability and function of the protein.  For example, it would be of             interest to be able to design proteins which were more heat and                 pressure stable, yet with similar or even enhanced functional                   properties.  It is the object of the research in the present                    proposal to study three categories of single amino acid mutants of              SNase, a small well-characterized enzyme which catalyzes the                    hydrolysis of ribo and deoxyribonucleotides.  Its three dimensional             structure is known from X-ray crystallographic studies.  By                     examining the high pressure equilibrium and kinetic denaturation                profiles of three classes of mutant SNase proteins Dr. Royer will               be able to identify any correlations between the three dimensional              packing of the native proteins, the characteristics of their                    unfolding states, their dynamic properties, their stability and                 their enzymatic activity.  It is hoped that determining the effect              of amino-acid substitution on these properties of the protein will              help to develop guidelines for engineering more efficient and                   effective proteins for a large number of biotechnological                       applications.",
