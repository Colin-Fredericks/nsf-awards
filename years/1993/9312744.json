 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act                        (RCRA), effective 9 October 1993, sets new minimum design                       standards for Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Facilities                         (MSWLF); requiring design of these facilities for a peak                        horizontal ground acceleration with a probability of                            exceedance of 10 percent in 250 years.  The seismic response                    of MSWLF has received very little study and is poorly                           understood.  Little guidance is available for an engineer on                    the performance of these facilities during strong ground                        shaking.  With the introduction of these Federal standards,                     the seismic design of landfills has taken on increased                          significance.                                                                                                                                                   The objective of this project is to measure insitu the small                    strain shear wave velocity profile at MSWLF to depths of 25                     to 30 meters, at 6 MSWLF sites in the Los Angeles basin,                        using the spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW)                             technique.  The sites are chosen to provide a representative                    spectrum of the conditions likely to be encountered in                          practice.  SASW is a non-intrusive geophysical measurement                      technique which is ideal for use at landfills, as it                            eliminates the health and safety problems associated with                       the soil borings required for conventional cross hole and                       down hole shear wave velocity measurements.  For this                           research, a unique large mass Controlled Source Spectral                        Analysis of Surface Waves (CSSASW) device will be used.                                                                                                         The shear wave velocity profiles that result from this                          research program will be an invaluable aid to engineers and                     scientists analyzing the seismic response of MSWLF.",
