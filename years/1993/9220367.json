 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to understand the origin of                       luminescence in porous silicon, and to explore the relationship                 between luminescence and surface chemistry of this material.  The               first goal will be achieved by testing the three current hypotheses             explaining photoluminescence in porous silicon.  The second goal                will be achieved by observing the changes that occur in emission                intensity, wavelength, and lifetimes on exposure of the materials               to various chemical reagents such as Lewis acids or bases,                      electron, hole, or energy transfer agents, and polar or polarizable             species.  The mechanism of luminescence quenching of porous silicon             by gas phase species will be studied.  The silicon surface                      chemistry will by developed by tuning the quenching response for                specific adsorbates.                                                                                                                                            The unique ability of porous silicon to change its fluorescence                 color and intensity in the presence of chemical adsorbates opens up             a range of possible application for gas, liquid, and biological                 sensors.  In addition, an understanding of the fundamental                      photophysics of porous silicon under these conditions may lead to               the development of full-color flat panel electroluminescence                    displays.  these potential development can build on well-                       established silicon processing technology.  The key contribution of             the proposed work is that it will define the chemical and                       photochemical reactivity patterns of luminescent porous silicon,                providing the design rules for the development of such                          applications.",
