 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305178  Collmer  The hypersensitive response (HR) of higher plants is characterized  by the rapid, localized death of plant cells at the site of  invasion by an \"incompatible\" pathogen (a microorganism that causes  disease only in another plant) and is associated with resistance  against many nematodes, fungi viruses and bacteria.  Elicitation of  the HR by Pseudomonas syringae and other plant pathogenic bacteria  is controlled by hrp genes, which are also required for the  multiplication and pathogenicity of these bacteria in their  respective host plants.  The overall goal of the research is to use  two recent advances to dissect the functions of the hrp genes and  to determine the general basis for the phenotypic dependence of avr  genes on hrp genes.  We expect that (i) harpins are needed for P.  syringae strains to initiate a metabolically active interaction  with the plant, (ii) HrpH and several other Hrp proteins are needed  for the secretion of harpin, (iii) harpin production must be  carefully regulated for successful pathogenesis, and (iv) Avr  proteins depend on the Hrp secretion system and/or harpin to  produce their phenotypes.  The work will involve potentially three  strains of P. syringae: (i) P.s. syringae 61, whose cloned cluster  of hrp genes has been extensively characterized and is unique in  that, it functions in nonpathogens like E. coli. (ii) P.s. glycinea  race 4, which becomes incompatible with Rpg1 soybean cultivars upon  acquisition of the cloned avrB gene, and (iii) P.s. tomato DC3000,  whose compatibility with Arabidopsis thaliana is reversed by  acquisition of avrB.  Early work on the project will determine  whether P.s. glycinea race 4 or P.s. tomato DC3000 will be the  focus of work on Avr protein function.  We intend to (1)  Characterize the P.s. syringae 61 hrpZ gene and the encoded harpin  with respect to primary sequence, elicitor-active domains, and  subcellular location.  (2) Determine the relative effects of hrpH  and hrpZ mutations on the initial interac tion of P.s. syringae 61  with bean and tobacco (or of P.s. tomato DC3000 with A. thaliana or  of P.s. glycinea race 4 with soybean). (3) Clone and characterize  the P.s. glycinea race 4 (or P.s. tomato DC3000) hrpZ gene,  construct derivatives that are deficient in harpin overproduce  harpin produce harpin instead of harpin or contain a hrpZ promoter-  uida fusion in trans; determine the phenotype of these derivatives  (with or without an avrB+ plasmid) on tobacco and differential host  cultivars.  %%%   Because homologs of Hrp secretion proteins are present in some  animal pathogens, successful testing of these hypothesis should  have a broad impact on research addressing bacterial pathogenicity.  ***",
