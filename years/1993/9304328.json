Dynamic adsorption is important in  foam-based separations of toxic or useful chemicals from  dilute solutions.  It is also important in coasting flows,  pesticide spray efficiency, downstream bioprocessing of  hydrophobic molecules, and in lung surfactant formulations for  treating the respiratory distress syndrome of premature  infants.  The objectives are to study how different kinds of  molecular interactions of various surfactants and proteins  affect the competitive adsorption behavior.  Dynamic surface  tensions area measured either at constant area or at pulsating  area conditions.  Surface adsorption densities are estimated  from surface electrical potential measurements, from using  radiotracers, and from sampling the surface monolayers by the  use of Langmuir-Blodgett deposition method.  Moreover, an  apparatus is being built for probing dynamic concentration  profiles.  The results are correlated with transport-  adsorption description models and are used in interpreting  foam - concentration and foam fractionation experiments of  octanol, sodium dodecylsulfate, bovine serum albumin,  lysozyme, and other molecules.  Finally, hexadecanol,  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, tyloxapol, and SP-A, SP-B, and  SP-C (lung specific proteins) are studied for their importance  in lung surfactant formulations.",
