The goal of the workshop is to improve retention of  women in the engineering program by offering them some skills needed to succeed in their first  engineering course.    The workshop is to be be conducted in the summer of 1994.  Approximately 30 women are  expected to participate.  Experiences planned for the workshop will help students to develop  visualization skills, become familiar with engineering terminology, and exercise problem solving  skills.  Meetings will women engineers and more senior engineering students will help  participants prepare for success in engineering.  Materials and lesson plans for the workshop will  be developed during the 1993-94 academic year by members of the Ohio State University  Engineering Graphics faculty with the support of the women in Engineering Program and the  College of Engineering.  Success of the workshop will be assessed by measuring the student's  performance in their first engineering graphics course and calculating the retention rate for  participants.  ***",
