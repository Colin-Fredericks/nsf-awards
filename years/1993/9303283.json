 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simple ecological models have been used by ecologists to                   understand how interactions such as density-dependence affect                   population dynamics.  These relatively elementary models ignore the             spatial aspect of populations.  This research will contribute to                the understanding of how spatial processes influence population                 dynamics.  Cellular automata models of populations that assume that             each individual exists in a unique location and that competition is             occurring over some predefined local scale will be developed.  How              local competitive interactions translate into spatial and temporal              dynamics and what general class of patterns (stable, cyclical, or               chaotic) are expected for competing populations distributed in                  space will be determined.  Conditions under which dispersal and                 competition can lead to coexistence in a spatially distributed                  system will be examined, as will the problem of how differences in              competitive scale and dispersal scale influence the patterns.                   Simple models have already yielded important insights into how                  intra- and interspecific competition can produce chaotic spatial                dynamics.  These models for single species and two species will be              generalized to models for multiple species.                                     %%%                                                                             Overall, results from this work ought to enhance our knowledge of               how local competitive interactions translate into spatial and                   temporal dynamics.  It will ascertain what general class of                     patterns can be expected for competing populations that are                     distributed in space.  In addition, it will determine the                       conditions under which dispersal and competition can lead to                    coexistence in a spatially distributed system and will examine how              differences in scale impacts patterns within populations and                    ecological communities.  Such information will be useful in                     learning how often we should expect chaotic spatial dynamics in                 natural systems.  By intensively studying two important variables               (competition and dispersal), it will be possible to discover what               patterns are most likely in spatially distributed populations.",
