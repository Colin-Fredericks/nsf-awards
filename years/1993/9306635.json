 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306635  Renardy       The proposal addresses a number of problems in the  mathematical analysis of viscoelastic and multilayer flows and  encompasses three components: i) the development of a rigorous  mathematical foundation for the analysis of instabilities and  bifurcations in viscoelastic flows.  The issues to investigate  include the connection between linear stability and spectrum, and  the existence of center manifolds which allow the reduction of  the dynamics to ODEs.  While these issues are well understood in  Newtonian fluid dynamics, very little is known in viscoelastic  fluids; ii) the study of instabilities and qualitative dynamics  of fluid interfaces.  Previous work in the area has been  concerned with linear stability and \"simple\" bifurcations.  The  proposed research will concern more complicated bifurcations,  such as sideband instabilities, and situations where several  unstable modes coexist; iii) the study of flow problems with open  boundaries.  Such open boundaries arise from truncation of flow  domains for numerical purposes. The proposed research is aimed at  addressing questions relating to open boundaries in viscoelastic  flows, and the possibility of artificial instabilities resulting  from the presence of open boundaries.  A graduate student will  work on the existence of steady flows for model equations  resulting from kinetic theories of polymer solutions.       The proposed research is aimed at further developing the  mathematical theory of the flow of polymeric liquids, as well as  multilayer flows.  Such flows are important in many industrial  processing operations. The results of the proposed research will  be helpful in developing a better qualitative understanding of  such flows and in developing methods for their numerical  simulation.  The research focusses in particular on the study of  instabilities, i.e. qualitative changes in the nature of the flow  when certain parameters are changed, and on problems introduced  by artificial boundaries which arise w hen the flow domain is  truncated for numerical purposes.  ***",
