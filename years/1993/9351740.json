This project involves the  implementation of scientific equipment for developing a cross-  disciplinary controls laboratory. The objective is twofold:  first, to broaden the horizon of electrical engineering  students and further their understanding of multidisciplinary  problems; second, to equally satisfy the desire of a cross-  departmental student body in grasping realization concepts. The  requested equipment, usually found in typical industrial  processes, is used to design three work cells; an engine-  generator system, a robot arm mechanism, and a variable speed  AC drive with simulated fan/pump loads. The applications  contribute in a coherent way to the understanding of  fundamental concepts in feedback control, systems modeling and  analysis, and instrumentation and data acquisition. EE and ME  students indiscriminately are asked to look at both the  electrical and mechanical engineering aspects of the system. To  bridge the gap between EE and ME in a non-superficial way, the  students  work in groups and at their own pace on small  projects. Many schools may find the developed experiments and  facility of special interest by combining departmental  resources and providing an effective controls education. The  experiments will be documented and made available to other  schools, and the outcomes will be communicated in professional  society coferences.  ***",
