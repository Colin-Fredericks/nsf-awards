 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to study small-scale velocity differences in open                and closed turbulent flows.  Of special interest is the cross-over              from the chaotic state (few degrees of freedom) to the fully                    turbulent state, where \"cascade\" ideas of turbulence may be                     applied.  The turbulence will be probed by conventional techniques,             such as laser Doppler velocimetry, and also by homodyne light                   scattering, which permits the measurement of velocity differences               without making the \"frozen-turbulence\" assumption.  Also to be                  studied are:  the dynamics of phase-separation of fluids and liquid             crystals contained in porous media; and nucleation in fluid                     mixtures under uniform shear.  The common thread running through                all of this work is that of systems driven far from equilibrium.                %%%                                                                             The research deals with \"self-similar\" phenomena which have the                 property that they look the same when viewed on all scales of                   magnification.  Turbulent fluids exhibit this self-similarity,                  which will be studied by light scattering.  Another self-similar                occurrence is the motion of fluids constrained within porous media              (e.g., oil in sand).  The goal is to understand the origin of this              self-similarity.",
