 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353099  Anderson    The project is a three year investigation of collaborative problem  solving in science for the purpose of developing accounts of  learning and problem solving by middle school students and  developing instructional strategies and materials that improve both  students' conceptual understanding of science and their capacities  for self-regulation in complex problem solving situations.  Year 1  is an intervention study investigating the comparative effects of  three instructional conditions:  a) mediated independent problem  solving, b) group problem solving, and c) mediated group problem  solving.  This investigation will be conducted in eight classrooms  as the students study a unit on the nature and properties of  matter.  Analyses of Year 1 data will occur in Year 2 for the  purpose of:  a) evaluating the success with which the desired  outcomes were achieved across the various conditions in terms of  conceptual understanding, self-regulatory abilities, and  internalization of the social norms practiced across the three  conditions, b) evaluating the reasons for the outcomes, principally  through microanalysis of classroom interactions, and c) revising  the instructional procedures.  In Year 3, we will investigate the  implementation of the revised instructional program in eight  classrooms.  The proposed study will contribute both to research on  problem solving and conceptual understanding in science and to the  improvement of educational practice, focusing on the opportunities  for teachers and students to work together in \"learning  communities.\"  ***",
