 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant seeks to develop a program to improve the                   teaching of science at the middle and upper elementary school                   levels.  The program will be directed at developing mechanisms                  for establishing ongoing relationships between faculty in a                     university research community and teachers in regional                          schools.  During the twelve months planning period                              approximately 70 teachers from three school districts - Urban                   School District, Suburban School District, and Rural School                     District will work together to review and analyze a series of                   science teaching tapes. Upon completion of this task, the                       teachers from the various schools in the three school                           districts will present the tapes to science teachers in a                       workshop in their respective systems.  The reactions and                        results from the workshops will be used in answering the                        following questions: What types of written materials for                        teachers should accompany such a tape?  Would a kit with                        examples of the materials introduced in the unit also be                        helpful?  What is the optimal length of time for such a tape?                                                                                                   Upon completion of analysis of the tapes, the curricula of the                  participating schools will be analyzed.  One of the goals of                    the program will be to establish some commonly agreed upon                      needs for middle and upper elementary school science programs.                  This aspect of the program is based on the assumption that                      every program in science education needs to be updated in                       response to advances in the fields of science as well as                        changing societal needs and needs of the various school                         districts.  An outcome of the planning period is the design                     and development of new teaching units in science that are                       flexible in structure and format that can be introduced into                    existing programs without changing the entire science program                   or without committing the district to new series of books.                      Teachers can learn how to introduce new teaching material that                  is limited in scope.  The new material and teaching strategies                  they learn with these units can also be extended to other                       areas of the curriculum.",
