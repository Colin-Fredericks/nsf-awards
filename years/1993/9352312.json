 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352312  Palettas  The Statistics Focus Group, sponsored by the Mathematical  Association of America's Curriculum Action Project, has  recently raised two very important issues concerning  undergraduate statistics education. First, traditional  lecturing is proving ineffective to convey the basic concepts  from probability and statistics. Second, dogmatic teaching of  older theoretical frames becomes increasingly less relevant as  the advancement in power and sophistication of modern computing  leads to fundamental changes in statistical practice.  This project is developing a novel mode of instruction which is  addressing both of the above concerns. Specifically, the  project is fostering active learning by means of laboratory  instruction which employs calculation and plotting as means for  exploration and learning. At the same time, the project is  enriching the scientific content of undergraduate statistics  curricula with respect to advances in statistical/mathematical  computing and state-of-the-art computer intensive statistical  methodology.  In summary, Virginia Tech is developing a foundational course  to set up the framework to promote the use of structured,  partially supervised laboratory instruction. For that purpose,  the course is  designed to provide the students with a broad  introduction to numerical, graphical and symbolic computation,  which will be the tools employed by laboratory instruction, as  well as with guidance and direction to help them develop the  skills which is promoting active learning via the use of  calculation and plotting. The laboratories being developed  under this project are initiating the change from lecturing to  laboratory-instruction along the lines described above. The  project is tailored to the needs of the Statistics Majors  Program at Virginia Tech, but it is an innovative pilot project  with high potential to provide national models of continuing  impact.  ***",
