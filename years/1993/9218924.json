 "awd_abstract_narration": "A cooperative research program involving                                        scientists from the United States and China is                                  proposed to investigate the geochemical                                         characteristics of copper and gold-bearing                                      skarn deposits of the Ji Long Ores of the                                       Yangxin-Daye area of Hubei Province, China.                                     The goals of the proposed research are to                                       establish geochemical characteristics of the                                    ores and to determine the conditions of                                         formation.  Systematic field sampling in the Ji                                 Long deposits using field and mine exposures                                    and an extensive drill core library will be                                     followed by detailed petrographic and electron                                  microprobe analyses of ore and gangue minerals.                                 The data obtained will be used to define the                                    mineralogy and mineral chemistry within the                                     deposits and to establish paragenetic                                           sequences.  This information will be                                            complemented by detailed fluid inclusion                                        studies, including standard microthermometry                                    and laser Raman analyses, to define the                                         composition and physical state of the                                           mineralizing fluids.  The project provides an                                   excellent opportunity for cooperative research                                  between the American and Chinese scientists and                                 builds upon their respective knowledge and                                      strengths of sulfide ore mineralogy and field                                   relationships of the ores.  Collaborative field                                 sampling in China will be followed by detailed                                  mineralogical and analytical studies in the                                     United States.  The information derived will be                                 employed to define the geochemical and physical                                 conditions of ore formation and aid in                                          understanding where the skarn deposits form                                     around the intrusions of the district.",
