 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research continues work aimed at understanding the low-                  frequency radiation from large earthquakes in the frequency band                from 1 to 15 millihertz, a frequency range previously unrecorded                by high-gain seismographs.  Preliminary analysis of 30 large                    earthquakes has shown that most earthquakes are ordinary in the                 sense that their low-frequency source spectra are consistent with               the moment, origin time, centroid time, and duration estimated from             higher-frequency data and standard scaling relations.  Some                     earthquakes, however appear to be compound sources; that is, in                 addition to a fast, \"jerky\" rupture with a characteristic duration              of tens of seconds, they comprise an episode of slow, smooth                    deformation with a duration of hundreds of seconds or longer.  In               addition, for some of these events, the slow component must involve             substantial moment release prior to the beginning of the fast                   component.  The assertion that slow precursors exist for some large             earthquakes has significant implications for models of earthquake               nucleation and strategies for short-term earthquake prediction.                 This research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                  Reduction Program.",
