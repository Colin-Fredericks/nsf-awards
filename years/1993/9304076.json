 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304076  Poole    The long term objectives of the project are to understand how genes  interact during development to specify a complex body plan in  higher organisms. Several cell type specific transcription factors  in mammals share a two part DNA binding domain known as the POU  domain. POU domain proteins play a variety of roles in vertebrate  development. The closely linked pdm-1 and pdm-2 genes of Drosophila  also share this domain and are most closely related to the  mammalian Oct-1 and Oct-2 POU domain genes. Their developmental  expression patterns, responses to genes that organize the body  plan, and effects of their misexpression together suggest that the  pdm genes play important roles in regulating different aspects of  Drosophila development. In addition, the study of this class of  genes in Drosophila should give fresh insights into the structures  and functions of the mammalian genes. The overall aims of this  project are to understand the roles these presumed transcription  factors play in Drosophila development. Specific aims are to  generate chromosomal deficiencies in the pdm gene region to narrow  down the genetic area in which to search for mutations. To predict  the effects of mutations on development, phenocopies of pdm  mutations will be induced by injecting antisense oligonucleotides  into early embryos. To generate mutations in the individual pdm  genes, the chromosomal region will be saturated for lethal  mutations induced by the mutagen EMS. After identifying the  different genes in the region, the effects on development of  specific mutations in the pdm genes will indicate in which  processes the genes are involved.  ***",
