This proposal will assist in the purchase of a modern nuclear                   magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This instrument is an                   essential tool for faculty members at the University of                         California-Los Angeles engaged in chemical research.  The                       instrument provides important information which in most cases                   can be used to determine the geometric and/or molecular                         structure of newly synthesized molecules.",
