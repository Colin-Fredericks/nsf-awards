 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nesting is the process of placing objects together with                    minimal void space between them.  Nesting is required in the design             and manufacturing of almost every product.  This research will                  develop a three dimensional (3D) algorithm for the packaging of                 irregular 3D objects inside target volumes.  This computer program              will automatically pack the maximum number of components possible               with minimum wasted volume voids.  An intelligent software driven               system for use in the design and manufacturing of any product will              be developed that will enable designers to automatically visualize              nested layouts as they design; reducing lead time for new product               introductions, enhancing communications between design/engineering              and manufacturing.                                                                  In the computer industry, nesting of the various components is              done manually in order to achieve minimum size of the computer box.             With this computer program, a designer will be able to quickly                  assemble and define a computer geometry from prescribed components              and their location constraints.",
