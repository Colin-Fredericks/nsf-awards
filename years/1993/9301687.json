The evolution of body size is a problem of  fundamental interest, and one that has an important bearing on  community structure and conservation of biodiversity. The most  obvious and pervasive characteristic of the deep-sea benthos is the  small size of most species. The numerous attempts to document and  explain size patterns in the deep sea have focused on variation  among species or whole faunal components, and have led to  conflicting and contradictory results, In general, there has been  a failure to recognize that studying size as an adaptation to the  deep-sea environment must include analyses within species using  measures of size that are standardized to common growth stages.  Also, most studies have not applied appropriate statistical methods  for either demonstrating or comparing size trends. Sebens'  optimality model of body size in marine invertebrates provides a  useful conceptual framework for exploring the evolution of size in  deep-sea species. It predicts that optimal body size should  decrease with depth under circumstances where decreased nutrient  input lowers food intake rates and increases costs of foraging; but  it also allows for the evolution of size above the optimum when  larger size confers a competitive advantage. A preliminary analysis  within eight species of deep-sea gastropods reveals a clear trend  for size to increase with depth in both larvae and adults. Based on  this preliminary analysis and Sebens' optimality model, this  project will test the hypothesis that there are within- and among-  species components to size-depth trends. Using a single  taxonomically coherent family of ecologically similar species (the  Turridae) and the analysis of covariance, this project will test  four specific predictions: 1. that size will increase with depth  within species, but that the slopes of size-depth  relations will  decrease with depth, 2. that size will decrease among species as  they replace one another along a depth gradient, 3. that there will  be a latitudinal gradient in size, with larger species found at  higher latitudes, and 4. that size-depth regressions in regions of  higher production will have higher elevations than those in regions  of low productions. This project will provide the first accurate  analysis of geographic variation in size within deep-sea species,  and will contribute significantly to our basic understanding of  size as an adaptive response to the deep-sea environment.  ***",
