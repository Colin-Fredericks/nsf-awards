 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this ILI project is to develop a two semester                        undergraduate course in Environmental Analytical Chemistry                      covering both inorganic and organic analysis. The course will                   provide students with the analytical skills to make precise and                 accurate measurements on environmental samples using state-of-                  the-art instrumentation. In addition, this endeavor seeks to                    achieve the following objectives: 1) demonstrate and reinforce                  principles taught in the general curricula of geological sci-                   ences and environmental engineering; 2) improve integration of                  science and engineering cultures. Methodology will be taught                    with careful attention paid to common analytical problems. This                 course, however, will not focus solely on teaching specific                     techniques, but instead will seek to illustrate the critical                    relationship between analysis and elucidation of process                        dynamics. Moreover, special emphasis will be placed on                          interpretation of results and critical reasoning.  The                          equipment purchased with this grant will be used in combination                 with instruments on hand to perform trace inorganic and organic                 analysis, quantify and characterize natural organic material                    and compare techniques of pollutant analysis in water, sediment                 and soil samples. It is hoped that this project will spark                      student interest in environmental research and in the pursuit                   of advanced degrees. The development of this laboratory course                  and facility is consistent with the educational mission of UND,                 the federal mandate of environmental education and the future                   needs of our society.",
