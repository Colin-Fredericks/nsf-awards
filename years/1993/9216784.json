 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in statistics and probability between George Casella of Cornell                 University and Christian Robert of the Laboratory for                           Theoretical and Applied Statistics, University of Paris VI.  The                research is concerned with statistical inferences from                          experiments.  In addressing this problem they proposed to further               develop procedures for accuracy estimation.  Post-data statistical              inferences are based on all information in an experiment,                       including the knowledge of the data.  The proposed research will                integrate and evaluate approaches to post-data inferences using                 decision theory and conditional inferences.  They will investigate              fundamental questions on the behavior of estimators under                       different loss functions and in loss function robustness and                    explore problems of assimilating decision theory with stochastic                simulation techniques.                                                                                                                                          The cooperative research project takes advantage of                             complementary interests and expertise. The  U.S. investigator                   brings to this collaboration his expertise in decision theory. This             is complemented by the French investigator's extensive                          experience in computational and algorithmic statistics. Together,               their efforts may result in new techniques and methodology of                   statistical computing, including, better procedures for post data               inferences and efficient methods for computation of accuracy                    measures.",
