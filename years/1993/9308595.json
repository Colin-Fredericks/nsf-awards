 "awd_abstract_narration": "It was proposed to provide partial support for an                               interdisciplinary, international workshop on \"Control and                       particle processes Conference\" in Santa Barbara, at the end of                  January 1993.  The meeting will bring together researchers from                 universities, industry and government, with the focus on the in-                process measurements and control systems for manufacturing                      processes involving particles.  This topic is relevant in                       chemical, mining and mineral processing.  For instance, about                   80% of the products manufactured in chemical plant at DuPont use                particle technology.  The margins of improvement by process                     control, in both product quality and reliability in operation,                  are significant.  The proposed meeting will extend the research                 interests on particle process control of the group with areas                   of interest including chemical processes.  The participants is                  truly international.  NSF funds will partially support only                     professors and graduate students from the U. S. (20 participants                with $500 support per person), while the funds for the                          industrial and overseas participants will come from industry and                Engineering Foundation.  The workshop covers four research                      areas:  reactor control systems, particle processing,                           instrumentation, and modeling and control strategies.                                                                                                           The research focus of this proposal is at the intersection of                   two division in engineering, \"Chemical and Thermal Systems\" and                 \"Design and Manufacturing Systems\", which will co-shear the                     workshop expenses.",
