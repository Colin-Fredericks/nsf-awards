To this end, a laboratory-based course is  being created as a part of the Physics curriculum and offered as an  elective to students in the other sciences.  The course will be  taught as an in-class lab, where the students run simulation  experiments in the class and discuss the results, as well as any  difficulties, with the instructors on the spot.  Our team-teaching  approach, pairing a Physicist and a Computer Scientist, stresses  sound programming practices - modular design, proper documentation  and program efficiency - as well as standard numerical and  simulation techniques.  Computer simulations allow the students to  experiment with realistic systems which cannot be handled by  traditional analytical methods. The course includes a selection of  real-world problems from various scientific disciplines to  illustrate and emphasize the power and broad applicability of the  computational techniques. The in-class lab format and mix of  student backgrounds lead to a productive exchange of ideas and a  better awareness of the unity of the underlying science.    ***",
