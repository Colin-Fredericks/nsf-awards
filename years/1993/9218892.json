 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extinction, which may be the ultimate fate of all                          species, has always held a special interest for geologists                      and biologists, and even legislators (e.g., Endangered                          Species Act).  Extinction events, when a number of species                      become extinct over a geologically short period time, have                      always had historical significance to Earth scientists and                      evolutionary biologists, as they are conveniently used to                       divide up geologic time.  In this project, PI and students                      will examine in detail one of the earliest extinction                           events, at the Lower-Middle Cambrian boundary, and help                         answer questions such as how sudden the event really was,                       what percentage of the fauna went extinct, and whether                          species began to decline in numbers prior to their                              extinction.  The paleoenvironment in which these early taxa                     lived will also be reconstructed from the type of rock that                     now entombs them.",
