The central focus would be geometric                  visualization.  High priority in the major project would be on the              development of materials which were easy to use for both teacher                and student and upon dissemination.  The materials to be developed              would include computer programs, narrated videos, text materials,               and manipulatives.                                                                                                                                              The planning process would include the establishment of contacts                and ties with various producers of visualization materials,                     commercial publishers, nationwide curriculumprojects, and experts               in dissemination and testing, as well as mathematics education                  specialists and schooland college teachers.",
