 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309422  Fadem    Sex differences in reproductive behavior in mammals are  determined not only by the genes and by hormones produced in  adulthood, but also by steroid hormones secreted by the gonads  during perinatal development.  Although it is known that  testicular androgens play an important role during perinatal  development, androgens are metabolized into estrogens within CNS  target cells.  Determining whether an androgen or its  estrogenic metabolite is the differentiating hormone is  complicated since placental mammalian fetuses have systems which  actually \"protect\" them from maternal estrogen.  Thus, getting  estrogen to the fetus and quantifying the amount of estrogen  acting on the fetus is extremely important yet almost impossible  to achieve.  Dr. Fadem has developed a marsupial model to examine  the role of estrogen.  The newborns are born at a developmental  stage equivalent to that of a 13-day fetal rat or 8-week human  embryo.  Hence, much of the fetal development occurs outside the  body of the mother, making the fetal environment accessible in  these mammals.  Dr. Fadem will manipulate the hormonal  environment of the newborn marsupials.  She will assess the  effects of these early manipulations on reproductive and  aggressive behavior, morphology and physiology in adulthood.    The results from these studies will contribute to a better  understanding of various human disorders that result from  insufficient or excess hormone exposure during sexual  differentiation.   ***",
