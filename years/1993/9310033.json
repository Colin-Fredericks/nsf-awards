With the collaborative development of mathematical anthropology here and on the continent the invesitgators will be able to: (1) complete of a set of user friendly c omputer programs for data entry and dynamic and static analyses of kinship and marriage networks; (2) start a crosscultural data base of kinship networks; and (3) participate in series of colloborative workshops, funded, in part by the German Humboldt Foundation, where major European and US researchers will solve basic methodological and theoretical issues in network analysis applied to kinship problems.  The approach is comprehensive in its potential for representing and analyzing a great variety of kinship structures and related processes, and focuses on scientific studies of social order and change, involving new methods of discrete structural analysis and graphic techniques of resenting data and findings. ***   #    x   \\        P    C      X P#",
