 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms                which regulate the degree of unsaturation of membrane and storage               lipids.  We will address this question by measuring the effect of               variation in developmental stage and environmental conditions on                the expression of several recently isolated genes encoding fatty                acid desaturases from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  The                      existence of regulatory mechanisms which act at the level of direct             enzyme activation or deactivation will be examined by measuring the             effects on lipid composition in transgenic plants which contain                 higher than normal levels of desaturase activity due to                         overexpression of cloned desaturase genes.  The spatial                         organization of lipid desaturation within cells will be elucidated              using anti-desaturase antibodies to localize the enzymes by                     immunogold electron microscopy.  Finally, we will attempt to                    isolate genes for several additional desaturases by map-based                   cloning methods based on the availability of a comprehensive                    collection of mutants of Arabidopsis.                                           %%%                                                                             Plant fatty acids provide about one third of the calories in human              diets and are also used for a wide variety of technical products                raging from synthesis of nylon to cosmetics.  In addition, the                  ability of many plants to withstand exposure to temperature                     extremes is thought to be controlled by the fatty acid composition              of plant membranes.  The experiments proposed here are designed to              provided detailed information about the factors which regulate                  plant fatty acid composition.  This information may be useful in                permitting genetic modification of the fatty acid composition of                plants so that they produce edible oils with advantageous dietary               qualities, expanded technical uses or enhanced ability to withstand             temperature extremes.",
