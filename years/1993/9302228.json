The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Jon D.                                       Chorover of the University of California,                                       Berkeley, to work with Professor Jacques Buffle                                 of the University of Geneva in Switzerland.                                                                                                                     The transport of chemicals in natural aquatic                                   systems is regulated by the partitioning of                                     solutes between the solid and aqueous phases.                                   Colloids, the smallest of the solid particles,                                  may be readily entrained and transported by the                                 mobile fluid, thereby providing transport for                                   sorbed inorganic and organic adsorptives.                                       Although colloid mediated transport is                                          considered an important mechanism for                                           contaminant transport, the basic processes                                      affecting colloidal behavior are poorly                                         understood.  Organic-polymer/inoranic colloid                                   associations are ubiquitous in natural aquatic                                  and soil systems and these aggregates have                                      profoundly different colloidal properties than                                  the inorganic particles alone.  The technology                                  for in situ study of colloidal systems has                                      improved dramatically over the last decade, yet                                 the effects of experimental artifacts are not                                   well  known.  Careful investigations of                                         colloidal structure and stability therefore                                     incorporate several complimentary analyses.  In                                 the proposed project, Dr. Chorover and                                          Professor Buffle will study interactions                                        between anionic macropolymers and inorganic                                     microcolloids.                                                                                                                                                  The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel, a stipend for                                       twelve months, travel to meetings, and a                                        dependent allowance for Dr. Chorover's family.",
