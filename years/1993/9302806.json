 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Crane has argued that computers do not make hard tasks                easy in the social sciences and humanities; rather, computers make              hard tasks possible.  He has demonstrated how computer technology               can make hard tasks possible in his already completed work in the               humanities, Project Perseus.  He now proposes to turn his attention             to the history and philosophy of science.                                                                                                                       As in many fields, major, long-term database projects are being                 planned to provide a new kind of scholarly infrastructure for the               fields of Science and Technology Studies (STS).  Among these are                the Einstein, Oppenheimer and Peirce projects.  Questions are being             framed and decisions will, in the very short future, be taken that              constrain what we can and cannot do for many years to come.  The                organization of these databases, however, is extremely complex                  since they incorporate full text, images, linguistic tools,                     historical and cultural background.  Given the lack of broad                    experience, it is not now possible to predict with accuracy what                will and will not work.  Yet, Project Perseus does bring relevant               experience to bear on issues in STS.  The purpose of this                       exploratory grant is to bring to the attention of the STS research              community the way in which Project Perseus has addressed many of                the database problems researchers in this area are confronting and              to explore how the experience gained in the development of Perseus              can be most effectively used for scientific and technical texts.                                                                                                Under this SGER grant, Professor Crane and his colleagues are                   studying the possibilities of developing an electronic database                 that would serve as a model that would greatly extend the questions             which researchers can pose about science.  This database would be               built upon the existing Perseus multimedia database on Greek                    culture, but the framework they construct is meant to help                      establish standards in STS.  With a large amount of information                 already on-line and accessible in a published database, they are                exploring setting the history of Greek science within an unusually              rich existing framework.  By extending the Perseus database into                Greek science, they would not only be able to create a powerful                 tool more cost-effectively, but they would also be able to create               a working model for a comprehensive database for research.  Their               experiences would in turn help those working in other areas better              understand the strengths and weaknesses of the electronic medium                and thus have the capacity to allow work in other areas to progress             more rapidly and effectively.                                                                                                                                   The SGER project is progressing in two phases:  meetings in                     Washington in December, 1992 to discuss the possibilities  of this              work with members of the field; and a small conference in late                  spring, 1993 to plan the actual organization of the database for                Greek science.",
