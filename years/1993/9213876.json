Hampden-Smith of the University of New Mexico                   and David Rankin of the University of Edinburgh.  This                          interdisciplinary project involves solid state materials preparation            and chemical synthesis and characterization.  The objectives are to             determine the gas phase structures of a variety of volatile and new             organocopper precursors, perform thermal decomposition studies                  and surface studies of deposited copper films.  The research is                 focused on deriving fundamental insight into the formation of high-             quality, patterned copper thin films.   In studying the gas phase               aspects of the organocopper precursors, the investigators will                  provide important new information about the gas phase and gas                   surface reactions.                                                                                                                                              Dr. Hampden-Smith brings to this collaboration his expertise in the             synthesis and characterization of organocopper precursors in solid              state and in solution.  His group will synthesize the necessary                 compounds at the University of Mexico for the gas phase studies.                This is complemented by the unique instrumentation at the                       University of Edinburgh and Dr. Rankin's expertise in gas phase                 structural characterization using electron diffraction techniques.              Together, their research may allow the deposit of purer, low                    temperature, better quality copper films on surfaces than is                    currently possible.                                                              //",
