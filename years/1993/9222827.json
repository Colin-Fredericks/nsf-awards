The equipment will be used for several                research projects to be undertaken by an interdisciplinary group of             faculty.                                                                                                                                                        This equipment supports the proposed projects' common goal of                   developing novel parallel methods for advanced engineering                      projects.  In particular, the following projects shall be explored:                                                                                             Asynchronous algorithmic techniques for Computational Fluid Dynamic                                                                                             Run-time support for data distribution using formal methods                                                                                                     Parallel-specific algorithms in neural network learning for                     Nonlinear Control Systems, Computational Electromagnetics, and                  Chemical Process Flowsheeting.                                                                                                                                  This interdisciplinary project shall bring together applications                practitioners and Computer Science researchers.  The equipment is               representative of proposed teraflop computers.  thus, the                       equipment will be used to develop prototypes of codes that can be               scaled to run on larger computing equipment as it becomes                       available.  The collective result of this research will be improved             technological infrastructure for scientific computation.",
