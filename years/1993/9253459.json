 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both education and training, as conventionally practiced, fail to               provide many individuals with the level of understanding and                    skills needed to become productive contributors in a world of                   fast-changing technology.  This project explores the concept of                 mentoring as an alternative instructional tool that can bridge                  the gap between the concepts stressed in formal education and the               competencies required by the workplace.  We view mentoring as a                 dynamic social and instructional process initiated when a learner               detects a problem in the context of some activity.  In the first                phase of the project, we will study informal mentoring in the                   workplace and more structured mentoring in educational settings.                We will also initiate laboratory studies, using the first                       prototype of a computer-based support system that enables two                   individuals to work on the same application with provisions for                 a multimedia dialogue between participants.  This work will                     provide the basis for developing a cognitive model of the                       mentoring process.  That model and the Phase 1 research results                 will inform the design of the Distant Mentor, refinement of the                 initial prototype that will provide not only multimedia                         communication for networked collaboration but also support for                  specific mentoring activities as reviewing problem solving                      histories and generating explanations.",
