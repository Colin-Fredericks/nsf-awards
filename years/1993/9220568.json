 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Vernon                   Knight will continue his archaeological research at the site of                 Moundville. Located near the Black Warrior River in Alabama this                site marks one of the highest cultural achievements of pre-                     Columbian Native Americans. It consists of a large number of mounds             arranged in roughly symmetrical order, many containing tens of                  thousands of cubic meters of fill. Archaeological evidence                      indicates that these structures, which were likely built over                   extended periods of time contained religious structures at their                tops and also served as burial chambers. Several have yielded large             series of skeletons and burial goods. Of central importance is not              the structures themselves but the nature of the social organization             which made them possible. To construct such massive earthworks                  requires a social and political organization which can mobilize a               large amount of labor for long periods of time. Dr. Knight's                    research should provide insight into this underlying social                     structure.                                                                                                                                                      Building on past work at the site Dr. Knight will conduct two                   seasons of excavation. Using standard archaeological techniques he              will cut trenches into a number of mounds. The materials collected              will allow him to date the construction (or multiple construction               episodes) of each. On this basis estimates of person power over                 time can also be made. Dr. Knight will attempt to determine the                 functions of each structure and how these also may have changed                 over time.                                                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many scientists. It will increase our                       understanding of how, at a technologically simple level, complex                societies develop and are maintained. It will also assist in the                training of graduate students.",
