 "awd_abstract_narration": "A summer institute in physics will be offered to 20 teachers.                   The institute will be 6-8 weeks in length.  Those participants                  who opt for the longer time will have the opportunity to be                     involved in a research experience with the university faculty                   for 2 weeks.  There will be 6 two day follow up sessions on the                 university campus during the academic year.  Electronic                         networking between the teachers is anticipated where feasible.                  Graduate credit will be offered for those who complete the                      entire program.                                                                                                                                                 The project is aimed mainly at teachers whose major was in an                   area of science other than physics who teach in smaller schools                 in rural areas in Northern Illinois and Southern Wisconsin.  A                  few leader/master teachers will be included.  These teacher will                act as mentors for the under prepared participants.                                                                                                             A strong emphasis in the program is placed on the constructivist                approach to teaching to reflect the results of current research                 in physics teaching.  Demonstrations, laboratory experiments,                   field trips and seminars will broaden the spectrum of course                    offerings.
