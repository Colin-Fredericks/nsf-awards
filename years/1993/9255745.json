Design and development of the                   project's course and field experience components are being                      guided by the following basic principles.  1) Teachers should                   learn science and mathematics through instruction that models                   the practices they are being expected to employ during their                    teaching careers.  2) Courses and field experiences should                      integrate science and mathematics so that teachers will know                    and can take advantage of the connections between individual                    disciplines.  3) Teacher training programs should include                       substantial field experiences that engage the prospective                       teachers in the genuine research activities of business,                        industrial or scientific institutions and the science and                       mathematics education activities conducted by science centers,                  zoos or museums.  4) Teachers should develop their ability to                   use modern technologies as standard tools for research and                      problem solving as well as for imaginative classroom                            instruction.  5) Field experiences should be provided in school                 settings that enroll children of below average and average                      ability, as well as those in gifted and talented programs.  6)                  Teachers should receive sustained support during the critical                   first years of their induction to the teaching profession.                      Throughout the five year development period, continual                          formative evaluation, research on the process of teacher                        education, and a variety of dissemination activities are being                  conducted to inform others of the outcomes of this emerging                     model of teacher preparation.***//",
