 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306559 Cooksey This project is to investigate how plant associated bacteria adapt to toxic levels of copper in the environment.  Copper is an important bactericide used frequently for disease control on agricultural plants.  The development of copper resistance in plant pathogenic bacteria may pose a threat to the future use of copper in plant disease control, and a better understanding of how this resistance develops will be important for evaluating this threat.  The recognition of copper resistance has already led to attempts to develop new copper formulations that may circumvent resistance mechanisms, and a greater understanding of the physiological and regulatory mechanisms of resistance could enhance that effort. %%% Microbial resistance to nonessential toxic metals, such as mercury, has been studied extensively, but resistance to copper has receives much less attention.  Unlike the other metals. copper is required by loving organisms as a component of certain enzymes; at low levels it is beneficial, but at high levels it is toxic.  The evolution of copper resistance in microbial populations therefore involves a complex balance in copper uptake and exclusion mechanisms.  The genes determining copper resistance were cloned and characterized, and they were found to be related to a set of chromosomal genes found in copper sensitive bacteria.  We have shown that the resistance can evolve through modifications of these chromosomal genes, and the present project is to define further these modifications.  Since copper is required by microorganisms as a trace element, the resistance mechanism, which prevents uptake of copper, must be under tight regulatory control so that copper is not  excluded under normal growth conditions.  We have evidence that modifications in the level in gene expression in this system.  The copper binding capacity of other proteins produced by the bacterium is important in the copper exclusion mechanism, and we will study how copper binding sites of these proteins have been modified during the evolution of resistance.",
