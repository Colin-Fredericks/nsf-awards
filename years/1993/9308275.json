Eyewitnesses to crime often must  attempt to identify crime culprits from line-ups or photospreads,  and this is an important form of evidence for police investigators,  judges and juries.  Unfortunately, scientific studies indicate that  mistaken identifications (of an innocent suspect) are not easily  distinguished from accurate identifications (of the actual  culprit).  Especially problematic is the fact that the confidence  of the eyewitness in response to a question such as \"How confident  are you that the person you identified is the person you saw steal  the money?\" shows little or no consistent relation to the accuracy  of the identification.  This causes considerable difficulty for  crime investigators and for triers of fact (such as jurors), who  must decide whether the eyewitness is accurate or mistaken.    The project will undertake a series of five experiments designed to  discover better ways to determine whether an eyewitness has made an  accurate versus inaccurate identification.  Thefts will be staged  repeatedly before groups of unsuspecting people (totaling  approximately 1,500 subjects for the five experiments) who will  then be given photospreads and asked to identify the thief.   Various conditions will be used across these five studies to test  whether eyewitnesses' direct judgments of resemblance between their  memories and the appearance of the identified person better predict  accuracy of identification than do eyewitnesses' confidence in  their accuracy, and whether the former are less vulnerable to  extraneous influences than the latter.  These studies will make an  important theoretical contribution to our scientific understanding  of eyewitness confidence stability.  The results will also provide  useful tools for determining the accuracy of identification  evidence in actual criminal cases.  ***",
