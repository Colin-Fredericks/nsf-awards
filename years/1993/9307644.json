 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is directed toward some models of turbulence in fluids and  magnetofluids.  Deterministic and statistical equilibrium theories of coherent  structures in turbulence will be explored using both analytical and numerical  methods.  These theories, which  complement the cascade-oriented concept of a  driven and dissipative system, provide models for the long-time, large-scale  behavior of flows and fields governed by conservative evolution equations.    Their equilibrium solutions are characterized by variational principles,  such  as a maximum entropy principle with constraints dictated  by the conservation  laws for the governing dynamics.  Theoretical tools and computational algorithms will be developed  to solve the  constrained optimization problems that arise from these general principles.      A variety of fundamental, prototype problems derived from specific physical  applications will be treated with these methods; they include, for instance,     the organized vortex structures in a shear layer, and the most probable          state of a magnetically-confined plasma.  Most of the tractable problems of this  kind are essentially two-dimensional; however, some aspects of the analogous  three-dimensional problems will be also tackled using extensions of the same  methods.    The principal aim of this research is to develop a basic understanding  of the  physics of turbulence.  The turbulent medium can be an  ordinary fluid, such as  water flowing in a pipe or air streaming past a wing; or, it can be a magnetized  plasma, such as ionized gas  in a thermonuclear fusion reactor.  Simplified  mathematical models  of these complex physical problems are formulated in order  to  investigate some fundamental properties of the phenomena they exhibit.   Particular attention is focussed on the coherent or organized structures that  emerge and persist in the presence of turbulent disorder.   These structures are  studied quantitatively by deriving and then solving equations that captu re the  coarse-grained behavior of the system while partially ignoring its fine-grained  fluctuations.    In this way, useful predictions can be made of physical systems  having a very  large number of degrees of freedom, which otherwise would be beyond the grasp of  current methods of mathematical analysis or computer simulation. An  interdisciplinary approach will be adopted in which abstract analytical tools,  modern computing techniques, and solid physical reasoning are employed in a  unified manner.",
