 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to analyze the role of MHC class I               proteins in the entry of simian virus 40 (SV40) into the cell and               its targeting to appropriate intracellular compartments.  MHC class             I proteins were recently shown by this laboratory to be an                      essential component of the cell surface receptor for SV40.  One                 major concern is to confirm preliminary findings which suggest that             SV40 remains associated with MHC class I proteins during and after              its entry in the cell.  The functional significance of this                     association for virus entry and transport will be evaluated and the             residues on the MHC class I proteins that might be important in                 these processes will be identified.  Of particular interest is                  whether SV40 is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in                association with MHC class I proteins.  This is important because               MHC class I proteins acquire antigenic peptide fragments in the ER              and because SV40 provides the only precedent for a targeting                    pathway from the plasma membrane that can access the ER.  Thus,                 this study may enable the evaluation of the important but as yet                unsubstantiated possibility that MHC class I proteins recycle to                the ER.                                                                         Whereas this laboratory has confirmed that SV40 accumulates in the              ER prior to replication in the nucleus, it is not certain that                  transport to the ER is part of the pathway leading to productive                infection.  Nor is it certain whether or not virus entry leading to             infection occurs by receptor-mediated endocytosis via coated pits.              Experiments are proposed to address these issues.  In addition, the             rate at which MHC class I proteins are spontaneously internalized               into control cells, the rate at which SV40 enters cells, and the                effect of SV40 adsorbed to the cell surface on the rate of entry of             MHC class I proteins will be measured.  This will permit the                    determination of whether or not SV40 induces the internalization of             the MHC class I proteins to gain entry into the cell, rather than               entering passively in association with them.                                    %%%                                                                             These studies are likely to be of general significance for what                 they might reveal about the natural in vivo activities of the                   crucially important MHC class I proteins.  These molecules are best             known for the central roles they play in immunity.  They are widely             recognized for presenting endogenously synthesized antigenic                    peptide fragments for recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes                    (CTLs), thus playing an essential role in host cellular defense                 mechanisms.  They also play a central role in the thymic selection              of the T cell repertoire and the establishment of tolerance.                    Nevertheless, many important questions about their activities                   remain unanswered.  The studies proposed here will provide                      important information about their recycling into cells and                      intracellular targeting.  They will also provide important                      information about the little studied, but potentially significant,              pathway of targeting from the cell surface to the ER.",
