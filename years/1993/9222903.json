 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the characteristics of standard modelling in decision                    theory, game theory and economic theory has been the postulate                  that all the people in the models are completely rational; they                 have well-specified objectives, unlimited memories, and unlimited               abilities to compute without using up time or other resources.                  In recent years discontent with this postulate has been growing                 within economics because of the cumulative weight of years of                   data from experiments consistently showing that even in very                    simple decision problems and games the theories do not predict                  the actions of subjects very well.  This project explores                       alternatives to the standard optimization model.  In these                      alternatives, each decision-making situation is a pattern                       recognition problem in which the individual decision maker                      decides which of a small set of decision making tools (\"rules of                thumb\") or actions to use.  The project addresses such questions                as how did the individual's set of rules and method of assigning                rules to decision making problems come to be and how do they                    evolve.                                                                                                                                                         More specifically, the project examines two broad classes of                    models.  In the first class there are single decision-maker                     models in which the decision maker's choices influence the path                 of some stochastic process about which the decision maker has                   little information but which affects his well-being.  The effect                of certain crude rules of thumb on the long-term survival of an                 individual is explored in a variety of contexts.  The second                    class builds on previous work by the investigator on bounded                    rationality models in which individuals use rules of thumb to                   conserve on decision-making costs and to overcome imperfect                     reasoning and computing abilities.  A population of individuals                 interacts over time using crude rules of thumb in a variety of                  settings.  Here the focus is on what profiles of rules can                      survive over time as poorer performing rules are weeded out.  The               models used in the latter part of the project are adapted from                  the literature on anonymous random matching games.",
