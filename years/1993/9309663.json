 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a technique that              allows a designer to play an active role in the design optimization             process.  This research combines fast optimization methods, based               on sensitivity analysis, with virtual reality techniques to provide             an interactive method for design optimization.  Fast optimization               methods are needed to allow large design problems to be                         investigated in an interactive time frame.  Virtual reality                     techniques provide an interactive environment for the designer to               investigate multiple design changes.  Keeping the designer active               in the design process allows the designer to use all of his/her                 prior knowledge about the problem to be brought to bear to achieve              a viable, optimal solution to the problem in a timely manner.                        Design is an interactive process that often involves trade-                offs between competing performance criteria.  For example,                      designers strive to design vehicles that are both lightweight and               strong.  Design of large structural systems is accomplished through             the aid of sophisticated optimization software.  Currently, the                 interaction a designer has with the optimization process is limited             to the initial stages of problem definition, where the designer                 specifies an objective function, design parameters, and                         constraints.  As the design process progresses, design objectives               and constraints are often modified based on the designer's                      experience, in order to achieve a viable solution.",
