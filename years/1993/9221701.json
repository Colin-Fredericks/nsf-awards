MRnet plans to expand its capacity for connecting education                and research institutions and to expand its educational and user                into new regions of the state.  This should encourage smaller                   institutions to take advantage of information resources available               on MRnet itself or through the NSFNET.                                               The items proposed for NSF support include:                                          -Expansion of technical and user services staff;                                -Creation of a new network hub in Rochester, MN;                                -Terminal servers for connecting very small member                                institutions at a reasonable cost;                                            -Personnel for outreach, marketing, and support of new                            members.",
