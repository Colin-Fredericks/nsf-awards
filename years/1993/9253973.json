Hood, and Portland Community Colleges.                        Faculty from the four institutions will cooperate in                            formulating a curriculum that provides liberal arts students                    with three types of interdisciplinary science courses that will                 meet the University's general education science requirement.                    Natural Science Inquiry courses will focus on open-ended                        laboratory and field studies in the manner recommended by                       Project Kaleidoscope.  Integrated Science Concepts courses will                 be developed around concepts that bridge more than one                          scientific disciplIne and will feature investigative                            laboratories.  Context of Science in Society courses will                       explore the social, political, economic and ethical dimensions                  of science and technology.  The project will support course                     development efforts by natural science faculty from the greater                 metropolitan area community colleges and the university                         academic departments.  The Advisory Council for the project                     will consist of nationally recognized experts in undergraduate                  science education and educational evaluation in both university                 and community college settings. In the year following                           completion of the project Portland State University  will host                  an undergraduate science curriculum conference as one of the                    dissemination tools for the project.  Throughout the course                     development period educational research will be conducted to                    evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum and teaching                       strategies.***//",
