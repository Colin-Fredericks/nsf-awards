This study will investigate transport  mechanisms for breccia components in clastic dikes in silicious  shales of the Miocene Monterey Formation, coastal California, and  in Paleozoic limestones both in Titus Canyon, Death Valley, and in  the Shell Creek Range, NE Nevada.  Minimum velocities of fluid flow  will be calculated using relations among flow velocity, clast size,  viscosity, and fluid and clast densities in fluidized beds.  These  parameters will be estimated based on field and thin section  investigators, fluid inclusion studies, and published density  values of similar rock types.  Episodic fluid flow through the dike  can be inferred if the calculated flow velocity through the dike is  much faster than seepage by darcian flow.  In addition, mechanism  leading to fragmentation of wall rock and breccia components in  clastic dikes will be investigated.  Identification of the latter  process would allow estimated on the magnitude and rate of drops in  pore pressure.  Rapid drops are considered as characteristic for  clastic dikes serving as conduits for large scale, episodic fluid  flow.  Stable isotope and trace  element measurements across crack  seal veins associated with clastic dikes will determine if the  dikes were chemically closed or open systems.  Strontium isotope  analyses of wall rock and vein filling minerals will indicate if  vein cementation occurred in a closed or open system.  The proposed  investigations will increase the present understanding of fluid  flow mechanisms within the upper crust.  Findings of this study may  influence research in applied fields such as transport of  contaminants and heat in fractured rocks of earthquake hazard  analysis.  ***",
