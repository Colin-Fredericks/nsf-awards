 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spontaneous polymerizations, observed when electron-rich and               electron-poor olefins are mixed, are initiated by tetramethylene                intermediates which can be either zwitterionic or diradical in                  nature.  Spontaneous free-radical copolymerizations have similarly              been shown to compete with the Diels-Alder cycloadditions in                    reactions of dienes and olefins; these polymerizations are proposed             to be initiated by 2-hexene-l,6-diradicals or zwitterions.  To                  date, highly functionalized olefins have been used to obtain fast               and clean reactions.  These investigations will be extended to                  common industrial olefin/olefin reactions, such as styrene and                  acrylonitrile, and diene/olefin reactions, such as the                          isoprene/maleic anhydride system.  Moreover, the effect of added                Lewis acid to increase the electronphilicity of the electron-poor               olefin will be studied in each case.  The generation of diradicals              or zwitterions from suitably substituted cyclopropanes and                      cyclobutanes will be used for initiation of polymerization of other             monomers.  The photochemical behavior of these systems will be                  compared to the thermal reactions and a uniform mechanistic picture             will be established.  This study is a continuation of the principal             investigator's elucidation of the mechanism of spontaneous charge-              transfer polymerizations.                                                                                                                                            This research has as its aim to understand how, under certain              well-defined conditions, some monomer pairs can polymerize in the               absence of the usually needed initiating substances.  Greater                   control of the kinetics of polymerization and the resulting                     structures is a likely outcome.",
