 "awd_abstract_narration": "187Re is a radioactive isotope that decays with a half-                    life of about 4.6x1010 years to 187Os.  The 187Os of a                          system depends on the age of that system, the initial                           187Os/186Os ratio and the 187Re/186Os (where 186Os is used                      as the non-radiogenic osmium tracer).   The continental                         crust has 187Re/186Os about 100 times higher than the mantle                    so that the 187Os/186Os of the average continental crust                        with a mean age of about 20 billion years is about 10.5                         whereas osmium immediately derived from the mantle has a                        value of about 1.  The seawater 187Os/186Os of 8.5 implies                      that 80% of the present-day osmium supplied to the sea comes                    from the continents and 20% from oceanic mantle sources.                        This ratio of sources is expected to vary over time based on                    the marine 87Sr/86Sr record.  The hydrogenous fraction of                       oxidized deep-sea sediments and organic-rich reduced                            deposits from stratigraphically dated systems can provide                       records of past seawater 187Os/186Os.  The \"giant piston                        core\" from the central North pacific (LL GPC-3) and material                    from DSDP and ODP cores are ready sources for the study.                        The procedures involving leaching of the hydrogenous                            fraction of oxidized cores using dilute hydrogen peroxide                       have been developed.  Preliminary results shows a first                         order correlation with the marine 97Sr/86Sr record                              indicating that the relative roles of continental and                           oceanic mantle source affect both elements.  Imposed on this                    effect is the inverse relationship between 87Sr/86Sr and                        187Os/186Os in the latest Pleistocene indicating different                      sources for the two elements.  We will explore the full                         187Os/186Os seawater record over the past 100 million years,                    compare it with the known 87Sr/86Sr record and thereby to                       add to our understanding of the relationship of two                             different isotopic signatures to the geologic record of                         alteration and weathering.",
