 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309502  Reh    The development of the eye involves several different  interactions to organize the neural network of the retina and  the related non-neural pigment epithelium.  During early  developmental stages, cells called blastomeres have the  potential to later differentiate into progeny cells that can  become a variety of different types.  Later, the type of cell  which can arise from further cell divisions becomes more  restricted.  Work on transplanted cells from various stages  has shown that both intrinsic genetic factors and extrinsic  factors in the developing environment apparently influence  these cell fates to some degree.  This project uses an  innovative model of \"transdifferentiation\" and techniques of  immunocytochemistry and molecular biology.  The molecular  factors will be examined that determine the differences  arising during development between retinal neurons and retinal  pigment epithelial cells.  These studies involve the roles of  fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and their receptor molecules  as important extrinsic factors, and the role of a gene known  as CASH-1 which is expressed in retinal neural but not retinal  pigment epithelial cells, as an intrinsic factor in  developmental determination.  The results will have an impact  beyond developmental neuroscience alone, to understanding  formation of the visual system, and will have likely  health-related applications.   ***",
