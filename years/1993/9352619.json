 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to establish a Computer Integrated                            Manufacturing (CIM) environment for undergraduate level CIM                     lecture and laboratory course. This is a new course which will                  be offered for the first time in Fall 1993.The project is                       consistent with the objectives of the Department and the School                 of Engineering to develop CIM education. The main goals                         include: (a) providing a fundamental course and well-                           constructed lab experiments for undergraduate students so they                  can function better in a modern, industrial environment, (b)                    utilizing a state-of-the-art computer control system to                         integrate the many facets of a manufacturing facility, (c)                      furnishing an up-to-date medium for attracting and motivating                   minority and women students into engineering programs. The                      results of this project will be reported in professional and                    educational journals and conferences.At present, students learn                 the components (design, manufacturing, and business functions)                  of computer integrated manufacturing. They have no opportunity                  to integrate the knowledge taught separately in the respective                  subjects. The CIM laboratory is intended to challenge the                       students to experiment on integration and explore different                     levels of hierarchical control. The equipment which will be a                   part of the laboratory includes 486 Personal Computers which                    will be networked and integrated with the Engineering Computing                 Center, a Puma 560 Robot, Denford NC Machine, ASRS, and a                       closed loop conveyor.  A separate room has been allocated for                   the CIM Laboratory.",
