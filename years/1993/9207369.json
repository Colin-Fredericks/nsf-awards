 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the construction of visitor and                       graduate student housing                                                        units (totaling 8 bedrooms and associated shared living and                     kitchen facilities) at                                                          Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO).  In the last 4                       years SkIO has invested         a great deal in research                        equipment and facilities including the construction of a 32                     m circumference racetrack flume, an organic geochemistry                        laboratory, the purchase of an ICP-MS, a GC-MS, an image                        analyzer and a Silicon Graphics graphics workstation. The                       availability of these facilities and access to coastal                          marine environments has increased the demand for visitor                        housing to the extent  that current facilities (9 bedrooms                      total) are reserved approximately 18 months in advance.                         Since many research grants are only 24 months in duration,                      this long lead time is hampering collaborative research                         efforts.  Additional on-site housing is necessary for                           students and visitors because SkIO is located on a barrier                      island with no access to public transportation.  Given the                      excellent array of research facilities available for                            visiting faculty research and graduate student training, the                    institution is limited in the number of visitors that can be                    accommodated and students housed.  The Institute's                              remoteness from Savannah prevents students and visitors from                    seeking housing in town, for both cost and travel time                          considerations.                                                                                                                                                  * * *",
