 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predators may play an important role in the evolution                           of diet specialization in phytophagous insects.  This                           research will test the hypothesis that specialists are                          chemically and morphologically better defended against                          predation than generalists by offering both generalist                          and specialist lepidopteran larvae to two different                             invertebrate predators, Apiomerus pictipes (assassin                            bug) and Polistes carnifex (paper wasp) at Palo Verde                           National Park, Costa Rica.  To test separately for the                          importance of prey chemistry as a determinant of                                predator rejections, we will also offer caterpillar                             extracts to the same predators.  Results indicating                             that prey chemistry is an important deterrent to                                predators would only provide relatively weak evidence                           that plant chemistry is also important.  Therefore, to                          test the importance of plant chemistry we will also                             rear specialist caterpillars on artificial diets                                containing varying amounts of host plant and offer                              those caterpillars and their extracts to the predators.                                                                                                         Diet breadth of phytophagous insects is an important                            and current issue to evolutionary biology and ecology,                          including the potential for herbivorous insects to                              become serious agricultural pests.  This project is the                         first to test the combined importance of plant                                  chemistry and predation in determining diet breadth.",
