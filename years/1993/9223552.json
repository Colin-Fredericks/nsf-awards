 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is synthesize and measure properties of               high temperature superconductors.  In general, it is proposed to                extend previous copper-oxide studies to more complex systems and                investigate whether a reduced Madelung energy allows for a cross-               over from more ionic to covalent bonding in the superconducting                 phase of the n-type superconductors.  Specifically, eight topics                associated with narrow-band phenomena in solids are addressed:  1)              the transition from a superconductor to a conventional metal; 2)                the critical feature of high temperature superconductivity in n-                type superconductors; 3) measurements of frequency of charge                    fluctuation in systems below 150 K; 4) use of low-temperature                   synthetic procedures to make metal oxides with unusual valence                  states; 5) study of narrow-band phenomena in vanadium oxides; 6)                investigation of low-spin vs. high-spin configurations in cobalt                compounds; 7) examination of overlapping redox potentials in                    solids; and 8) exploration of variation of properties of                        monochalcogenides and pnictides due to the placement of redox                   couples with respect to the valence-bond edge.  The ultimate aim is             to pin point what is the essential confluence of properties that                makes possible the high temperature phenomenon.                                                                                                                 There is no consensus as to the mechanism responsible for high-                 temperature superconductivity in copper oxides, even six years                  after the discovery of the phenomenon.  This proposal addresses                 this issue on a relatively broad front by bringing together                     experimental techniques and conceptual thinking from both chemistry             and physics.  In general, it is proposed to extend previous copper-             oxide studies to more complex systems.  Materials exhibiting                    narrow-band phenomena are prepared and characterized, and eight                 topics are addressed to pin point what is the essential confluence              of properties that makes possible the high temperature phenomenon.",
