 "awd_abstract_narration": "Use of causal networks for problem-solving has been an active              research area in AI, but current methods are limited because of                 their complexity and the difficulty of obtaining the needed causal              knowledge.  It is proposed here that these problems could be                    overcome by applying neural network methods directly to causal                  networks.  To test this hypothesis, this project will 1) derive                 methods for formulating probabilistic inferences as highly                      parallel, strictly local computations, and 2) derive methods for                learning causal relationships and their associated probabilities                from case data.  Unlike past neural modeling work, these methods                will directly act on causal networks without requiring their own                separate networks.  Properties of these methods, such as systems                convergence, will be analyzed using theories of stochastic                      processes and dynamic systems.  Measurement of approximation errors             will be developed.  Computer simulations using different causal                 networks will be performed to verify the theoretical results and to             select important parameters such as annealing and learning rates.               The main contribution of this work is expected to be the                        development of new, potentially more efficient inference and                    learning methods that enjoy the advantages of both causal networks              and neural networks.  They can be used in expert systems for                    diagnosis, theory formation, decision support, and other                        applications involving probabilistic reasoning.  It will also                   provide a concrete example of high level inference using neural                 network methods that make direct use of an AI representation.//",
