 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decreases in stratospheric ozone over the Antarctic result in an                increase in the ultraviolet radiation flux in the euphotic zone                 of the ocean.  This increase may lead to cellular damage in                     aquatic organisms resulting in photo-inhibition and decreased                   productivity.  Cellular damage can occur either intracellularly,                or externally at the cell surface from biomolecular reactions                   with externally-generated reactive transient species.                           Extracellular damage will depend to a large degree on the                       photochemistry of the seawater surrounding the cell.  To date,                  little is known about the photochemistry of the unique Antarctic                waters.  This project integrates a field and laboratory approach                to obtain baseline information regarding the marine                             photochemistry of the euphotic zone in Antarctica waters as                     related to changes in ultraviolet radiation levels.  In situ                    photochemical production rates and steady state concentrations of               a suite of reactive species and dissolved organic matter                        degradation products as well as downwelling ultraviolet radiation               will be measured.  Additionally, flux by in situ chemical                       actinometry, action spectra for photochemical production of various             reactive species and dissolved organic matter degradation products,             and fluorescence and absorbance properties of dissolved organic                 matter will be determined.  This information will serve as a                    basis for understanding and predicting the effects of ultraviolet               radiation-induced marine photochemical processes on the                         productivity and ecology in the euphotic zone of the Antarctic                  Ocean.",
