 "awd_abstract_narration": "9219208  Pujol         This project involves the determination of seismic wave  attenuation using VSP (Vertical Seismic Profiling) data recorded  in a 4-km-deep pilot borehole next to the super-deep borehole   currently being drilled in Germany (expected to reach between 10  and 12 km).  In spite of extensive research, attenuation mechanisms  are not well understood, and even its measurement is plagued with  uncertainty, as wave amplitudes are also modified by wave  propagation effects generally only approximately known.  For this  reason, VSP data offer the best chance to observe the actual   change in the amplitude and shape of seismic waves with the minimum  amount of interference.  The importance of the German deep-  drilling program for this proposal is two-fold.  (1) The borehole  is one of the very few drilled in crystalline rocks.  Very little  information about attenuation in this type of rocks is available.   (2) Several zero-offset VSP data sets for different seismic sources  have been collected.  Explosive, vibrator, and impact sources have  been used to generate P and S waves.  This is an exceptional data  set that will be used to study the influence of the type of source  and the frequency content of the waves on the measurement of  attenuation, a matter on which little or no research has been  carried out so far because of the unavailability of data.         Although the measurement of attenuation (Q) using VSP data is  the most reliable technique and getting a number for Q is a rather  straightforward procedure, there are a number of factors that  affect the measurements.  In fact, different methods of measurement  (e.g., spectral ratio, rise time) and even the choice of a tapering  window may affect the results.  In addition, wave propagation in  the real earth affects wave amplitudes and frequency content  because of scattering and the filtering effect of thin layers.  For  this reason, the main goal of this research will be the computation  of reliable intrinsic Q values and a  study of the factors that  affect it.  This will be the most detailed information on  attenuation in crystalline rocks and will be extremely useful to  calibrate the attenuation that  may be determined from the analysis  of high-quality reflection seismic data collected in the borehole  area.  ***",
