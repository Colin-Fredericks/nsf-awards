 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312252  Muller  This proposal concerns the theoretical investigation of the  dynamics of quantum spin systems. It is broken into three related  areas: 1) Dynamics of 1D and 2D quantum antiferromagnets. The  numerical technique of analysis will be the recursion method which  makes it possible to extract information on the gaps in the  excitation spectrum, ordering in the ground state, infrared  singularities in spectral densities etc. 2) Transport of spin  fluctuations at high temperature. Spin diffusion will be studied in  classical and quantum systems using a mix of direct simulation and  recursion methods. At stake is the controversy over the long-time  behavior of spin relaxation time. 3) Quantum chaos in spin  dynamics. The spin-boson model will be employed for a study of  incipient quantum chaos by looking at the quantum invariants of  time averages of non-conserved observables. This allows for direct  comparisons with manifestations of Hamiltonian chaos in  corresponding classical model systems.  %%%  The work here involves study of spin (magnetic) systems using a  variety of numerical techniques - the principal of which is the so-  called recursion method. This method has a rich history in  condensed matter thoery but has been applied only recently to spin  dynamics. The spin to which we refer is that of electrons in a  lattice; usually \"tied\" reasonably tightly to lattice sites. Of  particular interest are the dynamics of spin diffusion and of spin  relaxation in model magnetic systems. Lastly, the PI proposes to  study the onset of quantum chaos (ie non-integrability) in spin  systems. A methodology is proposed to allow comparison between  quantum systems and their classical counterparts.  ***",
