 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312615  Carter    Agricultural liberalization in Madagascar has  had disappointing results: agricultural  production per capita has declined since  reforms began.  This dissertation research  project will attempt to explain in  microeconomic terms the fallacies in the logic  of liberalization which have produced these  unexpected outcomes.  The candidate,  Christopher B. Barrett, working under the  supervision of Prof. Michael R. Carter, of the  Department of Agricultural Economics, of the  University of Wisconsin - Madison, will collect  market-structure data on ten villages in one of  Madagascar's principal agricultural regions,  the Vakinankaratra area of the Central  Highlands.  The cooperating Malagasy  institution, the Centre d'Etudes Economiques of  the Universite d'Antananarivo, under the  direction of Dr. Pepe Andrianomanana, will  assist in identifying informants.  These data  will be analyzed in conjunction with existing  data already gathered from a variety of  sources, including an 825-household Malagasy  farm management study fielded in 1990.  The  researcher will use the data to test a  microeconomic theory of peasant response to  risk in an imperfect market environment.      The conventional, reductionist approach, which  identifies prices as levels and represents  markets by price levels alone, predicts  relatively uniform producer response across  households.  The proposed approach would add  three intuitive insights to the conventional  model:  that prices are distributions, that  markets are not uniform in the way they  transmit price signals, and that farm-level,  non-price constraints bind differentially  across producers and commodities.  The  potential practical benefit would be a new  perspective that could improve the design of  agricultural liberalization programs.  ***",
