 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study continues research on the decomposition of organic              matter, which comprises a major fraction of carbon in the ocean.                The study is directed toward further defining pathways and rates of             organic matter decomposition in the oceanic water column, from                  production in surface waters, through the zones of remineralization             in the water column, to preservation in the underlying sediments.               The decomposition of organic matter is one of the major processes               controlling the chemical composition of seawater and sediments. On              a global scale, oxic decomposition is the major pathway of                      degradation in marine sediments, with anaerobic processes consuming             much less organic matter.  However, the majority of carbon                      preservation occurs in anoxic systems, typically coastal marine                 sediments where organic matter sedimentation rates are highest.                 Understanding the controls on organic matter decomposition and                  carbon preservation is a key to interpreting changes in sedimentary             carbon content, and thus paleoproductivity of the oceans.                                                                                                            The major goals of this research are to investigate the                    formation of methane from, methylamines in particulate matter, to               measure the effects of adsorption and desorption of organic                     compounds on their decomposition rates and mechanisms, to determine             the influence of oxic vs anoxic conditions on decomposition, and to             explore the use of cell-surface enzymes in the decomposition of                 amino acids and amines by phytoplankton and bacteria.",
