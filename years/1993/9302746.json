Constraint  logic programming languages, and their generalizations in the cc  framework, combine constraint handling and (don't know)  nondeterminism; they are particularly appealing for a variety of  combinatorial search problems for which they offer a short  development time and a good efficiency.  However there is still a  difference in efficiency between special-purpose algorithms  written in procedural languages and constraint programs.    The research aims at reducing further the gap between constraint  and procedural programming by using global compilation  techniques.  Global compilation will be based on abstract  interpretation, a systematic framework for dataflow analysis,  which has been studied intensively in the logic programming  community.  Recent results have indicated that abstract  interpretation of logic programming can be performed with a  reasonable efficiency and that significant benefits in efficiency  can be achieved.    The main result of the research will be the design and  implementation of optimizing compilers for two languages: cc(FD)  (a constraint language over finite sets of integers) and cc(Q) a  constraint language over rational linear arithmetic).  Beside the  traditional Prolog optimizations, the global optimizations  considered include constraint specialization, detection of  determinacy, elimination of redundant constraints, exploitation  of independent subsystems, and constraint clustering.  New  results in abstract interpretation may also be expected.  In  particular, new frameworks and algorithms, including reexecution-  based analysis and forwards/backwards analysis, the impact of  granularity on efficiency and accuracy, and new domains will be  studied.  ***",
