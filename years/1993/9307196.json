 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307196  Comstock    Transpiration is the unavoidable water loss from a plant incurred  during photosynthesis. Several methods are employed in this study  to better understand the ways in which very high rates of  transpiration limit plant performance, and what specializations  can enable plants to endure them. The study focuses on the  performance of arid-land plants, and examines both physiological  mechanisms and population-level adaptation. A new climatic index  is proposed, which ranks sites in terms of the evaporative demand  of the environment  during growing season. Preliminary evidence  suggests that this index explains population-level genetic  differentiation in key water-use characteristics of warm-desert  shrubs. Special attention is given to the importance of the  capacity for water transport between root and shoot. It is  suggested that this is often a key limiting factor constraining  maximum tolerable transpiration rate, and therefore limits  photosynthetic activity under conditions of high temperature and  low humidity. Specific mechanistic models of how transpiration  rate is sensed and controlled will be tested. Water-use  characters under study include leaf gas-exchange with the  atmosphere, functional measures of liquid water transport  capacity, transport tissue anatomy, and humidity treatments  during growth, drought studies, and pressurization of the soil  volume to control leaf water status. These experiments will  contribute directly to understanding the environmental physiology  of arid-land plants i particular, but the principles under study  are general constraints experienced by all terrestrial plants.  The results will be pertinent to all environmental biologists  interested in either natural or cultivated plant systems  ***",
