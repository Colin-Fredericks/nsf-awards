 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Czech Joint Fund research project between                               Dr. Blanka Wichterlova, Heyrovsky Institute of                                  Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, Czech                                  Academy of Sciences, and Dr. Kamil Klier, Lehigh                                University, is in the field of structure and                                    activity of heterogeneous catalysts.  The                                       researchers propose to study catalytic NOx                                      abatement, primarily in non-reducing atmosphere                                 exhaust gases and emissions of stationary sources                               such as power stations.  The goal of decomposing                                NO in a neutral or oxidizing atmosphere presents                                a well-recognized scientific challenge with                                     practical impact for the world environment.  The                                researchers will examine the relations between                                  the structure and activity of metal oxide -                                     zeolite based catalysts.  Both theoretical and                                  experimental studies of sophisticated models and                                real catalyst structures will be carried out.                                   Results may be helpful in designing a catalyst                                  with the optimum activation of the NO molecule                                  and exhibiting sufficiently fast oxygen                                         desorption.                                                                                                                                                     This research in chemistry and catalysis fulfills                               the program objective of advancing scientific                                   knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S.                               and Czech Republic to combine complementary                                     talents and pool research resources in areas of                                 strong mutual interest and competence.  Funds for                               the project are awarded through the US-Czech                                    Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance with                                          established guidelines.",
