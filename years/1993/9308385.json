The approach will be  primarily empirical and comparative, with the experiences of a  variety of countries during both the postwar and interwar periods  being considered.  Three basic questions about the operation of  monetary policy will be addressed:  (1) How do we go about deciding whether a given monetary policy  is \"tight\" or \"easy\"?  That is, are there reliable indicators of  monetary policy stance?  (2) How do changes in monetary policy have their effects on the  economy, i.e., what is the monetary transmission mechanism?  (3)  What is the best general framework or strategy for  conducting monetary policy -- rules, discretion, or something  else?    The largest portion of the research will be on monetary  transmission, with a dominant theme being the role of capital  market imperfections.  In the postwar context, the project uses  data from a variety of countries to address whether monetary  policy works primarily by affecting the quantity of the  transactions medium (the traditional \"money view\") or the  quantity of bank lending (the \"lending view\").  The project  quantifies the relative importance of the two channels and  considers some alternative ways in which capital market  imperfections affect monetary transmission.  In the interwar  context, the project uses multi-country data sets in order to  assess the relative importance of nominal rigidities such as  sticky wages and of deflation-induced financial distress in  transmitting monetary shocks.  ***",
