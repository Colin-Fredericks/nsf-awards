 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301801  Dusenbery   The magnetotail of the Earth's magnetosphere, including the plasma  sheet and its boundary layers, plays a major role in energy storage  and its subsequent release, energizing particles during magnetic  substorms.  The current sheet is generally regarded as the primary  locus of tail energization.  We propose to carry out four research  projects in magnetotail physics: 1) particle motion in a nonzero y-  component of the tail magnetic field at the current sheet, 2)  trigger mechanisms of the current sheet catastroophe model, 3)  neutral line signatures and modeling, and 4) dynamics of the plasma  sheet boundary layer.  Project 1 involves tools from nonlinear  particle dynamics such as orbit analysis, Poincare surface-of-  section plots, and the underlying invariants. A 1D hybrid  simulation code will be used for Project 2 to investigate kinetic  instabilities as an internal trigger for the current sheet  catastrophe model.  A single-particle simulation model will be used  to model ion distributions near a neutral line for Project 3.  The  last project examines the equilibrium structure and nonlinear  evolution of a sheared, inhomogeneous plasma sheet boundary layer  using a Vlasov model exended to include multi-ion species.  A 2-  1/2D particle simulation model will also be used to study nonlinear  evolution of the boundary with high ion density gradients.  The  overall theme of the proposed research is to understand the role of  microscopic and mesoscale processes on the global dynamics of the  current sheet and the plasma sheet boundary layer regions of the  Earth's magnetotail.     ***",
