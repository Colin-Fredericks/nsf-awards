 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a research conference in                   differential equations.  It combines the activities of two                      conference series which were held for many years in the                         southeastern and midwestern regions of the country.  They provide               an opportunity for exchanges among the many investigators of the                regions who are otherwise not funded.  In addition, funds are                   directed primarily for subsistence and travel for graduate                      students and young researchers.  A smaller fraction is directed                 toward expenses of principal speakers, some of whom must                        travel considerable distances.                                                       There is appreciable support provided by the University of                 Kentucky and the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications.                Combining these funds with those of the Foundation, it is                       expected that a conference attracting over 175 participants                     with100-120 scheduled talks will be possible.  In all, this                     amounts to an excellent investment of public funds.",
