 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop an innovative instructional software                  system which will increase visual reasoning capabilities of                     engineering students. We will provide a learning system with                    which a student can develop visualizing and spatial reasoning                   capabilities in a self-paced series of exercises. Specifically,                 we will take the missing view problem which forms the                           foundation for all visual reasoning processes. This problem                     requires both visual analysis and visual synthesis, and has                     been identified as the one for which students show immense                      diversity in their solving capabilities. We will draw from                      solid modeling and artificial intelligence technology and the                   power of interactive computer graphics to implement such an                     instructional system. The system will capture and critique the                  reasoning steps of each student. The system will select a                       suitable level of difficulty based on perceived capability of                   the student in solving previous problems so that a suitable                     path of exercises can be provided for each student. The system                  will provide a discovery-oriented learning environment where                    the students develop visual reasoning skills from their own                     accumulated experiences guided by the system.                                   The software system will be tested and evaluated in the                         laboratory curriculum of Engineering Graphics and Design course                 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This is a                    required course of most disciplines in the College of                           Engineering. The software system will then be ported to diverse                 computing platforms and disseminated to other institutions                      nationwide. The project results will also be disseminated by                    holding workshops in ASEE meetings.",
