 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides ongoing support to The Jackson                              Laboratory, a private, non-profit research institution, to                      continue their Research Experience for Undergraduates Site.                     Undergraduate science students with exceptional ability have                    been participating as research apprentices since 1929 at The                    Jackson Laboratory, . Twelve undergraduates, selected from                      300 applicants nationwide, are exposed to all aspects of the                    research process by conducting hands-on, basic research in                      mammalian genetics for 10 or 12 weeks in the summer  under                      the sponsorship of staff scientists. The students' projects                     are components of their sponsors' independent, investigator-                    initiated research programs. Inbred and mutant laboratory                       mice are utilized in many projects. All students are from                       outside the host institution; about half are from                               baccalaureate colleges.  Students with diverse science                          preparations are accepted, with each participant's project                      tailored to his or her background . Students' work at the                       bench is supplemented by group sessions on careers, ethics,                     critical scientific thinking, and a formal student                              symposium. Follow-up activities, including affiliations with                    graduate schools, foster the students' continuing                               participation in science. 100% of the  REU participants who                     have graduated are now in graduate or medical school or are                     employed in science. Long-term studies of program alumni                        show that a very high percentage receive doctoral degrees in                    the biological sciences or medicine.",
