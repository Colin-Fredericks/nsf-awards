 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318063  McClure  Rochester General Hospital (RGH) has an extensive internal network  (RGHNET) that services all of the buildings on the campus,  providing state-of-the-art computing and communications services to  over 1500 educators, researchers, clinicians, administrators and  students.  A major teaching facility offering primary, secondary  and tertiary levels of care, Rochester General Hospital is  constantly seeking innovative technologies that maximize the  abilities of hospital staff.  The following are a few important  examples of the wide range of services available through the  INTERNET that can enhance productivity and clinical care at  Rochester General.  Physicians participating in clinical trials can  log patient-care data and share this data on a national basis,  surgeons will have access to vascular and trauma registries and  medical images, administrators and residents in the independent  residency programs will have access to the AAMC electronic  residency application service, nurse researchers will have access  to the Sigma Theta Tau National Nursing Research Library, educators  can use the INTERNET to acquire and transmit curricular materials,  pharmacists will be able to exchange protocols for new drugs, and  the library will use the INTERNET to offer enhanced reference and  document delivery services.  Such access will greatly assist the  hospital in \"building a superior system of care which meets the  lifelong health needs of our community.\"  Initially, the clinicians, educators and researchers at Rochester  General will be the primary users of the INTERNET. But the impact  of the INTERNET link will extend beyond RGH to its corporate  partners.  As well, the circuit librarians based in the Health  Sciences Library will provide INTERNET training and linkages to the  practitioners in the rural hospitals surrounding Rochester.",
