 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies a new model of computation, which  extends  the object-oriented model with timing constraints  and resource  requirements  specifications.  A  set of scenarios (a set of applications  executing at a time)  and a scenario change  mechanism that allows for  different sets of applications to be  executed according to  the situation are defined.  These scenario changes are triggered by  an error handler, by an operator or  by a user.  Scenario  changes also allow uniformity in multiple types of   fault-tolerant behavior such as graceful degradation, load-shedding,  etc..    The latency of these scenario  changes and quantify their  applicability to real-time and  non-real-time systems are studied.  Methods are  developed for the  detection of situations in which these scenario changes can  be applied, and develop a theory for the adaptation of these  scenario changes  to non-time-constrained applications and  systems.  More accurate models are  developed based on  real-life  workloads and situations, to model realistic  fault models,  encompassing transient as well as permanent  faults.  These are  of temporal or physical nature (e.g.,  transient overloads, site  crashes or  link failures).   The  implementation of a prototype of a fault-tolerant   real-time  system that  supports this model of computation follows.",
