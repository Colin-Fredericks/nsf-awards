 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Section of Vertebrate Paleontology of Carnegie Museum of                    Natural History will over three years institute major                           improvements of collection facilities in Vertebrate Paleontology,               specifically installation of a modern moveable compactor system                 in the collection area, thereby increasing storage capacity by                  approximately 110%.  These improvements will promote and advance                study, maintenance, and conservation of the paleontological                     collections, which are international stature and importance.                    These collections include over 100,000 specimens, ranging in age                from Late Silurian to Quaternary and encompassing all vertebrate                classes.  Field research projects add specimens at the average                  rate of 2500 per year.  The paleontology collection areas include               two large rooms in the Museum's basement as well as space set                   aside for collections in the second floor office complex.  These                areas are filled to current capacity, with the result that large                parts of the collections are difficult to access and crowded past               optimal conditions.  The only solution to these crowded                         conditions is to increase density of the collections, which is                  best accomplished by compactors.  Data verification of the                      Section's computerized database will accompany rehousing                        specimens in compactors.  Previous Carnegie Institute commitments               to this project include computerization of the collections and                  additions to the staff of two full time preparators/collection                  managers (the latter to be implemented in 1993).  Compactor                     installation will be preceded by development of environmental                   controls and renovation of spaces occupied by the collections.                  %%%                                                                             Collections of this type comprise a nationally important suite of               resources that serve to facilitate a much broader array of                      activities than just current research.  They are key resources                  for educational endeavors important to all age groups and levels                of specification.  They provide the documentary data base for the               past history of life on earth.  They are important repositions                  for materials awaiting the attention of future generations.",
