The primary goals in this undertaking are to  develop quantitatively accurate models for describing the molecular  organization, to identify subtle changes in this structure which  arise during synthesis or processing and to correlate this  microstructural variation with changes in the electrical or mass  transport properties.  An additional goal will be to elucidate key  size-scaling relationships and other novel properties that result  from the subtle interplay of various competing interactions at the  molecular level within these highly anisotropic guest-host  composites.  Both x-ray and neutron scattering will be employed in  combination with highly refined modeling algorithms which have been  modified to accommodate the special structure characteristics  intrinsic to polymeric materials.  %%%  This project is an intensive investigation of the fundamental  submicroscopic structure of conducting polymers--a novel and  technological important class of polymers.  Objectives are to  develop quantitatively accurate models for describing the molecular  organization, to identify subtle changes in this structure which  arise during synthesis or processing, and finally to correlate  these microstructural variations with changes in other physical  properties (e.g., electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, or  mass diffusion).  In addition to resolving issues directly related  to conducting polymers and their applications, the experimental  probes and data analysis techniques developed in this research will  enable analogous studies of structure in more conventional polymer  host materials.  ***",
