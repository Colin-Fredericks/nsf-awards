 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in molecular cloning technologies have made it                         possible to generate                                                            large quantities of diverse proteins in micro-organisms, in                     order to study the biological and physical properties of                        these proteins. The Department of Biochemistry at the                           University of Virginia has a long history of biophysical                        studies on diverse biological systems and several of the                        faculty, particularly the faculty recently recruited, have                      research projects designed around studies of such                               recombinant proteins. Of the 13 full time faculty, 8 are                        either using recombinant proteins or plan to use them in the                    near future.                                                                                                                                                    One problem with this approach to the generation of research                    material is in                                                                  assembling the hardware necessary for the isolation of these                    proteins from bacterial, or other types of, cells. We have                      not had a long history of bacteriology or large scale                           protein purification and so our resources which were once                       adequate for our biochemical needs are now completely                           inadequate for generation of recombinant proteins. This                         shortfall is compounded by the fact that for many of the                        projected biophysical studies particularly large amounts of                     protein are required.                                                                                                                                           We propose to purchase the basic instrumentation for                            moderate scale isolation of recombinant proteins from E.                        coli, yeast, and other cells.",
