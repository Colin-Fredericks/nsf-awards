 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314098 Pukkila It is known that during meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and then synapse in association with the synaptonemal complex (SC).  The source of specificity for homologous pairing is not understood.  It has not been possible to obtain direct evidence for DNA DNA interactions that could mediate homologous pairing in any system, although such interactions remain an attractive possibility to provide the required specificity.   %%% We have discovered that prior to meiosis, a genome wide homology search occurs in C. cinereus that results in the methylation of duplicated sequences.  We propose to ask if the same genes control the homology searches that result in MIP (methylation induced premeiotically) and the homology searches that result in meiotic pairing.  We will monitor the occurence of MIP in vegetative dikaryotic cells from wild type and from three meiotic mutants in which chromosome synapsis is defective.  If we can demonstrate an association between a MIP defect and pairing defect, we would have a powerful and unique assay to identify genes required for homology recognition, which should permit an understanding of the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosome pairing. ***",
