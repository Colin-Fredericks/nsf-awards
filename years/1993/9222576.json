 "awd_abstract_narration": "Convective storms are of fundamental interest to scientists as             well as important to the general public.  Such storms produce                   severe weather that is economically disruptive and life-threatening             as well as producing beneficial rainfall.  Accurate short term                  predictions (up to 24 hours) of the location, timing, intensity and             type of convective storm would be of substantial benefit to                     society.                                                                             Using the Advanced Regional Prediction System numerical model              developed at a NSF Science and Technology Center, Center for                    Analysis and Prediction of Storms, the Principal Investigator will              attack various aspects of prediction of convective activity.  By                using broader parameter spaces as well as higher spatial                        resolution, more realistic methods for inserting                                pseudo-observational errors into the simulations during storm                   evolution, and a more accurate method for treating subgrid-scale                motions, the Principal Investigator will evaluate the utility of                various dynamical parameters in predicting storm behavior within a              variety of environmental settings; examine linkages between                     helicity and energy dissipation; and attempt to understand how                  errors grow and propagate in convective storms so as to establish               predictability limits as a function of storm type, environment and              other parameters.",
