 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phase II effort will address three basic topics related                to the abrasive suspension jet (ABJ) process.  First, a study will              be conducted on suspension preparation and the effect of                        rheological characteristics on jet coherency and cutting                        performance.  The rheological characteristics of the suspension                 will be modeled and correlated with the jet's structure and the                 resultant machining performance.  The second topic is related to                nozzle optimization and jet flow modeling and will also involve                 exploring alternative nozzle concepts and new materials.  The                   suspension acceleration process and the jet's structure will be                 modeled.  The third area of study will address the jet-material                 interaction process for cutting and drilling.  Previously developed             abrasive water jet (AWJ) models will be used to guide the                       development of an ASJ cutting prediction model.  Jet and jet-                   material interface visualization techniques will be used in this                program.  The results of this work will be used in parallel                     engineering efforts on pump development for commercialization.                       The technology developed under this program will have                      significant direct and indirect effects in several commercial                   fields.  The high-velocity flow of ASJs will introduce a new                    cutting beam to the machining industry.  The ASJ beam is highly                 efficient and capable of machining any material.  Cutting,                      drilling, turning, milling, polishing, deburring, and other                     machining operations could be performed with the same tool.",
