 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiences of structural failures                                              in past earthquakes have shown that                                             shearwalls offer excellent                                                      protection for buildings in seismic                                             regions.  As compared to the                                                    cantilever shearwalls, the framed                                               shearwalls have an additional                                                   advantage inasmuch as the wall                                                  panels can be used as sacrificial                                               elements to absorb seismic energy                                               and protect the main structural                                                 frame.                                                                                                                                                          When a framed shearwall is under                                                earthquake action, the wall panels                                              inside the frame are subjected to                                               shearing action.  Considerable                                                  controversy has been raised in the                                              past regarding the effectiveness of                                             wall panels in developing shear                                                 ductility.  Recent experimental                                                 studies in reinforced concrete show                                             that shear ductility can indeed be                                              obtained in wall panels, if the                                                 reinforcement are correctly                                                     designed.  Additionally, the                                                    development of truss model theories                                             allows for the prediction of shear                                              ductility.  These experimental and                                              theoretical advancements have laid                                              down the foundation for a                                                       scientific treatment of the                                                     behavior of framed shearwalls.                                                                                                                                  This proposal is to study the                                                   behavior of framed wall panels                                                  subjected to monotonic, cyclic and                                              dynamic loading.  The research is                                               designed to clarify the interaction                                             of the wall panels and the frame                                                members, so that the effect of the                                              frame constraints on the shear                                                  ductility of a wall panel can be                                                evaluated.  Based on the static and                                             dynamic behavior observed in the                                                proposed tests, a simple method                                                 will be developed for the design of                                             framed shear walls.                                                                                                                                             This research will be carried out                                               jointly by the University of                                                    Houston in the United States and                                                the Tongji University in Shanghai,                                              China.  It will be part of the US-                                              PRC Cooperative Program, Annex 3 -                                              Cooperation in Earthquake Studies.                                              The University of Houston will                                                  study the monotonic and cycle                                                   behavior of framed wall panels                                                  using the universal panel tester.                                               Dynamic tests of framed wall panels                                             simulating earthquake action will                                               be performed at Tongji University                                               using a shaking table.",
