 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. K.C. Chang, Mr. Yang-Jin Pak will                    collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze                     materials excavated by Chinese archaeologists at the site of                    Yanqing in northeastern China. Preliminary analysis indicates                   that they date to the Bronze Age of the first millennium B.C.                   More than 500 burials were discovered in three locations along                  with many different kinds of rich and distinctive artifacts,                    numbering as many as 20,000. All are single burials with no                     indications on the surface. In addition to a wide variety of                    objects made of bronze, gold, silver, bone and jade, many of the                graves contain sacrificed animals such as horses, cattle, sheep                 and dogs. The richness of these materials provides Mr. Pak with                 an excellent opportunity to reconstruct the organization of the                 society of which the deceased individuals formed a part. Mr. Pak                will describe the material and conduct a statistical analysis to                determine how different types of artifacts are distributed among                individuals. On this basis it will be possible to examine the                   degree of differential treatment and address questions such as                  the extent of social stratification and how this relates to                     factors such as the age and sex of the individual.                                                                                                              One of the world's great civilizations arose in China and found                 its first expression during the bronze age. To speak of one                     civilization however is probably not correct given the size of                  the country and the numbers of cultures present. While much is                  known about the prehistory of the central region, very little                   information is available about the Northern area. Preliminary                   evidence indicates that during the bronze age this region was                   distinct and what is probably more interesting is the fact that                 people were primarily nomadic. In a worldwide context, such a                   situation is extremely unusual and the data collected by Mr. Pak                with shed new light on how complex society can develop within                   this subsistence context. This in turn will increase out                        understanding of the development of social complexity itself.                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed new light                 on how complex societies develop and assist in the training of a                promising young scientist.",
