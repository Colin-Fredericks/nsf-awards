In these studies, a simplified \"brain\" or ganglion, which controls the heartbeat in invertebrates will be used.  This cardiac ganglion contains only 9 nerve cells (or neurons), so it is relatively easy to study.  The cardiac ganglion must receive input from other parts of the nervous system, from circulating hormones, and from the heart muscle its elf, and then integrate this information to finally produce an output that regulates the heartbeat in a way appropriate to the animal's needs.  How can such a simple neural network produce a behavioral output that is capable of changing to suit the animal's needs?  Even though the wiring of the circuit is fixed, its output is not.  One of the ways output from the network can be changed is by altering the properties of one of the component cells in the network.  A chemical that changes the properties of a part of the network is called a neuromodulator.  In this research, Dr. Freschi will learn how certain neuromodulators (acetylcholine and proctolin) cause changes in component neurons of the cardiac ganglion.  He will study how the electrical properties of neurons are changed and what biochemical processes are responsible for those changes.  He will use electrophysiological techniques to measure the electrical changes in nerve cells, biochemical techniques to measure intracellular chemical changes caused by neuromodulators, and histochemical techniques to measure the location of various neuromodulators or neurotransmitter chemicals that are affected by neuromodulators. ***",
