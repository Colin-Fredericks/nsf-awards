 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the renewal of funding of the Materials                       Research Group at the University of Wisconsin at Madison on the                 topic of weak links, interfaces, and mechanisms of high                         temperature superconductivity.  The original award (DMR-8911332)                provided funding for a period of forty two months.  The research                to be performed under this award is a combination of continuation               of research started under the original award plus new areas under               the same general topic.  Research to be continued includes                      coupled electromagnetic and microstructural characterization of                 flux-grown yttrium-barium-copper oxide bicrystals, cation-doped                 bicrystals, doped and undoped single crystals, melt-processed and               solid state sintered polycrystals, as well as development of a                  high-speed position-sensitive atom  probe.  New programs starting               under this award include coupled local electrical and                           microstructural characterization by patterning of thin-film and                 bulk-scale superconducting materials, coupled electromagnetic and               microstructural  characterization of step-edge superconducting                  junctions, coupled electromagnetic and microstructural                          characterization of grain boundaries in bismuth-strontium-calcium-              copper oxide bicrystals, studies of local intergranular and                     intragranular compositional variations using the position-                      sensitive atom probe, characterization of the grain boundaries                  using high-spatial-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy,                and investigation of the superconducting gap as a function of                   temperature and  location in the Brillouin zone.                                %%%                                                                             The research is aimed at understanding why and how grain                        boundaries limit the transport critical current density of high                 temperature superconductivity.  This is one of the most important               problems in high temperature superconductivity.  The challenging                experimental procedures required for this research have been                    demonstrated in the first three years of the Materials Research                 Group.  The group is the only one to have performed coupled                     electromagnetic and microstructural characterization on the same                specimen of  superconducting  material.  The issue of critical                  current density must be solved to achieve the full potential of                 high temperature superconductivity for national technological                   competitiveness.",
