 "awd_abstract_narration": "A lot of effort in the recent past has been expended on                         theoretical development, algorithmic investigation,                             computational testing, and chemical engineering design and                      science applications of the local optimization algorithms for                   nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixed-integer nonlinear                         programming (MINLP) problems.  There now exist a number of                      local optimization algorithms and their efficient                               implementations that are used for small, medium, and large                      scale problems.  There has been much less systematic study on                   the theoretical developments, algorithmic methodology,                          computational testing, and application to chemical engineering                  design and science problems of global optimization approaches.                  The goal of this research is to develop and apply theoretical,                  algorithmic and computational techniques for global                             optimization problems (GOP) that arise in a variety of                          chemical engineering design and science applications.                                                                                                           The PI will investigate several classes of global optimization                  problems using a primal-relaxed dual global optimization                        algorithm.  In particular, he will focus on: (1) new                            properties and new formulations of the relaxed dual                             subproblems; (2) the design of phase and chemical reaction                      equilibrium systems; (3) the process synthesis of separations,                  heat recovery networks and reactor systems; (4) bilevel linear                  and nonlinear optimization problems arising in process design                   and control; (5) optimum structure(s) determination of                          clusters of atoms and molecules; and (6) the development of a                   parallel primal relaxed dual, GOP, approach.",
