In general such problems involve the need to assign objects to various groups, or classes.  Recent attempts to solve this problem  have employed linear programming methods and, in particular, neural networks.  In this research an approach will be developed that combines linear programming (specifically, traditional linear programming and/or linear goal programming) with neural networks   an approach that should prove to be a significant advance over earlier and ongoing attempts toward the development of such combinations.          Ongoing efforts toward neural network design/training via linear programming have failed to either consider or include an adequately rigorous treatment of the specifics of hardware replication.  The researchers will develop and evaluate a detailed representation of all pertinent network processing elements and connections in order  that direct replication via hardware ultimately be permitted.",
