 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the potential cues that initiate and                  maintain swarm behavior in the marine copepod, Dioithona oculata,               by computerized motion analysis to study individual and swarm                   responses to light intensity and pheromones.  A conceptual model                is presented for the swarming behavior pattern: diel light cycles               provide a releasor cue, a threshold light intensity provides an                 arousal cue, and gradients of light intensity elicit a swarming                 response.  Cues for individuals to orient in the swarm may be light             intensity, and/ or pheromones. The study will first determine                   photosensitivity by phototaxis, and response to chemical pheromone              signals by recording individual swimming tracks. The swimming                   behavior and spatial distribution of individuals in a swarm will be             quantified for laboratory swarms in experimental light gradients,               changes in light intensity, and presence of a swarm marker (beam of             light).  The life history stage composition of laboratory swarms                will be manipulated to test for the effect of pheromones from adult             females and other swarming stages.  Laboratory swarm behavior will              be compared to that of field swarms. Initially all experiments will             be conducted during midday until the presence or absence of                     circadian rhythms has been determined.  This study will help verify             the conceptual model of swarm behavior, provide a framework for                 interpreting in situ observations of zooplankton aggregation, and               provide mechanisms for explaining swarming which can be included in             mathematical models.",
