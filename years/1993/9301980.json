 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Seventh International Conference on Domain Decomposition               Methods in Scientific and Engineering Computing will be held at                 Penn State University from October 27 to 30, 1993.  Domain                      decomposition refers to a class of methods for the simulating                   large-scale scientific and engineering systems on computers.                    Using a divide-and conquer strategy to obtain the solution to a                 massive problem by combining the solutions to numerous smaller                  ones, domain decomposition offers the possibility of simulating                 systems that are too large and complex even for today's powerful                supercomputers using conventional solution methods.  Such                       problems include long term climate prediction and the study of                  global change and the design of space vehicles and structures.                  Among computational scientist, engineers, and mathematicians,                   domain decomposition techniques are of particularly intense                     interest now because they are well adapted to emerging high                     performance computer architectures.                                                  This conference will convene academic and industrial                       researchers in domain decomposition and allied areas in order to                disseminate recent advances and stimulate further development in                areas ranging from basic theoretical research on the analysis and               validation of domain decomposition algorithms to specific                       industrial applications.  The conference will enhance the                       technology transfer between academia and industry, and provide                  opportunities for students and young scientists and engineers to                become involved in this important new class of computational                    methods.  Graduate students, young researchers, women, minorities               and people with disabilities are being especially encouraged to                 attend the conference and to contribute papers.  The proceedings                of this conference will be published by the American Mathematical               Society and are expected to become an important resource for                    researcher and users of domain decomposition.",
