 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will complete the development of an experimental                  method for measuring in situ cosmogenic 14C (half-life=5730 yrs) in             common surficial terrestrial materials, and for making pilot                    studies of the method for investigating a few challenging                       geomorphic problems.  From the work carried out to date under NSF               grant, we have in hand an experimental method, potentially capable              of providing accurate and contamination-free (from environmental                14C) measurements of 14C concentrations.  Instead of the commonly               adopted method of high temperature fusion, we developed a wet in                vacuo method to determine the in situ 14C concentrations in the CO              and CO2 phases in the mineral quartz.  Environmental 14C does not               affect the 14CO measurements, but appears erratically as                        contamination in the 14CO2 measurement.  Since more than 60% of in              situ 14C appears in the CO phase, it is convenient to assay in situ             14C by measuring its activity in the CO phase.  During the first                year, work will primarily be directed towards the development of a              robust experimental technique to accurately measure in situ 14C                 concentration at levels of  >x104 atoms 14C/g quartz, and the                   determination of in situ 14C production rates in quartz at different            altitudes and latitudes.  The latter is a prerequisite for its                  applications.  In the second year, we propose to make some test                 applications of the in situ 14C method to a number of selected                  geomorphic problems. It may appear that little can be done in such              challenging problems in just one year but we are able to do this                because we have at a suite of diverse geomorphic samples in which               in situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al studies have made earlier in our               group.  We believe that among the various in situ radionuclides, 14C            should offer the most convenient approach for characterizing                    geomorphic surfaces, providing a firm basis for decisions for                   further analyses using other in situ radionuclides, e.g. 36Cl, 26Al             and 10Be, and the stable nuclide, 21Ne.  We are very anxious to                 complete the development of the experimental method to reliably                 measure in situ cosmogenic 14C in surficial samples, and to                     demonstrate its usefulness in geomorphology.  //",
