 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new modernized curriculum for teaching Engineering Design                     Graphics (EDG) was developed by Barr and Juricic as part of NSF                 Grant No. USE - 8854623 (1990). This project is based upon the                  theory that an engineering design graphics currIculum can be                    taught in a different way such that the learning and interest                   level of students that have varied backgrounds can be                           optimized.                                                                      The concept involves moving earlier in the semester the 3D                      modeling work which is used as a tool to explain traditional                    concepts of 20 orthographic work as it applies to design and                    manufacturing. Students can relate to 3D modeling easily since                  they have dealt with 3D objects since early childhood.                          The success of the theory hinges on utilizing an \"enhanced\" CAE                 Lab that is based on a unique \"LINKING\" hardware system that                    connects the instructor and individual students' computers                      allowing communication and individualized self-paced                            instruction.                                                                    This \"individualized\" approach will enhance the students'                       interest and desire to continue the study of engineering and                    allow them to exit the class with a more uniform level of                       knowledge and experience.",
