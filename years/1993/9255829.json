 "awd_abstract_narration": "PRIME Science provides an American adaptation of \"Salter's                      Science\"--a well-tested British multi-disciplinary science                      program for middle grades.  The science is balanced - not                       integrated - between life, earth and physical science,                          developing conceptual understanding and integrating                             mathematics, technology and decision-making.   The science                      is rigorous, interesting and useful to the student.  Among                      the major integrative themes that provide structure                             for grades six through ten are the earth in space,                              properties of matter, etc.  Each unit begins with an                            application.  The teachers' guides are directed at first                        year teachers,  not teaching in their major discipline.                         Included are student preconceptions, safety, background,                        ways of introducing the content and assessment items.                           The visually-stimulating, attractively-designed student                         supplements for each of the forty units contain the                             application, a summary of what students should know, what                       they need to learn and the activities the can do.  The                          materials are tested and rewritten by teachers and science                      educators at several sites throughout the US. Professors at                     the University of California/Berkeley review the materials                      for content accuracy.  The British developers are part of                       the design team.  The adaptation involves not only language                     translation, but changing data to interest American                             audiences and adding units to meet local interests and                          frameworks.",
