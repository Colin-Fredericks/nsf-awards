 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to develop applications of                       radiogenic isotope analysis to pelitic sediments that have been                 affected by a wide range of fluid-mediated diagenesis through low-              grade metamorphism.  Although data for clay-rich sediments imply                that they have a memory for fluid-rock interactions owing to their              limited permeability as compared with other basin sediments, much               isotope data lead to ambiguous results in part because analyzed                 samples are heterogeneous and contain unknown proportions of more               than one generation of fine-grained clay mineral.  This proposal is             a renewal of our current support, in which high resolution scanning             electron microscopy (STEM) is combined with isotopic analysis of                equivalent pelitic rocks.  The ultimate aim of these studies is to              determine the timing and extent of water-pelite interactions and                thus of basin- to regional-scale fluid/rock interactions.                            Having previously focused on Rb-Sr and development of Sm-Nk                methods, we now propose to develop the 40Ar/39Ar laser technique for            pelitic sediments, using well characterized samples (thin sections              and separates), and other isotopic techniques to provide supporting             data.  We intend to determine the limitations of the methods, both              with respect to spatial resolution and age.  Based on our previous              observations of shales and slates from a wide variety of                        occurrences, we have chosen to obtain data from bentonites (as                  standards having clays of a single origin) and shales from the                  Texas Gulf Coast and Welsh Sedimentary Basin, as well as other                  prograde sequences.  The latter is representative of diagenesis in              a passive marginal basin, whereas the former represents                         tectonically-induced dissolution and crystallization over the range             of diagenesis to greenschist facies conditions.  The samples from               each locality represent the complete range of diagenesis through                low-grade metamorphism.",
