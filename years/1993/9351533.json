The radio science facility would  join a night time optical observatory and a student solar  observatory (based on a heliostat) as alternatives to the  traditional physical science laboratories: as opportunities for  non-science majors to work with and master a piece of state of  the art instrumentation. The University has a radio antenna  which was installed and outfitted with low noise amplifiers and  a continuum radiometer at Departmental expense. With relatively  modest additional expenditure, two major new areas of activity  are being opened up to students: radio frequency spectroscopy  of interstellar gas and radar and communications studies based  on reflecting signals from the moon.  The radio facility  furthers the teaching of non-science majors in three important  ways: first, in the laboratory situation, many fundamental  concepts such as wavelength, the electromagnetic spectrum,  black body radiation, and absorption lines, become much more  concrete because they relate to things students can see and  \"play around with\"; second, by participating in the same type  of activities as do modern astronomers, students gain a clearer  idea of how science is actually done; and, third, this type of  laboratory has proved to hold the interest of the students much  better than do the traditional laboratories.  The spectrometer  designed and built in this project can be replicated at very  modest cost. printed circuit boards, plans, and software are  being made available to other interested institutions.  ***",
