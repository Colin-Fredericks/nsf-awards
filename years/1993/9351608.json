 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Civil Engineering program at Gonzaga University includes a                  laboratory course that provides instruction in fluid mechanics,                 hydrology, hydraulics and environmental engineering. This                       course will be made more effective by introducing new equipment                 that allows students to perform activities which combine                        \"seeing\" by using flow visualization, \"doing\" by using data                     acquisition systems (DAS) in flow models or field measurement                   exercises and \"thinking\" by using computational fluid dynamics                  (CFD) analysis to simulate flow. This same equipment will be                    used to perform in-class activities that will make the                          instruction more vivid in the fluid mechanics course. The new                   equipment will allow velocity and turbulence to be measured                     easily. Video cameras will be used by student during                            demonstrations to provide a record of the work and to increase                  student interest and participation.                                             In elective CE courses, flow model equipment will be used to                    clarify the complex behavior in alluvial channel hydraulics.                    Students will be able to measure the scour at differently                       shaped piers at various velocities. In another course, water                    quality (WQ) sensors will be used to collect data from local                    streams and lakes using the PC-based DAS. Students will benefit                 from making WQ calculations using \"real\" WQ data collected in                   these local water bodies.                                                       This equipment will also accommodate inter-disciplinary use by                  students in the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS)                          Department who will use the equipment as an illustration of a                   physical process that can be simulated by sophisticated                         numerical models. Results from the CFD software can be directly                 compared to the physical flow situation. The CFD software can                   also be used to support senior projects for CE, ME and MCS                      students.",
