 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304394  Poccia    The long term goal of this work is to understand the  inactivation/activation of the sperm nucleus that occurs during  spermatogenesis and following fertilization. Successful genetic  reactivation of the dormant sperm nucleus by egg cytoplasm is  essential to successful biparental embryonic development. Male  pronuclear reactivation is preceded by decondensation of chromatin  and alteration of DNA associated basic proteins. Dr. Poccia will  test the abilities of two sperm specific histones of the sea urchin  (Sp H1 and Sp H2B) to determine first order structure of sperm  chromatin and its alteration following fertilization. His model  predicts that phosphorylation of \"SPKK\" sites in the N-terminal  domains of these molecules controls average nucleosomal repeat  length and accessibility of linker DNA to enzymatic digestion.  These properties have been previously correlated in vivo, but  whether N-terminal phosphorylation plays a role in determining  repeat lengths or sensitivity to MNase digestion is a major  untested postulate. Novel features of his experiments include the  use of identical histone variants which differ in degree of  phosphorylation, employment of N- and C-terminal peptide as well as  intact molecules to assess the contribution of those domains, and  evaluation of the contributions of H2B as well as H1. Relevance of  \"SPKK\" phosphorylation extends beyond Sp histones. Similar sites  occur in most H1's and in several nucleic acid packaging proteins  and regulators, some of which are phosphorylated in a cell cycle  dependent manner. Moreover, positioning of nucleosomes and  alteration of histone-DNA binding affinities is critically  important in replication and transcriptional control mechanisms.  ***",
