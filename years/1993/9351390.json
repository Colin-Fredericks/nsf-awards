 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351390  Sirvatka    This project is involving students with methods of data  assimilation and presentation early in their study of  meteorology.  A Local Area Network (LAN) is being established  to facilitate optimum acquisition of data, and to allow for  student access to the LAN and all its data.  A RISC  Workstation, three PCs and a laptop PC are providing the core  of the LAN, while a laser printer and a video projection system  are allowing for effective presentation.  The proposed  equipment is enabling majors and nonmajors to immerse  themselves in laboratory experiences that are supplementing  classroom instruction in every course in the meteorology  curriculum.  Practical operation with emphasis on forecasting  and investigation of current research findings is heightening  students' critical thinking ability and instilling the process  of scientific thinking into the educational experience.   Students also are having the opportunity to apply the skills  learned in laboratory in cooperation with forecasting done by  the Northeast Illinois Severe Weather Spotter Network.         ***",
