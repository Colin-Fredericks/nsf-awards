 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wyoming Province exposes one of the most                               isotopically evolved Archean cratons.  The Wyoming Province                     forms an early part of the north American Precambrian                           shield, to which younger terranes were accreted.  However,                      the origin of the province is unclear, with some isotopic                       data suggesting that it was derived from an older reservoir                     that must have been older than 4.0 Ga if it U/Pb ratio was                      comparable to average crust.  Determining the age and                           composition of this older reservoir is crucial for                              understanding the processes that lead to the transformation                     of this craton from an older, relatively high U/Pb system to                    a low U/Pb system by the end of the Archean.  The work                          involves a detailed geologic and geochemical investigation,                     including SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology, of the Middle to Early                     Archean crust in the Beartooth Mountains where the evolved                      isotopic signature is best documented.  Results will be                         important in constraining the processes involved in Earth's                     early geochemical differentiation.",
