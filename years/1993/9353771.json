The project will be  directed at women entering Stony Brook who show academic promise and a demonstrated  aptitude for math, science, or engineering (MSE), and will consist of five components:  1) an  orientation that will educate the women about Stony Brook, and particularly its research milieu  in the sciences; 2) an innovative two-semester sequence on Becoming a Scientist that will expose  them to a range of scientific disciplines, help them develop critical skills, give them hands-on  research experience, and address gender-focused considerations that might influence their  educational and professional plans; 3) a basic calculus course using an enhanced version of the  Harvard Consortium curriculum that will be taught interactively and emphasize a group approach  to learning; 4) a multiple-tired mentoring system involving advanced women undergraduates  majoring in a science, women graduate students, and women faculty; and 5) informal programs  and social activities that will foster collegiality and socialization with women scientists.  While  the broad goal of Project WISE is to engage participating women in the excitement and challenge  of mathematics and science early in their college careers, before they make academic decisions  that will shape their subsequent education, the Project has several specific objectives:  1) to  motivate the women at the critical juncture between high school and college to continue their  mathematics and science education; 2) to help them develop confidence in their ability to learn  and perform well in mathematics and other quantitative courses; 3) to promote awareness of the  range of educational and career opportunities open to individuals with quantitative and empirical  skills; 4) to create a supportive social environment that will encourage continuation; and 5) to  create a  model program that can be readily \"main streamed\" at Stony Brook, and replicated or  adapted at other centers of higher education.      Project WISE is being developed in response to both national and Stoney Brook needs to  increase participation by women in MSE education and careers.  Few programs exist that target  female students specifically and focus on their recruitment and retention.  The project  concentrates on the period that bridges high school and college, through the first year of college,  because this has been identified as the period of \"highest risk\" in the MSE pipeline, when a high  proportion of college-bound students, but especially women, make the decision to discontinue  their study of these subjects.  ***",
