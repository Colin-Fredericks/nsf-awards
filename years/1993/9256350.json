 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Graduate Research Training award provides support to the                   University of Wisconsin for a program in Environmental Sociology.               This is part of an existing emphasis, at the graduate level, on                 Science, Technology, Agriculture, Resources, and the Environment                (STARE) in the graduate Departments of Rural Sociology and                      Sociology at the University.  A unique concentration of (10) STARE-             affiliated faculty has been assembled at the University of                      Wisconsin, and the STARE program has been in place since 1988.                  This concentration of sociologists is located in one of the                     strongest graduate departments of sociology in the U.S., one that               has frequently been the top-ranked program in the country.                                                                                                      National Science Foundation support will augment STARE by helping               to recruit and retain minority students and those with                          undergraduate degrees in the natural sciences, as well as providing             funding stability which is lacking in new areas such as                         environmental sociology.  There is a pressing national need for                 environmental sociologists to work on social aspects and                        implications of environmental problems.  A secondary benefit from               training environmental sociologists would be to broaden                         sociological analysis and discourse in general.  The program is                 highlighted by a weekly training seminar, existing courses, a                   research apprenticeship program, a Ph.D. qualifying exam, and a                 summer practicum.  Doctoral candidates will also be expected to                 take a natural or environmental science minor.  Building on an                  already-strong program and track record of minority recruitment and             retention, the STARE Graduate Training Program will place strong                emphasis on recruitment, retention, and summer training of Native               Americans.",
