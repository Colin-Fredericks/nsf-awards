His main                       emphasis is on the study of incompressible surfaces in hyperbolic               3-manifolds, representations of the fundamental groups of such                  3-manifolds, and the geometry and structure of closed geodesics                 in hyperbolic 3-manifolds.                                                           Since the space of everyday life is three dimensional,                     understanding the structure of objects of this dimension is                     likely to be especially relevant to the real world.  This world                 is certainly locally Euclidean, but on a cosmological scale it                  may well be hyperbolic -- at issue is the behavior of light paths               of enormous length.  In any event the techniques invented to                    answer questions about hyperbolic manifolds have surprisingly                   many applications elswehere in mathematics and theoretical                      physics.",
