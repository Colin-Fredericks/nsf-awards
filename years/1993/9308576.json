 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308576   Meredith    We interact with objects in the space around our bodies by  interpreting visual, auditory, touch, and other sensory signals in  a frame of spatial reference.  Each sensory modality has its own  reference system for central \"maps\" in the cortex of the brain,  with vision using a map centered by the geometry of the retina of  the eye, hearing head-centered, and the somatosensory system  body-centered.  However, generating appropriate behavior for  orientation to a stimulus requires some common coordinate system,  so that, for example, the eyes turn within the head to look toward  the source of a sound from one side.  The superior colliculus is a  complex structure in the midbrain that is strongly implicated in  this kind of spatial orientation.  This work provides novel tests  for neural mechanisms that could provide a reference system for  this sensory to motor integration.  Recording activity in alert,  behaving animals will clarify how multisensory neurons in deep  layers of the superior colliculus integrate combined auditory and  visual stimuli.  Activity of these neurons will be examined during  stimulation of one or more of the motor inputs, to further test how  motor commands may shape the response.  These experiments will  determine if multisensory collicular neurons code sensory space in  terms of motor coordinates, and will clarify the relation between  unimodal and multisensory frames of reference.  This novel approach  will enhance our understanding of how the brain deals with the  complex sensory environment, and so will have a broad impact on  research in many sensory fields, in sensorimotor integration, and  in attention and cognition.  ***",
