 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Enhanced Bioscience Education program greatly increases the                 effectiveness of undergraduate education in the biological                      sciences.  The new integrated Curriculum presents science as it                 is practiced--as a problem solving, investigative activity.                     The curriculum is designed for up to 100 bioscience and teacher                 preparation majors.  It is organized around topic areas and                     extends over five quarters of instruction: (1) Biological                       Investigation is the heart of the curriculum and consists of a                  series of laboratory modules covering the important concepts of                 modern biology, leading students toward design of their own                     experiments.  There is a strong emphasis on use of computers                    for collecting data and for data analysis and interpretation.                   (2) Principals of Bioscience includes the content areas now                     covered in freshman biology, cell physiology, microbiology and                  genetics presented as a single, coherent sequence and                           completely integrated with Biological Investigation                             laboratories.  (3) Physical Sciences and Mathematics covers the                 topics of freshman and sophomore chemistry, mathematics and                     physics, with the appropriate information and skills introduced                 in the order needed.  An Undergraduate Research Program                         includes freshman and sophomore independent research projects,                  preparation for more advanced projects, and the establishment                   of the Drexel Journal of Undergraduate Research as a vehicle                    for dissemination of student research.  Special attention is                    paid to problems of student support and retention.  Specific                    plans are included for evaluation and effective dissemination                   of the outcomes of the project.",
