 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study develops a new method for the separation of small                    (10\u001am. in diameter and smaller) particles from a gas stream.                    In this method, the gas stream is arranged to flow as a jet,                    and forced to impinge upon a conically shaped impactor                          surface.  The tip of the cone surface, and only a small                         fraction (termed the minority flow) actually moves through the                  aperture.  The average size of the particles in the minority                    flow is much larger than that in the mainstream which passes                    over the particles because the larger particles, with greater                   momentum, cannot negotiate the turn and follow the small                        particles into the aperture.  The aperture is joined to two                     concentric tubes.  The outer tube has a solid wall, and the                     inner tube a porous wall for a short distance near its end                      joining the solid plate.  Gas is supplied at high pressure to                   the annular space between the tubes, and passes through the                     porous part of the tube into the space behind the aperture                      creating a counterflow.  Finally suction is applied in the                      inner tube, downstream from the aperture.  The combination of                   suction and flow through the porous tube creates a plane of                     zero flow which separates gas flowing out of the bottom of the                  inner tube and gas flowing out of the aperture.  Particles                      that have traveled through the aperture must progress against                   the counterflow.  The ones large enough that their momentum                     can allow them to pass through the counterflow and eventually                   rejoin the majority flow over the cone.  By adjusting the                       counterflow pressure the plane of zero flow can be moved, and                   this provides some control of the particle size distribution                    collected at the downstream end.  The study will improve on                     this design by causing the jet gas stream impacting on the                      cone to move at supersonic speeds.  Supersonic speeds allow                     large particle velocities, and permits smaller particles to                     pass through the plane of zero flow and be collected.",
