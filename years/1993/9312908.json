 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312908  Trivedi       The American computer industry is affected by a lack of  synergism between the different phases of software design such as  specification, manufacturability, performance, reliability, and  cost assessment.  An Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center on Computer Engineering System Research at Duke University  could provide a better mechanism to advance the development and  application of basic research in the area of high performance,  dependable hardware, and software system for applications such as  real-time system, local and wide area networks, manufacturing  systems, flight-control systems, and command and control systems.       A planning meeting will study if industry will support an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Computer  Engineering System Research at Duke University.  The meeting will  address industry interest and determine if the Center has  sufficient support and merit to meet the Industry/University  Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.  The proposed  research projects will address:  1) Formal methods in system  engineering; 2) design principle of dependable and high performance  distributed systems and networks; 3) use of artificial neural  networks to solve complex design and scheduling problems; and 4)  statistical methodologies in software quality, reliability, and  safety.       The Principle Investigator is recognized as an eminent  researcher and has the resource for this planning meeting.       This project has been coordinated and cost-shared with Dr.  Bruce Barnes, Deputy Director of the Division of Computer and  Computation Research at the National Science Foundation.       The Program Manager recommends Duke University be awarded  $50,000 for 6 months for this planning meeting.  ***",
