 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transport of volatile organic compounds in unsaturated porous               media will be studied in the laboratory.  The emphasis will be on               processes that dominate transport over a broad areal extent.  These             include gas diffusion, gas advection, mass transfer between the                 soil water and soil air phases, and sorption onto soil particles.               A bench scale apparatus will be constructed to study these                      processes individually.  In the unsaturated zone, gas phase                     transport-- both gas diffusion and gas advection--is a primary                  pathway by which volatile organic compounds migrate.  Five factors              that affect gas transport in the unsaturated zone will be studied               using the bench scale apparatus.  These are the soil moisture                   content, the gradient in atmospheric pressure, the concentration of             the diffusing gas, the temperature, and advective flow of water.                In addition to gas diffusion and advection, transport in the                    unsaturated zone is influenced by the dissolution of the vapor                  phase compound into the water phase.  This is true  both in                     equilibrium systems--when Henry's law governs the distribution of               the compound between the phases--and in nonequilibrium systems--for             instance, during infiltration (Cho and Jaffe, 1990; Cho, 1992).                 The soil gas-soil water mass transfer rate coefficient will be                  quantified using the bench scale experimental apparatus over a                  range of moisture contents, advective fluid flow rates, atmospheric             pressures, and temperatures.  It has been observed that compounds               bound to the solid matrix of a porous medium can act as long-term               sources of contamination in groundwater aquifers (Cho, 1992; Smith              et al., 1990).  The sorptive and desorptive fluxes of such sorbed               contaminants into the fluid phases will be quantified, again using              the bench scale experimental cell. Finally, pilot scale experiments             will be conducted using a pilot apparatus used  in previous vadose              zone experiments (Cho, 1992).  In the pilot scale experiments, the              individual transport processes described above will be examined in              consort.",
