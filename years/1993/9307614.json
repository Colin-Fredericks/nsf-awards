The conference  will be held at the Bhabha Atomic Research  Center (BARC) in Bombay between January 5 and  7, 1994.  The American scientists are expected  to participate in panel discussions on research  and graduate education in the U.S. and India,  and on university-industry cooperative research  in the two countries.  They will also conduct a  symposium on modern developments in boiling and  condensation, and will present state-of -the-  art review lectures on topics of emerging  technologies.  They will give courses on  experimental methods in heat transfer, heat  transfer in manufacturing and material  processing, and thermal resistance in  electronic systems.  The U.S. scientists plan  to selectively visit Indian research institutes  including BARC and four of the Indian  Institutes of Technology.      Scope:  This project will help develop close  ties between researchers in the U.S. and India  for exchange of technical information and for  conducting cooperative research projects of  mutual interest.  This meeting in India is  similar to others organized by the ASME with  counterpart organizations in China, South  Korea, Japan and Europe.  India has a very  strong community of researchers in this  particular field of heat and mass transfer, and  it is likely that the U.S. participants will  benefit from attending this conference.  ***",
