Experiments are planned to allow  detection of changing mRNA levels in cultured human endometrial  cells in response to physiological concentrations of E2. The  Ishikawa cell line has been shown to retain its ability to  respond to E2: proliferation can be stimulated and specific  proteins can be induced. Changing levels of mRNAs will be studied  in a systematic way during the first 24 hours following the  addition of E2. Other mRNAs (secondary responses) will not appear  for many hours because their induction requires the synthesis of  a protein induced as part of the primary response. Experiments  are suggested to detect these two different classes of mRNA.  Additional experiment are planneed to look for other classes of  mRNAs induced by E2 in these cells and to study and compare  characterstic responses of different classes of mRNA to different  inhibitors.  ***",
