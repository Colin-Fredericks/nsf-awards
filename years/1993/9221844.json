The PI's derived a model of                                                                                               consumption by herbivores that incorporates variation in spatial                                                                                                arrangements of plants, and velocities and food processing                      abilities of                                                                    animals. The model generated the following hypotheses: 1)                       Increasing                                                                      patchiness in plant communities causes encounter rate with                      resources to                                                                    decline as foraging time increases. 2) The decline in encounter                 rate is                                                                         opposed by increasing resource apparency and size. 3) Spatial                   pattern                                                                         fails to influence intake rate when resource encounter rate                     exceeds an                                                                      animals food processing rate. 4) At a given scale, the influence                of                                                                              spatial pattern on intake rate will be greatest for animals of                  intermediate body sizes. To test these hypotheses, the PI's will                                                                                                manipulate spatial patterns of resources, resource apparency, and                                                                                               resource size available to herbivores in laboratory and field                   experiments. Results from these experiments will provide an                     assessment                                                                      of the model's ability to predict intake rate of consumers in                   comparisons with predictions from more traditional predictive                   theory.                                                                         %%%                                                                             The PI's have developed one of the first models that relates                    resource                                                                        patchiness, resource abundance, foraging movements of herbivores,               and                                                                             body size to resource acquisition by herbivores. The model has                  generated a series of testable hypotheses, some of which are                    unique and                                                                      counter-intuitive. Tests of these hypotheses will provide an                    important                                                                       contribution toward a much needed general theory of herbivore                   foraging.
