All  participants will be involved in  optoelectronic packaging.  The purpose will  be to try to identify major problems in an  area loosely termed optoelectronic packaging  through discussion of the research challenges  faced in advanced optoelectronic packaging as  well as methods of fostering an atmosphere in  which there will be free exchange between  university and industrial researchers.   Graduate students will be encouraged to  attend the workshop by travel supports.  Such  non-classroom education will enhance  students' experiences through group  discussions and poster exchanges.  ***",
