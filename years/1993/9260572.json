 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this SBIR proposal (phase I and II) is to                      explore new technology that can be used to ultimately develop                   during phase III a low cost modular NMR console that can replace                any commercially available console and provide up to date                       performance at a cost of less than $100,000.                                                                                                                    During Phase I, new RF technology currently used in cellular                    phone and other consumer product technology will be evaluated in                an NMR spectrometer.  In particular new Frequency Generation and                new IF Detection schemes for NMR Observe Unit will be studied in                an NMR spectrometer and their respective performance will be                    assessed.                                                                                                                                                       During Phase II, several units derived from the technology                      explored in phase I will be designed, built and tested in an NMR                environment.  This will include a complete broadband observe                    unit, a multi-nuclei decoupler and a field-frequency lock                       channel.  The end result will be a complete low-cost modular NMR                console.  This should be an attractive alternative to expensive                 NMR spectrometers and should help improve the funding problems                  for state of the art equipment.  Commercial development and                     application will follow during Phase III.",
