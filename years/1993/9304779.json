 "awd_abstract_narration": "Political processes can have profound impacts on the                       structure and operation of spaces.  Changes in political                        processes may produce new ways to organize and use space, a                     fundamental fact that once again is being demonstrated in the                   nations of central Europe and northern Eurasia that recently                    replaced communist regimes with more democratic governments.                    This doctoral dissertation improvement project will focus on the                relationship between political activism and community identity in               post-Soviet cities of Russia.  Special emphasis will be given to                assessing the role of political activism in the formation of new                community and territorial identities within cities and the degree               to which those new identities affect the agendas and behavior of                people active in politics.  Archival research, detailed                         interviews, and surveys will be used to conduct a comparative                   analysis of 'committees of self-governance' in Moscow, and                      secondary data will be examined to determine broader political                  and economic trends in urban centers throughout Russia.                              This research will provide valuable information and insights               into the dramatic transformations of political and urban                        structure in Russia, and it also will extend and refine theories                developed in Western contexts regarding reciprocal interactions                 between place and politics.  As a doctoral dissertation                         improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable               a promising student to establish a strong independent research                  career.",
