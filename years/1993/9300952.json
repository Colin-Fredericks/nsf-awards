 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eight undergraduate students from the Rocky Mountain and Southwest              Regions of the United States will participate in a ten-week,                    comprehensive research experience at the University of New Mexico               during the summer of 1993.  In accordance with his/her interests,               each student will participate as a team member in one of the                    following eight projects: 1) participate in the stress testing and              analysis of a steel interstate highway bridge; 2) learn about                   various methods for measuring displacements and strains using laser             interferometry techniques; 3) acoustically test an existing bridge              on the Rio Grande River to locate hidden cracks; 4) construct small             scale models of hydraulic structures and test these models in an                open channel flow facility; 5) design foot pad systems for a                    universal lunar lander currently being designed by NASA; 6) use the             discrete element approach to study micromechanical interactions                 between particles modeled as ellipsoids; 7) design a self-                      sustaining biosphere to orbit the sun; and 8) develop practical                 new techniques for the remediation of polluted ground water.  Over              half of the students will be selected this year from applicants at              institutions other than UNM, especially those without active                    research programs.  Women, minority and disabled applicants will                be recruited.  The students will become familiar with their                     projects through early contact with the research faculty.  Each                 student can expect to learn to work independently over the course               of the summer.  He/she will also present a final seminar on the                 research, assist in writing a publication describing the work, and              may travel to a meeting to present the results.",
