 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of mechanisms by which lysosomal enzymes are sorted is              teaching us about the relationship of protein structure to protein              transport.  In complex organisms, lysosomal enzymes serve a key                 role in embryonic re-sculpting.  Their sorting is regulated during              development.  The long range goal of this project is to discover                the molecular details of this regulation.  Dictyostelium discoideum             is a simpler organism whose development is well studied.  A                     complete CDNA copy of the Dictyostelium MRNA which encodes beta-                hexosaminidase (beta-hex), a lysosomal enzyme, has already been                 cloned and sequenced.  This was used to transform the organism with             a vector designed to express proteins accurately.  It was shown                 that the transformants overproduce active enzyme, which is                      appropriately sorted.  Also, a beta-hex-invertase fusion system was             developed for evaluation of candidate signals.  That study led to               the discovery of a signal which sorts proteins to a vesicle whose               contents are stored during growth and secreted during development.              It also led to the hypothesis that lysosomal enzymes may be                     directed from organelle to organelle by more than one receptor, or              by the combination of one receptor ligand interaction and other                 features of the enzyme structure.  This will be pursued through the             following specific aims.  The first is to determine the exact                   chemical nature of the signal which is required to sort protein to              the lysosomal pathway.  This includes: a, determination of the                  minimal biologically functional sequence and the extent to which                that sequence can be varied but still lead to proper sorting; b,                confirmation that the sequence acts as a ligand for a receptor and              purification of the receptor; and c, analysis of the specificity of             the ligand-receptor interaction with synthetic peptides.  The                   second is to test the idea that features of proteins, other than                recognition markers, are required for proper sorting to lysosomes,              specifically, to test theories that explain why a terminal beta-hex             sequence is necessary.                                                          %%%                                                                             A key feature of eukaryotes is that their cells are physically                  compartmentalized; that is, the cytoplasm is not a uniform mixture              of cellular components, but rather, is highly organized in such a               way that specific cellular functions, and the components that carry             out those functions, are localized in discrete regions of the cell.             Some of these functionally-distinct compartments are bounded by                 membranes, and can be considered to be \"organelles.\"  Since most of             the cell's proteins are produced on cytoplasmic ribosomes, it                   follows that there must be mechanisms to ensure that specific                   proteins get to their specific subcellular locations.  One well-                studied example of this is the problem of how newly-synthesized                 lysosomal (degradative) enzymes get to the lysosomes (specialized               membrane-bounded compartments responsible for enzymatic degradation             of macromolecules).  Nature seems to have provided multiple                     mechanisms for this to occur.  Although the best-studied mechanism              involves membrane-bound receptors which recognize mannosyl-6-                   phosphate residues at the terminal position of asparagine-linked                oligosaccharides on lysosomal enzymes, it is not the only mechanism             for proper targeting of lysosomal enzymes.  In the slime mold                   Dictyostelium discoidum, mannosyl-6-phosphate receptors have been               looked for but not found; therefore lysosomal enzyme targeting in               these cells must be via one or more alternative mechanisms.  This               project holds the promise of elucidating details of at least one of             these alternative mechanisms.  Detailed understanding of the                    structural requirements for a protein to be targeted to a specific              subcellular location is of basic importance to the biotechnology                industry; it is expected that the information learned from this                 project will allow molecular engineers to design proteins more                  intelligently for production in bioreactors.",
