 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will be at the             Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at Penn State during 1993-               1994.  The REU site will involve at least nine, and possibly twelve             or more, students in research projects each summer, six funded by               the National Science Foundation (NSF), three or more from other                 research sources within the department.  Students will be involved              in a wide range of frontier research projects in ground- and                    space-based observations and theory, and instrumentation.                                                                                                       As a REU site, the Department will engage in an aggressive                      recruiting program for students in a large geographical area                    covering Pennsylvania, the surrounding mid-Atlantic states and                  Appalachia, and southeastern states, including large rural areas                for which Penn State is one of the nearest major research                       institutions.  Minority participation will be encouraged through                the use of contacts with predominantly minority universities and                colleges in the region.                                                                                                                                         Seminars and special tutorials will broaden students' knowledge of              astronomy and astrophysics, ensure interaction with faculty, and                teach valuable skills including laboratory, observational and data              analysis.  Extra-curricular activities will encourage informal                  interaction with faculty and graduate students.  The program will               focus on encouraging students' interest in careers in astronomy and             astrophysics.",
