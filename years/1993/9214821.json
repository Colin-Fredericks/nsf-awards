 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed support for The Center for                     Molecular Biotechnology, a Science and Technology Center                        (STC) first  established at the California Institute of                         Technology in 1989.  The STC will move in stages to the                         University of Washington during 1992-1993, and will be                          located entirely at the University by early 1994.  The                          Center sponsors research and development activities aimed at                    the creation of new or improved instrumentation in several                      key areas of modern biotechnology. These include the                            sequencing of sub-picomole amounts of purified proteins, the                    large scale mapping and sequencing of genomic DNA and the 2-                    dimensional gel electrophoresis of highly complex mixtures                      of proteins.  Other research activities include development                     of mass spectrometric instrumentation, accompanying software                    and a variety of other computational tools useful in the                        Center's development of new technology and data analysis.                       In addition, the STC also sponsors education and outreach                       programs aimed at providing research experience and training                    for high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral                       students.  These include programs expected to encourage                         increased participation by members of underrepresented                          minority groups in scientific research.  Other activities of                    the Center provide for transfer of the Center developed                         technology to the academic and commercial sector, and for                       research collaborations with academic, industrial and                           Federal scientists.  Support of these various activities                        within a center maximizes the benefit of all research                           activities from progress to new developments and facilitates                    the transfer of new ideas, technologies and research results                    to basic research and commercial development activities in                      other institutions and sectors.                                                     The recent, enormous progress in our understanding of                       basic cellular processes and the concomitant growth in our                      ability to analyze and manipulate basic genetic phenomena                       for the benefit of mankind have derived from a variety of                       techniques for the separation, analysis and synthesis of the                    protein and nucleic acid components of all living organisms.                    Key to this progress has been the development of automatic                      microchemical instrumentation and computational tools of the                    type being developed by this Center.  The new devices and                       methodology created by the Center are expected to have                          impacts on areas of basic and applied research as diverse as                    anthropology, molecular biophysics, forensic and clinical                       medicine, and agriculture.",
