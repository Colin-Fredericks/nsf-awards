 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primary sensory neurons located along the length of the spinal cord             in structures known as spinal ganglia convey information about the              body (somatosensory information; e.g. pain, temperature) to the                 central nervous system.  Defining the anatomical, biochemical, and              molecular characteristics of these sensory nerve cells is                       prerequisite to determining their function.  Dr. Seroogy has                    recently discovered that substantial subpopulations of spinal                   ganglion cells contain the biosynthetic machinery for an enzyme                 called tyrosine hydroxylase, an enzyme crucial for the synthesis of             a class of chemical messengers called catecholamines.  This finding             raises the possibility that catecholamines play a role in the                   transfer and coding of sensory information from the body.  The                  primary goals of the proposed research are to thoroughly                        characterize the organization of tyrosine hydroxylase (and                      catecholamines) within spinal ganglia and to determine the specific             parts of the body that may be associated with catecholamine                     signalling.  Dr. Seroogy will accomplish this by using molecular                biological and neuroanatomical techniques.  The results of these                studies will add significantly to our understanding of the                      functional organization of catecholamines in spinal ganglia and                 will serve as the basis for future correlations with physiological              studies in order to understand the involvement of catecholamines in             transmitting sensory information.",
