 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304028  Hemley    This research sill involve the study of the structural, optical,  electronic, and vibrational properties of dense solid hydrogen and  related molecular systems at ultrahigh pressures (above 100 GPa) in  order to identify, characterize, and understand their  transformations to high-density states, including metallic phases.   The experiments to be performed will use specially designed  diamond-anvil cells coupled with recently developed synchrotron  infrared, Raman, and Brilloouin spectroscopic techniques.  These  will permit detailed study of electronic and vibrational  transitions to pressures above 300 GPa and at low temperatures (5  K).  Synchrotron x-ray diffraction is to be used to directly  determine crystal structure and phase transitions as a function of  pressure (50-100 GPa) and tempeature (5-300 K).  It will provide  additional information on acoustic velocities and anisotropy, the  equation of state, and constraints on chemical effects (including  impurities and dopants).  Finally, the research will continue the  development of new methods for probing samples at ultrahigh  pressures with the diamond cell.  %%%  The prediction that hydrogen will transform to a metallic solid a  extremely high pressure is a fundamental problem in solid-state  physics, materials science, and planetary science.  During the past  several years, there have been major advances in the ability to  produce sustained pressures in the laboratory in excess of those  found at the center of the Earth (>300 Giga-Pascals) using the  diamond-anvil cell.  The present research involves studies of the  structura, optical, electronic, and vibrational properties of dense  solid hydrogen and related molecular solids at these pressures with  these high-pressure devices.  Particular emphasis will be given to  the application of recently developed infrared spectroscopic  techniques that use high intensity synchrotron radiation.  These  measurements are crucial for identifying the onset of metallization  and  other electronic transitions in these materials.  This work  will be complemented by parallel studies using light scattering  methods and synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements of crystal  structure.  The research will also involve continued development of  new high-pressure techniques for a wide variety of studies of the  behavior of matter under extreme pressure conditions, including the  synthesis of new materials.  ***",
