 "awd_abstract_narration": "9219939  Wernicke         BARGE is an integrated, multi-disciplinary investigation of  a region of the earth's continental lithosphere where an abrupt  boundary exists between highly extended terrain and a tectonically  stable block.  The main research objective of this study is to use  the \"natural experiment\" of a large strain gradient in the  uppermost part of the lithosphere to understand how the Moho and  other deep discontinuities respond to extension, thus quantifying  how large horizontal strains of the lithosphere relate to vertical  motions at various levels, controlled by isostasy.  A number of  such regions have been identified by geological mapping in the  Basin and Range province.  Of these, the western margin of the  Colorado Plateau is the best suited example for accomplishing our  objective.  It has the virtues of (1) abruptness; (2) a geologic  setting that indicated a simple pre-extensional crustal structure;  (3)  a well-understood large-scale extensional kinematic history;  and perhaps most importantly, (4) a large inland waterway suitable  for deep geophysical studies, Lake Mead, that transects the  boundary in precisely the location where geological studies can  place bounds on crustal uplift during extension.  The Principal  Investigators are integrating geological and geochronologic  studies, marine multi-channel seismic reflection profiling,  coordinated land and marine seismic refraction profiling, and  gravity modeling to unravel the kinematic and dynamics of the      lithosphere's response to severe extensional strain.         The main objective of the geologic portion of the BARGE  project are nearing completion.  The primary objective was to  characterize the large-scale pre-extensional configuration of the  Gold Butte structural block in the crust through geologic mapping,  a petrologic and thermochronometic studies, and paleomagnetic  studies of the Proterozoic crystalline basement that comprises the  bulk of the block.  The geophysical component of BARGE was fun ded  a year later than the geological portion.  Due to unforseen  logistical delays, the geophysical experiment will be conducted in  early 1994, nearly a year after the expiration of the grant for the  geological portion of the research.  This project involves a modest  continuation of geological portion of BARGE with two principal  objectives:         1) Additional geologic mapping of the  Gold Butte and  neighboring small fault blocks, in particular the uppermost part  of the block where major upper crustal fault zones intersect the  high-resolution reflection lines; 2) Participation of the PI in the  geophysical experiment, including interpretation of results and  preparation of manuscripts for publication.  ***",
