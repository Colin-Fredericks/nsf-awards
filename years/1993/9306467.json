 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306467  Baptista    Young white-crowned sparrows learn songs from adults, and vocal tradition coupled with  isolation of local populations gives rise to regional song dialects.  A number of parallels  between speech development in humans and song development in birds have been noted.   These include early language acquisition, bilingualism or singing two song types at dialect  boundaries, lateralization of the brain, location of speech/song storage centers, and vertical  tradition along sexual lines (i.e., sons learn from fathers and daughters from mothers).    Although song and singing behavior of male white-crowned sparrows have been subjects of  intense study over the last three decades, little attention has been paid to song of females.   Dr. Baptista and his colleagues recently documented regular singing by female white-  crowned sparrows.  The present research is designed to test the function(s) of female singing  in territoriality and/or mate advertisement as well as the role of song quality in acquiring a  high-quality mate early in the breeding season to ensure successful breeding.  One prediction  to be tested is that females with good-quality songs will produce more young than females  with poor-quality songs (as measured by a new technique called autocorrelation).  Even  though white-crowned sparrows (like many species of songbirds) have generally been thought  to be monogamous, previous studies have indicated that over 30% of white-crowned  sparrows in a population are products of matings outside the \"monogamous\" pair.  The  pursuit of such matings may be a female strategy that ensures maximum production of  young, but it also leads to conflict between the sexes.  Dr. Baptista predicts that high-quality  females will try to mate with more than one male.  This prediction will be tested by DNA  fingerprinting, which will reveal identities of males fathering young in a nest.    Recognition of the occurrence and role of female vocalizations has the potential to  revolutionize our under standing of vocal behavior, its social and evolutionary importance,  and its neural and hormonal mechanisms.",
