 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the scientific analysis of a unique,                      longitudinal data base on the role of technology policy in the                  diffusion of computing in twelve Asia-Pacific countries.  The                   purposes are to:  (1) describe evolving trends in the international             diffusion of computing technology; (2) develop understanding of the             relationship between government technology policy and the diffusion             of computing; and (3) assess the effect of environmental factors,               especially economic development and computing infrastructure, on                the diffusion of computing.  The method involves quantitative                   analysis--by country, across countries, and over time--of                       relationships between the extent, rate, breadth and pattern of                  computing diffusion and two sets of independent variables:                      environmental factors and technology policy.  The analyses will use             data already collected for the period 1980-1992, which will be                  supplemented annually for each country.  The quantitative analysis              will be bolstered by reference to qualitative case histories of                 each country's political, economic and infrastructure environment,              its government technology policy, and its diffusion results.  The               analyses also will be reviewed by experts in each country who are               familiar with government technology policy and computing diffusion.             The results of the research will be new understanding about the                 relative influences of environmental factors and of government                  technology policy on the diffusion of computing production and use              within a country and across countries.  The results also will                   include a general model of the relationship between general                     economic conditions in a country and computing diffusion; and a                 unique and valuable database that other scholars can use to pursue              related scientific and policy questions.",
