 "awd_abstract_narration": "By carefully controlling the developmental stage of Oregon R               Drosophila embryos, we have succeeded in subjecting them to                     cryogenic temperatures with reasonably high survivals; Some 65-70%              hatch and nearly 40% of the resulting larvae develop into fertile               adults.  The purpose of the proposed work is (1) to identify the                especially critical factors and their tolerances so as to                       facilitate the use of the procedure by the Drosophila community;                (2) prepare a detailed protocol of the procedure which identifies               the critical steps and their tolerances; and (3) test the                       applicability of the procedure to two representative mutant lines.              With respect to Aim (1) we are finding that the step that limits                survival is the exposure to 8.5 M ethylene glycol that precedes                 vitrification.  Part of the damage from that exposure could be a                result of the osmotic dehydration accompanying the addition of                  concentrated ethylene glycol or it could be osmotic swelling                    associated with the removal of ethylene glycol after vitrification.             Part of the damage could be the result of chemical toxicity of the              high concentrations of glycol used.  The damage associated with                 shrinkage and toxicity could be ameliorated by reducing the extent              and duration of shrinkage by reducing the concentration of glycol,              by changing the exposure temperature, or by the use of a more                   permeable cryoprotectant like perhaps dimethyl sulfoxide, all of                which will be tested.  A critical point to be determined is to what             extent one can manipulate these aspects of the cryoprotectant and               still achieve vitrification.  To reduce potential damage from                   osmotic swelling, we shall optimize the sucrose dilution procedure              used to control that swelling.  We also propose to determine the                tolerances to certain critical steps during vitrification per se.               These include (a) can boiling liquid nitrogen be used in place of               nitrogen slush?  If so, it will simplify the procedure; (b) are the             15-hr embryos now being used as sensitive to brief exposures above              -100 C and to warming rates slower than ultra rapid as the 12-hr                embryos used previously?  Knowledge on these points will be                     important to users of the procedure.                                            %%%                                                                             Because Drosophila melanogaster is such an experimentally powerful              organism, the numbers of mutant and/or genetically modified stocks              has become an overwhelming problem.  To date, all stocks must be                transferred about every two weeks.  The development of a method to              freeze embryos which is simple enough to be used in biology                     laboratories and yet allows a recovery of fertile at a 40% level                will save millions of dollars and man-hours of work in a reasonably             short time.  It should also help to ensure that important stocks do             not undergo genetic drift over time.",
