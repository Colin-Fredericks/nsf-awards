The objective of this study is to better  understand the Lake Victoria ecosystem and the  processes that are presently causing dramatic  declines in stocks of native fishes.  Dr. Les  Kaufman and his team from the New England  Aquarium will work in conjunction with Mr.  Richard Ogutu-Ohwayo and his team from the UFFRO.   Also included in the research team is a doctoral  student from Moi University, Mr. Peter Ochumba.   By continuing a faunal survey of Lake Victoria,  these investigators will obtain data to help  elucidate the processes that are currently  operating to structure the ecosystem.   Specifically, they will consider a series of  predictions that relate to the patterns of  species survivorship among the indigenous fish  species, the identification of refugia, and the  template of selective forces experienced by these  species.  More generally, the study will produce  a collection of archival fish specimens, more  firmly assess the current extent of extinctions,  establish a working team of in-country  scientists, and build the necessary  infrastructure to continue such work in the  future.    This project in environmental biology fulfills  the program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  United States, Kenya, and Uganda to combine  complementary talents and conduct research in  areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   This project will also enable  U.S. and African scientists, who are early in  their careers, to work together conducting  fieldwork, and collecting and analyzing data.   Partnerships created through this project could  lead to   future, collaborative activities.  ***",
