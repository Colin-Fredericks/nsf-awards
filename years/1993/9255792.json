STEP is                           developing new alliances that form a statewide, interactive                     network consisting of school systems, Tribal Community Colleges                 (TCC's), state Universities and Colleges, the State Office of                   Public Instruction, the Montana Council of Teachers of                          Mathematics, the Montana Science Teachers Association, the                      Montana University System and a number of related on-going NSF                  supported projects in the state: the Systemic Initiative for                    Montana Mathematics and Science (SIMMS), Six Through Eight                      Mathematics (STEM), and the Alliance of States Supporting                       Indians in Science and Technology (ASSIST).  The project is                     providing the following: at least 2 years of early career                       support for mathematics and science teachers in a rural                         setting; model teacher preparation field sites in K-12 schools;                 increased numbers and better preparation of mathematics and                     science teachers from Native American Communities; a                            telecommunications network based model for fostering teacher                    preparation in rural states; strong faculty teams to redesign                   curricula and courses; strong institutional support for                         participating faculty and teachers; dissemination of new ideas                  in preparing teachers; an increase in the number of women and                   minority teachers in mathematics and science; and use of field                  sites as \"living laboratories\" for research on effective                        mathematics and science teaching, pre-service teacher                           supervision and the training of university science and                          mathematics educators in rural settings.",
