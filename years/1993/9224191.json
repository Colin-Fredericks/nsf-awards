 "awd_abstract_narration": "The radio astronomy program under the direction of the                          Principal Investigator, Professor Bernard F. Burke, will                        concentrate on the study of extragalactic radio sources,                        with particular emphasis on the study of the gravitational                      lensing phenomenon.  The first phase of the study, which                        involved the mapping of 4000 radio sources with the VLA, has                    been completed, and that work has resulted in the discovery                     of at least six new examples of gravitational lensing.  The                     gravitational time delay effect has been utilized to give an                    independent evaluation of the Hubble constant, and to                           explore the large-scale geometry of the universe.                                                                                                               A new class of gravitational lenses, called \"Einstein Rings\"                    has been identified.  Three have been found, and a search                       will be made for more of these objects.  These objects are                      of particular importance since they allow definitive                            measurements of galactic masses to be made.                                                                                                                     During the period of the grant two new radio source surveys                     will take place, one using the Very Large Array (VLA) in                        Socorro, New Mexico, and the other to locate sources using                      the Parkes 210-foot telescope in Australia.  This will be                       followed up by use of the Australia telescope                                   interformeteric array to look for gravitational lenses.                                                                                                         In addition to these programs, the Principal Investigator                       will continue a program that uses the VLA survey material to                    search for high-redshift radio galaxies and quasars, and to                     study their radio properties.                                                                                                                                   The Principal Investigator is regarded as a world leader in                     this research area.",
