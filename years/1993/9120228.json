 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.- Poland cooperative research project is                               between Dr. James R. Anderson of the University                                 of Maryland, College Park, and Prof. Robert R.                                  Galazka and Dr. Andrzej Mycielski of the                                        Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences.                               The researchers will investigate magnetism and                                  magnetotransport in some of the new types of                                    diluted magnetic semiconductors.  They will                                     investigate the narrow-gap materials, Hg1-x-                                    yMnxCdyTe and A1-xRxB (where A belongs to group                                 IV of the Periodic Table of the Elements, B                                     belongs to group VI, and R is a rare earth), and                                the wide-gap systems, C1-xMxD (where C is either                                Cd or Zn, M is a magnetic ion such as Co, Fe, or                                a rare earth, and D belongs to group VI of the                                  Periodic Table).  These materials will be                                       prepared primarily by the modified Bridgman                                     technique.  Magnetization measurements will be                                  used to examine the antiferromagnetic exchange                                  interactions among magnetic ions and to look for                                spin-glass and ferromagnetic behavior.  When                                    combined with magnetooptical studies, the                                       magnetization measurements will be used to                                      determine the interactions between the magnetic                                 ions and the carriers.  Magnetotransport                                        measurements will be used to investigate carrier                                scattering in diluted magnetic semiconductor                                    systems.                                                                                                                                                        This project in physics fulfills the program                                    objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                  enabling leading experts in the United States and                               Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                 and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                    interest and competence.",
