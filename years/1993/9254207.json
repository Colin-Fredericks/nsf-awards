 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial visualization is known to be a valuable and often                       essential skill for engineers in all of the disciplines. The                    purpose of this project is to design a three credit course in                   three-dimensional spatial visualization and to develop the                      necessary materials from which the course can be taught.  These                 materials will include a written textbook and a laboratory                      manual.  The laboratory exercises will involve sketching and                    computer graphics and will also utilize the visualization                       capabilities of IDEAS software.                                                 Freshmen engineering students with weak 3-D visualization                       skills  are the target audience for this course.  Women have                    been found to be approximately three times less likely than men                 to have well-developed spatial visualization skills. Thus, it                   is expected that the proposed course will increase the                          accessibility of engineering studies to women. The goal of this                 course is to provide the prerequisite spatial visualization                     skills needed by students to succeed in their subsequent                        engineering design graphics courses and in their later study                    and work.",
