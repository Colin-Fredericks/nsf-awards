 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moving cells show a pronounced rearward flow of membrane and                  cytoskeletal structures from the marginal lamellipodia through the              lamellar cortex.  The hypothesis to be explored is that this flow               is an essential mechanism of cell locomotion and that it is driven,             in part, by an actomyosin-like contraction of a more centrally                  placed lamellar cortex.  This will be studied using computer-                   enhanced video microscopy in combination with immunocytochemistry,              single-cell electron microscopy, and fluorescence marking to                    examine the movement and the three dimensional organization and                 flow of actin filaments and bundles in protruding lamellipodia.                 The mechanisms of the flow of the dorsal cortical microfilament                 sheath of the lamella will be examined using specific markers,                  photobleaching, and myosin II competitors.  The recent discovery                that stress fibers form in concert with cortical flow will be                   extended to examine the mechanism of stress fiber elongation and                the development of a sarcomeric organization of cytoskeletal                    proteins in fibers.  The rebuilding of the cortex and stress fibers             after elimination by cytochalasin will be examined.  These studies              will advance the field of cell motility by contributing to                      understanding of the mechanism of cellular migration and its role               in the morphogenesis of matrix and tissues.                                     %%%                                                                             Cellular motility is a fundamental and critical property of                     virtually all organisms.  This project focuses on \"ameboid\" or                  \"crawling\" motility, in which cells on a solid surface extend                   projections out in the direction in which they are moving and                   appear to \"pull themselves up\" to those projections.  This form of              cellular motility occurs in virtually all animals (invertebrate and             vertebrate), and is critical for morphogenesis during development,              regeneration and tissue remodelling after injury, host defense                  mechanisms, and other vital functions, and also occurs in cells of              other phyla (e.g., protozoa, slime molds).  The approach to be used             is to correlate high resolution video-enhanced microscopic                      observations on the motility of living cells with both                          ultrastructural observations at the EM level on the same cell and               with immunocytochemical localization of specific proteins also on               the same cell.  Very few other laboratories in the world use this               difficult but highly informative approach.  These studies will                  contribute to our understanding of the molecular organization and               mechanism of the machinery of cell motility.",
