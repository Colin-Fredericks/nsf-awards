The effects  of warming are expected to be amplified and observable first in  high latitudes.  Current models predict that rapid warming will  combine with increases in summer rainfall and winter snowfall in  northwestern North America, conditions that may result in rapid  degradation of permafrost throughout large parts of Alaska and  northwestern Canada.  Similar conditions may also persist in  northern Eurasia.  Although permafrost is not in direct contact  with the atmosphere, seasonal snow cover, surface vegetation, and  an organic mat serve as an active layer that buffers heat  transfer.  Energy passes through this active layer through  convection and through non-convective processes (including  evaporation and condensation, freezing and melting, and  volatilization and sublimation), which consume or release latent  energy.  High-frequency measurements of temperature and water-  ionic concentrations in soils conducted by the investigator in  discontinuous permafrost regions covered by boreal forests in  Alaska have indicated that the non-conductive processes can,  under some circumstances, dominate heat transfers in freezing and  thawing soils.  This project will continue this line of research  in both areas of discontinuous permafrost and expand it into  Arctic areas where permafrost is continuous.  Data will be  collected at two different scales, with high-frequency monitoring  of near-surface processes conducted at three sites.  Measurements  also will be taken in the upper levels of permafrost at the same  sites in order to refine methods for observing changes in crucial  variables in this critical zone.       This research will make contributions from both substantive  and methodological perspectives.  It will add to general  knowledge about the role of non-conductive processes within the  buffering active layer above permafrost, especially as that la yer  responds to changes in temperature and precipitation.  Expansion  of this line of research into the upper layers of permafrost will  increase understandings of processes in this zone and will  provide tests of the feasibility for new monitoring procedures  that might have utility in many similar locales.  ***",
