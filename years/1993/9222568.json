 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this study in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                    Program in the Division of Chemistry, a new theory is being                     developed to describe electronically diabatic processes in                      complex chemical systems.  The goal of this theory, which is                    based on time-dependent molecular orbitals, is to provide new                   insights, concepts, and methods for describing collision-                       induced and photo-induced electronic transitions.  A related                    objective is the development of methods for computing the time                  evolution of electronic state populations, differential and                     integral cross sections, and electronic branching ratios.                       Computer visualizations play an important part in these                         studies.  Applications are being made to the description of                     atom-atom, atom-diatom, and atom-solid surface collisions.                      %%%                                                                             The evolution in time of the properties of atoms and molecules                  as they undergo collisions or interactions with light can be                    described by modern theoretical and computational methods based                 on quantum mechanics.  In this study new procedures for                         obtaining these descriptions are being developed and applied to                 a wide variety of chemically interesting systems.",
