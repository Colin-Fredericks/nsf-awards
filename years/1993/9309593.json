An understanding of the efficacy of such techniques will shed important insight on the adaptiveness of cultural understandings of disease and the social and technical support system available to those afflicted with tuberculosis.  The objective of this medical anthropological research is to investigate the nature and implications of medical beliefs and practices in eastern Nepal.  Special focus is on tuberculosis, which, despite its sustained impact in Nepal and throughout the developing world, has been the subject of little research.  Building on groundwork laid during a pilot study in September 1992, this village-based project will utilize a biobehavioral perspective that incorporates the use of survey, participant observation, structured and unstructured interview, Western biomedical health records, and tracking of specific illness episodes to elucidate the interactions of biological and cultural aspects of health and disease.  Research topics will include local perceptions of disease categories and etiologies, therapeutic activities and healers, and expectations and evaluations of disease and therapeutic processes and outcomes.    This project is significant for its attention to voids in research on sociocultural aspects of tuberculosis incidence and impact, for its unique integration of biological and cultural aspects of health and disease.  Further, the focus of this study on disease of significant local concern underscores it applied dimension a nd its potential to inform culturally sensitive and effective health programming, and thereby benefit Nepalis, whose knowledge and experience facilitate the research project.  ***   s( t(                              @                           1               @   4    <                          P  O    `                                                            ^                                                             hrf12.frs    hrf6.frs     hrf12.chm    hrf6.chm     egaital.frs  egaund.frs   egasmc.frs   ega512.frs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  !           !           !                f     ?                       #             #                                 L    Times New Roman    Symbol  & Arial  & Lucida Sans    Bookman Old Style       u   u         u           \"             h     B   B                           y    etkin zvosec abstract abstract dissertation\"dissertation abstract zvosec etkin  Raymond Hames Raymond Hames",
