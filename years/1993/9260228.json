 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electric power transmission systems are large                                   electrical networks spread over a vast geographic                               area that deliver electricity produced by thermal                               and hydro-electric generators to the wide variety of                            customer loads distributed along the network.                                   Because these systems are so large and dispersed, it                            is extremely difficult to know how the system is                                behaving at any moment in time.  In spite of                                    extensive metering and powerful computers, the                                  best we can do is estimate the state of the power                               system.  Since certain electrical laws must be                                  obeyed that constrain and govern its behavior, and                              we are seeking the best estimate given an                                       abundance of telemetered measurements, we can                                   write the State Estimation problem as a very large                              optimization problem that seeks to determine the                                most likely electrical state of the network given the                           data available. Current power system State                                      Estimators solve a simplified optimization problem                              that ignores certain aspects of a real utility's                                practice.  For example, common system devices                                   such as transformer taps, phase shifters, or series                             capacitors are either treated as fixed variables or                             are heuristically accommodated in the optimization                              process.  Physically discrete variables and inequality                          constraints imposed by physical or operational                                  limits are ignored.  Current solution methods are                               based on first derivative information and ignore the                            important effects of second derivatives which can                               have a profound impact on computational                                         robustness.  These shortcomings have resulted in an                             industry-wide dissatisfaction with the current state-                           of-the-art, in spite of significant gains in                                    computational speed made by algorithmic research                                and faster computers. We propose to construct a                                 State Estimation model that directly includes                                   essential characteristics that are now ignored, with                            the premise that a more accurate and robust model                               is of greater concern than a faster solution method.                            A software prototype for numerical                                              experimentation is proposed, which will also serve                              as a benchmark debugger for commercial software                                 development in Phase II.",
