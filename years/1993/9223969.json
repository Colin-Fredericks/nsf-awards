 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past two decades the United States has experienced an                  exceptional 200% increase in incarceration rates and other forms of             criminal punishment.  At the same time crime rates were almost                  stable according to the National Crime Victimization Survey.  There             is increasing evidence that the trends in criminal punishment can               only be explained if the production of knowledge and beliefs about              the causes of crime and effects of punishment is considered.  Such              beliefs have also undergone radical shifts during this decade.                  They shifted, for example, from an image of offenders as socially               and psychologically conditioned to an image of offenders as                     rational or innately bad, from reform and treatment strategies to               deterrence, retribution and incapacitation, and from discretionary              to mandatory judicial decision-making.  The proposed study aims at              the measurement and explanation of knowledge shifts in criminology              and criminal justice studies between 1950 and 1992.  This project               tests the hypotheses that the development of scientific knowledge               about crime and punishment is a function of: (1) the emergence of               specialized institutions of criminology and criminal justice                    studies (i.e., university departments, journals, and professional               associations); (2) extensive government involvement in these trends             through research funding programs; and (3) simultaneous changes in              policy positions on crime and punishment.  The findings will                    improve our understanding of the relationship between the                       construction of knowledge and ideology in criminal justice policy.                                                                                              Data will be collected through content analysis of selected                     journals, and validated through surveys of journal editors and                  interviews with senior scholars.  The source for the content                    analysis is a sample of 3,800 articles on crime and criminal                    punishment in scholarly journals.  In-depth analysis will be                    applied to a smaller subset of articles using the cognitive mapping             approach.  The data sets so established will descriptively measure              the actual trends in criminological knowledge between 1950 and 1992             (time series analysis using SPSS/PC+ Trends).  The data set will                further undergo multivariate causal analysis to test the                        hypothesized impacts of institutional arrangements on published                 knowledge, especially the impact of historic time, type of                      researcher, research institution, funding source (if any), and                  place of publication.  This data set will later be combined with                other data on knowledge shifts in media, the political sector,                  public opinion, and trends in criminal policy and punishment.",
