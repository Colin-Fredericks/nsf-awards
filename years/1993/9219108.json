 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will reconstruct late eocene to Miocene continental climate from             the oxygen isotopic composition of fossel equid enamel phosphate.               This interval is an important period of global climatic                         deterioration inferred from paleoceanographic data with scant                   quantitative  geochemical information from continents.  The  18O                mammalian apatite precipitates in equilibrium with body water,                  whcih reflects ingested water.  Body temperature of mammals is                  constant and known so  18OPO4 records  the 18O of local water sources           which are dominated by the global hydrologic cycle.  The  18OPO4 of             fossil enamel may record continetal paleoclimate.  Fossil equids                are ideal because they are geographically widespread, common from               the Eocene to late Pleistocne, and have modern analogues.  We will              determine the isotopic fractionation between teeth, body water, and             ingested water in modern equids to quantitatively reconstruct  18O              of ingested water  for fossil equids.  We will determine if a                   continental climatic signal is preserved in fossil tooth enamal;                if continental climate reflects the marine record in magnitude,                 direction, and timing; and if equid evolutionary change occurred                concurrently with continetal climatic change.  We will analyze                  fossils  from Wyoming, South Dakota, and Nebraska, where fossil                 samples are available, regional stratigraphy and chronology are                 well known, and location near  the center of the continent is                   advantageous for climate studies.  Our preliminary data indicate                a primary signal is retained by most enamel samples and diagenesis              can be detected.  We will further develop criteria for evaluating               diagenesis   with infrared, XRD, and elemental analyses.  If                    diagenesis is negligible, we will develop a quantitative record of              late Eocene to Miocene paleoclimate from  18O of ancient                        precipitation.",
