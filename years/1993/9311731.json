The program has three parts:  1) continued observation with the LSU bar type gravitational wave antenna, 2) improvement of its sensitivity; and 3) preparation of a detailed design for a new type of detector which promises to be much more sensitive.          The LSU detector has been observing for 2 years.  Its sensitivity to short bursts is now the best ever obtained by any detector anywhere (average burst gravitational strain         2 `     noise is 6x10          19   ), and is probably sufficient to detect the gravitational waves from a supernova within our galaxy.  The LSU group will continue to operate their detector, until they are ready to improve its sensitivity.  Data exchange and searches for coincidences with any other detectors operational will continue.          The LSU group will also investigate a new type of detector with a nearly spherical shape, the Truncated Icosahedral Gravitational wave Antenna, or TIGA.  They have already published calculati ons that predict a 56 fold increase in energy sensitivity for a TIGA detector, compared to the equivalent bar type antenna.  A TIGA system could consist of several omni directional detectors at different frequencies, all designed to work in coincidence with each other and with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational (LIGO).  The LSU group will continue its program to verify the theoretical predictions by experimental measurement on a prototype TIGA.          In collaboration with other U.S. resonant mass detector groups, the LSU gravitational physics group will undertake the detailed design of a TIGA system of gravitational wave detectors.  The goal of the collaborative research effort will be the production, by January of 1995, of a detailed design and a plan for the construction and operation of the system in conjunction with all other gravitational wave detectors in the world. ***",
