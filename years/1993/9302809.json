The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Malcolm S.                                   Pringle to work with Professor Dr. Hubert                                       Staudigel at the Free University in the                                         Netherlands.                                                                                                                                                    The Cretaceous volcanism of the western Pacific                                 is thought to be an ancient analog of the                                       anomalous intraplate volcanism seen in the                                      southern Pacific today, and may have a causal                                   relationship with the systematic, global                                        changes which culminated in the Mid-Cretaceous                                  Greenhouse.  The proposed research project will                                 more fully characterize the distribution in                                     space and time of this volcanism and its mantle                                 source, and investigate whether this volcanism                                  is the result of one large \"Superplume\" or a                                    series of smaller, more discrete events.  The                                   principal tools of this study will be                                           radiometric age determinations, to determine                                    the original position of each site of                                           Cretaceous volcanism, and radiogenic isotope                                    analyses, to characterize the mantle source at                                  that particular location and time.                                                                                                                              The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel to the Netherlands,                                  an allowance to attend research-related                                         meetings and a stipend for twelve months.",
