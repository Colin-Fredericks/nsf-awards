 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a study of synoptic-scale evolution and                   vertical structure of intense convective events and westerly wind               bursts in the equatorial western Pacific.  the main objectives are              to : 1) complete a trial case study of such an event that occurred              during November, 1989, with pre-TOGA COARE data, 2) monitor the                 synoptic situation during TOGA COARE to identify candidates for                 subsequent case studies, and 3) analyze case studies drawn from the             TOGA COARE period in a similar way to the pre- TOGA COARE study to              gain a more complete understanding of how these events evolve and               interact with the ocean in that region.  Objective 3 includes the               analysis of data from four Integrated Sounding Systems, consisting              of surface meteorological instruments, a boundary layer wind                    profiler, and a portable omegasonde for vertical soundings of                   temperature, wind and moisture.  These observations will be                     supplemented with operational gridded analysis products from NMC                and ECMWF, OLR satellite data (as a proxy for convection), and                  oceanographic data from moorings in the TOGA TAO array.  The                    collective analysis of these data will provide insights into the                structure and evolution of synoptic-scale convective events and                 atmospheric circulations thought to be associated with coupled air-             sea processes in the region.                                                         This research is important because it is one of the TOGA COARE             studies examining the relationship between the convective-scale                 physical processes and the larger scales of atmospheric circulation             in an especially climate sensitive region of the world, the western             Pacific Ocean, the field site of TOGA COARE.",
