 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program will provide continued support to Dr. Theodore L. Brown                 of the Chemistry Department, University of Illinois at                          Urbana-Champaign, for the study of reaction mechanisms of                       transition metal organometallic compounds in solution.  Three                   main lines of investigation will be pursued.  First, the loss                   of carbonyl ligands from selected compounds will be promoted                    photochemically, and the reaction intermediates studied using                   low temperature infrared spectroscopy.  Dinuclear metal                         carbonyls, chromium carbene complexes, hydrostannation and                      hydrosilation will be studied using this method.  Secondly,                     linear free energy reationships for organometallic reactions                    will be developed, based on the assumptions of Marcus theory.                   The purpose of this portion of the reseach is to enhance the                    ability to predict changes in reaction rates that result from                   modification of reaction conditions.  In particular, the                        consequences of changes in electronic or steric factors as                      ligands are varied will be investigated, especially in atom                     transfer and associative substitution reactions.  Thirdly,                      molecular mechanics will be used to evaluate ligand steric                      effects.  Early results indicate that the influence of ligand                   cone angles can be successfully interpreted using this approach.                %%%                                                                             Investigation of reaction mechanisms of organometallic                          compounds is reaching a stage in which the results can begin to                 be systematized and generalized.  This work will provide                        guidelines for predicting reactivity in some reactions                          involving loss of a carbonyl ligand, atom transfer, and ligand                  exchange.  Particular attention will be paid to assessing the                   effect of ligands on reactivity.  These studies are important                   for the fundamental understanding of organometallic chemistry                   and catalytic processes involving organometallic compounds, and                 could be helpful for catalyst design.",
