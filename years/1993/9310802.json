 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310802 Olmstead           This research involves the use of systematic and population level genetic analyses to study three endangered species of Puerto Rican amphibians.  Both mitochondrial and nuclear genes will be sequenced, and museum specimens of extinct populations will be used in the analysis. %%% Many amphibians, including toads, are declining at an alarming rate.  Active, multifaceted conservation programs are in effect for several species, including the endangered Wyoming toad, the threatened Puerto Rican crested toad, and boreal toad populations in Colorado.  Populations of all these species are declining, and there are on going efforts to monitor each species' populations.  Unfortunately, the monitoring programs are occurring with little or no information on genetic variation within these species.  Genetic data are important to any conservation and restoration effort because they provide information on genetically unique populations and sibling species as well as information on lack of genetic variation and increased risk from inbreeding. ***",
