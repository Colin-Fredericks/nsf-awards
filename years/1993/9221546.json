This phenomenon has been termed the \"mere                    exposure effect\". Recent experiments in the PI's laboratory                     indicate that awareness of stimulus content inhibits the mere                   exposure effect, so that subliminal stimuli produce significantly               stronger mere exposure effects than do stimuli that are clearly                 recognized.                                                                                                                                                       No extant model of the exposure effect can accommodate this                   pattern of results. Thus these experiments are designed to test a               new theoretical model of the mere exposure effect. This model                   contends that exposure effects result from \"perceptual fluency\"                 (i.e., an increase in the ease with which a stimulus is perceived               and processed) that is induced by repeated stimulus exposures. When             stimulus exposures are subliminal, subjects attribute perceptual                fluency effects to properties of the merely-exposed stimulus based              on cues provided by the experimenter. In contrast, when clearly-                recognized stimuli are used, subjects can attribute fluency effects             to the stimulus familiarization procedure, diminishing liking                   ratings of the merely- exposed stimuli.                                                                                                                           Five sets of experiments will test the attributional model. The               first experiment compares the magnitude of the mere exposure effect             for attended vs unattended stimuli, replicating and extending                   previous work in this area. In the second set of experiments, the               PIs examine directly the processes that underly perceptual fluency              effects for merely-exposed stimuli. The third set of experiments is             designed to assess the relationship between stimulus awareness and              perceptual fluency effects in the mere exposure paradigm. In the                fourth set of experiments, the PI's examine various experimental                manipulations that affect the attribution of liking to previous                 stimulus exposures in mere exposure effect studies. In the fifth                set of experiments, other theoretical issues related to the                     attributional model will be investigated.                                                                                                                         The results of these experiments will have important applications             in several areas. First, these results can inform us in important               ways about the affective and cognitive processes involved in                    attitude formation and attitude change. In addition, these findings             may help to enhance the efficiency of various persuasion techniques             that are based on repeated exposure to a message, concept or                    argument. Finally, these results can be used to increase the                    efficacy of physiological treatment procedures wherein individuals'             attitudes toward stimuli that are disliked or feared are enhanced               via repeated, unreinforced exposure to the aversive stimulus (e.g.,             systematic desensitization).",
