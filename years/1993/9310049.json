 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310049  MORAN       Clearance of large tracts of tropical forests like those in  the Amazon Basin has potential impacts on many processes ranging  from loss of biological diversity to changes in atmospheric  chemistry that affect global temperature and precipitation  patterns.  Considerable attention has been devoted to identifying  rates and patterns of deforestation, but much less scholarly  inquiry has been given to assessing the degree to which native  tree species reestablish themselves in cleared areas.  The  investigative team undertaking this research project have engaged  in research on regeneration rates in two parts of the Amazon  Basin where soils are relatively rich in nutrients.  This project  will expand the comparative framework for this line of research  by using similar methods to investigate three sites with soils  containing fewer nutrients.  Two of the sites are in the Zona  Bragantina of Brazil; the other is in the Rio Negro Basin in  Colombia.  Thematic Mapper digital data from Landsat satellites  will be analyzed in concert with field-based investigations of  land-use change and management practices in the study sites to  identify spatial and temporal patterns of clearance and  regeneration.       This project will make contributions to general knowledge  from both substantive and methodological perspectives.  It will  add to understandings about the processes of forest clearance and  regeneration in different environments, thereby providing the  basis for making more accurate regional adjustments in models of  carbon exchange.  It also will continue exploration of new ways  to integrate remotely sensed and ground-based data for large  areas, a methodological thrust that will enhance and expand  capabilities for data acquisition across large areas.  ***",
