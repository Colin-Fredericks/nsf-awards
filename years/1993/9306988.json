 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306988  Clark    In many species of birds and some mammals, parents raise families of young that  differ in age, size and sex.  When providing food, parents face the problem of how  to distribute it among these young.  The young of many birds must signal their  hunger by begging behavior.  A number of very general theories predict how  parents should allocate care and how much effort offspring should make to get it.  However, there are few studies of exactly how parents might discriminate between  individual young to provide for their particular needs and, further, how younger or  smaller siblings compete successfully for care.  This study will address these  questions with field experiments and observations of red-winged blackbirds, a  species that has not only age differences within broods but also sex differences in  growth rate.  The behavioral differences among siblings due to age and sex will be  documented in controlled tests of those motor and visual abilities that would allow  them to beg effectively from their parents.  These tests will allow Dr. Clark to  identify critical periods when the differences in competitive abilities between older  and younger siblings are greatest.  Field experiments will be used to test parents'  ability to recognize and give appropriate care to young of different developmental  stages.  Both developmental testing and experiments will be used to assess  whether or not younger siblings can accelerate the development of some abilities  such as vision, a flexibility that might help them compete with their older siblings.    This study will contribute to our understanding of parent-offspring interactions in  several ways.  It will be the first to investigate exactly how a helpless nestling  bird's size, age, and sex compared to its siblings affect its interactions with its  parents.  It will thus help to provide a needed empirical base for theoretical  explanations of parent and offspring behavior in vertebrates.  Secondly, this study  may extend our animal mo dels for family-level interactions, a current research  focus in human psychology.  The central question addressed in this area is how  the presence and identity of siblings alters the family environment and changes  the interactions between a parent and each developing offspring.  Altricial bird  broods, unlike same-age litters of altricial mammals, make excellent analogs of  the age-staggered human family, albeit on a much shorter time scale.  Finally, the  study of visual development utilizes an unusual camera technique used for  studying myopia in human infants.  As a first study of visual accommodation in  passerine (perching) birds, the data on nestling blackbirds will add to our  understanding of the development of visual accommodation and its function in  vertebrates, including humans.",
