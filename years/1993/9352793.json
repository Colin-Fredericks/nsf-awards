A series of laboratory activities leads                  students through progressively more significant research                        experiences from introduction of biological concepts through                    guided design of their own experiments to development of                        research protocols. This series develops throughout three                       sequential courses: Frontiers in Biology, Organismal Biology,                   and Plant Physiology and prepares students for independent                      research projects involving organismal metabolism and gas                       exchange. Infrared gas analysis systems engage Frontiers in                     Biology students in the development of concepts in                              photosynthesis and respiration. Students in Organismal Biology                  use a diffusion phorometer and a portable photosynthesis system                 to investigate mechanisms of control of transpiration, factors                  that limit photosynthesis, and the effects of mineral nutrition                 on photosynthesis and transpiration. In Plant Physiology,                       students apply gas exchange techniques used in prerequisite                     courses to develop research protocols for investigating water                   use efficiency of desert shrubs, fruit ripening in native                       plants, and mechanisms of senescence in leaves.",
