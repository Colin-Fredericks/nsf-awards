 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308546   Hopp        In prior research and teaching in the Master's of Management  in Manufacturing Program at Northwestern, these researchers have  evolved a system of relationships or \"laws\" governing factory   behavior.  They term this system, Factory Physics, and have found  it to be a useful framework for comparing competing production   control policies.  In particular, it is a valuable tool for   communicating the subtle tradeoffs involved in the design and   control of a manufacturing system to students, both in academic   programs and in industrial short courses.        Some of the key Factory Physics concepts are based on results  from queueing theory.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of students  for whom Factory Physics id designed have little familiarity with  this topic.  For this reason, they make extensive use of animated  computer simulations to illustrate queueing concepts.  While such  simulations have been very effective in classroom presentations,  they make use of commercial packages that are expensive and time-  consuming to learn.  As a result, have not been able to provide   students with a hands-on learning experience.  In this project, the  researcher will develop a self-contained, interactive software   package that will allow students to easily examine the key types  of queueing behavior in a manufacturing system.  Since it will not  require a commercial package, recipients will be free to duplicate  it, use it in their own teaching, and carry it to industry as a   tool for convincing managers in their companies of the efficacy of  policies that are often overlooked in industry, such as variance  reduction.",
