IP :   C~   s   ~     OS :s  ^   }     C~           K~   9310277 Sontheimer  Early physiological studies of glial cells did not detect voltage and time-activated ion channels in glial cells; however, more recent cell culture studies demonstrate that astrocytes can express         Y       a variety of ion channels, including voltage activated Na   +   , K   +   , and Ca   2+    channels, previously thought to be restricted to neurons.  In contrast to neurons, these channels are not involved in cell-cell signaling but are important in maintaining ion homeostasis in the brain.  Voltage-activated channels have been described in astrocytes from numerous CNS regions and those studies revealed a significant degree of heterogeneity.  However, in all those previous studies little attention has been paid to the question of whether the cells' microenvironment influences the expression and/or activity of astrocyte ion channels.  Since astrocytes in the intact CNS are always surrounded by other cells, particularly neurons, and are exposed to different extracellular milieus, it is important to understand how such factors influence astrocyte physiology.  The proposed project is designed to study factors that modulate ion channel activity in astrocytes.  It has been widely reported that ion channels expressed in excitable cells contain kinase phosphorylation sites, and that activation of protein kinases can directly modulate channel activity.  It is proposed to study whether protein kinase mediated phosphorylation can also influence ion channel activity in astrocytes.  The two most prominent protein kinases known to         Y K     modulate ion channels, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Ca   2+   -depen dent protein kinase (PKC), can be selectively stimulated by neuroactive compounds, such as the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine which stimulates PKA activity.  Dr. Sontheimer will utilize a number of well-characterized activators and inhibitors of PKA and PKC, as well as specific neuroligands known to stimulate these second messenger pathways.  These studies will pay particular attention to the effects of these agents on astrocyte ion channels that have been         Y       demonstrated to play key roles in maintaining K   +    homeostasis in the CNS, such as K   +    channels         Y       and Na   +    channels, which serve as a vital return pathway for Na   +   /K   +   ATPase. ***",
