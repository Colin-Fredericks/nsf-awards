 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305286  Winey    Rheometry is the most common and reliable technique for measuring  viscoelastic properties of materials.  This rheometer, a  Rheometrics Solids Analyzer, satisfies the sample configuration  requirements of many researchers on campus, in that it can  accommodate molten polymers, glassy thin films, fibers,  concentrated solutions, rubber, and composites.  The processing  equipment, includes a melt mixer for combining a variety of  components and a small extruder to form samples for subsequent  structural and mechanical evaluation.    Throughout the School of Engineering and Applied Science and the  School of Arts and Sciences, this new equipment will compliment  the experimental techniques currently used by Penn faculty.  In  our research laboratories we prepare copolymer/homopolymer blends  by using a volatile solvent, a practice which is avoided by  industry, and evaluate the morphology and phase behavior using  transmission electron microscopy and small angle x-ray  scattering.  With the proposed equipment, blends will be prepared  without using a solvent and our extensive morphological studies  will be related to new rheological studies.  In another example,  preceramic polymers are currently studied at Penn by using  synthetic techniques elemental and thermal analysis, and wide  angle x-ray scattering.  The new equipment will provide a means  of fabricating fibers, using the extruder, and studying the  mechanical properties of the preceramic polymers, using the  rheometer.  Other research projects include: relating the percent  crystallinity and conductivity of a conducting polymer with the  viscoelastic properties of the materials, comparing the molecular  motion in polymer blends as measured by both diffusion and zero  shear viscosity, and testing theoretical models of ionomer  solutions by neutron scattering and rheology.    An important goal of this project is to make the research at Penn  more relevant to industrial concerns by using similar processing  techniques and g iving more emphasis to the interdependence of  microscopic structure and macroscopic properties.  ***",
