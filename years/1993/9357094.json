 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: 9357094  PI: Colon    Professor Colon of the University of Puerto Rico will  investigate long-distance electron transfer reactions; he  will do so with support in the form of an NSF Young  Investigator Award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and  Organometallic Chemistry Program.  One avenue of attack  will be through photophysical studies of myoglobin  bearing redox-active coordination complexes at various  surface sites.  The specific objective will be to  evaluate lambda, the reorganizational energy, and to  assess the distance dependence of lambda.  Another very  different approach will be to examine electron transfer  within the medium of layered synthetic materials.  These  materials will be based on zirconium phosphonates, which  will be intercalated with redox donors and acceptors.  By  this technique it should be possible to systematically  control the D-A distance, as well as to achieve vectorial  photoinduced electron transfer.  %%%  There is no doubt that the chemical process of  transferring an electron from one molecular site to  another can occur over distances long on the molecular  scale.  These processes, in fact, are essential in living  organisms.  Experiments will be conducted both to probe  the underlying factors that drive (or limit) this  phenomenon, and also to develop simple materials where  this process can occur in such a way as to mimic  biological photosynthesis.  This work should help to  establish the theory of long-range electron transfer as  well as to apply it in a potentially useful way.",
