In meeting this                  challenge, analytic and experimental investigations of scalable                 parallel processing techniques required for data management                     systems have been identified as critical needs for many grand                   challenge studies.  This research is aimed at studying these                    issues, in particular, to investigate scalable storage structures               and efficient query processing techniques.  The work involves                   both theoretical analysis and system implementation.  The                       expected results of this project include: (1) a multidimensional                distributed file structure that facilitates an efficient                        environment for handling very large data sets; (2) an efficient                 join strategy with dynamic load balancing capabilities for the                  multidimensional data declustering environment; and (3) an                      effective query optimization technique that takes the costs of                  load balancing into consideration.  Products of this                            investigation include an advanced query optimizer that serves                   both as a vehicle for feasibility demonstrations, and a platform                for future database machine development.  The significance of                   this research is in advancing the scalable software technologies                required for the implementation of large parallel database                      systems.  The results will have an impact on providing efficient                solutions to the grand challenge problems.",
