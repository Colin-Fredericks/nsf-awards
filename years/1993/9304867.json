 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our long term goals are to understand the regulatory mechanisms of              gene expression and the molecular basis of differentiation in                   plants using the nopaline synthase (nos) promoter as a model                    system.  We will study the nos promoter to further understand the               regulatory mechanisms controlling activation of the promoter in                 response to a variety of developmental and environmental signals.               We have shown that the nos upstream regulatory region consists of               two hexamer motifs and eight nucleotide spacer sequence and that                this nos element is essential for promoter activity  in various                 cells and for inducibility by wounding auxin, salicylic acid and                methyljasmonate.  During this grant period, we plan to further                  characterize the structure and role of the spacer sequence of the               nos element by the synthetic oligonucleotide mutagenesis and the                random site selection method which is based on the selection of                 specific protein binding sites from a pool of randomized DNA                    sequences.  The sequences immediately upstream or downstream of the             hexamer motif-containing region will also be studied by deletion                analysis.  Interaction between the hexamer motif-containing region              and transcription factor will be investigated.  We have isolated                two cDNA and four genomic clones transcription factors which                    specifically interact with the hexamer motif-containing elements.               Using gene specific probes of these clones, we will conduct                     Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization experiments to                 study whether induction of the nos promoter by wounding or the                  chemical stimuli occurs by increasing the amount of a specific                  transcription factor.  Preliminary data induction of the nos                    promoter is mediated at least in part by the level of the                       transcription factor.  It will be necessary to investigate whether              the increase is occurring at the transcriptional of post-                       transcription level.  We also plan to study the promoter regions of             the bZIP transcription factor genes by deletion and site specific               mutation analyses.                                                              %%%                                                                             The nos gene originated from Agrobacterium is strongly expressed in             most plant cells and regulation of this promoter is controlled by               plant transcriptional factors which are important for a variety of              developmental and environmental signals.  We proposed to study                  molecular mechanisms controlling the nos promoter by these factors.             The information obtained from this study will be useful for                     understanding the structure and function of complex regulatory                  mechanisms involved in plant gene expression.",
