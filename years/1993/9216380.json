 "awd_abstract_narration": "A problem in many areas of science and engineering is that of                   data rectification.  For example, in a plant a wide variety of                  measurements are made of the process variables for purposes                     such as cost accounting, process control, statistical quality                   control, and performance evaluation.  Not all of the possible                   variables are measured, some of the measurements are defective                  in the sense that gross errors creep into the measurements                      because of instrument degradation (or human error), noise                       exists, and unmeasured disturbances enter the processes.  The                   objective of data rectification is to provide the best                          estimates of the process variables that satisfy the process                     model assuming the process model is an accurate one - which                     may or not be the case.  If flawed information is used for                      process control or cost accounting, process performance can be                  degraded, perhaps substantially.  Data rectification involves                   not only reduction of noise but removing of other types of                      contaminants in the data, particularly gross errors.                                                                                                            A problem with some existing techniques for data rectification                  in dynamic processes is their inability to detect gross                         errors.  Often a process model of a complex nonlinear process                   may be inadequate to represent the dynamics of a process.                       Model mismatch prevents correct detection of disturbances and                   outliers, and rectified variables that satisfy an erroneous                     model will include systematic errors.  The use of artificial                    neural networks (ANN) for data rectification can ameliorate                     this problem because the mapping they accomplish can easily be                  of higher quality than that yielded by models based on                          physical principles or regression analysis.  At the same time,                  an ANN could serve as a filter to damp out random noise and                     gross errors.                                                                                                                                                   This research involves the investigation of the possible uses                   of recursive ANN to implicitly model dynamic chemical process                   equipment with the goal of data rectification.  The PI plans                    to generate deterministic simulations of simple and complex                     nonlinear dynamic processes (so that the true values of the                     process variables are known), and to these values add various                   kinds of random noise and gross errors to generate simulated                    measurements akin to real process data.  Scaled simulated data                  will become input to various kinds of recursive ANN, and the                    outputs of the nets will be the rectified values of the                         variables.  The effect of:                                                       (1) the magnitude and frequency of the gross errors,                            (2) the degree of auto and cross correlation in the noise,                      (3) model mismatch between the net and the true model,                          (4) missing measurements,                                                       (5) the sampling rate and delay in the measurements, and                        (6) the appropriate types of recursive nets                                    will be evaluated.***//",
