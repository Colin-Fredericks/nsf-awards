 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climatic records show that polar regions have demonstrated an              amplified response to global climate change through geologic time.              Additionally, polar regions have significant influence upon global              climate processes and conditions.  Clouds also have been cited                  repeatedly as a critical factor in climatic change.  The early                  Eocene appears to have been a time of warm polar conditions, but                climate modeling efforts have been unsuccessful in reproducing                  these conditions.  To date, Eocene seasonality characteristics                  reconstructed from proxy data have been unsatisfactorily explained              by model scenarios of high atmospheric pCO2 or by warm high                     latitude ocean surface temperatures.  However, proxy data                       interpretations may be explained by the presence of warming clouds              at high latitudes.  We have hypothesized that polar stratospheric               ice clouds may have occurred in the early Eocene and produced a                 dampened seasonal cycle at high latitudes.  Here we propose to test             this hypothesis by using an atmospheric general circulation model               to test the sensitivity of high latitude climates to the presence               of such polar clouds.  Of paramount interest will be temperature                seasonality of polar climates with and without such clouds.  We                 will examine the polar cloud mechanism for both poles, thereby                  testing the cloud influence on a water-covered pole surrounded by               land masses and on a continentally-capped pole surrounded by ocean.",
