 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312918  Saltiel  Photoisomerization in olefins having one or more conjugated   double bonds will be studied. Progressively more complex   olefins will be studied, starting from stilbenes, through   1,6-diphenylhexatrienes to bacteriorhodopsin. The question   of diradicaloid versus zwitterionic twisted excited singlet   states will be examined in the simpler olefins by evaluating   medium, substituent, and structural effects on their   photochemistry and spectroscopy. Emission and product   quantum yields will be measured as functions of medium,   temperature, and excitation wavelength. The method of   principal component analysis with self-modeling (PCA-SM)   will be used to analyze these data. From this analysis,   intermediates and the mechanisms of the photoisomerization   processes will be determined.  %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   continuing work of Professor Jack Saltiel at Florida State   University. Mechanisms of rotation about carbon-carbon   double bonds that are induced by absorption of light in the   visible or ultraviolet region will be studied. Of particular   interest will be compounds that have alternating carbon-  carbon double and single bonds. The most complex molecule   in this study is bacteriorhodopsin, the visual   pigment. Light emission and product yields, based on the   amount of light absorbed, as a function of solvent,   temperature and excitation wavelength will be treated by a   modeling program. This treatment will allow a description of   the mechanism of these photoisomerization reactions.  ***",
