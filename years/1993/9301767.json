 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301767  Kaplan       Atmospheric organic acids play an important role in  acidification of rain and clouds.  They are ubiquitous constituents  of urban smog and haze and are present in the atmosphere of rural  and largely uninhabited areas (e.g. the Amazon Rain Forest Basin).   Organic acids not only contribute to lowering pH, they may  contribute to visibility reduction by being adsorbed to \"black  carbon\" and they may play an important role in corrosion due to  their chelating ability.  It has been shown that organic acids such  as formic, acetic, and oxalic acids are emitted into the atmosphere  by automobiles through incomplete combustion.  Additionally,  combustion of biomass and industrial products may also generate  organic acids and their release from vascular plants may be an  important biogenic source.  Little information is, however,  currently available on the emission rates of organic acids from  these various anthropogenic and biogenic sources.  This research  project will attempt to characterize the sources of atmospheric  organic acids in urban and rural areas of southern California by  measurements of their carbon isotopic ratios, such as carbon-  14/carbon-12 and carbon-13/carbon-12.  The carbon-14/carbon-12  measurements by accelerator mass spectrometry can differentiate  fossil fuel-origin carbons form natural biogenic carbons.  The  measurements of carbon-13/carbon-12 can identify various  anthropogenic and natural sources as well as kinetic processes in  the formation of atmospheric organic acids.       To accomplish this project these researchers have developed  methodologies using ion exclusion chromatography to extract,  separate, and isolate milligram quantities of individual organic  acids form atmospheric wet samples.  During Fall 19993 to Winter  1995, atmospheric wet samples such as rain, clouds, fog and dew as  well as gas and aerosol simples will be collected in Los Angeles  and its surrounding rural vicinity.  Various organic acid-emitting  sources will also be  sampled in this study to determine their  specific isotopic ratios.  These source-specific isotopic ratio  data will be compared to the isotopic data of atmospheric samples,  in order to identify the different sources of the organic acids in  there samples.       The identification of specific sources for these atmospheric  organic acids will contribute to future control strategies for  acidic deposition and air pollution problems in Los Angeles and  elsewhere as proposed by the National Clean Air Act.",
