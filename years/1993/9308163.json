The proposed research spans a 3-year period and will be conducted  by five senior scientists, two postdoctoral fellows, and a graduate  student.  The research involves model/data and model/model  comparisons, theoretical studies of ionospheric dynamics and  electrodynamics, ionospheric outflow studies (polar wind), and  certain plasmaspheric studies.  The overall scientific approach is  to consider the ionosphere as an integrated system, which interacts  with both the magnetosphere and thermosphere.  The various members  of the group will study different, but related, ionospheric  problems, with the result that almost all of the major ionospheric  regions will be studied, including the E-region, F-region, and  topside ionosphere at equatorial, middle, and high latitudes.  In  the course of the studies, certain models will be upgraded and/or  improved, but the bulk of the proposed studies will be conducted  with existing ionospheric, plasmaspheric, polar wind, and  electrodynamic models.  The proposed research is directly related  to one of the main goals of both the international/STEP and  NSF/CEDAR programs, which is to elucidate the processes linking the  ionosphere-magnetosphere-thermosphere system.  ***",
