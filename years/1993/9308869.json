 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers have long realized that many workers find jobs                      through friends and relatives.  Survey evidence suggests that                   about half of all workers found their jobs through personal                     contacts.  Both sides of the labor market-- workers and firms--                 appear to benefit from the use of employee referrals.  The                      widespread use of referrals by workers and firms suggests that                  social structure--the pattern of social ties connecting                         individuals--may play an important role in determining labor-                   market outcomes.  In particular, inbreeding bias (the prevalence                of intra-group ties) and triad bias (the prevalence of cliques)                 in social networks may reduce labor-market efficiency and                       increase inequality.  The purpose of this project is to analyze                 the implications of these network biases.  Among the questions to               be addressed are:  (1) How do changes in these social structures                affect labor market outcomes?  (2) What is the equilibrium                      relationship among job-search method, network structure, wages,                 and employment?   Of special interest is whether social network                 explanations of labor market inequality are consistent with                     observed correlations in labor force micro data.  The project is                important because it may help us to better understand why there                 are persistent racial and gender differences with respect to                    wages and other labor market outcomes.",
