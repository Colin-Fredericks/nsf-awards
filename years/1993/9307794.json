The project will focus on the  preparation and characterization of the newly  discovered but not yet understood optical  activity of porous silicon using optical methods  and scanning tunneling microscopy.  Apart from  the scientific interest in the mechanism behind  its operation, there is interest in its potential  applications in electronic devices.  Thus this  newly discovered property of silicon, a cheap  semiconductor, may lead to the marriage of  optical and electronic circuits.  Project funding  will enable the research teams from both  universities to visit one another over the course  of this three-year study.    This project in materials research fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  United States and Jordan to combine complementary  talents and conduct research in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence.  ***",
