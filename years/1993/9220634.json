 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many species of organisms can adopt different outward                      characteristics in different environmental situations.  This                    phenomenon is called phenotypic plasticity.  Such plasticity has                been found in many aquatic organisms where the different                        environments that elicit the alternate characteristics involve the              presence or absence of particular potential predators.  While                   plasticity in such cases is assumed to provide some advantage to                the organism, in many cases this cause-effect relationship is                   difficult to demonstrate.  The characteristics adopted in the                   presence of the predators may result in lower vulnerability to                  predation, or may simply reflect developmental changes that afford              the individual no particular advantage.                                         %%%                                                                                  This proposed research involves phenotypic plasticity in the               freshwater crustacean Daphnia in response to the presence of                    predaceous larvae of the insect Chaoborus.  The research will                   result in useful information about the evolutionary importance of               phenotypic plasticity.  In particular, they will help clarify the               extent to which plasticity is advantageous, rather than simply                  reflecting random changes with respect to the environment.  Such                information will be important in evaluating how organisms can adopt             to a changing environment, such as might result from global                     warming.***//",
