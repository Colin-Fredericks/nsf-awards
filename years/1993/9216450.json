 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses one of the most complex                                 technological problems confronting today's society:                             the minimization of congestion on our nation's                                  roads and high ways.  It is unlikely that significant                           improvements can be made without the application                                of the principles of Intelligent Control.  Toward                               achieving this goal, we propose to formulate system                             models, to analyze vehicle and network modalities,                              and to design control, estimation, an d                                         identification algorithms for Intelligent                                       Vehicle/Highway Systems (IVHS).  We will develop                                a theoretical basis for applying intelligent control to                         large-scale, complex systems, using IVHS as a                                   substantive example.  Our approach is rooted in                                 optimization and control theory, as well as decisions                           analysis an artificial intelligence.  This is a                                 multidisciplinary problem; hence, principal                                     investigators from Princeton's Departments of Civil                             Engineering and Operations Research, Electrical                                 Engineering, and Mechanical and Aerospace                                       Engineering will work together to solve it.                                     Furthermore, we will collaborate with the Vehicle                               Systems Research Department of the General                                      Motors Research Laboratories (providing a link to                               the TravTek IVHS Program currently underway in                                  Orlando, Florida) and the TRANSCOM                                              Interagency IVHS Program (Northern New Jersey                                   and Metropolitan New York area) to assure that                                  this research is not only scientifically meritorious                            but relevant to real needs.  The proposed research                              separates naturally into three tasks: 1) Modeling                               Intelligent Vehicles and Schools of Intelligent                                 Vehicles, 2) Intelligent Traffic Management and                                 Information Transfer for Minimizing Congestion, 3)                              Graphic Simulation of Intelligent Vehicle/Highway                               Systems.  These three tasks will be conducted                                   concurrently and jointly by the  principal                                      investigators and their students.  Anticipated                                  outputs of the proposed research include a new                                  discrete-event formalism for analyzing systems of                               rule-based controllers and physical plants, a                                   hierarchical structure for intelligent management of                            large-scale systems, and a flexible graphics tool for                           investigating mixed-variable dynamic systems, with                              emphasis on IVHS scenarios.",
