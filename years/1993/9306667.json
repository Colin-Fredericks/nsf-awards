 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306667 Farrell          A phylogenetic study of the 32 subfamilies of the phytophagous beetle superfamily Chrysomeloidea (Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae, Bruchidae) based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences will be done.  Preliminary sequence data have confirmed the utility of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and the nuclear small ribosomal subunit gene (18s) for accomplishing this goal.  Phylogenetic analyses will be carried out to determine the relationships among the monophyletic subfamilies within each beetle family and the monophyly of the families themselves.  The primary goal is to provide a basis for a stable classification that reflects phylogeny.  This will be achieved by combining analyses of the proposed molecular data set with available evidence from morphology.  Secondary goals include evaluation of several extant hypotheses concerning the ostensibly relictual affiliation of the most \"primitive\" subfamilies with certain hostplants and eventual tests of the potential influences of shifts in resource use among these beetle lineages on rates of diversification. %%% This project will use both morphological information and new data to be obtained by the Principal Investigator from DNA sequencing of both a mitochondrial and a nuclear gene to determine relationships and establish a sound modern classification for this large group of beetles which includes 32 families in 3 families.  This group or superfamily includes over 72,000 species and many of them are important pests of timber, agricultural crops and stored grains.  The project will also test current ideas on the role of shifts in hostplant affiliations on rates of beetle div ersification. ***",
