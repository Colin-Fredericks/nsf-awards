 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350939  Freed  The Geology Department is using a Philips PW 1840 automated X-  ray diffractometer system which to enhance both undergraduate  courses and undergraduate research. The goal is to integrate  use of the diffractometer into three components of Trinity's  science curriculum: (1) the beginning Physical Geology course;  (2) the geology major, specifically student research projects  and three required sequential courses for the major (Mineralogy  & Crystallography, Igneous & Metamorphic Petrology, and  Stratigraphy & Sedimentation); and (3) laboratory exercises in  engineering and physics classes (Engineering Materials and  Condensed Matter Physics). Beginning geology students use  modern analytical X-ray equipment as an integral part of  examining minerals and rocks. Advanced students are using the  instrument to study mineral identification techniques,  understand crystallographic relationships, investigate  compositional and structural variations in minerals, and work  with multiple-phase systems, such as sediments or fine-grained  igneous or metamorphic rocks. After completing the required  course sequence, geology majors have the experience necessary  to use the diffractometer for addressing mineralogical problems  in a research context. The diffractometer significantly expands  the types of research projects that students can undertake.  ***",
