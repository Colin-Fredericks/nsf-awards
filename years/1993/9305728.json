NSF funds are requested for travel support  of U.S. invited speakers and Ph.D. students.  The purpose of the  meeting is to bring together top researchers-whose expertise spans  material design, material characterization, device fabrication, and  integrated device architectures-to the intimate setting of a small  mountain town to discuss and assess progress in the field.  This  upcoming conference is motivated by a small NSF-supported  conference that was held in Pullman, Washington in the summer of  1992.  At the demand of workers in the field who feel that such a  small forum is lacking, a future series of such conferences are  planned in 18 to 24 month intervals and will be held in those  countries that are active in this field.  ***",
