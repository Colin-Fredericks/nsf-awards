 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US economy boomed in the 1980s as both employment                      and real per capita income increased, but the gains from                        this expansion were distributed unevenly across families,                       workers, and geographic regions.  Current explanations of                       rising disparities in earnings or income involve changes in                     labor market conditions, and US metropolitan areas provide a                    suitable level of geographic scale at which changes in local                    economic, demographic, and political characteristics can be                     examined for their effects on income distribution.  Recent                      research on income disparity has concentrated either on                         regional differences or on national differences between                         persons and families.  Until now, there has been little                         overlap between these two approaches.  The research                             conducted under this award will quantify both the levels of                     and changes in the equality of income and earnings                              distributions within U.S. metropolitan areas for the decade                     of the 1980s.  It will attempt to isolate the effects of                        industrial structure, population and labor force                                characteristics, growth rates, unionization levels, and                         public sector investment on differences in income and                           earnings within metropolitan areas and on changes between                       metropolitan areas between 1979 and 1991.  Data will come                       from the Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS) of the 1980 and                    1990 Censuses of Population, and a series of quantitative                       models will assess the effects of the various metropolitan                      areas characteristics on incomes and earnings.                                       The causes of increasing disparities in incomes and                        earnings remain the subject of intense controversy.  This                       research will advance our understanding of the causes of                        income inequality across persons and families and by region.                    The results should be of use to both scholars and policy                        makers interested in finding out what causes income                             inequality at local and regional levels.",
