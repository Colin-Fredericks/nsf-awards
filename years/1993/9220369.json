 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fast local motions will be studied by molecular dynamics                   simulations.  The results will be incorporated into the dynamic                 rotational isomeric state formalism in order to extend the time                 scale and the size of the systems examined.  Two types of systems               will be studied.  The first type consists of polymeric hydrocarbons             severely constrained by channels.  Here the project will focus on               the influence of torsional oscillations on the orientation                      autocorrelation functions, and the creation, lifetimes, migration,              and destruction of conformational defects arising from independent,             or correlated, conformational transitions.  The second type of                  system consists of polyesters with a variety of spacers between                 aromatic units, and aromatic units that have fluorescence lifetimes             shorter than, or longer than, the time scales of the molecular                  dynamics simulations.  Fluorescence measurements will be performed              for the polyesters under conditions where the internal dynamics is              important.  The overall objective is to increases the time scales,              and the sizes of systems, susceptible to attack by atom-based                   studies of the internal dynamics.                                                                                                                               Polyesters are important industrial materials, and this research                seeks to relate the motions of the molecules to the observed                    properties.  Both computer modeling and critical experiments will               be part of the investigation.",
