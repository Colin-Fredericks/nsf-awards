 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate the growth rate of the magnetic field in                a smooth steady flow of an electrically conducting fluid in the                 limit of high magnetic Reynolds number.  The methods from                       Geometric Measure Theory and  Dynamical Systems provide an                      estimate from above and possibly an explicit formula for this                   quantity which is a central problem of \"Fast Dynamo\" theory. He                 proposes to study the completeness of a system of Floquet root                  vectors in time-periodic problems of fluid dynamics.  If such a                 system indeed exists, it would mean that the magnetic field in a                time-periodic flow of a conducting fluid cannot decay                           superexponentially and the same fact is true for small                          oscillations in a viscous fluid.  He will continue the research                 on the \"geometric instability theory\" for the Euler equation                    which would allow  treatment of flows of an ideal fluid with                    singularities.                                                                                                                                                  The Dynamo problem concerns the  process of a magnetic field                    generation by the motion of a highly conducting fluid.  This                    process is responsible for the existence of the magnetic field of               the Earth, solar magnetic field and magnetic fields in                          astrophysics.  It also can be achieved in laboratory although                   experimental difficulties are considerable.  The suggested                      mathematical study sheds light on the process of \"fast\" (most                   efficient) generation of the magnetic field.  This \"fast\" process               takes place on a time scale many orders of magnitude less than                  the time of Ohmic decay of the magnetic field.  Another line of                 research is the investigation of hydrodynamic instability using                 ideas from dynamo theory.  General conditions for instability of                fluid flows are of fundamental importance in the areas of fluid                 and aerodynamics.",
