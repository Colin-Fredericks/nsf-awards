 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to evaluate options early in the design phase is                    essential for today's complex computer-communication systems.                   Models are required to be able to specify and analyze designs                   prior to expending large amounts of capital on actual                           construction of the system.  Performance and reliability are                    two of the major criteria for system design evaluation, and                     the main approaches to evaluation are simulation and                            stochastic modeling.  The most widely used class of stochastic                  models is Markov chains.  Markov models have their                              limitations, but where applicable they are generally less                       costly than simulation and also have a theoretical foundation                   that permits one to consider formal error bounds, sensitivity                   analysis, etc.  The main limitation of Markov models is the                     amount of computer memory and processor time required for                       representing and solving the models.  The amount of required                    resources grows very rapidly with the complexity of the model                   and unfortunately, models of real systems are often quite                       complex.  The thrust of this research is to develop analysis                    techniques which greatly extend the range of models that can                    be analyzed with Markov chain numerical methods.  The only way                  to deal with the state space explosion problem is to exploit                    properties of the particular class of problems of interest.                     Although it is often effective to identify and take advantage                   of special problem structures, the success of this research                     will also be judged by the generality of the results, i.e.,                     the ability to handle as wide a class of problems as possible.                                                                                                  The approach taken here is to examine several classes of                        important problems in computer system performance and                           reliability modeling and show that certain properties of each                   of these problem classes suggest methods of analysis that will                  permit computation of tight bounds on the solution of models                    that would be impossible to solve via standard numerical                        solution methods.  The results of this research will provide                    both specific results on a set of applications (dependability                   analysis, load balancing, parallel processing and protocol                      analysis) that are of great interest by themselves but even                     more importantly will contribute to the body of formal                          techniques that will provide the basis for advanced design                      analysis tools.",
