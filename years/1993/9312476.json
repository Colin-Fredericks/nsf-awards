 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312476  Fowler  This research studies low-dimensional strongly interacting magnetic  and electronic systems which are increasingly important in  condensed matter physics for understanding high temperature  superconductivity, mesoscopic systems and anisotropic materials.   The approach uses exact solutions, usually solved by the Bethe  Ansatz, of one-dimensional strongly interacting models which are  physically plausible.  However, the exact solutions for these so-  called integrable systems are often difficult to interpret  physically and apply to higher dimension systems.  Systems which  will be studied during the grant period include the XXZ spin chain,  sine-Gordon thermodynamics, Calogero-type systems and the Toda  lattice.  %%%  The theoretical research being done on this grant uses highly   mathematical techniques to obtain exact solutions of model physical  systems.  In most cases, these exact solutions can only be obtained  in dimensions lower than the three dimensions in which we live.   Thus, the applicability of these solutions to the real world is not  always clear.  On the other hand, it is nearly impossible so far to  obtain exact solutions of three-dimensional systems and many  materials have characteristics of lower dimensional systems.  Thus,  judicious use of exact solutions in lower dimensions can help us  understand properties of real physical systems.  This is  particularly the case with high temperature superconductors,  certain mesoscopic electronic devices and anisotropic materials in  general.  ***",
