 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317844  TURNER       Natural scientists involved in global change research need  improved models of changing land cover because of the role that  land cover plays in dynamic natural processes across the globe.  Land-cover change cannot be adequately modeled or projected,  however, without an understanding of the land uses that affect  land cover.  Because land uses are largely the product of human  activities, social scientists therefore must contribute to  improvement in understandings of the social, political, and  economic dynamics that affect the use of land and other  resources.  In recognition of these interconnections and of the  need for both natural and physical scientists to work together to  address these important problems, the International Geosphere-  Biosphere Programme (IGBP) sponsored by ICSU and the  international Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change  Programme (HDP) sponsored by ISSC have agreed to sponsor a  focused scientific research program on global land-use and land-  cover change.  This award will provide support for a Core  Planning Project Committee (CPPC), which is developing a formal  science plan on behalf of IGBP and HDP.  The science plan will  outline strategies for identifying and demarcating common  situations through which various \"driving forces\" alter land use  and land cover.  It also will develop case studies for these  situations and frame global land-use and land-cover models based  on these situations and case studies.       This award will complement contributions for support of the  CPPC office at Clark University.  It also will help support three  international meetings that will bring the broader scientific  community into the development of the science plan.  The final  product of this activity will be a formal science plan to guide  future international collaborative research activities dealing  with land-use and land-cover change.  ***",
