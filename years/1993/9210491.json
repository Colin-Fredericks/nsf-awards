The workshop will be held at                                    the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in New                                   Delhi, on December 11-16, 1992 and is co-                                       sponsored by ISI and the International Linear                                   Algebra Society.  ISI is a major research                                       center for Statistics, Mathematics and                                          Economics where pioneer work on generalized                                     inverses was done by C.R. Rao and S.K. Mitra                                    The center continues to attract eminent                                         scholars of international reputation.  The                                      workshop will include: presentations by                                         outstanding scientists on contributions to date                                 in the theory of generalized inverses and their                                 applications to Statistics and Electrical                                       Engineering, contributed papers giving the                                      latest developments in the field of generalized                                 inverses by active researchers, and panel                                       discussions to identify the directions of                                       future research and to list open problems.                                                                                                                      Scope:  The air travel of six US scientists                                     will be supported by this proposal.  As the                                     bulk of research in generalized inverses has                                    shifted away from the US to India, Europe,                                      Japan and China, this workshop will be an                                       opportunity for US scientists to share their                                    knowledge with the rest of the world and to                                     take stock of the prevailing situation and                                      determine new research directions.    The                                       workshop will be a boost for research in                                        generalized inverses and their applications.",
