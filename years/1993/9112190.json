 "awd_abstract_narration": "There exists a need for large scale liposome manufacturing                      processes which can meet the growing market demand for                          liposomal drug delivery and controlled release vehicles                         with the constraints of stability, sterility, and cost.                         Bio-Eng is developing a large-scale liposome manufacturing                      process which has the potential to improve liposome                             characteristics and encapsulation efficiencies while                            meeting the market needs of the biotechnology and                               pharmaceutical industries. In the Bio-Eng critical fluid                        liposome (CFL) manufacturing process, organic solvents                          used in the preparation of liposomes are replaced with                          critical fluid solvents which, as a result of                                   decompressive forces, can act as a homogenizing agent.                                                                                                          The displacement of organic solvents with critical fluid                        solvents in the liposome manufacturing process will reduce                      the degradation of phospholipids and encapsulated                               therapeutics, and allow rapid solvent separation,                               recovery, and reuse.  There are several potential benefits                      to the proposed processes over existing laboratory and                          commercial processes for the preparation of liposomes.                          The anticipated benefits are: non-use of organic solvents;                      terminal sterilization of the manufactured liposomes; an                        oxygen free atmosphere; lower pressure requirements when                        compared to high pressure homogenation; lower operating                         and manufacturing costs; higher speed of processing; the                        potential formation of uniform frozen and thawed critical                       fluid liposomes; the ability to operate continuously; and                       scalability.",
