The                   Workshop will be held on July 9-11,1993. The previous                           first-of-its-kind Workshop was extremely successful at elicting                 the opportunities available to individuals who pursue advanced                  study in chemistry. The objective continues to be to bring                      minority students from throughout the USA together with                         high-achieving minority mentors from industry, academia and                     government in order to introduce the students to the                            opportunities created by obtaining a Ph.D degree in Chemistry.                  The Workshop will also include opportunities for the student                    participants to visit advanced research laboratories and to                     meet graduate students.                                                         %%%                                                                             This Workshop will provide underrepresented minority students                   with the opportunity to meet peer mentors who have shared the                   same obstacles in their lives and education. These contacts are                 intended to continue throughout their academic careers and                      hopefully, well into their professional lives.",
