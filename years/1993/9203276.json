 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bridge management is concerned with the improvement of existing                 bridges through systematic inspection and maintenance.                          Inspection of bridges in the United States is normally performed                at two-year intervals, subject to change if requested by state                  agencies.  A bridge deterioration model obtained through                        statistical analysis of bridge inspection data as well as                       reliability evaluation of the bridge can be used as a basis for                 the selection of a more objective inspection interval.  The                     statistical analysis will be applied to bridges in states with                  more diverse environmental and climatic conditions for a more                   complete evaluation of the current inspection practice.                                                                                                         A methodology is presented for quantifying inspection intervals                 using reliability analysis and determining existing and future                  reliabilities of a bridge.  The conceptual inspection strategy                  schedules bridge inspection based on the prediction of the bridge               condition.  A simple bridge case study is presented to show the                 effectiveness of such program.  Certain assumptions and                         approximations that are made for this case study will be studied                in detail and a comprehensive reliability based inspection                      strategy will be developed.                                                                                                                                     The National Bridge Inventory lacks structural properties that                  are needed in the reliability analysis.  Recommendations will be                presented for the creation of a bridge database using existing                  Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) technology.",
