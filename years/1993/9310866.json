 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310866  Holzwarth         The mechanisms by which the central nervous system controls  growth and development of cells in endocrine organs is not well  understood.  Since there is an extensive growth in the number of  cells in the remaining adrenal gland following unilateral  adrenalectomy, this physiological system may provide an excellent  model to examine these underlying mechanisms.  While it is known  that the compensatory growth of the remaining adrenal is mediated  by afferent and efferent autonomic adrenocortical nerves, the  cellular mechanisms by which these autonomic nerves initiate and  regulate cell proliferation have not been elucidated.  During  previous NSF support, Dr. Holzwarth identified a potent growth  factor in adrenal glands, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).   She will now determine whether the adrenocortical nerves activate  this local factor which then initiates the cell growth.  Using  state-of-the-art anatomical and molecular techniques, she will  assess the mechanisms responsible for the proliferation of  adrenocortical cells in vivo.  Dr. Holzwarth will determine whether  the cell proliferation is inhibited by immunological blockage of  the growth factor.  She will also measure how much bFGF is formed  and where it is localized during the initial stages of compensatory  growth.  Finally, Dr. Holzwarth will determine whether cellular  receptors present are altered during this proliferation.  These  experiments will provide new insights into how the nervous system  controls cellular processes of non-neuronal cells as well as the  mechanisms by which cells process and utilized their endogenous  growth-promoting factors.  Information gained from this work may  eventually prove important in developing methods to prevent  abnormal cell proliferation.   ***",
