 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is evaluating the capacity for numerical                  competence of non-human primates.  The research focuses on the                  ability of adolescent and adult chimpanzees to acquire number-                  related abilities, including counting, number comprehension, and                the symbolic representation of quantities.                                                                                                                      Drs. Boysen and Berntson already have documented the acquisition                of counting by chimpanzees, as well as the ability to manipulate                number symbols through implicit counting strategies.  Additional                studies of the use of fractions for labelling portions of foods                 and other objects will be completed with two young-adult animals.               Fraction concepts will be tested using novel objects and the                    introduction of a novel fraction.  To test receptive number                     comprehension, the chimpanzees are shown an Arabic numeral and                  then must construct an array of the same number from a collection               of objects.  This is a high-level counting skill, and preliminary               tests indicate success unprecedented in animal research.                                                                                                        This research is adding greatly to our understanding of the                     information-processing capacities of non-human primates for                     symbol use, and the similarities and differences in                             representational abilities between humans and apes.  The                        demonstration of such abilities in a species that shares our                    primate heritage will make important contributions towards                      characterizing the possible evolution of cognition in our early                 hominid ancestry.  These studies may also yield significant                     teaching and training strategies for the acquisition of complex                 numerical skills, which could be applied in a variety of settings               and for a range of compromised human populations, including                     learning-disabled, autistic, and developmentally-delayed                        children.",
