 "awd_abstract_narration": "The kinematic properties and synthesis of single and multiple                   degrees-of-freedom pencil trajectories are investigated in this                 research project. Whereas a line trajectory is one in which the                 tracing element follows a line, in the case of a pencil                         trajectory, both the line and the position of a point on the line               are included. It is therefore feasible to control the movement of               the tip of the pencil and the orientation of the pencil. For a                  single degree-of-motion a pencil trajectory may be regarded as a                point trajectory on a ruled surface. Typical applications of such               motions requiring control of a pencil include drilling, screwing,               welding, cutting, drawing, and laser or water jet positioning. In               the area of design and manufacturing, results from this research                provide an integrated treatment of both the direction and                       position of a line segment, there by eliminating the unnecessary                constraint of a rigid body motion. This leads to a considerable                 simplification for the pencil trajectory synthesis and planning.                The simplification is especially valuable when the number of                    degrees of freedom is limited to achieve high speed, high                       precision, easy of operation, and low cost.***//",
