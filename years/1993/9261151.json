 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new type of infrared multipixel staring array is proposed based               upon the recently observed phenomenon of photofluxonics.  The                   sensor is based on a simple Josephson junction and is the                       magnetic analogue of a CCD photosensor; a novel device geometry                 allows the direct conversion of photons to fluxons.  The                        quantized nature of the photon to fluxon conversion process                     affords a very low NDP.  Experiments indicate that single quantum               sensitivity in the infrared and far infrared range of the                       spectrum is possible.  An array of such detectors would be an all               thin film, monolithic, focal plane device with inherently low                   power consumption.   It will be possible to implement the                       associated read out electronics on the same substrate.                                                                                                          Phase I will demonstrate the photofluxonic effect in a Nb-Al203-                Nb Josephson junction and, according to the results, optimize the               preliminary design for an array of superconducting photosensitive               pixels.  Although well characterized low Tc superconductors will                be used in Phase I, the photofluxonic effect has also been                      observed in high Tc superconductors and there seems to be no                    major impediment to implementing the technology with high Tc                    materials in Phase II.",
