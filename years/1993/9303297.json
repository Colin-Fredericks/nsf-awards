 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predators affect prey populations and prey by consuming                    individuals and by influencing prey behavior itself.  Despite the               attention that both lethal and non-lethal predator-prey                         interactions have received, little empirical evidence of the                    relative importance of each, or of how lethal and non-lethal                    predator effects interact with each other to influence prey                     performance, population dynamics, species interactions and                      distributions, is available.  Previous research has either measured             the entire effect of predation (i.e., lethal and non-lethal                     together) or the isolated non-lethal effect.  Because lethal and                non-lethal effects of predation can have opposing influences (e.g.,             on prey growth rate), the component consequences of predation                   cannot be determined from these experiments.  Laboratory                        experiments to estimate lethal and non-lethal effects of a larval               odonate on its larval anuran prey over a gradient of density                    dependence among prey, and a field experiment to determine lethal               and non-lethal predator impacts on natural prey populations will be             performed.  The complex nature of predator-prey interactions means              that predictions of prey performance are not intuitive when both                types of predator effects are occurring.  A further goal of this                study is to develop a conceptual framework for understanding                    effects of predators that account for both lethal and non-lethal                influences on prey growth and survivorship.                                     %%%                                                                             Insights gained from this work ought to have generality because the             sorts of behavioral responses exhibited by tadpoles are also                    evident within many other taxa (fish, insects, crustaceans, and                 mammals for instance).  Field tests are necessary in order to                   detect the extent to which results are artifacts of the specific                setting (artificial wading pools).  One of the goals of this                    investigation is to more realistically mathematically model prey                performance relationships between foraging behavior and predation               risk/gain.  Recognition of the composite nature of predation                    effects on prey should alter the way ecologists view communities                conceptually.  If higher order effects occur commonly among prey                and predators, then it will not likely be possible, as some have                hoped, for ecologists to understand community patterns based on                 pairwise interactions (a building block approach).  Ecological                  models that successfully predict population dynamics and community              structure will need to incorporate both indirect as well as direct              interactions among species.",
