This summer and academic year program will emphasize the                        study of mathematics, physics, and engineering concepts in                      ways that will demonstrate to the participants how academic                     course work relates to the world around them and how the                        practice of science is accomplished.  Students are presented                    with unusual themes such as exploring space for                                 extraterrestrial life forms.  This leads to the study of                        radio signals from deep space, galactic noise, coding                           systems, and structural materials.  Students learn the                          mathematics of the development of the Richter Scale and how                     earthquake intensity is measured.",
