This project consists of a set of studies designed  to further our understanding of factors that influence the  development of social trust and effective risk communication.  The  research proceeds by categorizing risk communications under two  modes of thought, paradigmatic (logical-scientific) and narrative  (value-bearing stories.)  The discourse of some technical experts  uses the former.  Narrative thought is characteristic of general  public discourse.  These different discourse styles influence  social trust and risk communication.  Another factor that affects  social trust and risk communication is the set of cultural values  expressed in a message.  Value similarity between individual and  institution leads to social trust and successful risk  communication.  Communications express cultural values; those with  similar discourse styles and values and compatible narratives lead  to the same positive results.  The main objective of this project  is to test this hypothesis.  Stage one will develop scales that  will identify and differentiate the forms of social relations  individuals favor in the context of a risk management problem.   Stage two consists of two studies.  The first will use archival  data to determine the extent to which risk communication discourse  is organized into narrative, paradigmatic or mixed forms, and to  associate the form with certain characteristics of individuals such  as institutional affiliation.  The second explores associations  between forms of discourse and social and cultural preferences.   Subjects from various groups involved in risk controversies and  risk management will construct individual and consensus  explanations for a variety of cases.  Results will help to test the  hypothesis that discourse barriers are the key barriers to risk  communication as well as guides to its improvement.  The final   phase involves two studies also.  One tests what meanings  individuals with different preferences about social relations  construct for paradigmatically oriented messages.  One tests  whether using compound narrative forms is an efficacious way to  bridge communication gaps between individuals with these different  preferences.  This project, by generating insight into the ways  people think about risk management issues, will provide guidance  for the improvement of risk communication programs and for the  resolution of policy disputes.  ***",
