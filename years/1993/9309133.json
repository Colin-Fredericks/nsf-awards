X           This research examines the social and technological factors that lead people using computer based information to share information and solve problems.  It also addresses some design questions about new technologies and group work.  Conflicting results from the research on computer mediated group decision making are particularly troublesome, not because they exist, but because they are not empirically examined.  One stream of research suggests that computer networks \"open up\" communication and ease coordination in some tasks.  A second stream of research suggests that computer communication makes it difficult to regulate interaction and reach consensus.  The same technology apparently results in different group behaviors, depending on the kind of task that is performed.  The research proposed here will attempt to explore these task and media effects empirically.  Using theories from social psychology and group interaction, a series of experiments will be conducted to test the implication that computer supported group work may best be suited for divergent, information sharing tasks, but not well suited for convergent, consensus rea ching tasks.  These studies focus particularly on how the distribution of shared and unshared information affects the way in which groups exchange information and solve problems in face to face and computer mediated group decision making.  They also replicate and extend previous work on first advocacy and status effects to examine the effects of unshared information on expert behavior in groups.",
