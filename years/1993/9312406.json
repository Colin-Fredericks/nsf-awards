In current practice, unit processes  for IC manufacturing are controlled by independent regulators of  macroscopic variables such as temperature, pressure, and gas flow  rates.  Setpoint values for these variables are determined by  off-line studies and applied without adjustment during the  processing of a given batch of wafers.  Although setpoint tuning  may be performed from batch-to-batch using techniques such as  statistical process control (SPC), the use of real-time feedback  to adjust the process setpoints in real time has not been  possible until recently because of absence of in situ  measurements of process variables more directly related to the  actual process performance variables.  The particular process to be studied is plasma enhanced chemical  vapor deposition (PECVD) which exhibits many features common to  several IC unit processes.  A differentially-pumped quadrupole  mass spectrometer will be used to sample species directly  incident on the wafer platform during the processing.  Using  physical models and experiments to characterize the response  curves for the process and the dynamic responses of the species  concentrations with respect to the regulated variables,  multivariable control strategies will be implemented to enable  the direct regulation of the species concentrations.  Process  recipes will then be developed in terms of these measured process  variables to more directly influence the process outcome as  measured by several performance variables including breakdown  voltage, flat band shift, thickness, and index of refraction.   Two general approaches to multivariable control (robust  multivariable regulation and model predictive control) will be  implemented and compared leading to new insights into the  practical advantages and l imitations of alternative multivariable  control methodologies.  New models of the PECVD process will also  be identified in the course of this research leading to  improvements in the process performance based on new recipes  defined in terms of the measured process variables.  Many of  these results will be useful for other critical IC processes such  as plasma etching.  ***",
