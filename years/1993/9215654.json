Shah of the University of Central                                     Florida (UCF) to Pakistan to organize a                                         seminar and initiate cooperative research in                                    Computer Vision (CV).  His program will                                         include a seminar and experimentation at the                                    Mehran University of Engineering and                                            Technology (MUET) in Jamshoro, and visits to                                    two other major engineering colleges in                                         Karachi.  The scope of the seminar covers                                       imaging geometry, segmentation, two                                             dimensional shape representation, dynamic                                       scene analysis, shape from X, matching, and                                     texture.  The seminar will include programing                                   work by the participating students.  The                                        visit is intended to stimulate research in                                      this relatively new area in Pakistan and to                                     identify areas of mutual scientific interest.                                                                                                                   Scope:  Computer Vision is a dynamic and                                        growing branch of Computer Science.  It has                                     many applications such as in industrial                                         automation and robotics, traffic control,                                       object tracking, measurement of cloud and                                       wind motion, and in the biomedical field.                                       The UCF has a major department of computer                                      science which is designated by the state of                                     Florida as a Center of Excellence.  Dr. Shah                                    is the leader of the CV group in that                                           department.  His collaborator in Pakistan is                                    Dr. A.Q.K. Rajput, chairman of the Department                                   of Electronic Engineering and Computer                                          Systems at MUET.  The interaction with                                          faculty and students at the seminar and the                                     other visits are likely to open a vista for                                     increasing research in this area in Pakistan,                                   to the benefit of both countries.",
