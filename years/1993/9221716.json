Specifically, the researchers will examine                                      quadratic squeezing involving variables in                                      quantum optical systems which are quadratic in                                  the mode creation and annihilation operators.                                   Drs. Hillery and Buzek maintain that these                                      variables can be observed using combinations of                                 beam splitters and parametric amplifiers or                                     four-wave mixers.  They intend to use these                                     variables as probes of quantum optical systems                                  or field-matter systems to determine more                                       accurate and practical measurement schemes.                                                                                                                     This joint research project in theoretical                                      physics fulfills the program objective of                                       advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                                      leading experts in the United States and                                        Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents                                 and pool resources in areas of strong mutual                                    interest and competence.",
