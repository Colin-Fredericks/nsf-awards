 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is developing an                  undergraduate cognitive science laboratory which is functioning                 as a center for student research projects. Upper division                       students enrolled in independent research are working on a                      research team under the joint guidance of faculty from several                  disciplines (Computer Science, Psychology, Philosophy,                          Linguistics) and participating in a cognitive science seminar.                  Since cognitive science is a new discipline and there is no                     formal coursework in this area, the independent research                        project with a monthly seminar is one way that students can                     gain an interdisciplinary perspective.                                          The laboratory is equipped with 5 student workstations so that                  students can use procedures with extensive symbol manipulation                  and become involved with multimedia projects. This research                     experience is of particular benefit to those interested in                      graduate work in cognitive science. After majoring in one of                    the participating disciplines for 2 years, students are ready                   to embark on complex issues which require a combination of                      interdisciplinary knowledge and powerful computers. The                         Cognitive Science Laboratory is exposing students to a high                     level of problem-solving mastery. This laboratory is also                       enriching the curricula of all of the participating                             departments.",
