 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past two decades, Stanford has conducted a highly                       successful summer workshop that has served as a gathering place for             extended research interactions among economic theorists.  The                   intellectual and physical environment, extended program format,                 experienced staff, and support from the University and the Hoover               Institution have combined to make the Stanford program uniquely                 successful over many years.  The program has traditionally provided             an important forum for younger economists to present and receive                comments on their work.                                                                                                                                         For the summer of 1993, a program with the following three themes               is proposed: Environmental Economics, Financial Institutions and                Imperfections, and Epistemic Foundations of Game Theory.  Each                  topic will be centered on a workshop and will also include a series             of presentations on the same theme.  For the subsequent summers,                topics to be concentrated on include: Implementation and Design of              Economic Mechanisms, Applications of Game Theory to Oligopoly, and              Discontinuous Changes Induced by Inflation.",
