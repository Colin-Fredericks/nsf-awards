 "awd_abstract_narration": "When companies purchase computerized technologies, they anticipate              substantial improvements in organizational performance.  Some                   companies achieve these benefits, but others find the                           implementation of computerized technologies a struggle and the                  benefits of implementation elusive.  There is little research or                theory available to explain such differences in implementation                  effectiveness.  The proposed study of the implementation of the                 same computerized manufacturing technology (manufacturing resource              planning or MRPII) in 35 plants will begin to fill this gap.  The               research design holds the technology constant across plants,                    allowing a rigorous assessment of the impact of organizational                  characteristics and processes on the outcomes of technology                     implementation.  These organizational characteristics and processes             include climate for technology implementation, financial resource               availability, and upward communication within in each plant.                    Implementation outcomes include employee use and acceptance of the              technology and improvements in plant performance as a result of                 technology implementation.  Survey data will be gathered from an                average of 40 plant employees (plant management, implementation                 team members, and technology users) in each plant to test                       hypotheses regarding implementation effectiveness.  The study                   includes a longitudinal component, with plant management assessing              changes in plant performance as a result of technology                          implementation at two times, one year apart.  //",
