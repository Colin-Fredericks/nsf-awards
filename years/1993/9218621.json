 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will develop several numerical formulations for the                 purpose of studying fault-like behavior in viscous flow                         calculations, specifically applied to understanding the dynamics                of subduction zones.  he will compare formulations, including the               formulations currently used in plate calculations,  using                       observables such a gravity and topography profiles, stress                      distributions (in the plate and slab), compressional and                        extensional tectonic environments (e.g., formation of back arc                  basins or mountain belts), plate velocity and slab dip.  This                   systematic comparison will not only highlight strengths and                     weaknesses of the various methods, it will call attention to                    features which are unique to one particular methods and may be an               artifact of that method, not a robust characteristic of faulting.               On the other hand, since each method is built on different set of               assumptions, a comparison of approaches may lead to an                          understanding of unique signatures in the observables (e.g.,                    topography and geoid profiles, slab dip, tectonic environment)                  which could be used to predict the dominance or absence of physical             processes in specific subduction zones.",
