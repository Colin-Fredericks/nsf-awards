The Center is composed of two core universities,  the University of Southern California and the University of  California, Los Angeles, and three affiliated universities, the  University of California, Irvine, Arizona State University and  California Institute of Technology.    The Center was initially supported by a group of companies through  a non-profit organization, Institute of Manufacturing and  Automation Research.  This Institute recently has merged with  another, the Computer-Aided Manufacturing International.  The name  for newly joined organizations is \"Consortium for Advanced  Manufacturing-International.\"  The Center will be the research  component of the new organization.    Funding for the first year of a three-year continuing award for an  evaluator to study the industry/university interaction occurring in  the Center is also provided.    Additional funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's  Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Office to obtain a  non-voting membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Southern  California be awarded $58,000 for the first year of a three-year  continuing award (includes $8,000 for an evaluator).  An additional  $10,000 is recommended for one year with funds provided by the U.S.  Department of Energy.",
