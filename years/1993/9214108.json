 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-Sweden cooperative research                   in computer and computation theory between Andrzej                              Proskurowski of the University of Oregon and Stefan Arnborg of                  the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.  The                      principal objective of this project is the development of efficient             algorithms for hard optimization problems restricted to partial k-              trees.  The class of partial k-trees includes most of the important             families of graphs with an underlying tree structure. This research             focuses on the practical aspects of recognizing partial k-trees and             finding tree representations.                                                                                                                                   Dr. Proskurowski brings to this collaboration his expertise in                  algorithmic graph theory.  This is complemented by Dr.                          Arnborg's background in logic. They propose to address                          deficiencies in current graph theory through their work on a                    graph reduction system, including implementation of related                     algorithms, and by establishing algorithms for obstruction sets.                They will also investigate the streamlining of algorithms in                    solving distance-related discrete optimization problems.  Their                 combined and complementary expertise and efforts could lead to                  new, fast, practical algorithms for difficult optimization problems.",
