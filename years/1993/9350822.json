The curriculum is being  impacted by this instrumentation throughout the four year  undergraduate experience.  To get the students excited about  science and to show them what is possible in order to fire  their imaginations, students are making use of the  instrumentation at least twice in each of the introductory  courses, dynamic earth and oceanography. Sophomore and junior  required geosciences courses, particularly the lab experiences  in sedimentology, mineralogy, petrology, structure, and  paleontology are being modified considerably in light of access  to this instrumentation.  The microworld is now accessible to  chemical characterization in addition to the macroworld.  The  breadth of experience, the depth, and the sheer number of  undergraduate research opportunities is being substantially  increased. Students from outside our institution are being  impacted by this improvement, too, through our very active  participation with eleven other geology departments in the Keck  Geology Consortium.   ***y",
