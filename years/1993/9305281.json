 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305281  Rea  The vacuolar membrane of plant cells contains two primary proton  pumps: a V-type ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3) and a pyrophosphate (PPi)  energized proton-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (V-PPase:  EC 3.6.1.1).  Both enzymes mediate electrogenic H-translocation  from the cytosol to vacuole lumen to establish an inside-acid pH  gradient and inside-positive membrane potential.  This may then be  used to energize the secondary H-coupled transport of a wide range  of solutes.  The project planned is based on our recent molecular  cloning of cDNAs encoding the substrate-binding subunit of the V-  PPase from Arabidopsis thaliana and Beta vulgaris and the isolation  of genomic clones from the former organism.  Two main areas will be  examined.  (1) Studies will be finished to characterize Arabidopsis  clones and to determine if they correspond to isoforms of the  substrate-binding subunit, to additional unidentified subunits of  the V-PPase containing sequence identities with the substrate-  binding subunit, or to non-V-PPase genes.  (2) Experiments will  also be performed to study the in vivo function of the V-PPase in  Arabidopsis and Nicotiana plumbaginifolia by expression analysis,  and the formation of antisense and overexpression transformants.   Results will shed light on the overall subunit composition of V-  PPase and the possible existence of nuclear-coded homologs in other  organelles.  The possible involvement of the V-PPase in primary K  ion-translocation, as well as proton-translocation, and the  increasing recognition of PPi as a key metabolite in plant systems,  implicate the pump in pH stasis, resistance to anaerobiosis,  sucrose mobilization, turgor regulation and stomatal function.   Perturbation of one or more of these processes in transgenic plants  with different degrees ofV-PPase expression, will facilitate  elucidation of the true physiological function of the V-PPase.  %%%  Proton-translocating pyrophosphatases (PPase) have been found in  energy-coupling membranes  of mitochondria and in phototrophic  bacteria.  The so called V-PPase, however, is the first example of  a pyrophosphate-driven ion translocase in a \"non-energy coupling\"  membrane.  This in conjunction with its unique origins, membership  in a new category of ion-translocases, and its abundance and  ubiquity in plants, makes the thorough characterization of the  system important for general knowledge.  The work described may  contribute new insights into the role of PPi in plant sucrose  metabolism, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of plant cell  turgor and nutrient composition, and in strategies peculiar to  plants for ensuring cellular pH regulation and sustained metabolic  activity under conditions of limited oxygen availability.  ***",
