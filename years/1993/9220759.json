 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to examine the hypothesis that plant resources are                   allocated to maximize carbon gain and productivity under the                    constraints imposed by the seasonality of moisture and irradiance.              Lifespan, mass per area, nitrogen concentration, area per plant                 mass, area-based construction costs, and assimilation capacity of               leaves will be examined as determinants of productivity (relative               growth rate) during the dry season and wet season in Panama. These              features have been hypothesized to be mutually supporting,                      interdependent, and casually interrelated. Variation in leaf                    features will be documented over light gradients within the                     canopies of mature evergreen  tropical species, and among seedlings             of these species in an experimental common garden with a factorial              design of contrasting levels of light and water. These species                  encompass considerable variation in leaf longevity, while producing             new leaves in seasons of contrasting water and light availability.              As such they allow the examination of specific predictions about                how functional characters vary in response to variation in the                  opportunity for carbon gain. Studies will be conducted at the                   Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) using a construction             crane for access to the canopy of a tropical dry forest. Garden                 treatments and canopy trees will be followed for three years. These             will be the first comprehensive data for within-canopy                          physiological variation, and the first comparison of seedlings and              canopy trees for leaf longevity and function in tropical species.               These studies will demonstrate the potential for selection to                   produce coordinated responses among leaf characters to short-term               and long-term variation in resources. If functional relationships               among these features prove to be tightly coordinated, such                      physiological syndromes will provide an empirical link between leaf             and whole-plant processes of growth and reproduction. The canopies              of tropical trees provide some of the steepest resource gradients               known with respect to light, humidity, leaf water, and possibly                 nutrient, and thus are a model system to assess the relationships               among functional characteristics. Because of the great concern over             tropical deforestation, there is a pressing need to understand                  physiological syndromes associated with species capable of rapid                regeneration.",
