 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305115     Ammar       A significant obstacle to achieving heterogeneous system  interconnection is the need to maintain compatible network  protocols on all communication systems.  Protocol standardization  and profiling has long been viewed as a way to overcome this  obstacle.  The exclusive nature of this approach, however, presents  certain limitations.  Among them are exclusion of sometimes  superior technology and the necessity for strict agreement among  systems.  This research will consider an inclusive approach for  achieving inter-operability based on the use of multi-protocol  architectures, that is systems with a mixture of protocols from  different standards families.  Inter-operability in these  architectures is achieved by 1) providing sufficient overlap in the  protocols that systems implement and 2) equipment systems with the  mechanisms that can be used to determine this overlap.  The work  will have two major components:  a model building activity which  will help focus the work and help in identifying problems and  solutions and a parallel implementation activity based on a case  study of Internet and OSI protocol suites.  ***",
