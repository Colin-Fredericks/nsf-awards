 "awd_abstract_narration": "Department of Astronomy and Physics at the University of                        California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with Caltech and               JPL, propose to hold a timely conference entitled Infrared                      Astronomy with Arrays:  the next generation on the UCLA campus from             July 18-22, 1993.  Infrared array detectors have been in widespread             use for only 5 or 6 years, but already their impact on infrared                 astronomy has been tremendous.  Efforts to design and construct                 even better IR arrays with larger formats have also continued at a              rapid pace.  By the date of the proposed conference, many infrared              instruments using arrays with up to 256x256 pixels will be in                   operation.  The UCLA meeting will bring together, in a unique                   forum, astronomers, technologists and IR array manufacturers, to                see and hear about the exciting science that is already being done,             to exchange knowledge on methods of operation and data reduction,               and to discuss future prospects in the era of very large ground-                based telescopes, Antarctic astronomy and space missions dedicated              to infrared science.  Equally important, the conference will                    produce direct interactions between developers and a large, and                 growing, number of users and will serve to focus the concern of the             community on funding detector improvements and ensuring                         availability of future supplies at this critical juncture.                                                                                                      This meeting, although aimed primarily at ground-based infrared                 astronomy, will capitalize on the synergism with space-based                    applications.  The conference will be modelled on the successful                \"turning-point\" workshop held in March 1987 in Hilo.  The                       conference is timely since it has been three years since the most               closely related event.",
