 "awd_abstract_narration": "9358288  Rotea  As in other areas of engineering, design of control systems  involves tradeoffs among competing objectives.  The basic problem  is to find a controller that optimizes several competing  performance and robustness requirements associated with one  dynamical system.  Good tracking of reference inputs vs low  sensitivity to sensor noise, robust stability vs performance, are  just a few examples of these tradeoffs.  Clearly, it is important  to develop tools to help the designer understand how the various  competing objectives conflict with each other.  One goal of this  research is to obtain design procedures for the synthesis of  controllers that meet several design specifications in the  presence of uncertainty in the plant description.      It is intuitively obvious that the performance of a given system  may be greatly improved if the plant to be controlled and the  controller are designed simultaneously rather than designing the  plant first and then the controller.  Unfortunately, in some  cases of engineering relevance, an integrated plant/controller  design is not feasible due to the large number of variables and  design objectives.  However, there are some challenging aerospace  problems for which such an integration is not only feasible but  also desirable.  Another goal of this research is to develop a  methodology for the design of systems (i.e. both plant and  controller are to be designed) that satisfy multiple design  specifications of practical significance.      This research has three main components: (1) the development of  new theoretical results for the analysis and synthesis of robust  feedback systems with multiple design specifications, (2) the  development of computational efficient algorithms to implement  the theory, and (3) applications to validate the results.  ***",
