The first part of this  project is to encourage the use of formal robust methods in  applied econometric research by evaluating a robust estimator  suitable for simultaneous equations settings, which is both  extremely intuitive and very simple to implement computationally.   In essence, the first part of the project is designed to convince  applied econometricians that robust estimation is easier than  they may have thought.      The second part of the project is designed to convince the same  audience that robust methods are more necessary than they may  have thought.  Instead of looking at the implications of using  robust estimators in place of conventional ones in several  isolated or unrelated applications, the proposed research would  first replicate the published results of a set of three papers  which addressed the same set of economic issues.  Considered as a  whole, the striking, and unsettling, feature of this group of  papers is that even though each used the same data set,  comparable estimation techniques, and addressed the same set of  issues, essentially no consensus on the substantive economic  questions emerged from these studies.  After replicating the  original, highly divergent results, the proposed research would  reestimate the models, maintaining any differences in the  specification, but using formal robust methods.  If robust  estimates are in much closer agreement across the different  studies, then this would show that currently accept econometric  practice is not an adequate substitute for the systematic and  objective treatment of data errors and extreme observations  provided by robust estimation.     More specifically, this project analyzes the properties of the  Krasker-Welsch robust simultaneous equations estimators and the  instrumental variables(IV) version of the Huber estimator as a  simpler alternative to Krasker-Welsch.  By comparing the  estimates, and the corresponding economic implications, which  result when one applies a conventional (nonrobust) estimator, IV-  Huber, and Krasker-Welsch, the research will demonstrate the  extent to which the choice of conventional vs. robust methods can  make an important difference to the economic conclusions which  are drawn from the data.     ***",
