They are currently at the midpoint of a ten year drive for excellence in chemical education and research.  By emphasizing the inseparability of teaching and research and involving undergraduates as major contributors to the ongoing research, they can serve as a model for other research intensive universities.  This award will allow the university to renovate their main facility for chemistry teaching and research, Fletcher Brown Laboratory, which is currently obsolete.  This renovation will facilitate cutting-edge research, improve education for the next generation of chemists, and attract outstanding new teacher/scholars and a more diverse student population.  The NSF award to this university will be matched by more than two to one and will enable state-of-the-art laboratories at the University of Delaware.  ***   u                                          ! ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S   U V W X Y Z   \\   ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~                                                                                                                                     9313319  Futrell  The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Delaware conducts research  and training in t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 !         !
