 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cognitive Science Department at UCSD is developing a new                    program of training with the goal of unifying research in brain                 science, behavioral studies, and computational theories and models.             Although still in the early stages of development, the program                  already shows real promise.  The advanced graduate students are                 producing insightful and publishable papers that cut across these               disciplines.  The program's three years of experience leads to                  confidence that the multidisciplinary approach to the study of                  cognition will significantly enrich our understanding of the                    biological and computational bases of cognition.  These                         traineeships will enhance the educational experience of students by             permitting them undistracted time and energy to attend to the                   rigorous coursework and experimental research required by this new              discipline.  The goal of this grant is to attract intellectually                diverse and multiply-equipped students, with special attention to               minorities, women, and others who have been under-represented.",
