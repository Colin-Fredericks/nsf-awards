 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with determination of the three-                      dimensional molecular and crystal structures of biopolymers,                    primarily polysaccharides, using x-ray fiber diffraction analysis.              Such polymers do not form extensive crystals that can be analyzed               by traditional x-ray crystallography.  However, they can often be               prepared as fibers consisting of more-or-less parallel                          microcrystals.  The structures of the polymers in such fibers can               be determined by supplementing the x-ray diffraction data with                  stereochemical information, and optimizing model structures so that             diffraction calculated from the model agrees with that measured, as             well as possible.  The goals of this project are:  (1) To extend x-             ray fiber diffraction technology by improving techniques for data               collection, allowing use of data from more disordered polymer                   specimens, improving optimization of model structures and                       developing measures of accuracy; and (2) to determine the                       structures of a variety of polysaccharides of biological and                    industrial importance and so identify the intra- and inter-                     molecular interactions that are the molecular basis of their                    important properties.                                                           %%%                                                                             The significance of this research is that:  (1) It will allow x-ray             diffraction analysis of biopolymers to be applied with more                     precision and more routinely, and to a wider range of biological                polymers and assemblies.  These developments will impact not only               its applications to polysaccharides, but also to nucleic acids,                 helical viruses and membrane proteins that form disordered planar               arrays.  (2) The polysaccharide molecular structures and                        interactions determined will help us and others to understand why               these molecules have the properties they do, and that such                      knowledge will both prompt and discipline further useful inquiries.             Specific information to be expected includes the molecular basis of             the useful viscosity properties of solutions of bacterial                       polysaccharides such as xanthan, acetan, wellan, and XM6, and the               plant polysaccharide konjac mannan; and relationships between the               molecular structures and biological functions of a number of                    polysaccharides that are important components of mammalian                      connective tissue and the exoskeleton of insects and crustaceans,               that are antigens to some bacterial pathogens, and that are                     important in the process of nitrogen fixation.",
