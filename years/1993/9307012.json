 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate a three trophic level                       interaction in a hybrid zone of cattails. The three levels of                   interactions include:  the cattails and the hybrid, herbivores that             eat the seeds of the cattails, and parasites that infect the                    seed-eating herbivores. To study how herbivory varies among the                 three types of cattails, field experiments will examine the                     herbivore loads sustained by these cattails over a broad geographic             range. The role that hybridization and introgression play in                    influencing rates of herbivory and parasitoidism will be addressed              with a transplant study using potted plants of various crosses.                 Herbivore exclusion and addition experiments will examine 1)                    whether the pattern of reduced herbivory on the hybrid cattails can             be attributed to plant properties or parasites, 2) the degree of                dependence that one species of seed eating herbivore has on                     the presence of another.                                                        %%%                                                                             ALthough hybridization of plants has been responsible for 30-70% of             the genetic variation in and among plant species, little is known               about the three-way interactions that occur in zones of                         hybridization. By focussing on the patterns of herbivory and the                herbivore-natural enemy interactions, the dynamic nature of plant               hybrid zones will be elucidated. This research will make an                     important contribution to understanding the role of hybridization               and control of natural enemies in plant populations.",
