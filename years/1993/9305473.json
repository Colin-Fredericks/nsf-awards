 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305473  Mandoli    Dr.Mandoli's long term goal is to understand how developmental age  and/or size of an organism and environmental signals co-regulate  initiation of reproductive development. A genetic dissection of the  initiation of reproduction in Acetabularia acetabulum will provide  unique insights into development at the level of the single cell.  Initiation of reproduction in A. acetabulum, requires de novo  protein synthesis, and is regulated at the translational level by  a) developmental age/size of the cell, b) blue light and c) a  putative cytosolic, nuclear encoded inhibitor. There are three  specific aims in this proposal: 1) To breed an isogeneic cell line.  Isogeneic cells will provide a homogeneous background for mutants.  The cell line also will be screened for increased fecundity and DNA  content using four parameters which correlate with these  phenotypes; 2) To screen for two types of developmental mutants;  those which are developmentally arrested at specific points during  vegetative growth (da mutants) and those which initiate  reproduction or 'cap' prematurely (early mutants) which may be  defective in, or null for, an inhibitor. Mitotically active haploid  nuclei will be mutagenized with EMS prior to gametogenesis at a  dose known to induce 50% kill of the subsequent generation.  Treatment of mitotically active haploid nuclei will propagate  populations of mutant gametes inside gametangia. Selfs and  backcrosses of gametes will recover recessives; 3) To characterize  these mutants using nuclear and cytoplasmic complementation in  trans (cell grafting and nuclear transplantation) and classical  genetic techniques. Dr. Mandoli can rescue da mutants in three  ways. First, implanting a wild type nucleus will 'piggy-back' the  mutant nucleus through reproduction. Second, grafting a wild type  cytoplasm may complement the mutant in trans. Third, repetition of  development post amputation will determine if regrowth and normal  development are the same. Classical genetics  of early and rescued  da mutants will determine dominance, numbers of alleles and  complementation groups.  ***",
