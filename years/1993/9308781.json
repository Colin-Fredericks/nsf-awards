Specifically, the                                        researchers will: 1) prepare DNA-modified                                       mercury and graphite electrodes and 2) study                                    the interactions of DNA anchored at the                                         electrode surface with proteins, intercalating                                  drugs, metals, and cancerostatic substances as                                  compared with the DNA interactions in solution,                                 using electrochemical and spectroscopic                                         methods.  The results of this project should                                    contribute to our understanding of the                                          interactions of nucleic acids with surfaces,                                    proteins, small ions and drugs.                                                                                                                                 This research in molecular biophysics fulfills                                  the program objective of advancing scientific                                   knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    U.S. and Czech Republic to combine                                              complementary talents and pool research                                         resources in areas of strong mutual interest                                    and competence.  Funds for the project are                                      awarded through the US-Czech Joint Fund,                                        Prague, in accordance with established                                          guidelines.",
