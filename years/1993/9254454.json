 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alliance of Mentors for Physics Instruction: A Teacher                          Leadership Institute is a joint project of California State                     Polytechnic University, Pomona and California State                             University, Fullerton.  The project is designed to train 42                     experienced high school physics teachers with strong                            backgrounds in physics in content and leadership training in                    the seven-County Southern California metropolitan area and                      to develop and establish this group as an Alliance of                           mentors to be used as a resource for other teachers.  The                       focus of the content training will be modern physics concept                    enhancement along with directed studies in the incorporation                    of modern physics topics throughout the classical high                          school curriculum.  There will be three residential summer                      institutes, during which content enhancement will be                            performed with lecture presentations, laboratory                                experiences, computer technology training (using Interactive                    Physics, Physics Explorer and other software), guest                            presentations and problem solving sessions.  In addition to                     these activities, summer institutes will include leadership                     training, preparation and design of academic year workshops                     and development of strand activities described below.                                                                                                           Academic year activities will include professional                              development workshops offered through County Offices of                         Education, during which mentors will disseminate content and                    strategies to additional physic teachers.  These workshops                      will be of two types: 1) Modern Physics Workshops, designed                     for experienced physics teachers and aimed at passing on                        strategies for incorporating modern physics into the high                       school curriculum; and 2) Conceptual Physics Workshops,                         designed for junior high school teachers, new high school                       teachers and crossover teachers, and focused on building                        strength in fundamental concepts in physics.                                                                                                                    In addition, each mentor will be responsible for pursuing                       professional development activities in one of three                             \"strands\": 1) Elementary In-Service Strand, in which                            participants will work with the California Science                              Implementation Network (associated with the California State                    Systemic Initiative) in improving the abilities of                              elementary school teachers to teach physical science; 2)                        Research Strand, in which participants will establish and                       implement an educational research project at their local                        site; or 3) Scope, Sequence and Coordination In-Service                         Strand, in which participants will work with California                         Scope, Sequence and Coordination (SSC) representatives in                       assisting SSC teachers in their abilities to teach                              integrated science.                                                                                                                                             The mentors will attend Topical Conferences on three                            academic year Saturdays each year, at which research                            scientists will share information in morning presentations                      about applications of physics in the research world.  In                        addition, all high school physics teachers in Southern                          California will be invited to attend these Conferences.  In                     the afternoons of these days, the mentors will hold meetings                    designed to share information about workshop and strand                         activities and maintain networking relationships.  These                        networking relationships will be further enhanced through a                     link to CSUNET, an existing computer network that links the                     California State University campuses.                                                                                                                           The mentors' strand activities will form the basis of a                         thesis project.  After completing the three-year program,                       mentors in the Alliance will be eligible for a Master of                        Arts in Teaching Science degree, using their thesis project                     in conjunction withcontent enhancement from the summer                          institutes and a series of science education courses offered                    along with the summer institutes.                                                                                                                               The PI for the project is Dr. John Jewett of CSU-Pomona.
