 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project between C. Rogers (Tufts U.) and                J. Eaton (Standford U.).  A combined experimental-numerical                     simulation approach is proposed to displace the masuring control                volume of an LDV system as it were a particle in a turbulent                    field.  The LDV system will use an active control loop.  The                    fluid velocity autocorrelations in a particle-Lagrangian                        reference frame, and the correlations between the fluctuating                   velocities of the particle and the fluid at the same point, will                be detrmined.  The obtained data are similar to the results                     derived from direct numerical simulations, which currently are                  feasible only at turbulent flow with low Reynolds numbers.  The                 results may be useful to calibrate various theories and                         numerical simulations in tow phase flows.  The conditions of the                experiment are simplified:  only point particles are simulated,                 particles do not affect the flow, the testing domain is two-                    dimensional, the effects of particle shape and wake are                         considered.                                                                                                                                                     The present project may lead to significant advances in                         understanding and modeling disperse two-phase flow at high                      Reynolds numbers of interest in various industrial processes.",
