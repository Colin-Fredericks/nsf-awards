 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic pack ice seals are represented by four species,                   Crabeater, Lobodon carcinophagus; Weddell, Leptonychotes                        weddellii; Leopard, Hydruga leptonyx; and Ross, Omatophoca                      rossii.  These species could be potentially affected by human                   related environmental impacts that are beginning to occur within                the Antarctic ecosystem.  The impact that such disturbances as                  global warming, ozone depletion, and commercial fisheries, could                have on the ecology and population dynamics of these species is                 unknown.  Because of their dependence upon the pack ice                         ecosystem, it has been hypothesized that this group could be                    particularly vulnerable to slight changes that would be caused by               such events.  Census data, from very limited surveys, in the                    early 1980's, have shown that the crabeater seal population may                 have declined in certain areas of the Antarctic in recent                       decades.  This species is currently being viewed as an indicator                of fisheries impact.  However, very little is known about the                   total distribution, abundance and general ecology of this species               around the Antarctic continent.  Thus, it is difficult to                       properly interpret local changes that may be observed from                      investigations.  This workshop will produce an integrated study                 document that will prioritize topics of research on these marine                mammals.  The workshop will  encourage cooperation and sharing of               data, logistic resources, and scientific expertise.",
