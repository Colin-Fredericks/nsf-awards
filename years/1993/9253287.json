 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a four year program to build a partnership                      between four school districts in Westmoreland County, PA,                       local industry, and Saint Vincent College, in support of                        mathematics and science education in the four districts.                        The project will consist of three components: 1)  10 day                        summer academies for 90 elementary teachers from the                            La Trobe School District (grades k-6), with school year                         follow-up support for implementation and evaluation of new                      mathematics and science activities developed during the                         academies;  2) the development of 24 teams (6 per                               participating school district) consisting of a junior or                        senior high school \"lead or mentor\" teacher, an industrial                      scientist and a college scientist.  The scientists will                         introduce the teachers to their work environments and will                      assist them in the development of appropriate hands-on                          classroom activities to improve their mathematics and                           science courses: and 3) three five day seminars for 18                          selected teachers to develop and implement an integrated                        mathematics-science capstone course for high school seniors                     in the four school districts.                                                                                                                                   Cost sharing equals 120.2% of the NSF award.",
