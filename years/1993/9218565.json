This project is a renewal of                                        research conducted under NSF Grant No. 90-                                      02442.  Special emphasis in this research is                                    on reactions between nitrogenous organic                                        compounds such as the amino acids and                                           peptides that are found in treatment plant                                      effluents.  The investigator plans on using                                     radiotracer techniques to determine the                                         stability and breakdown products of the                                         chlorinated organic compounds.                                                                                                                                  Chlorination of wastewater treatment plant                                      effluents is a process relied on for                                            disinfection of the effluents prior to their                                    placement into environmental waters despite                                     the known formation of chlorinated organic                                      compounds that subject the environment and                                      subsequent users of those waters to potential                                   health risk.  Results of this project are                                       expected to provide the basis for any changes                                   that may be necessary in use of and in the                                      engineering design of chlorination processes                                    to avoid or eliminate negative effects                                          associated with this practice.",
