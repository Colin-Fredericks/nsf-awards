 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an analysis of the rate of production and                       dissolution of biogenic silica in the uppermost 150 meters of the               Ross Sea, and is part of a coordinated study of the biogenic silica             and organic carbon cycling in the water column and the sediments of             the Ross Sea.  The data base for the study was obtained from                    dedicated cruises of the R/V Polar Duke in 1990 and in 1992.                                                                                                    The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf environment is the                 major repository for silica accumulation in the global ocean, and               dominates the global silica budget.  The Ross Sea is a particularly             anomalous area in which large amounts of biogenic silica are                    accumulating in modern sediments, while the surface production                  rates are generally below the global average.  Moreover the usual               similarity between the oceanic silicon and carbon cycle does not                hold around Antarctica, and the two cycles are decoupled in that                the rate of particulate carbon deposition in the modern sediment is             very low.  The analysis phase will concentrate on three sites,                  identified in the field phase, at which the biogenic silica and                 organic carbon content differed by two or three orders of                       magnitude.                                                                                                                                                      The objectives of the project are to quantify the variability of                silica production and dissolution rates in these sites of                       silica-rich and silica-poor surface sediments through isotope mass              spectrometry of the samples obtained on the 1991-92 cruise, and to              produce an integrated surface silica budget that will be combined               with vertical flux data and sediment accumulation data to be                    obtained by the cooperating investigators.",
