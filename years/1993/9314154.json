 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major effort in fisheries ecology has been to develop biochemical             tools for quantifying instantaneous growth rate and the nutritional             dynamics of recruiting fish larvae juveniles.  Recent studies have              lead to a succession of innovative techniques.  Due to problems of              interpretation with these methods, current trend in recruitment                 studies is to use combination of biochemical, histological, and                 morphometric techniques.  Thus, what is needed is a truly specific              biochemical indicator of the actual rate of cell growth at any                  point in time.  Recent advances in the biochemical regulation of                the cell cycle indicate that a protein kinase, Mitosis Promoting                Factor (MPF), acts as the \"master oscillator\" of the cell cycle.                Measurement of MPF activity suggest that MPF has tremendous                     potential as a highly specific measure of cellular proliferation                and growth.  To test this idea, DiMichele will develop analytical               techniques, verify the proportion of cells committed to mitosis in              asynchronous cell populations, and fit the theoretical model to                 known whole animal growth rates in the red drum, Sciaenops                      ocellatus.  If the model is verified, the biochemical measurement               of MPF will have a tremendous potential as a specific measure of                instantaneous growth and cellular proliferation in heterogeneous                populations.",
