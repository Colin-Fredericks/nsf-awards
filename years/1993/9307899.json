 "awd_abstract_narration": "The longterm goal of this project is to determine the mechanisms              that cells use for assembling and regulating the interactions of                the actin and myosin filaments that form the cleavage furrow.  A                number of microscopic imaging methods will be used with living                  cells that have been microinjected with various probes, to analyze              the distribution of the major component molecules of the cleavage               ring.  The first aim will be to determine how actin filaments are               assembled into the region of the cortical membrane where the future             contractile ring will form.  The source of the actin that composes              the contractile ring is uncertain.  Considering the importance of               this division process for the cells, there may be two independent               methods for directing actin to the cleavage furrow.  Experiments                are planned to test this hypothesis by determining if and when the              filaments move along the cortical surface to the cleavage furrow                and if there is elongation of the pre-existing actin filaments in               the furrow region, and to determine if actin monomers add to one or             both ends of the existing actin filaments in the furrow regions.                Experiments are also planned that will utilize aequorin to measure              fluctuations in calcium levels during the assembly and contraction              of the cleavage ring in these dividing tissue culture cells.  The               calcium levels inside cells are thought to be regulated by the                  endoplasmic reticulum.  Confocal microscopy of living cells is                  planned to determine if there is any co-distribution of the                     endoplasmic reticulum and actin filaments in the assembling and                 contracting cleavage ring.  All of the proposed experiments are                 designed to determine the mechanisms responsible for a basic                    process present in all animal  cells: cytokinesis.                              %%%                                                                             The ability to reproduce is the most fundamental, defining property             of life.  Cell division is an intrinsic part of this phenomenon for             all cellular organisms.  For single-celled organisms, reproduction              is, simply, cell division.  For multicellular organisms, cell                   division is key to reproduction, by generating germ-line cells                  (gametes, spores) and for regenerating whole organisms from spores              or zygotes (development).  The division of one cell into two is a               remarkably controlled process; the precise geometry of cleavage is              critical to the survival of the daughter cells and/or the organism.             The cleavage mechanism in animal cells generally involves an                    actomyosin based contractile apparatus, the contractile ring, which             girdles the cell at the inside of the cleavage furrow.  This                    project will use experimental manipulations and state-of-the-art                microscopic observations directly on living cells to better                     understand the cleavage process.",
