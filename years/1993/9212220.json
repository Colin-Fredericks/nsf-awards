Kolata of the University of                                  Notre Dame, Indiana, in a research                                              collaboration with Professors Eli Aguilar and                                   Enrique Martinez of the Mexican Nuclear                                         Research Center (ININ).  The proposed research                                  will study details of fusion mechanisms in the                                  reaction of atomic nuclei.  The goal of the                                     research is to achieve a basic understanding of                                 heavy-ion fusion, a process in which the                                        constituent protons and neutrons of two                                         reacting atomic nuclei drastically re-arrange                                   to form a compound nucleus.  Sub-barrier fusion                                 is now known to be stronger than what was                                       expected on the basis of simple theoretical                                     models of these processes.  Several                                             explanations have been put forward to explain                                   this discrepancy but further study is needed to                                 understand this phenomenon.                                                                                                                                     The proposed collaboration is an extension of                                   previous mutually beneficial projects involving                                 staff members of the Mexican Research Center.                                   The data analysis phase of the work will be                                     carried out primarily in Mexico while the Notre                                 Dame group will bring to the collaboration its                                  expertise in heavy-ion physics and sub-barrier                                  fusion.",
