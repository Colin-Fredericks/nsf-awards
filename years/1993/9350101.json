 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insect antennae intercept vanishingly small quantities of chemical              signals from the air with great efficiency.  Our ability to                     evaluate how antennae function is hampered by our lack of knowledge             about the role of physical factors such as air speed or antennal                size and geometry on signal capture.  That is, there is no                      appropriate null hypothesis available against which to compare                  measured antennal performance.  In engineering terms, this exchange             of material between the environment and an object is called mass                transport.  The objective of this study is to quantify the rate of              pheromone interception by real antennae under different flow                    conditions and to compare these results with predictions from mass              transport calculations.  These calculations require knowledge of                mass transfer coefficients, values that are specific for a given                geometry, flow situation, and diffusing material.  To determine                 these currently-unknown mass transport coefficients, physical                   modeling will be done using dynamic scaling methods.  This                      biomechanical approach will allow predictions to be made for                    antennal performance under different flow conditions, such as when              an insect flies at different speeds.  This approach will also allow             differentiation between the rate of physical events and                         neurological events.                                                                                                                                            Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching               a course in Insect Biomechanics; giving guest lectures in Insect                Physiology, External Insect Morphology and Insect Behavior;                     participating in a new course on mentoring in science entitled                  \"Topics in Women Studies:  Women in Science;\" and advising                      undergraduate students in independent research.                                                                                                                 This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
