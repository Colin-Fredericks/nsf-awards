 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seasonal food shortages constitute an important environmental                   challenge for many mammals. Some of the longest fasts undertaken by             mammals occur when bears enter dens in autumn and remain there over             winter without access to food or water. During their winter fast,               bears maintain near normal body temperature, recycle nitrogenous                wastes produced by metabolic processes associated with protein                  turnover, produce no net urine, and thus, protect body proteins.                Unlike other species of bears, polar bears, can adopt these                     characteristic protein sparing mechanisms at any time of the year,              not just during winter. In consequence, polar bears are one of the              most proficient mammals at undertaking extended fasts. In order to              meet the challenge of seasonal fasts, many mammals accrete energy               as body fat during periods of food abundance, and draw on these                 stores when food is scarce. The energetic costs associated with the             sophisticated protein sparing abilities of bears when fasting are               presumably met from breakdown of such lipid stores. Polar bears eat             heavily from late April through June, when recently weaned seal                 pups are available in large numbers. When prey is abundant, polar               bears may consume only the blubber of the seals and leave the                   muscle mass untouched. During such feasting periods polar bears may             have the highest dietary intake of lipids of any mammal and their               fatty tissue depots expand rapidly. At times of maximal storage fat             tissue depots may constitute more than 50% of the total body mass,              but after extended fasting these may be reduced to less than 10% of             body mass. The period of feasting may be only 6-8 weeks long; while             fasting may exceed 8 months. Using stable-isotope labeled                       metabolites as tracers, we propose to carry out detailed, long-term             monitoring of metabolic pathways in individual feeding and fasting              polar bears throughout their annual cycle. This study will be the               first to use state-of-the-art isotopic methodologies to investigate             the means whereby free-ranging bears are able to switch so rapidly              into a physiological state whereby long-term fasting is possible.               This research will add significantly to our knowledge of the                    metabolic capabilities of one of the most important predators in                the Arctic environment as well as advance our fundamental                       biochemical knowledge of feast and fast cycles.",
