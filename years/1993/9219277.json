 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to define the biochemistry of the                   anaerobic O-demethylation (AOD) reaction in Acetobacterium woodii,              a homoactogenic bacterium.  Initial studies will be undertaken to               identify the product(s) of the reaction.  To accomplish this,                   demethylation enzyme(s) will be partially purified to minimize                  interference by other competing cellular reactions that may act to              modify the test substrate and/or transform reaction product(s),                 thereby obscuring the chemistry of the demethylation reaction                   itself.  Currently, little is understood about A. woodii AOD,                   except that O-demethylation is stimulated by exogenous                          tetrahydrofolate (THF) and by ATP.  To begin the understand the                 chemistry of the reaction, we will first identify reaction                      product(s) formed in the presence of THF and determine if other                 low-potential reductants also serve to stimulate the reaction. Our              studies will continue on to determine the role played by ATP in O-              demethylation.  If time permits, and if it appears warranted, we                will attempt to purify O-demetylation pathway proteins to                       homogeneity.  To begin to learn about the regulation of the                     pathway, we will also initate studies to screen for transposon-                 generated AOD regulatory mutants cells.                                         %%%                                                                             Aromatic compounds containing O-methyl ethers are abundant in foods             and wood processing wastes.  The first step in biodegradation of                these compounds is removal of their methyl group by the O-                      demethylation enzyme.  The reaction has already been studied in                 aerobic organisms where it uses oxygen as a reactant.  The                      mechanism of action of the analogous enzyme is not understood in                anaerobic bacteria, where oxygen is not used.  It is important that             we understand how this anaerobic reaction also operates, because a              major part of the earth's biosphere is anaerobic.  For example,                 important anaerobic environments include the digestive tracts of                animals, fresh water and marine sediments, and man-made anaerobic               digestors.  In our research program, we plan to determine how the               mechanism of anaerobic O-demethylation (AOD) operates in                        Acetobacterium woodii, a common anaerobic bacterium.  The results               gained from our study will contribute to understanding the natural              anaerobic process.  In addition, we may discover ways to engineer               the O-demethylation reaction in these anaerobic bacteria, and then              use it commercially for the conversion of renewable biomass waste               material and for the production of industrially useful products.",
