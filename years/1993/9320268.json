This will support the work  of the IPCC Secretariat to produce the IPCC's Second Assessment Report (scheduled for  publication in late 1995) and to support the participation of scientists from developing  countries in meetings of IPCC Working Groups and Subgroups which have been assigned  responsibilities for preparing inputs, especially on scientific issues, for the Second Assess-  ment Report.  The Second Assessment Report will include three focussed assessments.   The first will address science as in the First Assessment.  However, the second will cover  both impacts and response options (rather than \"strategies\") and the third will address  \"cross-cutting economic and other issues\".  The science assessment will address: carbon  dioxide and the carbon cycle; other greenhouse gases; aerosols; radiative forcing; and  methodologies for developing national inventories of net emissions.",
