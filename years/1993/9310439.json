 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310439  Zvanut  This project is designed to study the microscopic aspects of defects in diamond thin films grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  Electrical measurements such as steady state current measurements, ac impedance measurements, and metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) device measurements will be used to characterize the diamond film. In addition, the powerful spectroscopy of electron paramagetic resonance (PER) will be employed to extract important information about defects and impurities at the atomic level.    The investigation proposed here will provide closer look at the insulating and semiconducting properties of thin film diamond particularly those properties related to device applications.  For example, since a MOS device must be capable of withstanding continued voltage stress, we will study the breakdown field of synthetic diamond films to test the effects of various fabrication procedures.  Furthermore, the effects of long term current flow will be addressed in terms of electron and hole trapping kinetics and energetic.  The proposed project will address these properties of the insulating diamond film as well as properties of the semiconducting diamond.  ***",
