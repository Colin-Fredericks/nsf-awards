 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310247  Hall    Critics of American political institutions have long lamented the  infuence of organized \"factions\" in national policy making.  The  proliferation of Washington lobbyists and the growth of political  action committees have intensified the charge that Congress is the  province of \"special\" interests in general and private business  interests in particular.  Federal agencies and commissions,  likewise, are often said to be \"captives\" of the industries they  were established to regulate, and various accounts suggest that  Congressional actors conspire in such arrangements.    An important counterweight to this view is the notion that the  public interest groups play an important and healthy role in the  politics of American pluralism.  Such organizations vary  considerably in the purposes to which they aspire, but a  significant number of them seek to influence public policy,  especially on issues where important public goods are at stake.   While a few of these have formidable PACs, such groups tend to rely  far more heavily on lobbying and informational efforts than they do  campaign contributions to achieve their legislative purposes.  What  counterweight, if any, do the efforts of such organizations  provide?  More generally, what influence do the advocacy efforts of  public interest groups have relative to the more numerous, more  moneyed, more studied, and more maligned private groups or business  associations?    The investigators examine this question by assessing the role of  public and private interest groups on a diverse set of issues where  actors from the two sectors compete in congressional policy making  and, indirectly, in agency rule-making.  They first elaborate a  theory of legislative mobilization which lays out the conditions  under which one might expect both the lobbying and campaign  contribution efforts of each (or both) to pay off.  Second, they  undertake a broad empirical study, including samples of cases from  the energy, environment, human resources, a nd foreign policy  domains.  The study will employ interview and archival data, and  the analysis will be multi-method.    This study should enhance substantially our understanding of public  advocacy groups and private interests in Congressional law-making  and Congressional intervention in agency rule-making.  ***",
