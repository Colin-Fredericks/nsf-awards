 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns several open problems and questions at               the interface between geometry, topology, and group theory.                     Specifically, Bestvina intends to continue working with R. D.                   Edwards on the Hilbert-Smith Conjecture, a classical conjecture                 on the topology of manifolds, and on a program of research                      related to the dynamics of group actions on R-trees.  The notion                of an R-tree, i.e. a tree-like space modelled on the real                       numbers, has developed into a powerful research tool in topology                and group theory in recent years.  Understanding R-trees will                   lead to a deeper understanding of the degeneration of the                       universal cover of a negatively curved space.  Certain phenomena                first discovered in 3-dimensional manifolds, in particular, the                 characteristic submanifold, the classification of surface                       homeomorphisms, and the role of measured laminations, have a                    wider significance in light of this new theory, as has become                   clear through the work of Gromov, Rips, and many others.  Mess                  intends to work on various problems about discrete and geometric                structures, especially in connection with 3-manifolds.  Work in                 this area over the past decade has made clear the power of                      geometric analysis in developing new insights.  With this in                    mind, Mess seeks to understand more about the deformations of                   geometric structures by means of laminations, and to understand                 uniformly quasisymmetric groups.                                                     The group of symmetries of an object plays an important role               in an attempt to understand the object.  Conversely, abstract                   groups often arise as groups of symmetries of a space.  In the                  cases this project deals with, the spaces have fractal nature,                  which makes for a fascinating interplay between the fractal                     geometry of the spaces and the properties of the groups.                        (Fractal geometry is characterized by the repetition of similar                 structures on ever smaller scales in an infinite recession.  It                 is a notion that has come into its own in recent years as a                     natural theoretical construct for a computer to model, and, as a                practical matter, it has enabled computer graphics to depict                    unusually realistic mountains, clouds, etc. from remarkably                     simple programs.)",
