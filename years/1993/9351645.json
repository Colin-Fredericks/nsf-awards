 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is expanding a pilot program developed by two of                   the co-principal investigators to enhance the mathematics                       curriculum at Palomar College with computer technology.                         Preliminary laboratory materials were developed for teaching                    one section of College Algebra and one section of Calculus I                    with a computer laboratory component during the spring 1992                     semester. This project is providing the resources to continue                   that curriculum development and expand to other College                         Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus I sections. Macintosh                        computers and associated peripherals are being used to provide                  a laboratory component for College Algebra, Precalculus, and                    Calculus I courses offered by the college. The computers are                    empowering students to simultaneously represent functions in                    numeric, symbolic and graphic form. Students can visualize                      mathematical concepts without the need for excessive                            preliminary concentration on rote manipulation. Students                        concentrate on learning concepts through guided discovery,                      using problem solving strategies, and becoming familiar with                    how mathematics is done outside the classroom. The laboratory                   environment is requiring students to work collaboratively and                   write about the mathematics they are learning.",
