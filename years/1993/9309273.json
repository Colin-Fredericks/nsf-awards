 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a pilot study motivated by recent results on the lateral                connectivity and dynamic processes in the mammalian neocortex, a                new model of coritcal self-organization called LCSOFM (Laterally                Connected Self-Organizing Feature Map) was developed.  This                     research focuses on LCSOFM as a computational model of the primary              visual cortex.  The main hypothesis is that the lateral                         connectivity in the visual cortex mediates cooperation and                      competition necessary for the self-organization and low-level                   perceptual phenomena.  The hypothesis will be tested by building a              LCSOFM model of the visual cortex and analyzing its behavior                    through simulated neuroscience experiments.  The LCSOFM model                   permits computational study of the visual cortex at a new, more                 fundamental level than earlier models, and allows us to test                    several new hypotheses about its structure and function.  Based on              the pilot study, there is reason to believe that the model can                  verify whether (1) self-organization can be based on cooperation                and competition among laterally connected neurons; (2) the observed             patterns of long-range lateral connections arise from correlations              in neural activity; (3) plasticity of the cortex results from                   reorganization of lateral connections; (4) tilt illusions arise                 from competition of neural responses in laterally connected                     retinotopic maps; (5) gestalt principles can be extracted from                  visual experience and encoded into lateral connections; and (6)                 cooperation and competition through lateral connection, combine                 with binding by phase-locking, can be responsible for segmentation              of visual input into coherent wholes.//",
