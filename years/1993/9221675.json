 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Thomas Hester and                 his colleagues will conduct archaeological excavation at the site               of Cobweb Swamp, Belize. In 1987, during the course of survey and               test pitting in the area surrounding the known Mayan site of                    Colha, Dr. Hester discovered highly paginated stone artifacts                   which stratigraphically underlay Mayan artifacts. Additional                    excavation in 1991 yielded materials radiocarbon dated to 2500 to               1400 BC. This predates the earliest known Mayan presence in the                 region. Dr. Hester and colleagues will now return to the site and               excavate a large 4x6 meter block as well as smaller 2x2 meter                   test excavations. He hopes to recover abundant lithic as well as                floral and faunal remains and on this basis both describe this                  pre-Mayan culture and determine its relationship to later Mayan                 occupation of the region. He will also obtain material for                      additional radiocarbon dating, collect pollen to reconstruct                    environment, and attempt to determine how this changed over time.                                                                                               The origins of the Mayan peoples who inhabited lowland Middle                   America are not known. In Belize the earliest Mayan site dates to               about 1200 BC and by that time the roots of Mayan civilization                  has been established. Archaeological data from earlier periods                  exists, but it is minimal and does not come from                                stratigraphically secure, well dated contexts. Cobweb Swamp                     however is different and is important for this reason. It is                    unclear whether Mayan culture emerged from this earlier pre-                    ceramic context or if Mayan peoples entered the region from                     elsewhere. The question is important because it bears on our                    understanding of how complex culture developed in heavily                       forested tropical environments.                                                                                                                                 This research is significant for several reasons. It will                       increase our understanding of how complex societies arise and                   will provide data of interest to many archaeologists.",
