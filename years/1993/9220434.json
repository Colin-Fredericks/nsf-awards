 "awd_abstract_narration": "Initiatives such as the human genome project and similar                   projects for other model genetic systems are generating vast                    amounts of information on the detailed genetic organization of a                variety of organisms.  The search for general organizing                        principles and new biological processes using these data requires               a starting framework for a theory of genome structure.  This                    project continues Dr. Walsh's long-term research goal of a                      comprehensive population-genetic theory of genome evolution,                    based on an understanding of how molecular forces within the cell               shape the genome and, conversely, how one can make inferences on                the nature of these forces from genomic sequence and structural                 information.  Three related problems will be examined.  The first               is to examine how intracellular selection, drift, and gene                      conversion influence the within-cell substitution dynamics of                   organelle genes.  All eukaryotes carry at least two separate                    genomes (the nuclear genome plus one or two organelle ---                       mitochondrial and chloroplast --- genomes).  Organelle genomes                  are very widely used as genetic markers in problems as diverse as               understanding human origins, tracing the genetic input from                     different native plants into high-yield domesticated crops, and                 conservation biology.  The theory proposed to be developed here                 will provide a better understanding of how these genetic markers                behave.  Second, models for the conditions under which a recently               duplicated gene evolves a new function (as opposed to becoming an               inactive pseudogene) will be examined.  There has been                          essentially no modeling of just how frequent (or infrequent) the                evolution of new function is expected to be.   Finally, models of               the evolution of genome size, treating size as a quantitative-                  genetic character will be developed.  While there is a developing               theory of the behavior of an individual gene family, there is                   currently no general theory about how genome size as a whole                    evolves.                                                                         //",
