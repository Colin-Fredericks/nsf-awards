 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past two decades, researching the functional morphology of               primate teeth has managed to make connections with certain diets.               Long molar crest length has been associated with leaf and insect                diets, cups sharpness with insect diets, and low crown relief                   with fruit diets.  However, there has been little attention to                  the obvious variation in the physical properties of foods (eg.                  hardness of various preferred fruits or nuts, or even in leaf                   tenderness).  Also, seasonal variation in diets has not been                    addressed systematically in such studies, but clearly that is an                important variable.                                                                                                                                             This study will address these and related issues in field and                   museum studies of a series of Madagascar strepsirhines.  It will                provide insights into the relation of tooth form and structure to               dietary variation.",
