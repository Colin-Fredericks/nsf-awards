 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318080  Morris  Tufts University School of Medicine is part of the Tufts Health  Sciences Campus which is a confederation of separately administered  institutions with cooperative arrangements to fulfill shared  missions of patient care, education and research.  These  institutions include Tufts University's four health-science schools  and the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging; the New  England Medical Center and 30 affiliated clinical teaching sites  throughout New England.  Tufts University School of Medicine proposes to provide Internet  linkage to 2100 faculty located in over 30 affiliated hospitals  throughout New England either by direct dedicated 56 KBS line for  those hospitals with or planning to have a hospital backbone or by  dial-in service to physicians for whom direct connection is not  possible.  This Internet connection will impact patient care,  education, research and facilitate administrative matters.  Specific benefits to be derived from this grant will be to improve  the following; communication between 3300 Tufts faculty;  collaboration on multi-center research projects; medical education  for its students at remote sites; potential for remote  consultation; access to factual and bibliographic database,  including access to Medline, available at Tufts through the Tufts  Healthnet and through the Internet; and access to referred  patients' clinical data.  The grant's objectives are to link three hospitals with network  backbones by dedicated 56 KBS datalines directly to the Internet  and to provide dial-in service for physicians at hospitals not  directly connected to a backbone.  In addition, to further the  objectives of Tufts University School of Medicine Robert Wood  Johnson Foundation planning grant, access will be provided to  physicians who become part of the Community Physician Educator  Program whose goal is to increase the number of generalist  physicians.",
