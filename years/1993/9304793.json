The  mammalian phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk) gene system provides an  ideal system for such studies, since we have now amassed sufficient  information about the expression, regulation, and evolution of  these genes to formulate testable hypotheses about how different  modes of transcriptional regulation have evolved in different  members of this particular gene family.  The autosomal Pgk-2 gene  evolved as a duplication of the X-linked Pgk-1 gene by  retroposition or gene processing during mammalian evolution, prior  to the divergence of metatherians (marsupials) and eutherians  (placental mammals) about 120-150 million years ago.  In eutherian  mammals, the Pgk-1 gene is expressed ubiquitously, while expression  of the Pgk-2 gene is tissue-specific, occurring only in  spermatogenic cells.  The tissue-specificity of Pgk-2 expression  apparently evolved after its origin, since ubiquitous expression of  Pgk-2 can still be observed in certain marsupial species.  We  believe the evolution of tissue-specific expression of the Pgk-2  gene in eutherian mammals has resulted from a combination of  changes leading to: 1) the enhancement of Pgk-2 expression in  spermatogenic cells, and 2) the repression of Pgk-2 expression in  somatic cells.  Our recent studies have revealed several  characteristics of transcriptional regulation that distinguish the  specifically expressed Pgk-2 gene from the ubiquitously expressed  Pgk-1 gene in the mouse and human, including the absence or  presence of a CpG island in the promoter region, single or multiple  transcription start sites, tissue-specific or ubiquitous protein-  DNA interactions, and differential or constitutive DNA  hypomethylation in expressing tissues, respectively.  We believe  these differences represent examples of molecular changes that have  lead to the evolution of tissue-specific regulation of the Pgk-2  gene  in eutherians.  Thus in this application, we propose to  examine these same characteristics in metatherian and eutherian  species that show intermediate degrees of tissue-specificity of  Pgk-2 expression to better understand the evolution of these  characteristics and to distinguish those associated primarily with  enhancement of Pgk-2 expression in spermatogenic cells from those  associated with repression of Pgk-2 expression in somatic cells.  %%%  Organic evolution occurs by various genetic mechanisms, including  the appearance or loss of entire genes, and changes in the  structure of the proteins encoded by specific genes.  However  changes in another mechanism, gene regulation, which determines  whether or not, or when or where (ie- in what organs or tissues) a  particular gene is used (or expressed) also play a major role in  the evolutionary process, but this area has received inordinantly  little attention to date.  This lack of attention has occurred  primarily because appropriate hypotheses and informative model  systems in which to test those hypotheses have not been readily  available.  The mammalian phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk) gene system  now provides an ideal system for such studies, because we have  learned enough about it that we can develop and test appropriate  hypotheses.  The mammalian Pgk gene system includes two functional  genes, Pgk-1 and Pgk-2, each of which encodes a similar metabolic  enzyme called phosphoglycerate kinase.  The Pgk-1 gene is used  ubiquitously in almost every part of the body, however the Pgk-2  gene is used in only one type of cell, the spermatogenic cells that  give rise to sperm in the male.  We know that the Pgk-2 gene  evolved as a duplicate copy of the Pgk-1 gene early in mammalian  evolution, and we have evidence that when it first evolved it was  used in all parts of the body just like the Pgk-1 gene.  Thus we  believe that it was not until after it originally appeared as a  duplication of the Pgk-1 gene that the Pgk-2 gene evolved its  tis sue-specific mode of regulation such that it is only used in one  type of cell.  What is more, we believe that by studying the right  species of mammals, we can recapitulate how this evolution of  tissue-specific expression occurred.  Thus we know that in some  species of marsupials that exist today, the Pgk-2 gene is still  expressed in all parts of the body, while in other marsupial  species the Pgk-2 gene is expressed in several, but not all, parts  of the body.  It is only in placental mammals that expression of  the Pgk-2 gene is strictly limited to the spermatogenic cells.  We  have already carried out several experiments at the molecular level  to determine what mechanisms are involved in the ubiquitous  expression of the Pgk-1 gene and the tissue-specific expression of  the Pgk-2 gene in the mouse and the human.  Thus in this project,  we plan to investigate the status of these same molecular  mechanisms in certain marsupial species that show intermediate  degrees of tissue-specificity of Pgk-2 expression.  In this way, we  hope to learn more about which molecular mechanisms were directly  involved in the transition from ubiquitous to tissue-specific  expression of the Pgk-2 gene, and also to learn more about how  these mechanisms changed during mammalian evolution.  ***",
