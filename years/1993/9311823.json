 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311823  Boxer  Dr. Boxer is seeking to enhance our understanding of the relations  between cultural and technological aspects of the methods employed  for conservation, control and use of water resources in the 20th  century China.  In particular, Dr. Boxer is examining how the  traditional approach, called shuili, to control of water resources  conflicts with modern Western engineering approaches.  Shuili is  not simply folk-knowledge but is a scientific and technical  knowledge based on over two thousand years of trying to control  raging rivers and streams in this ancient land.  How the  traditional Chinese engineers have adapted shuili to meet the  demands of technological modernization and change is the principal  interest to be investigated in this project.  Dr. Boxer is  contrasting Chinese and foreign views over the past 70-80 years on  the social benefits and costs of water engineering in the Yangzi  River basin.  He is examining three cases:  the controversial Three  Gorges Dam, the Dujiangyan irrigation system, and controversies  over physical connections between upstream-downstream water  problems and the social and ecological effects of engineering  solutions.  Dr. Boxer is aiming to show how tensions between  Chinese and foreign technological approaches helped redefine  traditional Chinese ideas about water's role in mediating nature-  society relations.  A major goal is to document the process through  which traditional attitudes and beliefs about the human and  environmental impacts of water engineering change in response to  foreign values, technologies, and political ideologies.  Results of  this study promise to be of great interest for examining  human/environment interactions and for students of modern China,  and the comparative social history of science, technology and  engineering.  ***",
