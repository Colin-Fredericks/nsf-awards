 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on four related categories in the area of modal  logics. (a) Group Knowledge:  In recent years, the PI has come to believe that  what we call knowledge is more algorithmic than semantic, i.e., on the  basis of what one learns, one then carries out certain probabilistic  algorithms and the `information` does not tell us about the state of the  world, but tells us rather that certain algorithms are likely to be  beneficial.  (b) Reasoning about Topology and Computation:    In joint work with Larry  Moss, the PI shows how standard topological concepts can be formalized  in a modal logic of knowledge.  The point of this work is to suggest  that simple aspects of topological reasoning are also connected with  special-purpose logics of knowledge.  (c) Legal Reasoning:    There has recently been substantial interest in  applying dynamic logic to legal reasoning.  One sets up some domain of  possible worlds where the situation is not merely factual but also has a  legal aspect.  However, Dynamic logic allows one only to look at the  actions of one agent.  As is obvious to anyone who reads the newspaper,  there are many legal situations involving two or more individuals.  (d) Non-monotonic Logics of Knowledge. An example of such a problem is:  suppose  it is given that 1 < a < b are factors of 6.  One can then  know  that  a = 2, b = 3.  If, however, given that 1 < a < b are factors of 12,  then one cannot know what a, b are.",
