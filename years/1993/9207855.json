 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small islands in the Gulf of California support                            extraordinarily high densities of many species compared to larger                                                                                               islands or the mainland.  Three variables are important:                        productivity flowing from the marine to terrestrial ecosystems;                 the presence of predators; and relative colonizing ability.                     Small island receive more nutrients from shore drift and marine                 birds (land plants provide little energy).  The scaling effect is                                                                                               counter-intuitive to the general notion that larger islands are                 more productive.  Scaling also influences predation: small                      islands lack many predators found on larger islands, allowing                   high marine productivity to produce large populations.  Predators                                                                                               drastically reduce population size on larger islands and the                    mainland.  Thus community and food web dynamics vary greatly with                                                                                               habitat size, productivity, species composition and dependence on                                                                                               habitats.  Overall, the research objectives are to connect the                  seemingly unrelated food webs form marine and terrestrial systems                                                                                               and to integrate elements of landscape ecology with the effects                 of variable production and productivity to understand food web                  and community structure.  In general this research provides an                  understanding of factors affecting abundance and biodiversity.                  This system is a general model for fragmented habitats, each of                 different size and each exhibiting different combinations of                    species and interconnections to other habitats.",
