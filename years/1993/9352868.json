 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project directors are designing and constructing Mathematica                computer laboratory notebooks for calculus and applied mathematics.             This builds on Bowdoin College's three years of experience as the               Mathematica laboratory development site for Project CALC, the                   calculus reform program from Duke University. The primary focus of              the development efforts is on applications from other disciplines               which are new to the calculus and applied mathematics curriculum.               The calculus laboratory development effort has multivariable                    calculus as a primary emphasis. The materials produced are being                disseminated, and instructors using the laboratories are being                  supplied with training and ongoing support.                                     Dissemination of the laboratories and support of instructors using              the materials is being accomplished by (1) a three-day summer                   faculty workshop entitled \"Laboratory Instruction with                          Mathematica,\" (2) a dissemination network which includes                        distribution of Mathematica notebooks via FTP and disk mailings,                (3) publications, and (4) presentations and workshops at regional               and national meetings.                                                          This project is adding Mathematica laboratory notebooks to the                  collection of materials currently available for revitalized courses             in calculus and applied mathematics. These notebooks are                        distinguished by their complete development of topics under study,              their focus on models from other disciplines, and their use of                  graphics routines to develop geometric understanding. Aggressive                dissemination of the notebooks is encouraging the adoption of                   Mathematica into calculus and applied mathematics courses,                      providing students with a research-level tool which can be carried              on to other courses in mathematics, the sciences, and economics.",
