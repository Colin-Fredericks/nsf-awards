Diamond coatings for  cutting tools, heat sinks for thermal management, and free-  standing thick infrared (IR) optics are a few applications in  which high deposition rates are crucial.  Diamond deposition  processes using a high power density microwave reactor were  developed in Phase I to obtain deposition rates of 15 um/hr.   These rates are one order-of-magnitude larger than previously  possible in similar systems operating at lower power.  These  Phase I results demonstrated that operation at high power  densities opens a completely new operating regime for microwave  based deposition reactors.  In this research, an experimental  program is undertaken aimed at understanding the gas phase,  chemistry changes at high power densities, to develop techniques  to control film morphology, and to increase the growth rates to  50 um/hr.  Such understanding would lead to increased confidence  on the scale-up of diamond deposition reactors as one would be  able to identify which are the most important parameters which  control deposition rates.  ***",
