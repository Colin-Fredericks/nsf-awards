 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301962 Bertero The Landers EQ of June 28 was the largest EQ in California since 1952, with a magnitude of 7.4 and a significant set of strong motion recordings both in the free field and in buildings.  It was preceded by the Joshua Tree and Big Bear earthquakes in April.  The data recorded from these earthquakes present an excellent opportunity to study the effect of long duration multiple occurrence of strong ground motions on structural response.  More specifically the objectives of this study is to:  (1) evaluate the damage potential of these recently recorded recent Southern California earthquakes, (2) evaluate the effects of multiple EQs on the mechanical characteristics of different instrumented structures whose responses were recorded, (3) evaluate the effects of long duration strong ground motion on various structural systems and to correlate this with the response to long duration ground motions recorded outside of the U.S., (4) assess the implications of the results obtained with respect to the present state of the practice regarding the seismic design coefficient, Cd, and the structural system coefficient, Rw, as currently used by building codes, (5) attempt to formulate a better procedure for establishing the design EQ than is currently being used, (6) compare the analytically predicted building characteristics and performance to both the recorded and the observed behavior in order to calibrate:  the actual stiffness, the strength (particularly the resulting overstrength to that required by present codes), the torsional effects, the soil structure interaction effects, the deformational response parameters, the probable energy dissipation capacity of these  structures and their damage indices, (7) evaluate      h)          0*0*0*         further the application of inelastic response spectra and energy considerations for earthquake resistant design of building structures, and to quantify the concepts of yield resistance, seismic coefficient and design ductility for application to building code requirements, (8) evaluate the reliability and practical application of a nonlinear static loading procedure to earthquake resistance design, (9) formulate an equivalent SDOF model of the actual multi degree of freedom system that can be used to analyze the performance of the structure under earthquake motions at all levels, (10) attempt to formulate guidelines for the selection of efficient strategies and techniques for the seismic upgrading of buildings that the conducted studies have shown to be potentially hazardous in case of future severe EQGMs. ***",
