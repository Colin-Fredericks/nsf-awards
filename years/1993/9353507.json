 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353507  Kaput    They prose to build, test and perform close clinical analyses of  students working with a series of engaging simulations and  activities designed to link students' real experience with motion,  fluid flow and other continuously variable quantities, first to  graphical and then to more formal representations.  the ultimate  intent is to help democratize access to the central idea of  calculus by providing the conceptual and technological foundation  for a global reorganization of the core quantitative mathematics  curriculum from the middle school onward.  We aim to treat calculus  not as a capstone course for the intellectual and professional  elite that follows upon a long series of prerequisites, but as a  mainstream strand in the curriculum for ALL students.  While we  initially design for and work with those students who are now  alienated from mathematics in unacceptably high numbers, we plan to  create exciting activities appropriate for all students beginning  in the middle grades and continuing into university calculus, where  versions of our materials can serve as a front-end.  For students  will be able to drive a \"MathCars\" simulation to create position  and velocity (vs. time) graphs that can then be downloaded to an  inexpensive hand-held device to do further analysis, e.g., curve-  fitting, slope or area approximating, etc.  They will also be able  to recreate their school bus trip home by inputting velocity data,  for example, estimated during the actual trip.  They could then  specify the motion of one of two simulated vehicles to be that of  the bus and 'follow; the bus in the second, using only position  graphs, say, instead of the usual windshield view.  Or they could  follow the bus displaying its position graph while getting feedback  only on their own velocity.  They will also be able to run a  variety of experiments with 'ToyCars' on a two lane track,  specifying their motion algebraically, and eventually examine other  regular motion, including harmonic  and other periodic motion.   Using clinical research methods we plan to examine in considerable  detail the relations between simulation-based learning and learning  involving physical MBL devices, differences in conceptual impact of  different concrete contexts such as motion vs. fluid flow, and the  gradual process of transforming understandings mediated by concrete  and graphical representations to understandings encoded in formal  algebraic representations.  We will integrate our work with the  Memirovsky Change and Variation Project at TERC, which is  investigating learning in physical contexts.  A second level of  classroom based testing with underrepresented populations at  several sites in the last 18 months of the project will follow the  research with individuals and pairs, using enrichment modules in  both middle and high school classes at all levels, as well as  university precalculus and calculus classes.  ***",
