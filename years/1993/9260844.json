 "awd_abstract_narration": "The resolution and overlay accuracy needed for advanced                         semiconductor manufacturing has tightened about 30% every two and               one-half years.  Current design rules lie near or below the                     actual wavelength of visible light.  Therefore, optical tools for               pattern generation are now supplemented by new technologies such                as X-ray and electron beam exposure systems.                                                                                                                    Manufacture of devices under a sub-half micron design rule                      requires patten overlay control to an accuracy more severe than                 ever before.  The task is complicated by the mix of new                         lithography tools, which may employ dissimilar technologies, but                nevertheless must be calibrated and integrated.  So far, the most               successful approach has been to model the distortions of printed                patterns against the parameters of the lens and alignment                       systems.  However, new and stronger methods are needed.                                                                                                         This SBIR Phase I research explores an expert system for process                overlay control.  Called the Lithographic Imaging METrology                     (LIMET) module, the LIMET-expert uses new techniques to provide                 the modeling and statistical experience available to customize                  models and algorithms.  LIMET-expert has application in the real-               time control and maintenance of the process as well as the                      pattern generation equipment.",
