The primary  direction of research is the development, enhancement and efficient  implementation of heuristic search approaches for some NP-hard    combinatorial optimization problems.  Specifically, ideas and    methods from artificial intelligence, such as informed best-first  strategies and AND/OR graphs, will be utilized within the framework  of integer programming algorithms.  Special emphasis will be given  to a design of parallel algorithms.         The work on heuristic methods will include a design of    improved criteria for measuring the quality of the heuristic    solution.  In this context the impact of changes in the initial   data on the heuristic solution will be investigated.  Increasing  the solvability of nonlinear inter programming problems and placing  them in a dynamic environment by studying the impact of data    changes on the solution, will broaden the applicability of such   mathematical models to a number of problems arising in engineering  and modern technology.",
