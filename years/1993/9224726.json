In a perfect world output from one program could easily be used as  input to another.  The world of scientific computing is far from  perfect, however, and scientists are plagued with the task of  writing special purpose data conversion programs.  Business data  processing are solving interoperability problems by using shared  databases.  Unfortunately, current database systems do not serve  scientific applications well.  This research addresses the problems  of interoperability in the scientific realm by interfacing  databases to computational biology programs.  It builds on previous  research in object-oriented databases for computational chemistry  conducted jointly by the Oregon Graduate Institute in Portland,  Oregon; Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories in Richland,  Washington; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, New York.  Results of  previous research are being extended to cover genomic databases by  using T4 bacteriophage data (perhaps the most nearly complete  representation of genetic information for any individual organism).   The genomic database is extended to include a \"computational proxy  mechanism\", which allows for parameterized interface of the T4 data  to existing computation-intensive distributed applications.  The  research has three objectives: (1) to demonstrate that previous  database work is generalizable to scientific domains other than  computational chemistry, and serviceable as a model for database  interface with so-called \"legacy\" applications; (2) to make  computational operations as well as genomic data available to the  T4 researchers; and (3) to demonstrate that previous genomic  database work in yeasts is transferable to other sites and  organisms.  The long term impact of this research is to transfer  the current computing environment that the computational scientists  find too complex to a data-centered approach  that improves the  interoperability of scientific data and programs.   ***",
