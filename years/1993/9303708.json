Most of the models involve partial  differential equations, specifically reaction-diffusion equations  or systems explicitly incorporating spatial effects in their  coefficients.  Some of the activity is directly focused on  modelling specific phenomena such as the spread of exotic plants  into the Florida Everglades.  The significance of this portion of  the activity is in providing ways of understanding and  predicting the results of land management and conservation  policies.  Other parts of the research are focused on more  general problems in the design and evaluation of mathematical  models in ecology, with the aim of providing new or improved  mathematical tools for other scientists working on related  problems.  Many of the mathematical methods are taken from the  theory of dynamical systems; in particular, the idea of  permanence or uniform persistence and alternatives to that idea  are especially important.  Other important components of the  mathematical methodology are nonlinear analysis, especially  bifurcation theory and related topics, and the spectral theory of  elliptic operators.  In addition to itsapplied value the research  aims to yield new mathematical results in those areas.       The project deals with the development and analysis  of mathematical descriptions of how populations interact with  the spatial aspects of an environment.  Mathematical models  are effective means of identifying what factors are important in  the growth or decline of populations.  Spatial features of  an environment, such as its size, shape, and geographic  variability, can affect the growth or decline of the resident  populations in the environment.  The models of the present  project are particularly well-suited to quantifying these  effects.  The analysis of the models involves new and challenging  mathematics, and provid es a flexible theoretical tool for  objective assessment of the viability of the species in question.   Moreover, understanding the models can also suggest what data to  collect or what experiment to run in actual situations.  A  better understanding of the effects of the spatial aspects of an  environment upon the viability of species within the  environment can improve the design of wildlife refuges and the  development of management schemes for dealing with problems  arising from habitat fragmentation, whether the fragmentation is  the result of a natural disaster such as Hurricane Andrew or the  eruption of Mount St. Helens, or the result of human activity  such as logging, mining or development.  ***",
