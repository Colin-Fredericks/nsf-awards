 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  ASPIRA Association, Inc., proposes to develop a national              applicable model of community-based model to increase the number of             Latino middle-school youths with adequate preparation in math and               science education.                                                                                                                                                   Latino community-based organizations are uniquely capable of               reaching youth that are often difficult to reach by non-Latino                  organizations.  The importance of out-of-school informal science                experiences for young people to reinforce their interest in science             and mathematics is of interest to the National Science Foundation,              and to the ASPIRA Association.  However, not enough is known about              what works in informal science in the Latino community and with the             Latino students.                                                                                                                                                     The ASPIRA Association is requesting support from the National             Science Foundation to undertake a project to answer the following               question:                                                                                                                                                            How can informal science programs have a greater impact on                      Latino middle school youth in science and mathematics?                                                                                                     The perceived benefits of the project are:                                                                                                                           \u0007    Identification of exemplary informal science education                          efforts undertaken by organizations in working with                             Latino youths.                                                                                                                                             \u0007    Identification of effective curriculum models in informal                       science education for reaching Latino youths.                                                                                                              \u0007    Identification of characteristics of successful programs.                                                                                                  \u0007    Encouraging partnerships among CBOs, educators, schools                         and family.                                                                                                                                                \u0007    Identification of supplemental resources for supporting                         informal science education programs.                                                                                                                       ASPIRA is the only national nonprofit organization devoted to              serving Puerto Rican and other Latino youth through leadership                  development and education.  With a thirty-one year old track record             of proven effectiveness, ASPIRA's work with Latino youths is based              on the belief that all youths can succeed.",
