 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rocky Mountain Institute of Software Engineering is                    coordinating a workshop on architectures for process-sensitive                  engineering environments, to be held September 22-24, 1992,                     in Boulder, Colorado.  The workshop's purposes are:  obtain                     a good understanding of architectural issues for process-                       sensitive environments, compare alternative existing                            architectures, and develop a general \"game plan\" for future                     work.                                                                                Participation is by invitation only, with attendees                        chosen to assure a balance of practitioner and researcher                       viewpoints as well as a balanced participation from industry,                   government and academic organizations.  All attendees will be                   required to prepare position statements addressing topics                       identified by the workshop organizers.  Most of the workshop                    will be devoted to working-group discussions of the topics;                     occasional presentations and periodic plenary sessions will                     be held to foster cross-fertilization among the working                         groups.  A report on the workshop will be broadly disseminated                  throughout the software engineering community.  This report                     will augment the results of other process and environment                       related activities such as the Software Development                             Environment Conferences and the International Software Process                  Conferences and Workshops.",
