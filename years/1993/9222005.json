 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will test four hypotheses about                           evolutionary forces that affect the behavior of pair-bonded birds               to each other and to the nestlings they raise:  1.  Male-male                   aggression during a female's fertile period decreases the                       likelihood that the female's young are sired by males other than                her territorial partner.  2.  Female-female aggression during the               egg-laying period functions to decrease the likelihood that                     females' broods contain nestlings from other females of the same                species that lay their eggs in the nests of neighbors.  3.  Mate-               guarding by males is a response to females' behavior or                         ecological circumstances that increase the likelihood that                      females mate with more than one male.  4.  Parental feeding of                  nestlings by males varies according to males' likelihood of                     genetic paternity as indicated by the behavior of females when                  they are fertile.                                                                                                                                               These are important questions for several reasons.  Dr. Gowaty                  and her colleagues are attempting to observe evolutionary                       processes as they occur, by testing the current functional                      utility and evolutionary significance of important, sometimes                   dramatic, social behaviors.  Also, the researchers are testing                  hypotheses about the relationship of \"confidence of paternity\"                  (the perceived likelihood that a male is the actual genetic sire                of the offspring he cares for) to actual genetic paternity as                   assessed using DNA markers.  This in turn is important because                  ideas about confidence of paternity are theoretically prominent                 explanations for variation in the social behavior of male                       animals.",
