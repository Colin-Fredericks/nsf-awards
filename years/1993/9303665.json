 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disseminated sulfide mineralization at the Babbitt Cu-Ti-Ni-                    PGE deposit of the Duluth Complex is found within iron-and                      titanium-rich gabbroic rocks that occur near the contact                        with metasedimentary rocks of the underlying Virginia                           Formation.  In order to evaluate possible metal sources Re-                     Os and Pb isotopic studies are planned.  These two isotopic                     systems will provide direct evidence as to the relative                         importance of crustal or mantle sources of metals                               Mechanisms of metal-enrichment will be evaluated by tracing                     chemical variations that accompany fractional                                   crystallization, crustal assimilation, magma recharge, and                      magma mixing.  The addition of crustal sulfur at Duluth is                      thought to be a prime reason for the differences in what may                    be a continuum  between sulfide-rich and sulfide-poor, oxide-                   apatite rocks.  Because of the chemical similarities a                          comparative study  with Fe-Ti-P-rich rocks from the St.                         Urbain and Labrieville anorthosite complexes in Quebec is                       planned.  Results will aid our understanding of similarities                    and differences between mineralization in layered                               intrusions, subvolcanic intrusives, and massif-type                             anorthosites and related  rocks.",
