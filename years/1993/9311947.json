 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Thomas Hester, Ms. Shirley Mock will                 collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct                    archaeological fieldwork at the site of Northern River Lagoon                   (NRL), located in the coastal region of northern Belize. Previous               work at the site has indicated an occupation during the Late and                Terminal Classic periods when Mayan civilization reached its                    height. Preliminary data suggest that the inhabitants of NRL were               engaged in intensive collection of fish and the production of salt              to preserve them. Ms. Mock hypothesizes that these were then traded             to interior sites in return for valued materials such as obsidian.              To test this idea Ms. Mock will conduct surface survey and then                 intensive archaeological and geological investigation both to                   provide more precise dates for the site and to obtain more detailed             information on the material culture present. On the basis of floral             samples she will also reconstruct changing environment over time.                                                                                               Archaeologists want to understand how Mayan civilization arose in               the inhospitable environment of lowland Middle America and then why             it rapidly declined. In areas which today are largely uninhabited,              Mayan peoples constructed dressed stone temples and were able to                support large groups of people in relatively limited areas. At the              end of the Classic period this system appears to have fallen apart.             Monumental construction ceased and people dispersed into smaller                groups. Ms. Mock believes that environmental stress caused by a                 combination of population increase and related degradation of the               land is responsible and she will examine NRL in this context. It                represents, she believes, an early stage in this sequence and that              the extensive trade in food which developed resulted from                       nutritional stress in inland areas. She thus is looking at the                  first stage in the process.                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our                   understanding of human-environment interactions and will also                   assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
