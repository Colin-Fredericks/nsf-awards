 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a systematic field study of atmospheric sulfur                  chemistry in the antarctic troposphere.  The specific objective is              to obtain a comprehensive data base for estimating the potential                impact of dimethylsulfide (DMS) emissions on the climate of                     Antarctica, and by extension, the global climate.  Field                        measurements will be conducted at Palmer Station during two austral             summer months in the 1993-94 and the 1994-95 season.                                                                                                            It is known that approximately 80 to 90 percent of the aerosol                  mass deposited to the antarctic ice sheet consists of fine par-                 ticles of non-sea salt sulfate.  These particles are though to be               formed by gas-to-particle conversion involving biogenic sulfur                  gases emitted from the Southern Ocean.  Some antarctic                          phytoplankton species emit large quantities of DMS which is                     subsequently oxidized by the hydroxyl radical, forming sulfuric                 acid as one of the end products.  Sulfuric acid in the atmosphere               may condense to form nanometer droplets or become condensed on pre-             existing aerosol particles; these phase transitions form non-sea                salt sulfate which is then precipitated to the ice sheet.                                                                                                       These processes will be traced by the direct measurement of                     twenty sulfur-containing species as well as the aerosol and                     condensation nuclei size distribution.  Recently developed highly               sensitive techniques will be applied to the antarctic troposphere               for the first time.                                                                                                                                             The resulting information will be used to assess the relative                   importance of individual chemical reaction pathways which will                  contribute to the better understanding of the marine biogenic                   sulfur record in antarctic ice cores with respect to past climate               changes.  It will also provide a model data base for estimating the             sensitivity of the present climate of Antarctica to volcanic or                 anthropogenic sulfur pollution and its effect on the ultraviolet                radiation regime.",
