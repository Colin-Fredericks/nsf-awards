 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is concerned with the discovery and development                    of adaptive routing protocols for massively parallel                            architectures using Hypercube Interconnection Networks (HINs).                  This class includes the well known binary n-cube, k-ary n-                      cube, and multidimensional arrays.                                                                                                                              A taxonomy of routing protocols is developed and used to focus                  attention on distinct classes.  Two new concepts will be                        developed and explored in this study.  First, the properties                    of conservatism and optimism of these protocols will be                         rigorously characterized.  The effect of these properties on                    message latency, network bandwidth, and network topology will                   be studied.  Second, the class of multi-phase protocols will                    be introduced and developed.  These are protocols whose                         behavior is a function of the distance of a message from the                    destination.  The proposed router architectures will be                         modeled and evaluated via simulation.  Particular attention                     will be focused on the evaluation of performance in the                         presence of implementation constraints such as wiring                           complexity, pin count, and link layer protocols.",
