 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in Theoretical Physics between Antal Jevicki of Brown University                and Jean Avan of the Laboratory for Theoretical High Energy                     Physics, University of Paris VI.  The investigators propose to                  solve a series of problems in string theory and quantum gravity.                The objectives are to understand the symmetries of two                          dimensional string theory and explore its relationship to higher                dimensional integrable theories. Specifically the research                      involves exotic matrix models, quantum symmetries, interacting                  theory of tachyons, topological fields and the nature of w-                     infinity algebra, which appears throughout matrix models and                    topological fields.                                                                                                                                             The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in                 theoretical physics.  This is complemented by the French                        investigators experience in mathematical physics.  The                          investigators have already progressed on some key aspects of                    string theory and the nature of w-infinity algebra.  This project               will enable them to expand their efforts and ultimately apply                   their results to the physics of black holes, early cosmology, and               ultra high energy physics.",
