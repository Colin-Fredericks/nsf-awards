 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of Dr. Donald   Hilvert at the Scripps Research Institute to study physicochemical and   structural characterization of selenosubtilisin with particular emphasis on   understanding and optimizing its peptide ligase and peroxidase activities.   Subtilisin variants containing site-specific changes in addition to Ser221Sec   will be prepared to address mechanistic questions and to improve the chemical   efficiency of the first-generation catalysts.  The specific targets are (a) to   prepare a family of artificial selenoenzymes based on subtilisin and explore   the intrinsic reactivity of its selenium prosthetic group, (b) to characterize   these selenocysteine-containing proteins and deduce the relative importance of   steric and electronic factors in catalysis, (c) to apply them to peptide   ligation, (d) to characterize and optimize their redox properties to both   mimic the action of the natural redox enzyme glutathione peroxidase and   catalyze the stereospecific oxidation of substrates other than thiols, and (e)   to extend these studies to other protein templates.  In this project Dr.   Hilvert will elaborate structural, mechanistic and synthetic aspects of   selenoenzymes prepared by modifying naturally occurring enzymes, where the   modification entails a replacement of sulfur (or oxygen) by selenium.  The work   concerns the preparation and characterization of selenosubtilisin and variants   thereof, peptide ligation, redox chemistry, and expansion of selenium   substitution in other enzymes.  The rational design of these abzymes may have a   profound impact on medicinal and industrial applications.",
