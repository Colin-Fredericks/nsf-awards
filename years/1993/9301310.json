 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intelligent, dynamic scheduling in manufacturing systems                   encompasses a unique set of problems which span Computer Science,               Engineering, and Cognitive Science fields of expertise.  Many                   issues come to play in the manufacturing scheduling arena,                      including:  1.  external (suppliers, production orders, market                  conditions, etc.) and internal factors (machine layout, setup                   times, maintenance, etc.),  2.  interactions within the plant                   because of, e.g., resource sharing among lines or cells,  3.                    unexpected conditions or events (breakdowns, stockouts, strikes,                etc.),  4. inventory policies (e.g., MRP versus JIT),  5.  type of              layout (e.g. flow lines, cells, job shop),  6.  volume.  These and              other issues render the scheduling problem a complicated one,                   requiring a knowledge-rich solution procedure based on a model of               the plant synthesis-type reasoning tasks.                                            This workshop brings together researchers with the unique                  blend of skill necessary to develop models and schedulers in                    manufacturing.  The goals of the workshop are to:  1.  clarify what             progress has been made in this area,  2.  identify the various                  levels and types of schedules required in manufacturing and how                 they interact,  3.  identify the factors most critical to schedule              formation/revision,  4.  address plant-specific research versus                 more general research via a discussion of classification or                     morphology of plant types and/or features,  5.  compare                         manufacturing scheduling to other types of scheduling tasks; what               makes manufacturing scheduling unique?,  6.  discuss empirical                  versus theoretical research in the field,  7.  set major research               goals for future work.//",
