 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millions of people contribute money or volunteer time to                        charitable organizations, and the levels and frequency of these                 donations far exceed what could be predicted by standard economic               models.  Such cooperation is also seen in laboratory experiments.               Many scholars have explored cooperation with the prisoner's                     dilemma, and over recent years, there have been many experiments                on the private provision of public goods.  The general results of               these experiments is that subjects cooperate well in excess of                  that predicted by theory.  This project carries out experimental,               theoretical and econometric research on cooperative behavior.                   The results are important because they could lead to a better                   understanding of why people cooperate and how to encourage                      cooperation.  For example, cooperation is an important element in               human adaption to global environmental change.                                                                                                                  Four major experimental projects are conducted to determine how                 much of the cooperative behavior observed in experiments can be                 attributed to things other than altruism or warm-glow.  There are               four major econometric projects.  The first looks at both the                   Survey of Consumer Finance and the Independent Sector survey on                 gifts and time.  By combining the strengths of these two surveys,               the project provides the first detailed study of the                            interdependence of volunteerism and charitable giving.  Three                   other projects examine the data from the 1989 Current Population                Survey to study household decisions on labor force status, hours                of work, and volunteerism.  This project explores the puzzle of                 why American corporations contribute almost 2% of pretax profits                to charity.  Currently there are almost no studies of corporate                 philanthropy in the economics literature.  Another project                      addresses the \"fund raising puzzle,\" which is that charitable                   organizations rely heavily on \"leadership gifts\" in fund raising                campaign.  A new model is developed of how personal charitable                  contributions can be influenced by peer pressure or \"social                     comparisons.\"",
