 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the area of knot theory and the topology                of3-dimensional manifolds.  The investigators will study                        3-manifolds, using two points of view to analyze surfaces in a                  3-manifold.  The first method uses combinatorial techniques                     combined with the concept of 'thin position' of a knot.  This                   will be used to consider some old problems in knot theory, such                 as the cabling conjecture, as well as the classification problem                for Heegaard splittings of Seifert fibered spaces.  Thin position               surfaces serve as a combinatorial version of the minimax surfaces               used by Pitts-Rubinstein in their investigations of Heegaard                    splittings, and they will be used to attack problems similar to                 the recognition problem for the 3-sphere, recently solved by                    Rubinstein.  The second method uses techniques of smooth minimal                surface theory and hyperbolic geometry to investigate the                       topology of 3-manifolds.  One goal is to show that any 3-manifold               admits only a finite number of Heegaard splittings of each genus,               a result recently established for Haken manifolds by Johannson.                 Another goal is to show thatnon-Haken 3-manifolds are determined                by their fundamental groups.  Finally, the investigators will                   explore the topological consequences that follow from imposing                  curvature conditions on a manifold and its boundary.                                 The geometry of three dimensions is the geometry of the                    world we live in, so one might expect that the mathematical study               of this area would have particularly broad applications.  This is               indeed the case, and the area leads to applications in physics,                 in the study of the differential equations governing physical                   phenomena, to group theory, and to many other branches of                       mathematics.  Mathematicians study, in all dimensions, the                      geometric objects called \"manifolds,\" which have properties                     similar to those of the space we live in.  Manifolds in dimension               three exhibit unique features which make their study a                          flourishing area of current research.  The objective of this                    project is to study certain categories of these 3-manifolds, in                 pursuit of the overall goal of understanding these geometric                    objects.  Using techniques developed from studying knotted curves               and the complexity of their raveling, and from the theory of soap               films and minimal surfaces, the investigators aim to contribute                 to the classification problem for3-manifolds and to understand                  specific classes of 3-manifolds in great detail.",
