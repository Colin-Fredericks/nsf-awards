 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue experimental studies of                              granivory in the Chihuahuan Desert near Portal,                                 Arizona. The 20-ha study site contains 24 fenced plots,                         each 0.25 ha in area.   Investigators have maintained                           the removal of some or all species of rodents and/or                            ants from 10 plots continuously since 1977 and from an                          additional 14 plots since 1988.  Standardized censuses                          of rodents, ants, and plants provide invaluable data on                         responses of individuals, populations, and communities                          both to experimental perturbations and to natural                               temporal and spatial variation in the environment.                                                                                                              Results to date demonstrate: 1) long-term fluctuations                          in rodent and plant populations in response to                                  precipitation in El Nino years; 2) surprisingly                                 constant competition among rodent species; 3) direct                            effects of seed predation by rodents and ants on annual                         plant populations; 4) indirect effects of rodents on                            ants, birds, and plants, and of ants on birds and                               plants; and 5) wholesale changes in vegetation in                               response to exclusion of kangaroo rats.  The research                           plan for the next five years includes: 1) continuation                          of experimental manipulations and standardized censuses                         of rodents, ants, and plants; 2) analysis of long-term                          population dynamics; 3) investigation of the                                    relationships between direct and indirect biotic                                interactions; and 4) comparison of responses to                                 manipulations initiated in 1977 and 1988.",
