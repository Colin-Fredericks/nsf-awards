 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315527  Crawford  This project supports the participation of Dr.  Tadesse Mesfin of Addis Ababa University,  Ethiopia, in an ongoing study in plant  molecular phylogenetics, led by Dr. Daniel  Crawford of Ohio State University, (NSF Grant  INT-9025030), of the systematics and evolution  of the genus Coreopsis (Asteraceae).  Both  South America and Eastern Africa represent  centers of diversity for Coreopsis that equal  or surpass that found in North America.  This  collaborative component will expand the work  beyond North and South American taxa to  investigate the relationship of North American  Coreopsis to African plants that have been  variously assigned to Bidens or Coreopsis.    It is hoped that the visiting scientist can  obtain morphological characters useful in a  cladistic analysis of Coreopsis and selected  representatives of the large genus Bidens and  several related genera.  The visitor will  examine the holdings in several herbaria in the  U.S., and will be introduced to some basic  molecular techniques being used in the host  scientist's laboratory to apply to the problem.   These include allozymes, restriction site  analysis of chloroplast DNA, and RAPDs.  The  cooperation will improve understanding of  Coreopsis in each of the geographical areas  where it occurs, and also on a worldwide basis,  including its origin, evolution and  biogeography.  Improved understanding of this  large, widespread genus is consistent with the  Africa Initiative emphasis on biodiversity  research cooperation, and promises benefits to  both partners and to their parent institutions.   Moreover, this project will contribute to the  establishment of a longterm research network  linking scientists on three continents, Africa,  North America, and South America.  ***",
