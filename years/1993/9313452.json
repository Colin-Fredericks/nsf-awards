The number of graduate and undergraduate  students involved in research activities in the department has  grown tremendously since the construction of the building in  1967.  The department has experienced an increase in extramural  support, making it the second department to receive the most  research funds in the College of Sciences.  Research conducted in  the facility encompasses five major areas of chemistry:  analytical chemistry, biochemistry, environmental chemistry,  organic chemistry,  and materials chemistry.  In addition to  awarding the B.S. and M.S. degrees in chemistry, the department  shares a new Ph.D. program in the Biomedical Sciences with the  Biology Department and the Eastern Virginia Medical School.  Increases in research faculty, funding, size and maturity of the  graduate program have reached a level where the department is  proposing to implement a Ph.D. program in Applied Chemistry.    In addition to refurbishing laboratory space, renovations will  include: upgrading the electrical power system, modernizing the  fire alarm system to state fire codes, providing a centralized,  deionized water system for the entire building, replacing the  original motors and ductwork for fume hoods, and replacing the  air handling system that is essential to protect sensitive cell  lines from contamination during biochemical experiments.  Completion of the renovations will improve the research and  research training enterprise, at Old Dominion University, by  improving the research environment, providing research  opportunities for high school students, and students enrolled at  predominately minority institutions, and in the retraining of  military personnel at the graduate and undergraduate levels.  ***",
