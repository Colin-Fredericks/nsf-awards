 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to acquire new equipment for                    the analysis of genes and proteins, thereby modernizing and                     revitalizing the Genetics course in the Biology Department at                   Ursinus College. In addition, the equipment will allow the                      inclusion of more challenging experiments in the Evolution                      course, and the expansion of opportunities for student                          research.We will revise and update the laboratory component of                  the Genetics course by teaching the indispensable, fundamental                  principles of Genetics, supplemented by auxiliary lessons which                 deal with the history of genetics, knowledge of sexual and                      asexual organisms needed for genetics research, and the                         acquisition of technical and experimental design skills                         necessary for careers in science. Such skills will encourage                    and better prepare students for an independent undergraduate                    research experience, an opportunity which the Biology                           Department desires to provide to all majors.The equipment                       requested will permit us to teach several new principles in our                 Genetics and Evolution courses, enhance the student research                    program, and better serve the unprecedented numbers of Biology                  majors we have had the good fortune to attract to Ursinus                       College.",
