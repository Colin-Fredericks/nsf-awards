However little is known about the                                               physics and applications of                                                     semiconductors near half their gap.                                             Our preliminary results on a                                                    nonlinear directional coupler have                                              shown the potential for classical                                               all-optical waveguide switching                                                 below half the band gap.  Based on                                              this preliminary result, it is                                                  proposed to investigate the third                                               order nonlinear properties of bulk                                              and MQW samples of GaAs and A1GaAs                                              near half their band gap, that is                                               to: 1) measure the spectral                                                     dependence of both the nonlinearity                                             n2 and two photon absorption                                                    coefficient B2, looking for                                                     enhancements due to gap states,                                                 excitons ets; 2) use the below half                                             band gap nonlinearities to                                                      demonstrate all-optical switching                                               devices; 3) investigate spatial                                                 soliton propagation, and its                                                    potential application to logic                                                  devices in A1GaAs; 4) study whether                                             the cascading of second order                                                   nonlinearities can lead to large                                                third order nonlinearities.",
