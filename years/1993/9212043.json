 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate people's perceptions of                          multidimensional auditory stimuli.  Examples of such stimuli                    include simple sounds, like tones, that can be made to vary in both             frequency and intensity and speech sounds, which are inherently                 complex.  The principal research question is whether or not the                 components of such sounds are perceived independently, and if not,              what kinds of interactions take place.                                                                                                                          Experiments will use speech and nonspeech sounds that are difficult             to distinguish.  The presence of perceptual interaction can be                  diagnosed by comparing people's ability to discriminate different               combinations of sounds with the predictions of a quantitative                   theory.  Several series of experiments will be conducted.  The                  first series will test whether observed interactions are sensory                effects, or arise from the observer using less-than-ideal decision              processes.  The second will measure whether interactions change                 with experience and whether such improvement is due to a change in              the decision rules the observers use.  The third will investigate               whether listeners find some auditory dimensions more available than             others in analyzing complex sounds.  The fourth will compare                    interactions with hard-to-discriminate stimuli and with clearly                 audible sounds.                                                                                                                                                 The results of these experiments will shed light on the problem of              designing informative auditory displays.  Multidimensional displays             are known to be optimal for conveying complex information, but only             if the dimensions are independent; determining whether dimensions               are independent, or become independent with training, is a goal of              this research.",
