 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efficient algorithms to learn complex concepts from examples  and other kinds of information are sought.  A major focus  is on the `other kinds of information` that may serve to  reduce the computational difficulty of learning complex  concepts, including queries to a teacher, advantageous order  of presentation of examples, the presence of related concepts,  graded (as opposed to Boolean) inputs and responses, and  constraints imposed by real-world situations (e.g., robot  navigation, language learning).  Techniques from computational  complexity, the theory of automata and formal languages, the  analysis of algorithms, and cryptography are applied to  narrow the gap between provable efficiently learnable and  provably not efficiently learnable classes of concepts.  The  problem of omissions and errors in the `other kinds of  information` are also addressed.  The problem of  approximating a distribution by sampling is studied as a  method of extending Valiant's paradigm of `probably  approximately correct` identification to problems in which  negative examples are absent.",
