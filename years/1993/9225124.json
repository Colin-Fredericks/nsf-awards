 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to define a general formal model for  reasoning about real-time and distributed systems, and to  establish its value  by using it for a variety of purposes.  Many  models have been proposed  for such systems; this project  is unique in that it attempts to define a single  model that can  be used for many different purposes.  The uses for such a model  include: (1) proving fundamental results about the capabilities of real-time  and distributed systems.  These include upper and lower bound  complexity  results (for time, space and communication complexity)  and impossibility  results: (2) describing real systems, using appropriate programming  languages;  (3) specifying allowable system behavior; (4) verifying (by hand or by machine)  the correctness of algorithms  and systems.  There are different styles of  verification, of  which assertional, algebraic and temporal logic methods are  probably the most significant; and (5) analyzing system performance.  Traditionally, research in each of these areas has been based on  a semantic  model designed specifically for that area.  In  contrast, this project aims to  conduct work in these areas in  terms of a common model.    The project   focuses particularly on real-time and other timing-based systems (e.g.,  communication systems and real-time process  control systems).",
