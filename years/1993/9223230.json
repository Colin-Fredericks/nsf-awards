 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the electronic and vibrational excitation,                 energy-migration, and relaxation processes, involving various                   molecular and electronic defects in ordered and disordered ionic                solids.  Research will include electron-vibration energy transfer               processes between F-centers and molecular defects will be                       investigated using resonance Raman scattering, vibrational                      luminescence and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy.  A newly             developed technique will be used to produce high quality ultra-thin             crystals in the range 0.2 - 100 \u001am.  The influence of the                       mesoscopic size on the films on the energy-transfer and phase                   behavior of the materials will be investigated and may lead to new              optical materials or research possibilities.                                    %%%                                                                             This project involves the study of the optical properties of                    materials which are typically used in laser devices.  One area of               interest is that of energy transfer processes that need to be                   understood in order to optimize the optical and lasing properties               of materials.  Another important area is that of thin films of                  optical materials, where the reduced size of the medium changes the             properties of crystals in new and incompletely understood ways.                 The study of these materials may lead to new laser materials or                 devise applications.",
