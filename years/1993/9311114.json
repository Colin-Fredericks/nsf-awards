 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311114  CHIN  This project will examine the social and economic networks that  underlie illegal Chinese immigration to the United States.  The  research will describe the migratory processes (from initiation in  China to entering the United States), and the problems faced by  illegal immigrants after their arrival.  The social and economic  networks make the immigration possible and also support the illegal  aliens in this country.  Some of this support is by otherwise legal  groups and families, and some is by illegal groups and enterprises.   The research will describe the ways in which illegal immigrants  cope with their illegal status, including their economic and  criminal activities, and identify those factors in the legal,  social and economic environment that facilitate or inhibit their  success.  The study will analyze these data in the historical  context of previous waves of immigration by other ethnic groups  over the past 100 years or more.  This research will make an  important empirical contribution to scientific knowledge about  immigration processes as well as to policy analysis focused on  current illegal immigration.    In order to examine the legal, social and economic aspects of  illegal immigration among the Chinese, the investigators will  conduct in-depth interviews with 200-300 illegal Chinese immigrants  who are now living in New York City and its vicinity.  In addition,  social workers, business leaders and community leaders in Chinatown  will be interviewed.  These interviews will make it possible for  the investigators to trace the various immigration networks within  the Chinese community and document the ways in which these networks  also provide the economic and social bases for illegal immigration.   The study will also explore comparisons between current (legal and  illegal) Chinese immigration and earlier waves of immigration by  other ethnic groups through an examination of the historical  literature on immigration to the United States.  ***",
