 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present proposal is to explore, by means of numerical and                   theoretical investigations, the feasibility of the hypothesis                   that biomembranes define spaces that have a random fractal                      geometry, and to design experimental tests of the hypothesis.                   Numerical methods will be developed for the study of molecular                  mobility in two-dimensional hard sphere fluids, so that the                     time/distance scale dependence of lipid/lipid and lipid/protein                 obstruction can be more fully elucidated.  Experimental                         measurements of anomalous transport properties will be developed                in order to find evidence of (1) dependence of the diffusion                    coefficient on the measurement length scale and (2) time-                       dependence of the second order rate coefficient in homogeneous                  solutions and in biomembranes.  The goal of these research                      planning activities is to design experimental and theoretical                   protocols that will form the basis of a proposal to the NSF for a               Research in Undergraduate Institutions grant, to support a three                year program of research carried out be undergraduate students at               Lawrence University, under the direction of the present PI.                     %%%                                                                             Molecular mobility may be an important determinant of metabolic                 rates in biomembranes, particularly for enzymes and substrates                  that are spatially restricted, as in portions of the                            photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains.                       Biomembranes are heterogeneous, disordered media that may possess               fractal geometry.  Recent theoretical investigations have                       suggested that transport properties, such as diffusion and                      conduction, may well be anomalous in heterogeneous spaces.  The                 diffusion constant has been shown to depend on the length scale                 of measurement in random fractals, and the rate coefficient of                  bimolecular reactions, a constant in homogeneous reaction spaces,               has been shown to be time dependent.  The research planning                     activities proposed here are motivated by the idea that these                   recent theoretical developments may provide fundamental new                     insights into the nature of molecular mobility in biomembranes.                 If membranes are fractal objects, then they may display anomalous               transport properties experimentally, and this may not only                      resolve some longstanding issues in biophysics, such as the                     disagreement between diffusion constants measured on different                  length scales, but also have profound metabolic implications.",
