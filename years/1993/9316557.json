The main thrust  of the research is a combined experimental and theoretical  study of oxygen transfer by Group VI metals in both biological  and inorganic systems. A combined spectroscopic approach  utilizing variable-temperature, variable-field magnetic  circular dichroism, single crystal polarized absorption, and  resonance Raman spectroscopies will probe the Mo(V) state of  xanthine oxidase catalytic intermediates. These enzyme studies  will be complemented by parallel investigations of relevant  model compounds which display structural features believed to  be present at the enzyme active site. Excited state spectral  studies will be used in order to evaluate the results of  detailed bonding calculations including self-consistent field  scattered wave calculations, transition-state calculations, and  density functional methods incorporating Slater or  Gaussian-type basis functions.  %%%  Group VI metals, specifically molybdenum and tungsten are  catalytically active towards oxygen transfer in both enzymatic  and inorganic systems. These studies will provide a wealth of  information concerning the mode of substrate binding to the  metal and will directly probe the initial steps in oxo transfer  from metal to substrate.  ***",
