The project aims to address an area of weakness in our  understanding of cellular signalling events, that is, the nature,  distribution, and function of the pools of calcium inside cells  which contribute to generation of intracellular calcium signals.   High resolution imaging techniques will be applied to study the  location, control, and biological significance of calcium  regulatory organelles functioning within established smooth muscle  cell lines.  The project will develop and utilize novel single cell  and subcellular imaging technologies to spatially resolve those  organelles that function as calcium signaling pools in cells.  The  specific goals are to answer the following questions:  (1) What are  the levels of calcium within calcium pools?  The objectives are to  visualize calcium pools directly, measure intraluminal calcium  levels, and correlate distribution of calcium pools with known  calcium regulatory proteins and specific organelle markers. (2) How  is calcium inside calcium pools controlled?  The question will be  addressed by investigating the function and interrelationship of  the mechanisms that pump calcium into pools, release calcium from  pools in response to intracellular mediators, and transfer calcium  between distinct intracellular pools activated by GTP-binding  proteins.  By developing and applying high resolution z-axis  controlled fluorescence imaging to the analysis of calcium pools,  the studies provide a novel approach to understanding the  distribution of calcium signalling pools, and address the  hypothesis that calcium levels within organelles are of fundamental  biological importance to cellular function.  %%%  An early, measurable event in many cellular responses to external  signals is an increase in internal calcium.  A variet y of cellular  functions are regulated by calcium, so it is critical that cells be  able to regulate the internal levels and subcellular distribution  of this ion.  An active area of research in recent years has been  development of techniques to measure the levels of free calcium in  the cytoplasm of cells.  The goals of this research will complement  the available techniques for measurement of cytoplasmic calcium by  developing and using novel techniques to study the location,  control, and biological function of calcium sequestered within  regulatory organelles (calcium pools).  High-resolution, single  cell and subcellular imaging will be used to study calcium-  containing organelles in cultured smooth muscle cell lines.   Experiments will be designed to answer the questions:  What are the  levels of calcium within particular calcium pools, and how is  calcium inside these pools controlled?  The results of this  research will provide new techniques and information to fill an  important gap in our understanding of cellular signalling events.  ***",
