 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dissimilation of sinking organic aggregates is a central issue in               the regulation of carbon fluxes from the ocean's surface into its               depths.  The role of attached bacteria in particle decomposition                has been unclear.  High concentrations (108-109 ml-1) of slowly                 growing bacteria commonly found on aggregates create intense                    ectohydrolase activities which rapidly solubilize (0.2-2.1 d                    turnover time) particulate combined amino acids but allow most                  hydrolysate to be released into seawater.  This \"uncoupled                      solubilization\", particularly if it applies generally to                        aggregate's carbon pool, could have profound implications for                   downward flux of carbon.  Using SCUBA collected marine snow and                 laboratory-made 14C labeled phytodetritus aggregates studies will 1)            quantify DOC release (measured by high temperature catalytic                    oxidation) and POC turnover rates and how they vary with variation              in colonization and enzyme activities on aggregates.  2)                        characterize the released DOC in terms of molecular size                        distribution (with molecular sieves), whether it contains colloids              and sub-micron particles (by transmission electron microscopy), and             whether some of it is refractory to bacterial utilization (or has               long turnover time); 3) test whether enzyme action on aggregates                causes differential solubilization of C, N and P.  This work will               be done on aggregates collected in waters off La Jolla, Santa                   Barbara, and at several offshore stations in Southern California                Bight during 4 cruises.  The proposed study will contribute to an               understanding of the role of attached bacteria in POC  DOC                      transition and hence in carbon cycling in the ocean.",
