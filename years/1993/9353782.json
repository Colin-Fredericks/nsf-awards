Encouraged  by the enthusiastic response to the earlier IDEAS effort, the TAP Program is built upon the best  of IDEAS.  TAP TEAMS will be formed on the basis of major fields of study and will consist  of incoming women, returning women, and women alumnae.  The teams will be formed during  the two-day \"Transition\" experience, maintained throughout the \"Assimilation\" experience, and  widely utilized for the \"Preparation\" experience.    The Transition component will provide a two-day on campus experience designed to make  incoming women feel comfortable and connected to MSoE.  All activities will promote  interaction, bonding, and networking with other incoming women students, returning women  students, and women representing the faculty, staff, and alumnae of the college.  The  Assimilation component will strengthen the friendships and networks begun during the Transition  stage and provide new opportunities for feeling connected to the School and to the field of  engineering.  These opportunities will include shadowing MSoE women as they work on their  senior design projects, designing and implementing new programs that meet the special needs  of women on the MSoE campus, and participating in a lecture-discussion series led by  professional women engineers.  The Preparation component will help women formulate realistic  career goals and strengthen their commitment to the filed of engineering.  This will be achieved  through an extensive shadowing program linking sophomore students to professional women  engineers, through quarterly forums in which students share their experiences, and through  increased student participation in professional organizations on campus.  Evaluation of the  effectiveness will involve external consultation, students and faculty/staff.  ***",
