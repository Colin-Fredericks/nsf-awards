 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jones  9302584       This mathematical research project will focus on the  approximation of complex valued functions of a complex variable.   The work centers on the use of rational interpolation by Pade  approximates.  These are rational functions which match the power  series of specific functions at two or more points.  Within this  framework investigations will be carried out on the indeterminate  strong Stieltjes moment problem and the associated orthogonal  Laurent polynomials, on applications of Szego polynomials to  digital signal processing and the convergence of Pade continued  fractions relative to classical special functions including  truncation error analysis.  Finally, a comprehensive survey of  continued fraction representations of mathematical functions  along with a guide to their computation will be prepared.  Large  scale computation will be done for experiments in search of  general properties that can be proven and for graphical and  numerical illustration of the convergence behavior of rational  approximants.       In many scientific applications, the relevant functions are  not computable by elementary methods.  Approximation theory, as  exemplified by this project, seeks to establish and catalogue  methods for approximating more or less general functions by means  of specific, easily computable substitutes.  It is important that  the methods developed also provide error analysis and, where  possible, algorithms for efficient implementation of the  approximations.  ***",
