 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bamboos (family Poaceae: Bambusoideae), which include the              true bamboos and rices, are a morphologically and ecologically                  diverse group of temperate and tropical grasses that comprise                   approximately 116 genera and 1300 species.  The rices, an important             cereal crop, have been extensively studied, but the true bamboos                (both woody and herbaceous) are much less well known taxonomically,             and large gaps in our knowledge of bamboos remain.  Evolutionary                relationships among the groups of bamboos, and between bamboos and              other grasses, have been only superficially explored.  With                     combined expertise in morphological and molecular techniques, Drs.              Clark and Wendel of Iowa State University are studying the                      taxonomic diversity of bamboos on a worldwide basis.  The primary               goals of their research are: 1. to produce an explicit and robust               phylogenetic hypothesis of bamboo evolution using a combined                    approach to integrate morphological and genomic data with modern                cladistic methods, and 2. to generate a classification of the                   bamboos at the tribal and generic levels that will ally related                 groups of species into monophyletic groups (all those likely                    sharing a recent common ancestor).  Morphological studies will                  include new investigations by scanning electron microscopy of leaf              and seed surface features.  Molecular studies will include analyses             of patterns of restriction-enzyme digests of chloroplast DNA.                   Collaborators from around the world are supplying samples from the              numerous genera of bamboos.  The research promises the first global             perspective on bamboo evolution uniting morphological and genomic               data, and will facilitate subsequent taxonomic and biogeographic                studies of bamboos and their close relatives.",
