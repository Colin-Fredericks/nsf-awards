 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new course combines concepts from the students' prior                      course work and introduces them to a broad range of modern                      design and testing techniques for advanced materials.                           Fundamental engineering concepts are followed immediately with                  engineering problem-solving.  A series of lab sessions have                     been formulated, each involving a task directed toward the                      reverse-engineering, evaluation, and improvement of a sample,                   manufactured mechanical product. Design and manufacture is                      approached as parallel rather than sequential tasks. The course                 also enhances learning by increasing the level of interaction                   on various levels. The course is arranged in a way which                        emphasizes discussion and oral examination rather than lecture.                 The instructor spends most of his/her time interacting with                     small groups of students rather than the entire class. The                      students are required to interact amongst each other in the                     organization and preparation of the lab reports. Unlike more                    traditional courses, grading will not be based strictly upon                    knowledge level.  Student interest in the material will be                      stimulated because the proposed lab sessions have both a                        sequence and a unifying context which give the learning                         experience continuity. The course will give the students                        exposure to more modern and advanced mechanical testing                         techniques, engineering materials, and approaches to the                        design/manufacturing interaction than they currently receive.",
