 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations will be conducted on the implementation and use of  a            higher-order   metalanguage  that  has   several   applications   in            prototyping  derivation systems. This metalanguage is based  on  the            logic  programming  paradigm  but  it  enriches  conventional   such            languages  by incorporating a polymorphic typing regimen,  providing            the  terms  of  a lambda calculus as data structures, using  higher-            order  unification for probing these data structures  and  including            two  new search primitives for realizing hypothetical reasoning  and            for   creating  new  constants  during  search.  The  implementation            problems that are raised by each of these features have been studied            and  a  preliminary  abstract machine  has  been  designed  for  the            underlying  logical  language. Efforts will  now  be  devoted  to  a            practical realization of a programming system based on these  ideas.            Language and interface design aspects will be considered to  enhance            the usability of the metalanguage based on the logical language. The            abstract  machine will be extended to cover the additional  language            features  and  an  implementation of  the  overall  system  will  be            undertaken. Experiments will be conducted with the implementation to            obtain  feedback  on  specific design decisions  pertaining  to  the            abstract machine. Attempts will be made to tailor the implementation            to   sublanguages   that  are  becoming  of  independent   interest.            Theoretical  issues  affecting the quality and  correctness  of  the            implementation will also be examined. A particular interest will  be            the  study  of  notations for lambda terms and  their  relevance  to            optimality in reduction.",
