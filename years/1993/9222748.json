 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers will investigate the social and cultural                        reasons why anorexia nervosa is difficult to cure through an                    ethnographic study of \"non-compliance\" on the part of                           anorexic patients in the United States.  Anorexics often                        resist treatment, and the purpose of this project is to                         determine if this resistance is related to the fact that                        anorexia exaggerates a contemporary ideal of feminine                           \"fitness\" and bodily control.  Many young women today try to                    attain autonomy and self-control through dieting and                            exercise, in the face of pressures to relax and consume.                        Anorexics carry the dieter's dilemma to an extreme in their                     experience of a control paradox; the more anorexics are able                    to control their bodies, the more their bodies seem to                          control them with demands for food and relaxation.  The                         central hypothesis for this project is that anorexics do not                    comply with psychiatric protocols because these treatment                       practices participate in the cultural production of the                         anorexics' predicament, by recreating her fundamental                           anxiety about whether or not she can control herself.  The                      doctoral researcher will investigate this problem through                       interviews with patients and clinicians, case studies of                        individual anorexics' life histories, and observations of                       the interaction between anorexics and clinicians in eating                      disorder clinics.  If the researchers' central thesis holds                     up to evaluation, this project will demonstrate the close                       relation between clinical practice and cultural                                 constructions of the ideals of feminine control and should                      aid clinicians in devising better ways in which to treat                        anorexics.",
