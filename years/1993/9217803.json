 "awd_abstract_narration": "Uncertainty in modeling the response of Eath environments to                    changing conditions such as global warming arises from a poor                   understanding of the dynamics of these environments.  It is                     established that over the past 20,000 years the Sahara has                      undergone dramatic swings from more extensive and sand-sea                      devlopment than today to being vegetated with common lakes and                  rivers.  While   these swings correspond to Milankovitch cycles,                our basis for understanding these in a process-reponse model has                only recently begun to emerge.  The area of the Sahara extending                from the Atlas Mountains onto the Sahara  Platform in Tunisia                   offers a microcosm of diverse environments, where deposits are                  housed in a subsiding trough.  Remote sensing is first used to map              present environments, recognize relict features, and locate                     specific depocenters for detailed field work.  Field work involves              the establishment of an unconformity-bounded stratigraphic                      framework for eolian, fluvial and lacustrine deposits in the area               through field mapping of soil-geomorphic and stratigraphic                      relationships, facies analysis, and geophysical methods.                        Subsequent lab analysis involves the dating of the sequences so                 they can be correlated with climatic events.  Because the response              of eolian and associated depositional systems to climatic and other             factors is the basis for sequence stratigraphy, the results are                 expected to help formulate a general process-response eolian                    sequence  model that will have predictive capabilities with respect             to changing external controls.",
