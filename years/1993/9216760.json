 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists, engineers and technical managers often work in teams.               The ability to work as part of a team contributes importantly to                organizational productivity.  Yet despite a strong tradition of                 theory and research on groups, little is known about the                        acquisition of teamwork skills, especially in technical domains.                This research investigates how technical students and professionals             learn teamwork in software development.  A theoretical framework                for examining individual and group change in coordination behavior              and teamwork skills is developed.  Then, studies of the development             of teamwork skills in student software development teams are                    conducted.  The research examines the effect of students'                       experience on changes in team structure and communication, and of               how patterns of team coordination are associated with team                      performance and with individual performance and cognitive learning.             The analysis is then extended to actual organizations with studies              of changes in patterns of coordination and learning in software                 development teams in two organizations.  Two field studies are                  conducted:  (1) a cross-sectional study of how coordination                     patterns in teams are associated with cognitions and attitudes                  about teamwork, and (2) a longitudinal study of socialization for               teamwork, examining the influence of experienced group members on               changes in the coordination behaviors, cognitions, and attitudes of             novices.",
