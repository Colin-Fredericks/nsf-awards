It has been difficult to determine whether  or not there is race discrimination in the bail system for the  reason that bail may be correlated with race because race may be  correlated with some legitimate bail determinant.  Research cannot  conclusively determine whether discrimination is occurring unless  the researcher can account for all factors that should affect bail.  The project avoids this problem by directly examining measures of  flight (and rearrest) risk, the outcome(s) that bail seeks to  control.  The investigators will then compare the determinants of  both flight and rearrest risk.  The project will also use data on  bondsmen's rates to perform a market-based evaluation of the bail  system.    The project requires data collection, data manipulation and data  analysis.  The data will be collected from the Connecticut Judicial  Department, the Connecticut Bail Commission and the Connecticut  State Police.  All of these data will require significant computer  programming to become machine readable.  The three data sets must  also be assembled into a single, coherent data base that will be  suitable for the purposes of the study.  Extensive statistical  analysis will then be required to answer the research questions.  ***",
