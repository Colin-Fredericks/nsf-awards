 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests $100,750 for acquisition of four                         major, multiuser equipment items: two high speed                                centrifuges, a liquid scintillation counter, and an                             automated sequence reader/scanning densitometer. The                            five research programs that support this application                            encompass a diverse assortment of basic biological                              research, including the areas of cell biology,                                  evolutionary genetics, molecular biology, molecular                             genetics, and microbial genetics. A primary objective                           of each of these programs and many others within the                            Department of Biological Sciences is isolation,                                 purification, and characterization of protein and                               nucleic acid fractions. The requested items are basic                           instrumental requirements for modern techniques in cell                         and molecular biology that are used to achieve this                             objective. As such, each of the five research programs                          rely heavily on the instrumentation requested in this                           proposal.                                                                                                                                                       The research projects that support this request involve                         undergraduate student research projects, M.S. thesis                            topics, and faculty research efforts. The equipment                             will significantly enhance the research, training, and                          instructional capabilities of the Department of                                 Biological Sciences. Most of the faculty and graduate                           students in the department will require the                                     instrumentation in their research. Undergraduate                                students working under faculty supervision will receive                         training and research experience with the equipment.",
