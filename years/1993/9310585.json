It is a  study                    of class conflict over American education at the turn of the                    century.   The award will enable the researcher to  reorient                    her  work toward qualitative and archival work on the social                    influences on American education.  The project will  examine                    a variety of newspaper, archival, and other sources in order                    to  identify  the contending groups trying to influence  the                    direction  of American education in several regions  between                    1880  and  1920.   The  project  is  designed  to  test  the                    hypothesis  that only those social groups that can  draw  on                    pre-existing organizations can translate their interests and                    claims into changes in the educational system.                                       This project will contribute important new perspectives                    on the social roots of the politics that shaped the American                    educational system in the twentieth century.  In addition to                    the  scientific  gains to be achieved by the research,  this                    award will materially assist a very capable young researcher                    prepare  for  a more broad-ranging research career,  thereby                    contributing  to the strengthening of the national  base  of                    women scientists and engineers.",
