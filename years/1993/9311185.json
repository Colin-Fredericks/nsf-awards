 "awd_abstract_narration": "Menon         This research is on the development and implementation of  optimization techniques for multilevel combinational logic  circuits specified at the gate level.  Logical implementation  techniques which have been proven effective in test pattern  generation are being used for this purpose.  These techniques are  being applied to three problems in logic optimization: area  reduction, delay reduction, and testability enhancement.   Relationships between signal values are being used to identify  common subfunctions without generating expressions for them and  putting them in any standard form.  This approach is efficient  and could substitute for Boolean factorization in logic  optimization.  Techniques for delay reduction involve replacing  segments of long paths with shorter ones so that false paths are  not created and undetectable faults are identified during delay  reduction.  The effectiveness of these techniques as supplements  to an existing synthesis system are being investigated.",
