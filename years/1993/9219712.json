 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant cell wall is an important cellular structure that has                 numerous biological and physical roles during plant growth.  This               structure is dynamic and changes as a consequence of growth,                    cellular differentiation and interactions with the environment.                 The long term goals of the proposed research are to determine the               function of proline-rich cell wall proteins (PRPs) during plant                 growth and development and to identify the factors responsible for              their controlled expresion.  PRPs are expressed in specific cell                types and are induced by wounding in a specific plant tissues.  In              addition, these proteins become cross-linked within the cell wall,              a process which appears to be stimulated by physical damage.                    However, the sequences required for the transcriptional regulation              of these genes or the amino acids important for their                           insolubilization within the cell wall are poorly understood.                                                                                                    The specific goals of this award to identify specific regions                   within the SbPRP1 and SbPRP2 promoters which are required for the               wound-inducible expression of these genes in soybean and to                     identify amino acids which play a critical role in the                          insolubilization of these proteins within the cell wall.  The use               of promoter/GUS in stably transformed plants will allow PIs to                  distinguish between sequences which regulate the expression of                  these genes during development and in response to physical damage.              In addition, Dr. Tierney will be able to investigate which cell                 types within wounded tissue are capable of responding to the wound-             induced signals which ultimately result in SbPRP1 and 2 expression.             She will also investigate the specific amino acids which are                    important for the insolubilzation of these proteins within the cell             wall.  The use of \"synthetic\" PRPs will make it possible to                     identify amino acids capable of forming cross-links within the cell             wall, the types of interactions involved, and whether these amino               acids are important for insolubilization of these proteins in all               cell types.  These studies will also describe the substrates for                key enzymes involved in cell wall matrix formation and will serve               as a starting point for the identification of these proteins.",
