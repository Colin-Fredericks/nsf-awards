 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large, single crystals of exacting quality are needed for the                   fabrication of advanced optical, magnetic, and electronic                       devices, and the growth of these crystals is one of the most                    difficult challenges in modern materials processing.  The                       properties responsible for the performance of a crystal in a                    device are determined by crystalline structure or composition.                                                                                                  Often, these characteristics are affected during the growth of                                                                                                  the crystal by processes which link molecularscale growth                       processes with macroscopic transport processes.  A long-term                    goal in crystal growth modeling is to understand the                            mechanisms which influence crystal quality through the                          hierarchy of length and time scales relevant to these                           molecular-scale and macroscale processes.                                                                                                                       The immediate goal of this research is to develop the tools                     necessary to understand the interactions of transport                           phenomena, crystal growth kinetics, and crystallography in                      solution crystal growth processes.  The realistic modeling of                   fluid flow, and mass transfer, and crystal growth habit in                      these systems has not been possible in the past due to the                      extreme computational challenges posed by these truly three-                    dimensional, time-dependent systems.  However, the coming                       generations of massively parallel supercomputers promise to                     deliver the performance (in terms of speed and memory) to make                                                                                                  such computations viable.                                                                                                                                       The principal investigator will develop, test, and apply new                    algorithms for modeling solution crystal growth systems.  This                                                                                                  work will place particular emphasis on algorithms appropriate                                                                                                   for massively parallel supercomputers.  The benefits of this                    work promise to be enormous, both in the development of                         appropriate algorithms for this type of supercomputer and in                    their application to understanding the complexities of                          solution growth systems.",
