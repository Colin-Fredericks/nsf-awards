 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research                 program.  The immediate objective of the project is to test the                 effectiveness of the yeast NADP/thioredoxin system in activating                seed proteins, notably the proteins of flour and soybean.  The long             term objective is to develop a safe and inexpensive processing                  technology for baking and other industry that uses flour from                   wheat, soybean and other seeds.                                                                                                                                 Preliminary studies carried out in the PI's laboratory in                       collaboration with the French group yielded an interesting                      discovery that the intramolecular disulfide groups of diverse                   proteins including a number of commercially important proteins, are             reduced (activated) by the indigenous NADP/thioredoxin system,                  consisting of NADPH, NADP-thioredoxin reductase and thioredoxin.                Potential application of the NADP/thioredoxin system ranges from                basic biology research to cereal technology to medicine and                     nutrition.                                                                                                                                                      Specifically with the SGER award, Dr. Buchanan will determine if                the yeast-based NADP/thioredoxin system can be developed into an                efficient tool to explore application potential of the thioredoxin              technology.  All work up to this point has been done using E. coli              system which has proven not appropriate for cereal technology and               nutrition applications.",
