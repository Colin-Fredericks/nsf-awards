 "awd_abstract_narration": "An emerging technology is the single wafer rapid thermal                        chemical vapor deposition (RTCVD) system.  In these systems a                   single wafer is loaded into a cooled stainless steel chamber                    where low pressure gases react on the radiatively heated wafer                  surface.  Compared to the multiwafer system, the RTCVD system                   represents considerably less cost both in initial capital and                   in required wafer fabrication floor space.  In addition, cold                   wall operation in the RTCVD system eliminates the particulate                   generation occurring on the hot walls of the multiwafer                         system.  Adding plasma enhancement to a CVD reactor (PECVD)                     prevents thermal damage to the wafer by permitting lower                        temperatures of operation.  The throughput for single wafer                     reactors needs to be maximized (e.g. rapid thermal processing)                  to be competitive with multiwafer systems.                                                                                                                      This study will focus on deposition and etch technology using                   single wafer CVD and etching reactors with plasma enhancement                   and rapid thermal processing capability.  For these unit                        operations, new fundamental (theoretical) mathematical models                   will be developed that relate the operating and equipment                       design variables to reactor performance.  These models will be                  verified using data from two reactor configurations; one of                     these reactors is a flexible manufacturing reactor from Texas                   Instruments, which will be used to study silicon nitride                        deposition.  The other is a reactive-ion etcher using carbon                    tetrafluoride CF4 and hydrogen H2.  This project will also                      research new control strategies that permit design of model-                    based controllers for each reactor.  Of particular interest                     will be a nonlinear programming-based technique called                          nonlinear model predictive control.  Active collaboration with                  personnel at Texas Instruments and SEMATECH will facilitate                     ultimate transfer of this technology to the semiconductor                       industry.",
