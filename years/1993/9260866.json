 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software engineering is a composite of data and rules about                     how those data are composed, presented to various users, and                    transformed as software development proceeds.  An appropriate                   computer-aided software engineering environment must easily                     handle data and rules.  Currently available commercial                          programming languages and database management systems tend to                   be able to handle either data or rules well, but not both                       simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                 Using a standard RDBMS and an open architecture would allow                     CASE tools to be defined as sets of schemas and semantic                        rules.  Development would be defined as sets of                                 transformational rules.  The automatic nature of this approach                  improves the reliability of developed software and decreases                    the time and cost of it.                                                                                                                                        Feasibility of the approach will be established by expanding                    a previously initiated example application.  The example will                   span all views including development and implementation                         phases.  The requisite syntactic, and project constraints will                  be identified.  A constraint language syntax will be                            specified.  Two areas of potential commercialization exist:                     (i) an extended constraint subsystem, and (ii) individual CASE                  methodology tool rule bases.",
