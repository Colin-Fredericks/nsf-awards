 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main thrust of this collaborative effort between applied               mathematics (fluid dynamics) and geophysics (geophysical Fluid                  dynamics) is a focussed study of strongly chaotic                               three-dimensional convection as applied to the Earth's mantle,                  using analytical, numerical and visualization techniques.  The                  investigator and his colleague David Yuen extend the usual                      canonical formulation of constant property simulation to include                realistic depth-dependent thermal expansivity and viscosity                     thermal conductivity along with multiple internal  phase                        transitions and internal heat generation.  The presence of a                    triple point in the phase diagram and a more  accurate                          temperature-dependent viscosity are also incorporated into the                  mathematical formulation.  The investigators use the newly                      developed proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and linear                      stochastic estimation (LSE) techniques to compress the enormous                 amount of data resulting from large-scale three-dimensional                     numerical simulations.  The POD and LSE techniques are also used                to characterize and understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of                  the relevant coherent structures, such as hot rising thermal                    plumes and cold sinking sheets.  The investigators study relevant               geophysical problems such as the underlying causes of large-scale               circulation in the mantle, the relative stationarity of                         upwellings from depth-dependent material properties,                            gravitational instabilities caused by multiple phase transitions                and the effect of temperature dependent viscosity on the mantle                 dynamics.  They also conduct simulations with an imposed                        time-dependent boundary condition at the bottom to account for                  the cooling of the core, in order to study the thermal history by               starting at very high Rayleigh number, like 10**8, and slowly                   lowering the Rayleigh number via cooling.                                            The investigators use modern mathematical theories and                     numerical techniques to study the three-dimensional dynamics of                 the Earth's interior.  An important issue arising in the last                   year is the possibility for gravitational instabilities to                      develop in the mantle due to phase transitions.  This instability               results in periodic eruption of superplumes and associated                      intense volcanic activity.  The collaborators are among the first               groups to model this phenomenon in three dimensions.  They plan                 to study this further by incorporating more realistic flow laws                 and thermodynamics.  There are still many aspects in this                       phenomenon of gravitational instability to explore, as increasing               evidence from the correlation between past trench sites and the                 cold anomalies in the lower mantle, inferred from seismic                       tomography, suggests that such mantle instabilities could have                  occurred in the past 100 million years.  Recognition of these                   instabilities may change traditional views of the role of                       steady-state processes.  They also investigate the nature of                    coherent large-scale flow structures in the lower mantle as                     revealed by seismology, and what effects these instabilities have               on the long-term thermal evolution of the Earth and Earth-like                  planets.  It was only a few years ago that the idea of a thermal                attractor from the collisions of plumes was introduced in                       geophysics.  They expect that work on large-scale coherent                      structures maintained dynamically by mantle convection may also                 affect traditional views of geophysical behavior.",
