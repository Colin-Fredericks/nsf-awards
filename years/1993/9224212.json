The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct              of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such               items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment              and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment                 such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to   pin               point the location of research sites, communication equipment                   including radio  transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice              and scientific data communications and other equipment such as                  motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data                retrieval sites.                                                                                                                                                The Project Director, Dr. John Martin is full qualified to direct               this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the               acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.                                                                                                            This project which will allow the institution to replace an ageing              radar and acquire a wireless intercom.",
