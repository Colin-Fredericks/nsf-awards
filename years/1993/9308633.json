 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308633  Ostrom    This is a follow-up conference to one that was held at Harvard in  April of 1992.  The conference will bring together scholars from  many diverse disciplines working on problems related to both global  and local environmental issues who rarely have an opportunity to  confront one another's work.  Even so, there has been a remarkable  convergence between two independent streams of literature in  political science, economics, international relations,  anthropology, ecology, and related disciplines.  The convergence  points to important similarities between the cooperation achieved  in some international regimes and in some local common-pool  resources (CPRs).    The major activity of this conference is to further theoretical and  empirical work on six unresolved, theoretical issues at the core of  research on international regimes as well as on CPRs.  These issues  are well defined but not yet effectively addressed and are thus  ripe for further work in the immediate future.  These issues are  crucially important to the understanding of cooperation in  situations of collective action without hierarchical governance.    The set of activities contributes to the scientific investigation  of a theory of cooperation related to environmental issues at both  the global and local level.  In the current era of global change,  the research leads to important policy recommendations emphasizing  the importance of multiple scales of organization.",
