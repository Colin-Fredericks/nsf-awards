 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the marine confining units (Tertiary) of the Atlantic Coastal                Plain, analysis of the mechanically-extracted pore waters from                  cores indicate elevated concentrations of sulfate (maximum value,               2200 mg/L).  This project proposes to determine (a) the source of               the elevated sulfate concentrations, and (b) the impact the sulfate             concentrations have on water quality in the confined aquifers.  The             principal investigator and 3 independently-funded collaborators                 propose to evaluate sulfate transformations and pathways in deep                confining beds.  Sediments from deep marine (unweathered) confining             units will be retrieved as core samples in cooperation with a                   Continental Dynamics Program drilling project during March through              the Fall of 1993.  Twenty core samples from one confining unit will             be analyzed over the following 18 months.   Major analyses include              the determination of pore-water chemistry, mineralogy, sulfur and               strontium isotopes in solid and aqueous phases, and microbiology.               These results will be used to constrain a coupled flow and                      transport model to assess the relative impact that various                      processes have on sulfate transport through marine confining units.             This proposal reviews the nature and implications of the elevated               sulfate concentration issue, describes the rationale for the chosen             analytic activity, and outlines the field procedures and logistics.             Successful analysis will provide important understanding of sulfate             hydrogeochemistry and valuable insight into confining unit effects              on aquifer water quality.",
