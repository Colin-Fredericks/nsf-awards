 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant viruses and viroids are minimal pathogens and depend upon                 interaction with key host components during pathogenesis.  The                  temporal and spatial regulation off host factors during initial                 host-pathogen interactions is conditioned by host recognition of                viral/viroid signals and the subsequent transduction of the signal              leading to metabolic alterations.  The processes by which these                 agents manipulate host plant proteins are unknown.  Protein                     phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cascades are important post-                  translational processes which serve to rapidly amplify and                      transduce specific developmental and environmental signals and                  coordinate metabolic responses.  This laboratory has characterized              a plant-encoded protein kinase (p68) whose autophosphorylation is               induced in viral and viroid infected plants and in noninfected                  tissue extracts supplemented with viral dsRNA and artificial dsRNA.             The response is signal dependent and occurs in the initial phases               of pathogenesis.  Studies to date have emphasized biochemical and               immunological characterization of p68.  In order to better                      understand the role of p68 it is necessary to begin analysis at the             gene level.  The investigator has chosen to use both virus- and                 viroid-host models.  Each has distinct attributes.  This project                will further characterize the significance of p68 activity in host-             pathogen interactions and in healthy plants by isolating,                       sequencing and studying the cDNA and genomic clones of p68.  The                functional significance also may be indicated by determining the                phosphorylation of p68 in tissues challenged with viroid mutants                which vary in both RNA stability and pathogenicity.  The role of                p68 may also be indicated by expression of sense and antisense                  constructs in transgenic plants.  p68 appears to be the only plant              protein thus far described that is associated with dsRNA dependent              protein kinase activity.  The viral/viroid-plant systems are                    excellent models to define the significance of phosphorylation in               host-pathogen interactions as well as to study the role of                      phosphorylation in healthy plants and how that function is altered              during infection.                                                               %%%                                                                             Addition or removal of phosphate groups (phosphorylation,                       dephosphorylation) from specific proteins plays an important role               in the recognition and amplification of environmental and                       biological signals in all organisms.  This process may also have a              central role in the way plants perceive and respond to signals                  generated during attack by pathogens or wounding.  The goal of this             research is to determine the role of protein phosphorylation in                 virus-plant interactions.  It will focus on a specific protein,                 \"p68\", that catalyzes the addition of phosphate to itself in the                presence of double stranded RNA from plant viruses.  The role of                p68 in normal plant physiology and during viral infection will be               studied.  The processes by which viruses manipulate normal proteins             after they infect plants are largely unknown.  The results of this              research should be an important contribution to basic understanding             of how plants respond to viruses.",
