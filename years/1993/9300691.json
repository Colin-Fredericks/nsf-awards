 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300691  Minker    This is the first year funding of a three-year continuing award.   Two related topics, logic programming and deductive databases are  to be studied.  In the former, the semantics of extended  disjunctive logic programs with logical negation and negation-by-  default are to be developed.  Model theoretic, proof theoretic and  fixpoint semantics are to be devised for this class of programs.   Alternative rules for negation-by-default are to be considered.   Work in extended disjunctive logic programming is related to  commonsense and nonmonotonic reasoning.  It will extend the  expressive power of logic programming and will permit users to  naturally combine logical negation and negation-by-default in one  theory and to compute in that theory.  In deductive databases  topics to be studied are: alternative theories for disjunctive  normal and extended deductive databases; the view update problem in  disjunctive theories; cooperative answering; and combining multiple  databases with priorities among atoms.  Work in deductive databases  will permit computation in situations where data is indefinite.   This is important for databases containing imprecise information  (e.g., medical).  A formal theory of database updates is to be  developed for disjunctive databases.  Cooperative answering systems  will provide meaningful answers to user queries in databases and  will permit queries to be relaxed when there are no answers to the  original query.   ***",
