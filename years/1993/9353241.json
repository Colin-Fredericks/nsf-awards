San Diego, CA    Park, Cynthia D.    \"Summer Science and Technology to Advance Research Skills (SSTARS)    The Math/Science Regional Center at San Diego State University  proposes a three-year Summer Science and Technology experience to  Advance Research Skills (SSTARS) for 50 students entering 9th  grade.  The San Diego County schools which are located in the South  Bay and Skyline areas include representation from each of the  predominant ethnic/racial groups in those areas.    The project consists of two closely related parts:  a four-week  summer residential program on the San Diego State University campus  and an academic year follow-up for students selected in Spring  1993.  The summer session offers entering 9th graders an  experimental pre-geometry class and a geometry computer lab, as  well as an interdisciplinary earth science course which integrates  a workshops in career exploration and adolescent problems.  A  technical writing class using Hypercard allows students to document  their findings in innovative and expressive ways.    All students participate in a research project, as well as  environmental field trips which supplement the courses.  This  includes a mentoring program in which university science faculty  will work up to four hours weekly with small groups of students.    Each succeeding project year (1994, 1995) will be a recapitulation  of the 1993 project year described in detail on the pages which  follow.  Students graduating from SSTARS will be able to continue  summer science study at any one of 15 specialized Upward Bound  Math/Science Centers in Federal Region IX.  ***",
