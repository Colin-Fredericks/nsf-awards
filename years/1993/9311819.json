 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed work is to develop a new cutting force model for             chip breaking in machining with a conventional grooved tool insert.             This is expected to be accomplished using a recently established                force model for machining with a flat-faced (non-chip forming)                  tool.  The proposed work will involve analytical modeling of the                process of chip breaking process for conditions requiring                       consideration of additional forces at the free-end of the chip as               well as at the back-wall of the chip groove.  Variable frictional               conditions will be assumed at the chip/tool back-wall and chip/work             surface contact points.  The well known shear plane theory of metal             cutting  will be extended to include the effects of the above                   additional friction forces.  Experimental work will include the use             of a high speed filming camera system to study the varying chip                 curling and breaking patterns within a typical chip breaking cycle              while continuously monitoring the cutting force variations with the             use of a three-component tool dynamometer system. Based on the                  analytical simulations and the experimental work, it is expected                to model the curled chip using the finite element modeling                      technique for continuously varying chip loading.  The variation of              mechanical properties such as the tensile strain which normally                 contribute to the chip breaking process will be estimated.                           The major objective of this work is to establish the most                  significant factors that influence chip breaking and to develop a               new chip breakability criterion based on the new findings.  It is               hoped that the new findings anticipated in this project will help               cutting tool manufacturers in designing new and innovative chip                 forming tool inserts.",
