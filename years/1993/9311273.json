A third congeneric species, G. nympheae, is native to North America and feeds on purple loosestrife only in limited locations.    The study uses a comparative approach to assess the factors affecting both local establishment and geographical spread of these three beetle populations.  Differences in the probability of  local establishment, both among species and for different numbers of insects released, will be determined using replicated releases in isolated locations.  A separate, single, large release will be used to track the patterns of spread through a heterogeneous environment.  %%%  Invasion biology, the study of the establishment and spread of exotic species, is a field of  growing interest and importance, particularly  as the impact of humans in biological exchanges between regions has increased markedly.  This project focuses on factors influencing the establishment and spread of exotic populations and their role in the biological control of pest species.  ***       S                                           Courier                                        (0N (s0p12h10                                       (0N (s0p12h10.0v0s0b3T        , , %             2 0      _   R   S        9311273  Root    The introduction of two closely related European chrysomelid beetles (Galerucella calmariensi s and G. pusilla)                     B   S                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       G   I                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        !         !         !         !
