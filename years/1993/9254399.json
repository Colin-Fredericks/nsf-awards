 "awd_abstract_narration": "Persons with disabilities are seriously underrepresented in                     science, mathematics, engineering, and in other high-                           technology careers.  To address this problem, a model                           program has been developed over the past decade that is                         dedicated to recruiting talented students with disabilities                     and encouraging them to pursue their interest in science and                    technology.  This program -- called High School/High-Tech --                    links educational institutions, businesses, and community                       organizations to provide enhanced educational opportunities                     in science, math and high-technology for talented disabled                      high school students in the 9th through 12th grades.  High                      School/High-Tech projects have enabled students with                            disabilities to attend and succeed in college and transition                    into careers in science and other high-technology fields.                                                                                                       A National Steering Committee on High School/High-Tech is                       comprised of representatives from business, industry,                           educational institutions, and government.  It is endeavoring                    to replicate its successful model throughout the country in                     order to reach as many students with disabilities as                            possible and to impart to them information concerning                           opportunities available to them in science and high-                            technology.  As a part of this endeavor, Moneta Development                     Corporation has been asked by the Steering Committee to                         produce a video that can be used by Steering Committee                          members in motivating education, community and business                         leaders to establish and operate new High School/High-Tech                      projects in new locations.  $20,000 has been requested from                     NSF to cost-share the production of this video.  It is                          anticipated that the video can result in the recruitment and                    initial training of hundreds of students with disabilities                      for careers in science, engineering, math and high-                             technology.",
