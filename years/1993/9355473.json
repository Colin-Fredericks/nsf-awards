In  addition, several principal investigators who have been supported  under Calculus and the Course and Curriculum Development (CCD) that  are coalition type activities and other selected individuals with  expertise in coalition building are also attending.  A guidebook  for individuals who are developing, planning, and leading  coalitions is being written.  The guidebook contains such  information as descriptions of successful coalitions, barriers to  coalition building and models for overcoming these barriers, other  potential coalition models, recruitment strategies, evaluation  mechanisms, and methods for sustaining coalitions.  Each coalition  represented is also developing as a result of this conference a  manuscript for submission to a newsletter or professional journal  about their coalition activities.  ***",
