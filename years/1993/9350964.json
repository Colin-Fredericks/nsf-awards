 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are changing the Introductory Physics Laboratory from                        \"standard fare\" to a tutorial course with new experiments that                  emphasize the physics concepts and principles of, and are given                 in synchronism with the concurrent lecture course.  In the                      past, the first phase of our change covered mechanics.  New                     apparatus was developed at Northeastern which is now used at                    many colleges and universities, and available commercially.  We                 are now in the second phase, the electromagnetic cycle of                       experiments.  Lack of suitable, commercially available                          apparatus is a known serious problem in this part of the                        curriculum.  This is especially true for such important                         concepts as Ampere's and Faraday's laws.  New robust yet                        transparent experiments are in various stages of design,                        prototyping, or student testing.  Support from the NSF is being                 used to incorporate them fully into our curriculum and make                     them available to the physics community.  In addition, some                     equipment support is being used to fully satisfy the tutorial                   character of the new courses.",
