The program will give ten                                 undergraduate students the opportunity to participate in                        research projects in ecology and conservation biology                           working with one of eight faculty sponsors in the                               Department.  Students  will be recruited intensively in the                     Boston area and also elsewhere in New England.                                                                                                                  The two major component of the program are complementary:                       (1) a series of lectures/discussions for all the students,                      and (2) individual research projects in which each student                      is closely associated with an advisor/mentor.                                                                                                                   Initial group meetings that address the theory and practice                     of research continue as weekly meetings at which students                       focus on topics that relate to the conduct of research or                       its implications They will also visit two or more field                         sites and learn directly about each others' projects A small                    hands-on workshop on molecular techniques will show the                         great potential of such methods for ecology An end-of-                          session retreat at the University Field Station will serve                      to articulate impressions, explore philosophical issues, and                    weave together some of the summers' threads.                                                                                                                    Potential research topics are will be suggested, several of                     which can effectively involve two or more undergraduates.                       The topics are focused on issues of biodiversity and                            conservation ecology but are intentionally diverse to                           illustrate several approaches They include three on the                         behavioral ecology of rare/endangered vertebrates, and                          others on the physiological ecology of Lepidoptera, the                         diversity of bacteria, the genetics of endangered plants,                       and the genetic diversity of deep-sea molluscs.  At the end                     of the session each student will prepare a written and                          present a short paper in a mini-conference.",
