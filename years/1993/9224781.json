Howell and Dr.                                        Theodore L. Bergman.  The Russian/Belorussian                                   group will be led by Dr. Alexander Ivanovich                                    Leontiev of Moscow Technical and State                                          University, and includes: Dr. Arkady G. Blokh,                                  Central Boiler & Turbine Institute, Russian                                     Academy of Sciences \u0131A/S!, St Petersburg;  Dr.                                  Gennady S.

The researchers will                                      exchange information and plan collaborative                                     research in radiative heat transfer.  The                                       workshop will center on problems and                                            applications in which radiation is highly                                       coupled with other heat transfer mechanisms.                                    Specific topics to be discussed will be: (1)                                    Radiation in Porous, Particulate, or Composite                                  Media; (2) Radiation in Combustion; and (3)                                     Radiative-Convective Heat Transfer in Low-                                      Temperature Plasmas.  Based on the technical                                    discussions, cooperative research projects                                      between groups in the U.S. and in Russia and                                    Belorussia will be identified.                                                                                                                                  This project in energy studies and mechanical                                   engineering fulfills the program objectives of                                  advancing science by enabling leading experts                                   in the U.S., Belorussia, and Russia to combine                                  complementary talents and pool research                                         resources in the areas of strong mutual                                         interest and competence.",
