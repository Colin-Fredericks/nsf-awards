 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to measure several important              products of atmospheric photolysis including the hydroxyl radical,              and gas phase sulfuric and methanesulfonic acids using a mass                   spectrometric technique.  In addition , the instrument used to                  perform these measurements will be modified to make possible                    shipboard and aircraft studies.                                                      A recent informal intercomparison between the mass                         spectrometric measurement technique and a NOAA long path laser                  absorption technique resulted in similar concentrations of OH being             measured by both instruments.  The measured hydroxyl radical                    concentrations were however, consistently well below model                      predictions.  In order to investigate these discrepancies these                 scientists will participate in an additional  hydroxyl radical                  intercompaion and photochemistry experiment in Colorado during the              summer of 1993.  A second study to isolate possible effects of                  vegetation and other near-ground loss mechanisms on hydroxyl                    radical concentration will also be undertaken.  Modifications to                the present system would also be undertaken to make possible                    measurements on a mobile platform for future studies.",
