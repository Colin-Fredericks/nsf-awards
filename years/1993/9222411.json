 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program provides continued support to Dr. Louis H. Pignolet of                  the Chemistry Department, University of Minnesota, for the                      investigation of mixed metal cluster compounds containing gold,                 platinum, and palladium.  Pignolet will synthesize additional                   cluster molecules that are larger, contain a wider variety of                   metals, and use less bulky phosphine ligands.  Recently,                        Pignolet has observed that hydrogen molecules can equilibrate                   with deuterium molecules on the surface of these clusters.  He                  wishes to explore the mechanism of this interaction and                         characterize the species involved.  He would also study the                     catalytic activity of these clusters upon hydrogenation under                   both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions.  The catalyst                    systems would be characterized using TEM, XPS, chemisorption                    and other surface methods.                                                      %%%                                                                             Many industrial catalysts contain a mixture of metals, and it                   is speculated that the effectiveness of these catalysts depends                 on a synergistic interaction between the various metals.  Mixed                 metal clusters, containing eight to twenty metal atoms, have                    been postulated as useful model compounds for understanding the                 details of such catalytic activity.  In this project, Pignolet                  will make larger and more varied clusters and reduce the size                   of the stabilizing phosphine groups attached to the metals so                   as to enhance the cluster's catalytic effectiveness.  The                       catalytic behavior of the clusters will be investigated,                        particularly for hydrogenation catalysis, and both free and                     alumina-supported clusters will be studied.  The results could                  provide increased understanding of the factors affecting the                    reactivity of catalysts.",
