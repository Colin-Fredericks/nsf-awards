 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a person is faced with a cognitive task that takes effort,                 neurons in a brain region called the anterior cingulate cortex are              activated.  At present we don't know whether neuronal activation in             this region is related to nonspecific effects of arousal, the                   increased effort involved in making a decision, or processes                    related to divided attention.  With this NSF small grant for                    exploratory research, Dr. Olson will study the responses of single              neurons in the anterior cingulate during the performance of tasks               that activate this region in the human.  The animals will be                    trained on three different tasks in order to distinguish between                increases in activity that are due to arousal, decision making, or              split attention.  This project represents the first attempt to                  study the activity of this area in behaving animals.  The results               should advance our understanding of the cognitive circuits                      underlying selective attention and decision making.  They will be               relevant for models of decision processes in humans, robotics and               artificial intelligence as well as neuroscience.***//",
