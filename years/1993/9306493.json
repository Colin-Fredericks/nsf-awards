An important phenomenon, knows as genetic hitchhiking,  involves the interaction of natural selection and genetic  recombination (genetic mixing between the two copies of a gene).   When a particular DNA mutation is favored by natural selection, it  may become more common in a population since individuals with the  mutation will replace individuals without it.  However, when  natural selection favors a particular DNA site, it will also affect  nearby DNA sites which are not themselves under selection.   Typically, genetic hitchhiking will cause a reduction in DNA  variability at these nearby sites.  The amount of reduction depends  on the rate of recombination.  This relationship is important  because it allows us to look for evidence of natural selection by  comparing levels of DNA variability in genes with different  recombination rates.  Recent studies on fruit flies (Drosophila)  have demonstrated that genetic hitchhiking may affect a large  portion of the genome.  This has broad significance for genome  evolution, including the implication that natural selection may be  acting quite frequently.%%%       To learn if these findings represent a general aspect of  molecular evolution, this study will look for evidence of genetic  hitchhiking in the house mouse, Mus domesticus.  This will be  achieved by comparing levels of DNA sequence variation among four  important genes on the X-chromosome:  two with high recombination  rates (Pip and Amg), and two with lower recombination rates (Hprt  and G6pd).  If genetic hitchhiking is common, then the two genes  with a high recombination rate should show a greater amount of DNA  sequence variability than the two genes with a low recombination  rate.  Three of these four genes in mice serve as important models  for human genetic diseases (Hprt:  Lesch-Nyhan syndrome; G6pd:  hemolytic anemia: Plp: P elizaeus-Merzbacher disease).",
