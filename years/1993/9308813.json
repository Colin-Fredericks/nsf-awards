 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT --CTS 9308813  Viljoen   The interdisciplinary problem of thermal stress in a chemical reacting system is addressed.  Examples of these phenomena are found in the failure of catalyst supports in packed bed reactors operating in the ignited state, reactions on metal gauzes, catalytic converters, and porous radiant burners (PRB).  The systematic analysis of these problems will enable us to design more durable supports, extend the life of converters and expensive gauze material (e.g., Pt) and expand the application of PRB's to transient and frequent shut-down-start-up operations.  Both a theoretical and experimental study of the problem is proposed.  The experimental program will be developed around ceramic samples with piezo-electric fibers embedded inside the matrix.  These samples of various forms and dimensions, will be exposed to a combustion environment.  Direct measurements of the stress will be made and results will be correlated with theoretical results.  The development of such an in-situ stress measurement technique for ceramic structures could also find important applications in other ceramic structures exposed to high stress/temperature environments.",
