 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sandra Greer is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                   and Computational Chemistry Program to continue her research                    involving structure, thermodynamics, kinetics and dynamics of                   organic molecules undergoing equilibrium polymerization.  In                    equilibrium polymerization, the monomers begin to polymerize as                 the temperature is lowered through the polymerization                           temperature and then grow in length as the temperature is                       lowered further.  If the temperature is raised, the polymers                    shorten and eventually revert to monomers on passing back                       through the polymerization temperature.  Systems undergoing                     equilibrium polymerization are referred to as \"living                           polymers\".  Microscopic studies will employ neutron scattering                  as well as light scattering to investigate the structure of                     solutions and the motion of polymer molecules in them.                          Macroscopic studies will include characterization of                            thermodynamic properties such as density, heat capacity, phase                  diagrams as well as transport properties such as viscosity and                  stress relaxation.                                                              %%%                                                                             Equilibrium polymerization is a major avenue for the synthesis                  of novel polymers with unique material properties.  These                       systems also provide a wonderful means for studying the                         microscopic structure of polymer solutions as a function of                     polymer molecular weight since the polymer size can be                          regulated by adjusting the temperature.  Dr. Greer's research                   will provide significant insights into the molecular level                      explanation for the dynamics and thermodynamics of living                       polymer systems.",
