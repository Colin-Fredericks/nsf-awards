 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trigonometric parallaxes of nearby stars are fewer in number and                lower in precision than is generally perceived.  Most parallax                  determinations are more than twenty years old and thus have errors              much larger than those possible in recent years, even with                      conventional equipment.  This program has made use of this increase             in precision in obtaining parallaxes and proper motions since 1967.             It is one of the two most extensive such programs now active.  It               would continue to enrich the number of high-precision parallaxes                and photometry of stars of the lower main sequence, as well as                  subdwarf type stars.  These stars are among the oldest in our                   Galaxy, and their parallaxes and distances are not now well known.              It is expected that the program will calibrate the distance scale               of these old stars with much greater precision than is now                      available.  Photometry and possibly radial velocities are acquired              as necessary.  It is also intended that students will be trained                in all aspects of the program.",
