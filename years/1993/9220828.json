 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Dibble and his                    colleagues will conduct three seasons of archaeological                         excavation and analysis at the site of Cagny-l'Epinette which is                located in the Somme Valley of northern France. They will                       collaborate with Professor Alain Tuffreau and his team who have                 worked at this site for several years. Excavation to date                       indicates multiple archaeological levels, the lowest of which is                the focus of this project. It contains materials from the                       Acheulian culture as well as associated faunal remains.                         Geological evidence indicates it dates to more than 700,000 years               ago and the distribution of materials and the nature of the                     matrix within which they are contained suggest it may represent a               living floor. Dr. Dibble and team will attempt to determine                     whether this, in fact, is correct. In the course of their                       excavation, they will apply a number of techniques which have                   never been used before in tandem in the excavation of such a                    site. All artifact orientations and distributions will be noted;                a concerted effort will be made to recover very small remains;                  lithic artifacts and bone will be refit; fauna will be studied                  from a taphonomic perspective and sediment magnetic measurements                will be made. On this basis the investigators hope to determine                 the extent of post depositional disturbance. The archaeological                 meaning of the materials can then be addressed.                                                                                                                 This research is important for three reasons. The Acheulian                     peoples were among the first to move from Africa to the more                    temperate regions of the Old World. While many Acheulian sites                  are known, very few contain in situ material which permit                       cultural interpretation. From this perspective Cagny-l'Epinette                 may be an exception which provides information on early human                   subsistence and social organization. Secondly, the research is                  important for methodological reasons. When archaeologists                       excavate surfaces such as this it is extremely difficult to                     disentangle the \"cultural\" and \"natural\" forces which played a                  role in their formation. Dr. Dibble's work will help to develop                 techniques, applicable in a wide range of sites, which may make                 this possible. Finally, this project includes a number of                       students and will assist in the training of these young                         scientists.",
