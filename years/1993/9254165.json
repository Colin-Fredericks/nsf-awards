 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematics Improvement Project (MIP) represents a                          concentrated effort to increase the numbers of underrepresented                 students majoring in science, mathematics, or engineering at                    the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) by focusing on                    their successful completion of College Algebra and Pre-                         calculus.  The project is incorporating programmatic structures                 that facilitate faculty training, curricular design, and                        implementation of pedagogical practices designed to both meet                   the special needs of underrepresented students and to promote                   critical thinking and mastery of mathematical concepts.  Four                   faculty within the Division of Mathematics, Computer Science,                   and Statistics (MCSS) at UTSA are working as MIP faculty and                    are designing and implementing a culture-sensitive learning                     environment as well as a non-traditional instructional                          curriculum to insure that students are prepared to work in the                  global community in the 21st century.  Although the program is                  open to all students, underrepresented students enrolling in                    College Algebra and Pre-calculus are being targeted.  Through                   collaboration with the university's Student Services offices                    and by formalizing ties with local schools and community                        colleges, this program is implementing an effective system of                   recruitment, retention, and successful completion of the MIP                    mathematics sequence for underrepresented students.  MIP's                      pipeline is generating a new momentum which allows students to                  build confidence and to achieve an incremental gain in skills                   powerful enough to ensure success in future mathematics                         courses.  The overall goal is to increase the rate of                           undergraduate students successfully completing the math                         sequence by at least 20%.***//",
