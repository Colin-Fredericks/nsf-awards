 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312136  Silevitch    This award provides funding for the first year of a three-year  continuing award under the \"Self-Sufficient Partnership for  Research\" Program and to support an evaluator at Northeastern  University's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Electromagnetics Research.  The Center has demonstrated successful  research support from industrial members and has met the review  criteria of I/UCRC Program.      Funding is also provided to support an evaluator at the Center to  continue the evaluation responsibility on the monitoring of the  industry/university interaction within the Center.      Additional Funding is provided by the U.S. Army Natick RD&E Center  to augment a membership in the Center and to support ongoing  research.  Funding is also provided by Rome Laboratory to obtain a  membership in the Center and to examine the electromagnetic  dynamics of high temperature superconductors in the microwave and  millimeter wave frequency ranges.      The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste  Management Office has provided funding to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center.  Additional funding is provided for a  woman undergraduate student to aid the Center in its's ongoing  research activities.        The Program Manager recommends Northeastern University be awarded  $58,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award;   $63,672 for one year with funds provided by Rome Laboratory;   $25,000 for one year with funds provided by the U.S. Army Natick  RD&E; $10,000 for one year with funds provided by the Department of  Energy; and $5,000 for one year with funds provided by the Women,  Minorities, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which the  university-industry intera ction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
