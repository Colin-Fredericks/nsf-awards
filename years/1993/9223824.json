 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this investigation is to develop a better                 understanding of the domestic and international conditions under                which state leaders: 1) decide to come to the defense of other                  states that face security threats (why they adopt policies of                   extended deterrence), and once extended deterrent policies are in               place, b) when will adversaries challenge the security commitments              of such states.  The researcher will test two alternative                       theoretical models of state behavior against the historical                     evidence of Great Power extended deterrence cases over the past 170             years to determine what conditions have had a consistent and strong             effect on the decisions of state leaders.                                                                                                                       The first model will test hypotheses which posit that foreign                   policy decisions are driven largely by assessments of geo-strategic             interests and relative military power.  In contrast, the second                 model proposes that foreign policy decisions are driven                         fundamentally by domestic political and economic concerns and, as               a result, national security policy cannot be separated from the                 goal of political leaders to secure and strengthen their position               of domestic political power and authority.                                                                                                                      The hypotheses from each model will be tested by statistical                    analysis and the results will address a number of more specific                 questions which are of both scholarly and policy importance, such               as:  a) when are states likely to form alliances?; b) when are                  adversaries likely to question the extended deterrent value of an               alliance?; c) when will alliance partners honor their deterrent                 commitments?; and, d) under what conditions can we expect domestic              political concerns to shape national security policy in fundamental             ways?",
