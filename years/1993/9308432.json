 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308432  Bean       Through support by NSF and several companies, the researchers  have developed, over the past year, two powerful genetic-based  codes for solving jobshop scheduling problems and bounded variable  integer programs.  In a matter of minutes one can solve problems  such as 400 job, eight machine, total tardiness scheduling  problems, or 5000 variable multiple-choice integer programs to  within two to three percent of the best known solutions.  The codes  are currently in research prototype form.  The researchers will  refine and document the codes during the summer of 1993 so that  they can be deployed in three manners:  given to students in the  courses IOE 472 (Introduction to Operations Research,  undergraduate), IOE 5443 ( Scheduling, master's) and IOE 614  (Integer Programming, Ph.D.) ; give them to representatives of  MasPar Computer and General Motors who will use them on current  manufacturing projects; and place them on an ftp bulletin board set  up by the genetic algorithm community.",
