In so doing, it will document the severe reduction in plant diversity in the Philippines since the beginning of this century    less the 6% (2300 sq. miles) of the original forests remain.  The project, originally based at the Bishop Museum in Hawaii, was recently transferred to the Botanical Research Institute of Texas and closely involves the Philippine National Herbarium, where the voucher collections of the survey are being housed and databased. The results of the project will enable investigators to identify similar trends in other tropical areas such as irreversible soil changes, loss of forest dependent species and cyclical changes in temperature and humidity.  Knowledge of these trends will aid in conservation efforts in the Philippines, where it has developed social, economic, cultural and political partnerships.  In addition to completing the survey of the entire country, teams of investigators will sample permanent plots to estimate the thoroughness of the survey methodology. %%% Since the beginning of this century, the Philippines has lost over 94% of its original forests to human activity.  This study will complete a long term survey of the remaining plants of the Philippines.  Its results will enable conservation efforts in the Philippines which the project has already aided through its social, economic, cultural and political partnerships.  One of the essential partners in this project is the Philippine National Herbarium, where the voucher collections of the survey are being housed and databased. ***",
