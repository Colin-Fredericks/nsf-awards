These fragments will be used as  starting materials in producing a low-density physical map  of each chromosome without gaps.  The major advantage of  this method is that it will allow for the cleavage and  recovery of much larger DNA molecules than can be achieved  by the three previously published methods.    Four novel cleavage-specific plasmids have been designed and  two have been constructed for this research.  These plasmids  will be used to transform Oryza sativa (rice), followed by  regeneration of the resulting transgenic plants.  Quantitative slot-blot hybridization and genomic blot  analysis will be carried out to determine the copy number of  the integrated copy of the cleavage-specific plasmid in each  transgenic plant.  A collection of over 100 transgenic  plants will be obtained and characterized, each with several  copies of the cleavage-specific plasmids integrated in a  different chromosome.  Next, the chromosomal DNA from  different transgenic plants will be specifically cleaved  using a novel enzyme-based strategy, followed by  fractionation of the DNA using pulsed field gel  electrophoresis and hybridization analysis.  The final  result of this proposed research is to produce a contiguous,  low-density physical map, with between 2 to 7 megabases (mb)  in between two markers, of at least 8 out of the 12  chromosomes in rice.  ***",
