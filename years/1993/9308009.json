These problems are motivated by specific applications in science  and engineering. The principal applications appear in the area of  laser instabilities and in mathematical biology. The laser  problems concentrate on oscillatory responses typical to class B  lasers. The project develops new asymptotic methods to describe  time-periodic solutions and their bifurcations. The biological  problems concentrate on (1) the bursting oscillations observed in  chemical and biochemical systems and (2) the conditions for  propagation failure in a system of weakly coupled cells.       Many lasers are unstable devices that exhibit a pulsating  response.  These lasers include practical lasers such as  semiconductor or solid state lasers. In order to control these  instabilities, the investigator analyzes mathematically specific  laser models. Propagation failure (voltage or conduction block)  is a known problem in nerve conduction that has important medical  consequences. Most studies on the mechanisms leading to failure  have been numerical simulations. The investigator analyzes these  models in detail to obtain simple conditions for failure.  ***",
