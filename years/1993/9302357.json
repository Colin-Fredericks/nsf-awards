 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental studies of the radiative and non-radiative defects in               epitaxial indium phosphide and its alloys with aluminum and                     gallium will be undertaken.  Defects and their properties                       resulting from deliberate doping of the alloys will be                          investigated; specific defect phenomena to be studied include:                  1)formation and stability of deep level native defects by                       self-compensation, 2)formation of deep donor levels associated                  with simple substitutional impurities, and 3)isoelectronic,                     rare-earth centers and their complexes.  Indium phosphide alloy                 thin films and heterostructures will be prepared by metalorganic                vapor phase epitaxy.  Photoluminescence, photoconductivity and                  deep level transient spectroscopy will be used to determine                     defect parameters and defect stability. To determine the symmetry               and identification of the radiative and non-radiative deep level                defects polarized excitation spectroscopy will be used and the                  results compared to other symmetry sensitive measurements.  The                 applicability of recent theories on native defect stability in                  these alloys will be examined.  Recent theories on the electronic               and optical properties of rare-earth impurities and their                       complexes will be examined with respect to experimental results.                %%%                                                                             Research will be conducted on the factors that influence the                    electronic and optical properties of compound semiconductor                     materials.  This research is expected to give a fundamental                     understanding of the effect of defects on material properties and               performance.  The semiconductors under study have wide                          applicability in electronic and optoelectronic devices;                         understanding the defect structure will also improve the                        performance of devices made from these materials.  New photonic                 materials and devices may result from these studies as well as                  significant improvements in devices and integrated circuits                     currently used in computing, information processing, and                        telecommunications.",
