 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Mark W. Meisel of the                             Microkelvin Research Laboratory at the University of Florida                    to collaborate in low temperature physics and cryogenic                         engineering research with Professor Georgio Frossati and                        others of the Ultralow Temperature Group at the Kamerlingh                      Onnes Laboratorium of the University of Leiden, Netherlands.                    The proposed research in physics will focus on several                          difficult problems associated with the study of phase                           boundaries and polarization in superfluid Helium-3 and                          highly polarized forms of normal liquid and superfluid                          helium-3.  Their efforts in cryogenic engineering will                          address the problems of achieving ultralow temperature in                       continuous and pulsed ultra-high magnetic fields and on the                     design of heat exchangers which are tuned to cool pure                          Helium-3/Helium-4 mixtures to heretofore unattainable low                       temperatures.                                                                                                                                                   The field of experimental ultralow temperature physics, by                      its nature, requires careful attention and innovative                           thought in both physics and cryogenic engineering.                              The proposed international collaboration links two leading                      ultra-low temperature research groups which are interested                      in pursuing both the science and the technology necessary to                    attack fundamental problems in this field.  Together, they                      will be in an even stronger position to design new                              approaches to questions that require novel techniques to                        advance the state-of-the-art.",
