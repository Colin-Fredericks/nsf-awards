 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311343  Narayan    Diamond, diamondlike and titanium nitrade films have extremely  desirable chemical, electrical and mechanical properties for a  variety of applications ranging from corrosion and erosion  resistant coatings to electronic packaging of microelectronic  devices.  However, many of these applications are limited by  poor adhesion of these films with metal and polymer substrates.   The adhesion of a film is determined primarily by internal  stresses in the film, thermal and lattice mismatch, and most  importantly by interfacial bonding.  Techniques are required to  deposit these films, and methods based upon selective laser and  ion beam irradiation of interfacial regions to improve adhesion  between polymer, diamond and diamond like films and the  substrate.  The proposed research addresses interfacial  processing and adhesion phenomena in the following systems of  technological importance:  diamondlike, titanium nitrade and  diamond films on copper, tungston, titanium, titanium nitride,  and polymer substrates.  The adhesion of the polymer to the  metal substrate can be improved through the silane adhesion  promoters, but the adhesion of metal to the polymer substate  must rely on interfacial processing.  For polymer substrates, a  very thin buffer layer of titanium will be used to improve  adhesion between diamondlike and polymer substrates.  The  affinity between C (diamond) and the underlying substrates  varies  from zero for copper to a very high degree for titanium  and tungston.  The proposed research emphasizes:  a) interfacial  processing to improve adhesion; b) interface characterization,  properties of thin films and adhesion measurement, and c)  modeling to evaluate interfacial stresses and strains and  toughness and to understand the adhesion and interfacial bonding  mechanisms.  The structure and chemical composition of the  interfaces will be studied as a function of laser, ion beam, and  substrate parameters.  Modeling of stresses and strains within  the film and t he interfaces will be carried out and the results  correlated with adhesion measurements of these films.",
