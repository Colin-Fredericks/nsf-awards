 "awd_abstract_narration": "Societies in many developed nations are exhibiting strong                       preferences, through domestic legislation and international                     conventions, for the protection of marine mammals and endangered                marine species.  The effectiveness of these policies is unclear                 given that other parts of the world, notably the developing                     countries and Japan, have quite different valuations for these                  global environmental resources relative to income.  The                         consequences of effective protection policies are also not well                 understood.  Policies that protect these species at the expense                 of considerable restrictions on the commercial harvest of fish                  have secondary implications.  Substitution to terrestrial-based                 protein sources can have severe environmental effects.                          Additionally, many developing countries rely heavily on fish for                protein and foreign exchange.  Restrictions in their harvests                   could have serious welfare implications for poor coastal nations.                                                                                               This project has two objectives.  The first is a qualitative                    assessment of the effectiveness of U. S. and international                      policies regarding marine mammals and endangered marine species                 that ultimately restrict commercial fishing for other non                       threatened species, with the objective of determining the impact                both on the protected species and on commercial harvests.  The                  second is a quantitative analysis of consumption and                            international trade in commercial fishery products potentially                  affected by the above policies, and their interrelation with                    consumption and trade in substitute protein sources.  The purpose               of this analysis is to determine the magnitude of the secondary                 effects on the environment and the welfare of poor coastal                      nations.",
