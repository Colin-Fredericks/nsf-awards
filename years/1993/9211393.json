 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many divergent forms of locomotor styles exist among the tetrapod               (four-footed) groups of vertebrates. The design of an avian wing                represents a balance between selective pressures driving the                    energetic efficiency of this rapidly oscillating forelimb and those             retaining maneuverability for flight. This highly sophisticated                 structure provides aerodynamic lift, propulsion, and some degree                of directional control during aerial locomotion. In this award, Dr.             Kenneth Dial will study neuromuscular coordination by determining               the activity patterns of selected avain flight muscles during                   maneuverable free-flight and during prolonged steady-state (wind                tunnel) flight. In addition, recordings will be made of the                     magnitude and time course of forces generated by the primary flight             muscles during steady-state and maneuverable flight. From these                 measurements, the bilateral symmetry of forces developed by the                 primary flight muscles can be determined, and the mechanical power              output during various modes of locomotion can be calculated. These              studies will contribute basic knowledge to understanding the                    control of movement.",
