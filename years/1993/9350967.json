 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science and Linguistics departments at Stony Brook                 have been drawn together by a common situation. At present,                     both departments are pursuing undergraduate science and                         mathematics projects that involve the creation and development                  of innovative educational software and curricula.The project                    emphasizes the experimental nature of computer science and                      linguistics. It builds on the software developed by the PIs                     Combinatorica, developed by Steven Skiena, has become the most                  widely used combinatorial computing environment for research                    and education. The system is implemented in Mathematica, and                    comprises over 230 functions for combinatorics and graph                        theory. In 1991, Combinatorica received an EDUCOM Higher                        Education Software Award for Distinguished Mathematics                          Software, and has been used at over 200 educational                             institutions around the world. Semantica is an interactive                      workbook for linguistic semantics currently under development                   by Richard K. Larson (Dept. of Linguistics) and David S. Warren                 (Dept. of Computer Science), through a three-year grant from                    the National Science Foundation's Course and Curriculum                         Development program. Based on a Prolog computing engine, and                    with extensive visual and natural language support, Semantica                   will form the basis of an undergraduate course in linguistic                    semantics.Exposing students to a tool like Combinatorica                        encourages viewing computer science as an experimental                          discipline. By observing phenomenon, such as combinatorial                      explosion, that \u0131students! ... hear discussed in class, they                    will gain a deeper appreciation for how the theory arises from                  practice.  Using Syntactica, students will be able to directly                  create, observe and experiment with the formal rules governing                  well-formedness of linguistic expressions. The interactive,                     hands-on manipulation of rule systems will strongly reinforce                   the experimental nature of the linguistics enterprise, and the                  scientific chanracter of its results.",
