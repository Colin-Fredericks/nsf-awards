 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to revise our introductory statistics                 courses in order to teach them as laboratory science courses                    emphasizing interactive computer graphics and real data. Some                   sections will focus on the sciences, some on economics, and                     some on sociology and political science.The major purchases                     will be: new statistical software; seventeen 486, 50MHz PCs                     with high quality graphics for running the new software; and a                  large disk to link to an existing file server for holding many                  data sets and student work on a wide variety of topics. The                     purchases will equip a statistics laboratory in new space                       provided by the construction this year of a building for                        computing, mathematics, and statistics.Inexpensive, powerful                    personal computers now make it possible to bring into the                       undergraduate lab iterative methods for describing data,                        resampling methods for inference, improved methods for testing                  fit of models, and color graphics to enhance intuitive                          understanding and pattern recognition. The large disk will be                   tied to a file server now on hand and networked to the                          student's computers, giving students access to a data library                   and software, and linking them throughout this campus and                       campuses nationwide.This project will establish an interactive                  learning environment where students will work in groups to pose                 questions, analyze data, discuss and especially to write about                  their conjectures, observations, and conclusions. Using real                    data will provide the excitement of discovery, will connect                     statistics to their real-life experience and other courses, and                 will demonstrate the usefulness and power of data analysis.",
