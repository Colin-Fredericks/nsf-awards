 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317931  Martin  New Federal minimum design standards for Municipal Solid Waste  Landfill Facilities (MSWLF) take effect on October 9, 1993.  These standards, as specified in the EPA (Environmental  Protection Agency) criteria for municipal solid waste landfills,  include minimum design standards for seismic resistance.  Little  information on the dynamic material properties of municipal solid  waste containment systems, or on the performance of solid waste  landfills subjected to earthquake loading, is available to the  engineer wishing to evaluate the seismic response of Municipal  Solid Waste Landfill Facilities.  Furthermore, little guidance is  available for establishing seismic performance criteria for solid  waste containment facilities.    The new Federal Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Facilities design  standards, know as Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and  Recovery Act, impact the seismic design of landfills in two ways.  First, the standards require that landfills be designed for a  horizontal peak ground acceleration in lithified rock with a  probability of exceedance of 10 percent in 250 years.  This  provision results in design accelerations in excess of 0.6g in  parts of California and 0.2g in many areas of the United States,  including large areas on the East Coast and in the Central United  States.  Second, the standards require that landfills be lined at  the base with a composite liner that includes a geomembrane and a  2 foot thick layer of soil with a permeability of less that 10-7  centimeters per second.  This provision virtually guarantees a  low shear strength at the bottom of the landfill.  This  combination of a high seismic excitation and a low shear  resistance at the base of the landfill make consideration of  seismic response an important facet of landfill design in many  areas of the Western, Central and Eastern United States.    A workshop is being held at the Southern California Earthquake  Center in Los Angeles to examine the impact of these new Federa l  regulations.  The primary results of the workshop will be  identification and prioritization of research needed to improve  seismic analyses and design of solid waste landfills.  The  results of the workshop are expected to significantly increase  the existing knowledge base on seismic design and performance of  landfills through the exchange of information and interaction  between workshop participants.  The proceedings of the workshop  will provide a succinct summary of the state of the art, the  state of practice, and the research needs.    ***",
