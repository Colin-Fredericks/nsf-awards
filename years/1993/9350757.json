 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is purchasing high performance (486DX) desk-top                    computing systems and printers, including one for color                         reproduction, in order to enhance a microcomputer-based                         laboratory program.  The students are being involved in (a)                     using new digital multimeter interface units and software                       currently under development by IBM in collaboration with one of                 the faculty members, and (b) 3-D molecular modeling for                         visualization and computation. The equipment is being used in                   courses for majors at the freshman, sophomore, junior and                       senior level as well as by non-majors in a liberal arts course                  in physical science.  Students are performing precision                         electrochemical experiments using the interface devices. These                  allow direct measurement of current and/or voltage as a                         function of time or of keyboard input permitting the study of                   numerous chemical reactions and physical quantities. Data                       analysis and transformation using a full set of mathematical                    tools as well as graphical output to screen or printer also is                  being done. The molecular modeling software is introducing                      students to an important new tool for the chemist. They are                     learning to display and manipulate 3-D molecular structures, to                 extract geometric or electronic properties and to perform                       calculations once reserved for high-end computer facilities.",
