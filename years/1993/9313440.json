The College will renovate the  structure, installing: a new heating, ventilating, and  cooling system; new laboratory spaces for faculty research;  new research training facilities for the undergraduate  curriculum; facilities for computer graphics and other  computer-intensive activities; and building features that  provide access by persons with disabilities.       The renovation of Severance Hall will have a  significant impact on the quantity and quality of research  and research training that takes place in the Chemistry  Department. The department's faculty members have an active  program of research, and the building renovation will remove  several obstacles to greater research productivity. State-of-  the-art instrumentation will now have appropriate  environments, and experiments that could not be performed  previously will be possible in the renovated laboratory  spaces. The research training that is integral to the  undergraduate curriculum will be expanded and modernized as  a result of this renovation. Giving undergraduates access to  research environments and experiences such as these will  attract a greater number of students to careers in  chemistry.  ***",
