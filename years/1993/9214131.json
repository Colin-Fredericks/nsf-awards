 "awd_abstract_narration": "9214131  Holton  This award provides modest support to enable Professor Raymond  Holton of the University of Tennessee to collaborate in marine  botany research with Professor Wytze T. Stam of the Department of  Marine Biology of the University of Groningen, The Netherlands.   Their cooperative research will begin at the University of Tennessee  with culturing of several strains of the microscopic marine alga,  Phaeocystis, which were collected from different geographical  regions.  Dr. Holton will carry out several biochemical analyses on  the alga, including pigment and fatty acid composition, and will  observe the anatomical features via electron microscopy.  He will  then visit the University of Groningen to work for several months  with Dr. Stam and others to sequence the ribosomal DNA genes in  order to evaluate the genetic similarity among the strains.  The  Dutch group is one of the few in the world that has applied these  new molecular biological techniques of ribosomal DNA sequencing to  algae, so their experience is invaluable to the joint research.    Phaeocystis is a cosmopolitan microscopic flagellated marine  phytoplanktonic alga which also has a colonial stage.  It is  important in causing blooms in polar seas but also in producing sea  foam which is a nuisance to fishing and oil industries and fouls the  beaches of the North Sea.  Various strains or species have been  isolated from different parts of the world, but because of its  extremely small size and uncertainties about its life cycle, it is  not known how closely related these isolates are.  The proposed  collaborative research will contribute new knowledge concerning the  genetic relationships and basic biochemistry of strains from several  different geographical regions.  It may also provide a basis for  predicting the ecological \"behavior\" of the various strains and,  ultimately, ameliorating some undesirable local impacts.  ***",
