 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this grant is for continued support for research                 on the nature and implications of establishment-level employment                and wage dynamics.  The various components of this project rely                 heavily on the use of the Longitudinal Research Database as a                   rich source of establishment-level data for U.S. manufacturing                  industries.  Three lines of research are pursued in this project.               The first uses quarterly and annual time series data, that the                  investigators have constructed on gross job creation and                        destruction, to investigate the driving forces behind business                  cycles.  The second line of research involves the development and               analysis of public domain time series data on gross investment                  flows, by detailed sector and plant characteristic.  The third                  involves the development of theories to investigate the positive                and welfare implications of the connection between job creation                 and destruction and the business cycle.  This research is                       important because it will enhance our understanding of wage and                 employment changes at the level of the firm, and it will also                   provide new insights as to how these changes affect and are                     affected by the business cycle.",
