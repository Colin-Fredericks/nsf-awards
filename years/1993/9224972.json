 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed research is to study the effect of               ionic groups on the structure and dynamics of perfluorinated                    ionomer membranes, ionomer solutions and ionomer blends.  The                   following experiments are planned.  FIRST, they will study the                  dynamics of the polymer chains and counter ions in membranes                    swollen by, and dissolved in, polar solvents.  The possibility of               a structural change in the transition between membranes and                     solutions will be deduced from studies as a function of ionomer                 concentration.  The experimental studies will be complemented by                theoretical modeling of the chain dynamics.  SECOND, they will                  assess to what extend reverse micellar systems based on protonated              and fluorinated surfactants can be used as model compounds for the              more complex perfluorinated ionomers.  THIRD, they                              propose to study segmental dynamics and phase structure in ionomer              blends, where specific interactions are expected to improve the                 miscibility of the blend components.  We propose to start with                  blends of polyacrylic acid and random and block styreneacrylic acid             copolymers with poly(ethylene oxide) and with poly(vinyl                        pyrrolidone).  The effect of gradual neutralization of the acid                 groups with various counter ions will be investigated.  FOURTH, we              plan to develop electron-spin-resonance (ESR) imaging as a non-                 destructive method for the study of diffusion processes in real                 time in ionomers and other complex polymeric systems, in two and                three dimensions.  We propose to use ESR (including                             multifrequency ESR, double resonance and imaging) methods for                   observing the paramagnetic counter ions and deuteriated reporter                molecules, 19F NMR to observe the perfluorinated chains, 2H NMR to              visualize the dynamics of deuteriated solvents and DSC to correlate             the macroscopic properties with the local information obtained from             the spectroscopic measurements.                                                                                                                                 Ionomers are amphiphilic polymers that contain up to 10 mole                    percent of ionic groups.  Incorporation of ionic groups in organic              polymers is an important method for modifying polymer properties.               The presence of these groups causes dramatic changes in the elastic             modulus, glass transition temperature Tg and in the permeability of             various guests in the polymers, compared to the analogous polymer               chains without ions.  Most of these changes have been attributed to             the formation of a phase-separated morphology in ionomers,                      consisting of ionic domains where the charges are concentrated, and             nonpolar domains that include mainly the organic backbone.  This                research aims to elucidate the membranes' structure.",
