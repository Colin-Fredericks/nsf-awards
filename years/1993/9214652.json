The Texas                  meeting is known as the major international meeting on topics of                relativistic astrophysics, including the physics of compact                     objects, cosmic rays, active galactic nuclei and cosmology and is               held in alternate years.  The PASCOS meeting is international in                scope and unique in its interdisciplinary coverage of topics in                 cosmology, string theory and particle physics.  Combining the two               meetings allows us to provide a thorough exploration of the                     interface between astrophysics and particle physics, involving a                large audience of theorists and experimenters who work in                       interdisciplinary areas.  Research in these fields is sponsored by              NSF, NASA and DOE.  Funding is requested to support this                        interdisciplinary conference.",
