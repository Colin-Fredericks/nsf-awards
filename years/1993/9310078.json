 "awd_abstract_narration": "Excitation-contraction coupling (E-C coupling) is a fundamental                 mechanism responsible for the initiation and control of force in                striated muscle.  The current hypothesis is that 2 calcium channels             are required in this process.  1) Voltage-gated calcium channels,               dihydropyridine receptors (DHP-Rs) at T-tubule membranes that act               as voltage sensors, and 2) 565-kDa junctional foot proteins (JFPs)              or ryanodine receptors that act as calcium release channels on the              sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).  Despite intense work on E-C coupling              and SR calcium release, the molecular mechanism(s) linking DHP-Rs               to JFPs remain unknown.  This laboratory has accumulated evidence               on a low molecular weight calcium release channel protein in SR                 that has been overlooked and may provide a key component of E-C                 coupling.  This channel has been studied by a combination of                    biophysical, biochemical, and immunological techniques and has been             named the \"sulfhydryl-gated 106-Kda calcium release channel\" (SG-               106).  This goal of this research is to obtain cDNA clones                      corresponding to the 106-Kda release channel protein, sequence the              complete CDNA and determine the relationship to other, previously               characterized channel proteins.  Mouse monoclonal and chicken                   polyclonal antibodies will be raised against the 106-Kda protein                isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle.  Antibodies will be selected              for their reaction with the 106-Kda on Western blots and will be                used to isolate pure 106-Kda and screen cDNA libraries from rabbit              white skeletal muscle.  The immuno-purified 106-kDa protein will be             cleaved and the fragments used to obtain partial amino acid                     sequences.  This study will establish whether the 106-kDa protein               is a new protein or a fragment of JFPs.  Reconstitution of the 106-             kDa protein in planar bilayers exhibits the single channel                      properties of native calcium release channels and thus this protein             will be of great interest whether or not it is a fragment of the                JFP because it would be readily expressed to study structure-                   function relationships.                                                         %%%                                                                             Excitation-contraction coupling is a fundamental mechanism                      responsible for the initiation and control of force in striated                 muscle.  The current hypothesis is that two calcium channels are                required for calcium release from an intracellular store in this                process. Despite intense work on excitation-contraction coupling                the molecular mechanism(s) linking the two calcium channels and how             they trigger calcium release remain unknown.  This laboratory has               obtained evidence that a low molecular weight calcium release                   channel may also be involved in excitation-contraction coupling.                This that has been overlooked by others may provide a key component             of the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism.  The goal of this             research is to isolate and determine the sequence of the gene for               this protein.  This will provide critical information about its                 structure and possible relationships to other, known channel                    proteins and will contribute to understanding of its possible role              in excitation-contraction coupling.",
