A two-week summer workshop                 in the well-equipped laboratories and computer facilities of                    the Department of Biological Sciences will provide hands-on                     experiences in molecular biotechniques including recombinant                    DNA technology, protein purification, vector construction, cDNA                 and genomic library construction for college faculty from                       regional two- and four-year colleges. The Workshop is designed                  to allow the transfer of molecular technology from the workshop                 laboratories to the participants' home institutions. A faculty                  enhancement seminar series aimed at the professional                            development of participating college faculty will continue                      throughout the post-workshop year.",
