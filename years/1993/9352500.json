 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will demonstrate the feasibility of a Chemical                     Engineering Simulation Laboratory (CESL) as a tool for                          instruction of chemical engineering concepts. The CESL is                       designed to instill an intuitive feel for the operation of                      chemical processing equipment, an understanding that is                         ordinarily obtained by chemical engineers only after several                    years of on-the-job experience. Simulation can complement                       traditional classroom and laboratory experiences by providing                   the students with realistic exposure to processes and phenomena                 that are too expensive, large, time-consuming, or dangerous to                  examine otherwise.                                                              This project will develop three \"process\" modules.  The first                   shall characerize the draining of a tank.  This simple, but                     interesting problem, will allow concentraing on the general                     problme of module development.  The other two modules will be                   selected buased upon experience with the first but will are                     expected to involve several process units (e.g., pumpts, heat                   exchangers, reators).  One will be appropriate for use in                       steaty-state operation, and the other in unsteady-state                         oepration.  In addition to these three process modules, the                     project will develop a high-level \"control\" program that                        governs the way the process modules are used.  The control                      program will allow the modules to be run in any of three modes                  (Laboratory, Steady, or Unsteady operation).  Flexibility in                    the design of the control program will allow for the                            incorporation of additional modules in the future.                              The seven faculty co-investigators will work closely with                       industrial consultants, student assistants, the computer                        vendor, and graphics programming experts to develop the                         simulation modules.  The modules will be introduced into two                    undergraduate courses (Unit Operations in the fall and Kinetics                 in the spring).  Assessment will be made of pedagogic impact of                 the modules via parallel control groups to compare quantitative                 metrics and exit interviews to capture student impressions.                     Plans are in place disseminate the present the project results                  at annual meetings of the AIChE and ASEE.  The developed                        software and documentation will be distributed to chemical                      engineering departments across the nation via an ftp server on                  the Internet.",
