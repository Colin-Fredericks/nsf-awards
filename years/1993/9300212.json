 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300212  Pollock  To exploit the fine-grain parallelism in pipelined, superscalar,  and superpipelined machines, various strategies for carefully  scheduling instructions at compile time must be developed.  Until  recently, instruction scheduling and register allocation were  treated separately.  Conflicts in ordering these two phases  reduced the efficiency of the final generated code.  Although  several efforts have been made to provide communication between  instruction scheduling and register allocation, these schemes  suffer several significant drawbacks.    This research will address the following principal research  problems.  Strategies will be developed for communication between  register allocation and instruction scheduling    techniques that  schedule across basic block boundaries, in   particular, region  scheduling and software pipelining.  The impact of integrating  register  allocation of scalars and subscripted variables on  instruction scheduling will be investigated to develop  cooperative allocation/scheduling schemes.  Register allocation  and basic block  instruction  scheduling will be integrated  without sacrificing code efficiency.  The strategies developed  will be compared to other existing strategies for code generation  across various architecture configurations and program  structures.  ***",
