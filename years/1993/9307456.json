 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for partial support of the \"First                     International Forum of Particle Technology\" and a preliminary                   workshop.  The aim of the workshop and conference is to bring                   together researchers in many different specific focused topic                   areas related to powder handling in order to promote the                        emergence of particle technology as a coherent field in the                     United States.  Coordinated efforts in Europe and the Pacific                   Rim are far more advanced with a number of visible academic                     departments and research institutes.  These meetings will help                                                                                                  to stimulate similar domestic efforts or to formulate some                      appropriate response in order to match developments in the                      field.                                                                                                                                                          Powder technology significantly influences many industrial                      sectors including chemical, agricultural, food products,                        pharmaceuticals, mineral processing, advanced materials, air                    contamination and even mass communication.  As such,                            technological advances in the handling of powders have broad                    implications for the American economy and quality of life.",
