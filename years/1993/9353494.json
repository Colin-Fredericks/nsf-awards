 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, Arecibo  Observatory in Puerto Rico attracts thousands of visitors each  year, of all ages and from many countries.  Pride in the  Observatory has caused local Puerto Rican organizations to  contribute the funds necessary for the construction of the new  Arecibo Observatory Visitor and Educational Facility.  Cornell  University, in behalf of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere  Center, is requesting $774,463 form the NSF-ISE over a two  year period to develop and implement the exhibits and  educational programs which will give life to the Educational  Facility.    Within the facility, we propose establishing an educational  program centered on the theme \"More Than Meets the Eye\", which  will reflect the general idea that we can study our world with  tools which extend our direct sensory experience.  The  proposed program will explore the unseen sky and, in  particular, the objects that fall under the scrutiny of a  radio telescope.  Specifically, the program will introduce the  visitors to the electromagnetic spectrum as a means of  exploration, will offer a framework of basic astronomy and  atmospheric science, and will provide understanding of the  function and operation of the Arecibo radio telescope.  Some  of Arecibo's most exciting new discoveries in the fields of  radio astronomy, solar system radar astronomy and  astomospheric science will be presented so that visitors can  experience the dynamic nature of science.  ***",
