 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224587  Mikita  This award supports  Professor Michael Mikita of California State   University at Bakersfield to collaborate in environmental  chemistry research with Professor H.-D. Ludemann of the Institute  of Biophysics and Physical Biochemistry of the University of  Regensburg, Germany.  The goal of their research is to gain a  better understanding of how soil organic matter affects the  nitrogen cycle in soils, by studying the organic reaction  mechanisms underlying chemodenitrification.  Specifically, they  propose to study the reaction of selected humic substances and  models with Nitrogen-15 (15N) enriched reagents under conditions  expected in soils.  In addition, they will seek to improve  methods for the 15N-NMR analyses of these reaction products and  work to discover the mechanisms of these reactions.  Although  preliminary studies suggest novel insights into this complex  chemistry, further work has been limited by the NMR facilities  available to Dr. Mikita.  His German collaborator, Professor  Ludemann, is a recognized authority in this area and has a world  class laboratory with all the instrumentation necessary to carry  out the proposed research.    The natural chemistry of nitrogen in soils and air remains very  poorly understood.  Anthropogenic sources of nitrogen oxides  include the burning of carbon-based fuels and the use of  nitrogenous fertilizers, both of which have been increasing  rapidly in the past century.  In the presence of soil organic  matter, these nitrogen compounds undergo reactions (known  generally as chemodenitrification) that release gaseous forms  into the air.  Now, there is growing concern over the influence  of these nitrogen oxides on ozone depletion and global  atmospheric processes.  Through the combination of expertise,  facilities and interests brought to bear by this U.S.-German  collaboration, progress will be made in understanding soil-based  reactions of nitrogen compounds which are potentially relevant to  climate change.    ***",
