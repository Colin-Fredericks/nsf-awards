 "awd_abstract_narration": "9217648  Dias  Support is requested to purchase a Mass Spectrometer, to serve a group  of investigators currently conducting structure-function research in  biochemistry, molecular and cell biology. The major user group projects  include: 1) The characterization of human glycoprotein hormone  recombinant mutants being used for structure-function studies; 2)  elucidation of the active site of deoxynucleotide metabolizing enzymes;  3) characterization of mitochondrial channel proteins; 4) the  identification of substrate binding sites of P450 enzymes, 5)  structural characterization of chimeric brain glutamate decarboxylase  recombinants and identification of the ATP binding site; 6) structural  characterization of oligosaccharide structures of glycoprotein  biosynthesis and processing pathways; 7) structural characterization of  two polyglutamyl folate hydrolase forms and of the substrate hydrolysis  products; 8) structural characterization of toxicant-adducts to  neurofilament proteins. A minor users group will: 1) characterize  estrogen metabolites (conjugates) induced by dioxin; 2) determine  partial sequence and molecular ion of the major protein associated with  lupus inclusions; 3) determine the structure of as yet unidentified  brain neuropeptides; 4) map the lysine binding sites of plasmin which  bind to cell surface proteins; 5) perform structural characterization  of synthetic peptide products prepared in the WCLR core peptide  synthesis facility.    The triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer proposed for purchase  will be the centerpiece of a core facility which will service the needs  of a primary user group, but will also be available to all scientists  at the WCLR and their collaborators. The core facility will be staffed  with a mass spectrometrist who will interface between principal  investigators and the instrument, and who as director of the facility  will perform the structural analysis of peptides, proteins,  glycoproteins and oligosaccharides by tandem mass spectrometry.   Additionally, the mass spectrometrist will be charged with developing  new mass spectrometry methodologies particularly with regard to the  needs of particular research problems. The mass spectrometrist will  also be responsible for maintenance of the instrument, exclusive of the  Service contract, and will serve as a member of the Internal Advisory  Committee. The proposed mass spectrometry facility will utilize the  protein chemistry core facility resources and personnel to assist  investigators with preparing samples for mass spectrometry.",
