 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is requested to investigate the structure and function of               photosynthetic reaction centers in photosystem 1 and the closely                related green sulfur bacteria.  The project will focus on the                   role of FeS centers and quinones as transient intermediates in                  electron transfer.  Flash kinetic spectrophotometry and EPR                     spectroscopy will be used as principle analytical methods.  In                  the case of green bacteria we will reconstitute the acceptor side               with a 22 kDa FeS containing polypeptide that has been expressed                in E. coli.  Elucidation of the mechanism of inhibition of the                  quinone binding site in Photosystem 1 is important because of the               potential of using this site for a new class of herbicides.                     A new project has been initiated on Photosystem 1 following a                   molecular modeling study of the core heterodimer.  The lab has                  already tested one hypothesis generated by the modeling                         concerning the interaction of the subunit PsaC with the Fx domain               in the core heterodimer.  This will be continued together with a                direct experimental test of the role of the leucine zipper motif.               This will involve synthesis of peptides containing the motif and                studying their physical properties.  Future experiments will                    create models of Photosystem 1 by synthesizing designed proteins                that fold into 4-.-helical bundles and installing redox centers                 of relevance to Photosystem 1 in the interhelical loops.  This                  initiative will provide footholds for future studies of models                  that would contain photoactive components.                                      %%%                                                                             Photosynthesis is accomplished in plant and certain bacteria by                 the interaction of light with specialized pigment containing                    metal-protein complexes.  The components of the complex and the                 ration of metal, pigment, and protein  are to be analyzed in the                proposal by sophisticated analytical methods.  Also, the nature                 of the interaction of certain chemical compounds with the complex               is important as a model for the design of herbicides that can                   interfere with photosynthesis.",
