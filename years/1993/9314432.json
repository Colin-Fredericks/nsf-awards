Within each frame, simple models (either numerical or qualitative) simulate the key processes for the corresponding ecological state.  \"Demons\" watch to see whether the assumptions underlying the definition of the state are transgressed, and if so, switch to a different model in a  different frame.  This approach greatly facilitates the process of building dynamic ecosystem models.  It makes it possible to rapidly test hypotheses, and leads to models that are  easy to understand and therefore facilitates the communication of ideas.  It also lends itself to models which include interactions between ongoing process (such as competition and herbivory and sporadic events (such as fires) at a level of resolution that is simple enough to comprehend but sufficiently complex to give informative unanticipated results.    %%%  Ecological systems are exceedingly complex  and ecologist  have been pursuing ways to model these systems in realistic ways.  This project is a substantial  contribution to the modeling approach using newly developed computer technology that is an interdisciplinary application of methods in Artificial Intelligence.  This approach could be a powerful means of understanding important issues, such as conservation of populations and habitats or long-term dynamic patterns such as climate change, in realistic ecological contexts.           &  ( u & G(` i M     &  G(  ) i M  \"    &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        !         !         !
