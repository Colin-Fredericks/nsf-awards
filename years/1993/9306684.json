 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306684  Lieber    The relationship between local atomic structure, microstructure,  electronic states and physical properties in complex low-  dimensional solids will be investigated with an emphasis on high-  temperature copper oxide superconductors and transition metal  chalcogenide conductors.  Detailed physical measurements of the  structure, electronic states and transport properties will be made  using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and other techniques.   Measurements will be made as a function of systematic variations in  composition and processing to develop an understanding of  fundamental material properties and how these properties can be  rationally changed.  Investigations of the copper oxide  superconductors will focus on two general areas.  First, the  structural and electronic effects of metal-substitution and oxygen  doping in BiSrCaCuO single crystals will be characterized at the  atomic to nanometer scale using STM and scanning tunneling  spectroscopy (STS) and on a macroscopic scale using diffraction and  transport measurements.  These studies will provide data needed to  eleucidate the relationship between atomic structure,  microstructure, electronic states, and the observable parameters  such as Tc and the critical current density.  Secondly, the low-  energy excitations in the superconducting state of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8  single crystals will be characterized using high-resolution  electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and STS.  HREELS and STS  will be used to characterize the magnitude of the energy gap as a  function of temperature and sample Tc in oxygen doped BiSrCaCuO  single crystals.  These HREELS and STS investigations will provide  new data essential for probing the mechanism of superconductivity.   In addition, STM and STS also will be used to characterize the  local atomic structure and electronic states in metal  dichalcogenide materials.  Results from these studies will address  systematically the problem of pining and disorder in two-  dimensional mate rials.  Overall, these investigations will provide  general insights into the relationship between atomic level  properties and macroscopic phenomena, and will develop further STM  and STS for probing complex materials problems.  ***",
