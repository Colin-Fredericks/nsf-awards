 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311999  BARROW  The primary objective of this project is construction of a  definitive, multi-user data base on the personal, social, economic,  career and political attributes of U.S. Courts of Appeals judges  who served from 1891 (the inception of this level of court) through  1992.  We know the presidents of different political parties  generally have different domestic agendas, that Democratic  legislators from the South often vote differently from their  counterparts outside that region, and that mass political behavior  is related to social and economic characteristics.  We are less  informed about the extent to which these factors influence the  voting (judicial decision) tendencies of appellate judges.  Indeed,  development of integrated theories about why judges vote as they do  has been impeded by the lack of a comprehensive and reliable data  base.  This type of information has been assembled for Supreme  Court Justices, but this is the first project to extend the data  collection to the far larger number of federal appellate judges.     The project will assemble the requisite data on federal appellate  judges and then make them available to the scholarly community in  a user-friendly format.  The constructed data base will include the  following information for each judge:  appointing president,  predecessor (if there was one), religion, party affiliation,  education, date and place of birth, state of residence, age at time  of appointment, previous positions held (in temporal sequence),  gender, race, ethnicity, A.B.A. rating (since these have been  available), and the timing and reason for leaving the bench.  A  complementary data base on case characteristics and votes is being  completed; both data sets will include a unique identification  number for each judge, thereby permitting the merger of the two for  appropriate research projects.  The merged multi-user data base  will allow the scholarly community to pursue important lines of  research that heretofore were impossible.  * **",
