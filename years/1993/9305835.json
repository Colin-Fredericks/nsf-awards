 "awd_abstract_narration": "Methods of  Markov chain Monte Carlo are attracting great                       interest in many areas of Statistics.  They provide                             realizations from probability distributions known only up to                    a normalizing constant, and thus from intractable                               probability distributions of latent variables conditional                       upon observed data.  These realizations can be used to                          obtain Monte Carlo approximants too therwise intractable                        likelihood functions and posterior probability                                  distributions.  The methods permit exploration of large and                     complex hypothesis spaces of models and parameters.                             Estimation of genealogical structure from genetic data is a                     long-standing problem, recently attracting renewed interest                     with the advent of new types of data that are potentially                       much more informative. The availability and quantity of such                    data are increasing rapidly.  The estimation of genealogies                     becomes of increasing practical importance with the                             increasing necessity to evaluate detailed population                            structure in the severely numerically restricted populations                    of  highly endangered species. The major problem in a                           coherent statistical analysis of genealogical structure lies                    in the plethora of alternative genealogical hypotheses that                     could relate a set of individuals. The development of the                       use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods towards the                             inference of genealogies and the estimation of population                       structure offers a solution of this complex problem. The                        current award will support research that is both                                methodological and computational.  Markov chain Monte                           CarloMethods are very flexible;  developing an effective                        method for a particular class of problems is not routine.                       Methods will be developed and evaluated.  Software to                           implement the methods will be developed, and will be applied                    in the context of some available data sets.  This award is                      being supported by four programs:  Statistics and                               Probability, Computational Mathematics, Systematics and                         Population Biology, and Computational Biology.",
