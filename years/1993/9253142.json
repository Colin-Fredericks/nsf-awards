 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wendy Saul is an education professor at the University                      of Maryland Baltimore County campus, where she specializes                      in the use of children's literature and trade books in                          elementary science instruction.  Dr. Saul has designed a                        collaborative effort with Scholastic Press to develop a                         commercial bibliographic software package.  This                                microcomputer-based system would provide teachers and                           librarians with information on science trade books for                          children.  The software would run on Apples, IBMs, and                          Macintosh computers, and could use CD-ROM drives if                             available or could rely on floppy disk drives.  This                            computerized bibliographic resource would contain titles,                       content descriptions, annotations concerning hands-on                           activities and materials, treatment of gender and ethnic                        issues, suitability for students with physical disabilities                     or limited English proficiency, and brief reviews by                            teachers and children's literature specialists.  The                            software would also contain an auditing function that would                     record how users navigate through the database query system.                    These audit data would be used to research how children,                        teachers, and librarians approach the use of science trade                      books, and would inform the software developers in refining                     the program.                                                                                                                                                    The proposed bibliographic software system has potential for                    broad impact on the teaching and learning of science in                         elementary schools.  By increasing access to appropriate                        literature and trade books, this information resource will                      encourage teachers to use science as a way to expand reading                    and language arts instruction, and will improve the                             integration of instruction across traditionally separate                        disciplines.                                                                                                                                                    Cost sharing represents 146% of the NSF contribution.",
