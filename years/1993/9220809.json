 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computed tomography has grown from numerical analysis and                  algorithm development for planar X-ray tomography scanners to                   encompass a broad range of imaging techniques.  Impedance imaging               systems apply current to the surface of a body, measure the induced             voltages on the surface, and from this information, reconstruct an              approximation to the electrical conductivity and/or electrical                  permittivity in the interior.  Mathematically, the problem is ill-              posed and nonlinear, and a frequently used approximation reduces to             a Radon transform.  Integral geometry is the mathematical basis for             tomography and one model for impedance imaging.  The Radon                      transform on lines is the model of X-ray tomography and                         generalizations model emission tomography and problems in                       ultrasound.  Tomographers use integral geometric theorems, such as              inversion formulas and range characterizations, to create and                   improve reconstruction methods.                                                      This project will support the AMS-SIAM Summer Seminar in                   Applied Mathematics on the Mathematics of Tomography, Impedance                 Imaging, and Integral Geometry to be held June 7-18, 1993 at Mount              Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA.  One of the features of                    tomography is the strong relationship between high level                        mathematics (such as harmonic analysis, partial differential                    equations, microlocal analysis, and Lie group theory) and                       applications to medical imaging, impedance imaging, radiotherapy,               and industrial non-destructive evaluation.  The conference has the              following main goals:  (1) to give researchers in the field the                 opportunity to define and articulate the main problems of current               interest and to isolate common themes and approaches and (2) to                 strengthen the connection between the pure and applied aspects of               these areas and to facilitate dialogue between researchers in the               various areas.  Graduate students, recent doctoral recipients, and              new researchers in the field will be encouraged to attend.",
