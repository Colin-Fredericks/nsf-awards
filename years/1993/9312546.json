According to the theory, the individual is protected from anxiety               by a dual component cultural anxiety buffer, consisting of (a) a                cultural worldview, which includes one's conception of reality,                 standards of value, and hope of immortality, and (b) self-esteem,               or the belief that one is living up to the standards of value                   prescribed by the cultural worldview. From this perspective,                    one's beliefs about oneself and the world in which one lives                    serve the essential defensive function of protecting one from                   anxiety. The equanimity-providing concepts are consensually                     validated when others share our beliefs and threatened when                     others disagree with our beliefs. Because the cultural anxiety-                 buffer requires continual consensual validation for effective                   protection from anxiety, much social behavior is directed toward                the validation of its two components.                                                                                                                                Research has shown that: (a) reminding people of their                     mortality increases the positivity of their reactions to people                 and ideas that support their worldviews and the negativity of                   their reactions to people and ideas that threaten their                         worldviews, (b) high levels of self-esteem decrease both anxiety                in response to threatening stimuli and defensive distortions that               presumably function to reduce one's anxiety, and (c) threats to                 the cultural worldview increase susceptibility to anxiety in                    response to subtle reminders of one's mortality. The goals of                   this research are threefold: (1) to investigate the centrality of               death concerns to the processes posited by the theory, (2) to add               to the evidentiary base for the theory by further assessing both                the effects of mortality salience on behavior focused on                        bolstering self-esteem and the worldview and the roles of self-                 esteem and the worldview in allaying death concerns, and (3) to                 assess the role of affective responses to and awareness of                      threatening material in the production of the effects posited by                the theory. This research will increase our understanding of why                self-esteem is so important and so beneficial for the individual.",
