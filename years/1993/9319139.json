 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319139  Schmidt       It has been shown recently that nucleic acid molecules can  fold into a variety of shapes, capable of specific interaction with  small molecule or protein ligands.  This application proposes to  synthesize a complex population of RNA species from a library of  DNA templates containing approximately 10 (exp13) random sequences.   The RNAs will be selected by affinity to a column-bound RNA stem-  loop structure.  RNA species recognizing the stem-loop (\"aptamers\")  will be eluted from the column, reverse transcribed, amplified, and  re-selected to obtain a population of high affinity to the stem-  loop.  The domain (epitope) recognized by selected aptamer(s) will  be determined.  The successful completion of this research will  allow the development of an RNA-based \"immunochemistry\" capable of  recognizing homologous or analogous three-dimensional structures in  RNA, much as conventional antibodies recognize structures in other  molecules.  This would be valuable, since RNA is a poor antigen in  vivo.  %%%  RNA molecules function in part by assuming three-dimensional  structures in solution.  In an effort to develop new tools for  analyzing RNA three-dimensional structure, RNA molecules will be  selected which recognize the three-dimensional structures of other  RNAs.  Eventually, RNAs will be tested for their ability to  recognize structurally similar domains in two RNA enzymes which are  hypothesized to have similar three-dimensional (tertiary)  structures even though they do not have obvious primary sequence  similarities.  ***",
