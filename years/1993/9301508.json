 "awd_abstract_narration": "McCarthy will study various spaces of holomorphic functions                and the natural operators acting on these spaces.  He will                      investigate the existence of radial or non-tangential boundary                  values for every function in an infinite dimensional Hilbert or                 Banach holomorphic space, and the connection between this                       phenomenon and the geometry of the space.  He will also                         investigate how elements of holomorphic spaces can be decomposed                into products of special functions, analogous to the inner-outer                factoring in the classical Hardy spaces.                                             Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the               infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,               when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has                the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                   matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                  operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                    associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                      underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,               and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.",
