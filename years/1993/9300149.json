This Field Station attracts researchers from                         throughout the country who come to the station to study the                     population biology of local plants and animals. Students                        will be chosen from a national pool of applicants to spend                      ten weeks at the station during the summer. The students                        will meet together with an REU coordinator at least once a                      week to discuss general issues on the conduct of science and                    their specific projects. Students will work closely with                        mentors to design and complete independent research projects                    in areas that could include the epidemiology of plant                           parasite-host systems, the ecological genetics of plant                         pollination systems, the genetic implications of group                          living in insects, the behavioral ecology of birds, the                         analysis of local vegetation patterns, and the interactions                     between                                                                         populations that live in adjacent communities.",
