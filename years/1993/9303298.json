 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to test predictions              about the genetic structure of canvasback duck (Aythya valisineria)             and redhead duck (A. americana) populations using sequence                      variation data from the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region.               Philopatry to natal areas is strongly female-biased in migratory                waterfowl, whereas males disperse widely prior to the time they                 breed; this characteristic is unlike that of most other birds.  The             uniqueness of such a social system suggests that despite a massive              flow of nuclear genes mediated by male dispersal, mtDNA variation               may be geographically structured.  In other words, mitochondrial                DNA lineages in local or regional populations may differentiate                 because they are isolated from other maternal lineages due to                   female site-fidelity.  This work will test whether effects of                   gender-based philopatry on mtDNA gene flow are reflected in                     geographic patterns of mtDNA sequence variation.  Geographic                    structure in mtDNA variation is to be evaluated using nucleotide                sequence data from the rapidly evolving control region.  This                   technique should permit much finer resolution of genetic                        differentiation than restriction fragment analysis, the technique               used in nearly all previous avian mtDNA investigations.                         %%%                                                                             Acquiring fine-grained knowledge about the genetic structure of                 long-distance migrants will facilitate the prudent management of an             economically-important component of native North American                       biodiversity.  In addition insights gained in this research will                advance historical phylogeography (geography from a phylogenetic                perspective), a growing point in ecology and systematics.",
