 "awd_abstract_narration": "9219434  Sacks         The role of subduction and magmatism in the growth of the  continental crust and the evolution of the crust/mantle system has  long been recognized, but a detailed, process-oriented under-  standing of the subduction cycle has been elusive.  In this project  the principal investigators will combine experimental petrology and  geochemistry, observational seismology, isotope and trace element  geochemistry and laboratory convection experiments with numerical  approaches to the thermal structure and large-scale convection of  the slab and mantle wedge, and porous flow models for melt and  fluid migration in the arc environment.  Heat flow and various  analyses of seismic data, from primarily the Japan arc, will  constrain the thermal structure and rheological properties used in  the initial calculations (2-D and some 3-D) of flow in the slab and  mantle, using a temperature-dependent viscosity.  Models developed  for Japan, where seismic constraints are strongest, will be used  as a base for Central America and for the Cascades, where a young  hot plate is subducting and conditions are far from steady state.   Models for transport of hydrous fluids in the vicinity of the slab,  and of melts through the mantle will be calculated using the stress  and flow fields from the thermal and convection modeling.         Plate scale mass transport delivers chemical elements derived  from the continental crust, hydrosphere and lithosphere to the deep  source of arc magmas; fluid and melt transport processes translate  some fraction of these elements back to the surface in crust  building magmas.  Documentably slab-derived elements such as 10Be  (1.5 Ma half-life), B and U (75 ka half-life in disequilibria  series) will be incorporated as chemical tracers in fluid/melt  migration models, with fluxes, transport paths and characteristic   transport times constrained from chemistry of subconducting  sediments and erupting lavas.  Fluid partitioning studies on key  elements will further const rain input to migration models.   Predictions from coupled thermal, convection and transport models  regarding spatial distribution, character and chemistry of lavas  along the length and across the width of arcs will be compared with  observed values, and evaluated against observed variations in  subduction parameters from arc to arc to arrive at an integrated  model of the subduction cycle and its role in crustal growth and  evolution of the mantle.  ***",
