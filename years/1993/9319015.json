It  also has become a major focus of educational reform in the  nation, having been designated as one of five core subjects for  American schools in the National Education Goals adopted by the  President and state governors in 1990.  Several significant  challenges now face the discipline, however.  Among these  challenges are:    - connecting geography as a science with grassroots interest in  geographic literacy,    - strengthening the relationship between geographic scholarship  and geographic education,    - meeting the demand for geographic educators, focusing more  research by geographers on national and global issues,    - clarifying the role of geography as a discipline relative to  the many partly geographic multidisciplinary activities, and    - coping with the higher costs of scientific research in  geography.       With support from NSF and other organizations, the National  Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) will  convene a committee to conduct a comprehensive assessment of  geography in the U.S.  The objectives of the assessment are  (1) to identify critical issues and constraints for the  discipline, (2) to clarify priorities for teaching and research,  (3) to link developments in the discipline with national needs  for geographic education, (4) to increase the appreciation of  geography within the scientific community, and (5) to communicate  with the international scientific community about the future  directions of geography in the U.S.  Committee members will be  drawn from the academic, public, and private sectors.  The  committee will use briefings, fact-finding exercises, and  discussions to produce a report that will summarize its findings.  This report will be subject to NAS/NRC review procedures and will  be readily available to geographers and others.       This project will provide a valuable and timely  examination  of the prospects and problems facing geography.  Especially  beneficial will be recommendations regarding research priorities  and steps that can be taken to more closely link basic and  applied research in geography.  ***",
