 "awd_abstract_narration": "World economies depend on the availability of natural rubber for                industrial purposes.  Despite its economic importance                           surprisingly little is known about rubber biogenesis in higher                  plants.  Rubber is produced in numerous species but mechanisms of               its synthesis are poorly understood.  The enzyme rubber                         transferase (RuT) (E.C. 2.5.1.20), a prenyltransferase, causes                  the unique cis-polymerization of isoprene responsible for rubber                accumulation in plants.  Our studies will protein (RPP), the most               abundant protein of guayule rubber particles.  The function of                  RPP in rubber biogenesis will be addressed because its abundance                suggests that it plays an important role either in biosynthesis                 stabilization, solubilization or trafficking of rubber particles.               Prevailing evidence suggesting that RPP is guayule RuT must be                  confirmed with newly available molecular probes.  A cDNA clone                  for RPP, recently identified in the lab, will be used to                        elucidate its role in rubber biogenesis.  Full-length RPP clones                will be examined for the effect of their expression in various                  heterologous and homologous systems.  Biochemical analysis and                  enzymatic assays will compare RPP expression with putative RuT                  and prenyl transferase activity in those systems.  Partial clones               of RPP expressed as fusion proteins in E. Coli will be used to                  generate de-glycosylated RPP Suitable for antibody production.                  Antisera prepared against recombinant RPP will be used several                  fold; first, to measure inhibition of prenyltransferase activity                in in vitro assays; second, to detect for the presence of RPP-                  liked proteins in other rubber-producing  species and finally,                  for immunocytochemical studies in guayule and in transgenic                     plants.  If RPP proves to be RuT, then engineering of rubber                    synthesis may be possible in other systems.                                     %%%                                                                             The production of rubber results from chemical processing of the                sap from the rubber tree which cannot be grown in the USA.                      However another plant native to the USA, guayule, produces rubber               but it is difficult to extract the compound easily from the                     plant.  Rubber is an interesting chemical biomaterial and finding               and characterizing the enzyme responsible for its synthesis is                  the research which is funded here.  The isolation of the rubber                 particle protein in the plant and its purification will lead to                 molecular biological studies fundamental to producing rubber and                related compounds in greater yields and in other plants.",
