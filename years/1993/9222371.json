 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrodifference equations are simple discrete-time models that  arise in population biology as models for organisms with discrete  nonoverlapping generations and well-defined growth and dispersal  stages.  These equations possess many of the attributes of  continuous-time reaction-diffusion models.  At the same time,  scalar integrodifference equations readily exhibit  period-doubling and chaos, and traveling cycles as well as  traveling waves.  Systems of integrodifference equations, in  turn, exhibit a new  variety of diffusive instability and pattern  formation.  The investigator proposes to study the traveling  waves and cycles and the varied spatial patterns that arise in  these models, employing a variety of analytical and computational  techniques.  Some equations have solutions that show repetitive behavior  either in space or in time, developing patterns.  It is of  interest to determine under what conditions such pattern  formations can arise.  This research will shed light on pattern  formation in general.  The equations studied here are related to  models of ecological processes.  Landscape ecology is beginning  to investigate how ecological processes generate the complex  spatial patterns observed on the landscape and how these  patterns, in turn, constrain or determine the rates of the  processes.  The investigator examines a fundamental mechanism  that may be responsible for spatial patterns.  The project has  practical ramifications in that it may allow for better  prediction of the spread of invading riparian plants and invading  insect pests.",
