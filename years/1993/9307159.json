 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307159    Fleming          To be competitive in today's environment of technological change  and global competition, firms need to develop and follow  sagacious technology strategies.  In order to make important  decisions regarding which particular technology strategies would  be optimal to follow, a firm needs reliable information to answer  questions such as:  how quickly and efficiently can its R&D  department develop and build on new technological innovations in  its industry relative to its competitors, and how effective is  the firm at appropriating the benefits of its R&D efforts and  withholding those benefits from others?  Results of the Phase I  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish the  technical basis for using patent citation data as a valuable tool  for helping firms evaluate their own technological capabilities  and those of their competitors.  The objectives of the Phase II  research focus on (1) demonstrating the feasibility of  constructing a patent citation database that meets technology  managers' analytical needs easily and cost-effectively; (2)  extending the citation model developed in Phase I to the point  where it can function as a reliable tool for (a) correcting  citation data for censoring and (b) predicting future citation  levels;  and (3) using these prototype tools to examine the  validity of hypothesized relationships between citation patterns  and the technology strategies of companies.  The project aims to  provide analytical tools for developing and assessing corporate  technology strategies, including patent citation databases and  user-friendly search and analytical software, consulting  services, and publications.    The project addresses the need to understand the  interrelationships among patent citations, the technology  strategies of companies, and their economic performance.  The  project will use this knowledge as the basis for its contribution  to the future of US economic competitiveness, that is, to make  available analytical  tools useful for formulating and analyzing  corporate technology policies that will be valuable to companies  and investors.    ***",
