 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the                                    renovation of the biochemistry laboratories at the                              Field Museum of Natural History.  Established in                                1974, the Field Museum's biochemistry laboratories                              were the first facilities of its kind to be located                             at a major history museum.  The laboratories, a                                 multi-user core facility, serve primarily as a                                  research and training facility for curatorial staff                             and graduate students conducting basic research in                              molecular systematics.  The original technology                                 offered by the facility, starch gel protein                                     electrophoresis, generated beneficial biochemical                               character data for phylogentic analyses of closely                              related species and genera and remains as a                                     valuable and economical technique for biogeography                              research and population level studies.  With the                                emergence of polymerase chain reaction and DNA                                  sequencing technologies, essential tools for                                    systematists, the demand for the use of the                                     facilities has increased.                                                            In addition to refurbishing laboratory space,                              renovations will include replacing inadequate                                   casework, modifying electrical and plumbing                                     systems, and installing an effective ventilation                                and air conditioning system.  The modernized                                    facilities will enable researchers to introduce new                             techniques, refine and maintain polymerase chain                                reaction and DNA sequencing technologies, and                                   provide the capabilities for protein                                            electrophoresis.  The research capacity of the                                  biochemistry laboratories will increase by                                      expanding opportunities for the Field Museum and                                Chicago's systematics research communities.",
