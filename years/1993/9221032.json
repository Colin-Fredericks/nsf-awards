 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal challenges the prevalent view about tropical                 forests that gap phase dynamics is the most important part of the               regeneration cycle for determining species composition of                       tropical forests. This research is the first to experimentally                  test the hypothesis that mammals and insects in the understory of               mature tropical forest control tree species diversity. This                     hypothesis has important ramifications for tropical forest                      dynamics, diversity, conservation, and management.  Recent                      observations suggest that when forests lose their mammalian                     herbivores and seed predators they develop low plant species                    diversity.  Forests with intact mammalian fauna have high species               diversity. Poaching and over-hunting in many tropical forest                    reserves are threatening mammalian herbivore populations. If                    mammalian herbivores are important, than forests that lose their                fauna are likely to lose tree species diversity at an accelerated               rate.  The forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, will be               studied in this research. Our findings indicate that gaps do not                affect species diversity in these forests; therefore, the                       abundance of tree species must be determined in the understory                  where seeds, seedlings, and saplings are exposed to intensive                   herbivory. We propose to test the hypothesis that herbivory and                 seed dispersal control the establishment, composition, and                      diversity of tree species in species-rich tropical forests.                     %%%                                                                                  For the past ten years, research in tropical forests has                   focused on the role of gap-phase dynamics as the primary                        determinant of tree species diversity. Although studies of seed                 predation are common, this project represents the first attempt                 to conduct a community-level experimental test of the effects of                mammalian and insect herbivores on tropical forest diversity. The               results have important implications for the conservation and                    management of biodiversity in tropical                                          regions.",
