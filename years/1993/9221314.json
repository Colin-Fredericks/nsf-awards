In this project a recently                                                      developed                                                                       rigid-plastic model to predict                                                  abutment movements will be                                                      modified.                                                                       The modified model will be capable                                              of treating the translation and                                                 tilting of the abutment in a                                                    coupled                                                                         manner and will account for                                                     movements prior to yielding.  Such                                              capabilities will be verified using                                                                                                                             centrifuge model tests.                                                                                                                                         In the second phase of the study,                                               the consequences of abutment gap                                                closure relative to the bridge                                                  response will be investigated.                                                  This                                                                            will involve the determination of                                               the dynamic abutment-deck                                                       interaction forces during the                                                   excitation.  Such forces are                                                    necessary to study the overall                                                  response of the bridge deck and to                                              design the \"soft-top\" abutments.                                                                                                                                Parametric analysis to evaluate the                                                                                                                             relative importance of the factors                                              that govern abutment behavior will                                              then be performed.  This analysis                                               will lead to a better understanding                                                                                                                             of the abutment behavior and will                                               result in a more rational and                                                   improved design in which abutment-                                              deck interaction can be                                                         realistically quantified and                                                    accounted for in design.",
