The meeting is an annual activity                                      organized by the Pakistan Ministry of Science                                   and Technology to offer to the participants a                                   forum to discuss advances in physics and their                                  relationships to modern needs.  The main topics                                 for this college are:  recent advances in solid                                 state physics related to high-Tc super                                          conductivity and surface physics; current                                       developments in atomic and nuclear clusters;                                    reaction theories relevant to atomic, nuclear,                                  and solid state physics; and introduction to                                    cooperative phenomena or quantum fluids.  These                                 lectures will be followed by a week-long                                        workshop to focus on: progress in many body                                     theories related to condensed matter physics;                                   atomic and nuclear clusters; superconductivity                                  particularly high Tc; phase transformation; and                                 surface physics.  The program allows for                                        participants to attend either of the two one-                                   week sessions or both.  Short workshops follow                                  the more intense lecture sessions to provide                                    for close interaction and collaboration.                                        Lecture notes are to be provided to the                                         participants, and an attempt will be made to                                    publish the proceedings.                                                                                                                                        Scope:  The proposed summer college has been                                    held annually in Nathiaghali, Pakistan, with                                    participation from scientists throughout Asia                                   and Africa and with lecturers from the western                                  world.  It has received strong endorsement in                                   the past from  participants from these                                          countries as well as from international                                         organizations including the International                                       Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste.  It                                  receives partial support from that center as                                    well as from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in                                 Beijing.",
