 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Sandra J. Rosenthal has been awarded a Postdoctoral                         Research Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Rosenthal's doctoral                      degree was from the University of Chicago under the supervision                 of Professor Graham Fleming. Dr. Rosenthal will continue                        research at the University of California/Berkeley under the                     sponsorship of Professors Charles Shank and Richard Mathies.                    Dr. Rosenthal's postdoctoral training will study the role of                    vibrational and electronic coherence in nonlinear optical                       phenomena and the photoisomerization of rhodopsin, using                        ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy and theory. Longer term                    she plans to study the mechanism and timescale of electronic                    dephasing processes and investigate the formation and                           relaxation of biexcitons in semiconducting nanoclusters. The                    information gained from these studies will lead to an                           understanding of exciton relaxation and the origin of nonlinear                 susceptibility, provide a blueprint to tailor the optical                       properties of new systems and, and initiate the use of                          semiconducting nanoclusters in the field of molecular                           electronics.                                                                    %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                   viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                      broaden the knowledge and experience of recent Ph.D.s and                       attract them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical                   research and teaching.",
