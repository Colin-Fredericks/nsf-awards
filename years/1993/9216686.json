 "awd_abstract_narration": "9216686  Wicker       The revival of interest in artificial neural networks (ANN's)  in the early 1980's has spurred research into their application in  many engineering fields, including digital signal processing and  communications.  The pattern recognition capabilities of ANN's  allows them to emulate a variety of functions. This emulation is  enhanced through the use of training algorithms, such as  back-propagation, that allow some types of ANN's to \"\"learn\"  desired functions.  This research is an investigation into the  application of ANN's to the soft decision decoding of block error  control codes.  In the past two years, experimental studies have  demonstrated that certain ANN's can perform error control decoding  for some block codes.  The experimental results have so far shown  that ANN's can perform hard decision decoding, but soft decision  decoding results have been extremely limited.  In this  investigation, the error control problem is first translated into  the terms of functional analysis.  Decoding is viewed as a mapping  from a continuous received signal space onto a discrete information  word space.  Decoder design is thus translated into a problem of  functional approximation.  The next step is to use a highly  promising class of ANN's, feedforward neural networks (FFNN's), to  implement the decoding function in an efficient manner.  The  operation of FFNN's can be viewed geometrically, with each layer in  the network carving up the received signal space into increasingly  lower dimensional subspaces, culminating in an output decision  layer that provides estimates of the transmitted information bits.   The functional approximation approach thus allows for ideal soft  decision decoding, while the FFNN design uses the algebro-geometric  redundancy within the block code to reduce the decoder complexity.   The performance of these decoders will be further enhanced through  the use of ANN training techniques that will match input layer  decision metrics to channel conditions w hile the decoder is  operating.  The result will be a series of efficient soft decision  decoders for a variety of block codes in a variety of applications.  ***",
