These functions include hormone and neurotransmitter secretion,                 skeletal muscle contraction, heart rate and force of contraction,               digestive and excretion processes, and control of DNA expression                and protein synthesis.  Changes in intracellular calcium levels                 are                                                                             also involved in more global physiological and pathological                     events,                                                                         which include learning and memory, cell and organ development,                  neurological and degenerative disorders and aging, to name a few.                                                                                               Dr. Korn is interested in determining the physiological                         circumstances and the different parts of the cells that are                     involved in elevation and reduction of intracellular calcium                    levels                                                                          during hormone secretion.  By using a technically sophisticated                 approach of combining patch clamp electrophysiology, video                      imaging                                                                         and photometry, he will explore the mechanisms by which calcium                 regulates growth hormone secretion from somatotrophs.                           Somatotrophs                                                                    an anterior pituitary cell type, is an excellent system to use                  since growth hormone secretion is under the excitatory hormonal                 control of growth hormone releasing factor and inhibitory                       hormonal                                                                        control of somatostatin.  Dr. Korn will analyze the time course                 of                                                                              calcium changes in different cytoplasmic compartments following                 the                                                                             stimulation and inhibition of hormone secretion.  The results are               likely to give answers with widely ranging implications for                     understanding cellular processes as well as to provide new                      insights                                                                        specifically into the mechanisms governing growth hormone release               and the control of ion channels in endocrine cells.  Since the                  results will have implications for how hormone secretion can be                 manipulated in both man and animals, the findings may eventually                be                                                                              important for the field of animal husbandry, for associated                     agricultural industries, and the pharmaceutical industry.",
