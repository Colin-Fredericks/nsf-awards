 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307791  Ogawa  Professor Ogawa of Bowling Green State University will  investigate electron transfer across artificial beta-pleated  sheets with support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and  Organometallic Chemistry Program.  He will synthesize compounds  based on oligopeptides;  these will be joined in pairs at the  ends so as to induce the beta-pleated sheet conformation.  Electron transfer donor and acceptor sites will be attached to  these capped oligopeptides so that the role of beta pleated  sheets in mediating electron transfer can be assessed.  The  molecules will be characterized by circular dichroism and  multinuclear nmr spectroscopy, and where possible by x-ray  diffraction.  Electron transfer will be initiated by flash  photolysis and monitored by fluorescence and absorption  spectroscopy.  The primary goal will be to determine if  beta-pleated sheets are unusually effective in mediating  electron transfer, as has been predicted theoretically.  %%%  The transfer of an electron through proteins is an essential  component of many life processes.  Often this must occur  through distances that are long on the atomic scale.  It has  been suggested that certain structural motifs within proteins  are especially effective in fostering such long range electron  transfer events.  In particular, structures known as  \"beta-pleated sheets\" have been implicated.  Experiments to  test this hypothesis will be conducted by designing and  synthesizing artificial beta-pleated sheets;  these molecules  will be constructed with sites that are able to participate in  electron transfer reactions.  The rates of electron transfer  will then be measured and compared with those of similar  molecules that lack the beta-pleated sheets.  The information  to be obtained will refine our understanding of the ways that  proteins perform their functions.  ***",
