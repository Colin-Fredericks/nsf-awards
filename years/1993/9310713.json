 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. George Gumerman                  and Mary Weismantel will conduct archaeological research in the                 Angamarca region which is located on the western slopes of the                  Cordillera Occidental of Ecuador. They will examine a total area                of ca. 96 square kilometers which includes the important                        prehistoric political center of Angamarca la Vieja. The main goal               of this first pilot stage of what is conceived as a long-term                   project is to test different archaeological survey techniques                   both to determine the range of cultural materials and sites                     present and also to discover the best technique for locating                    sites in this tropical environment. The team will employ a                      stratified random sampling technique to examine three primary                   zones: riverine, lowland and upland. Within each zone selected                  areas will be surveyed. Once sites are located, their boundaries                will be determined, a sketch map drawn, and a fraction of the                   cultural materials collected for analysis. Three multicomponent                 sites will be chosen for test excavations which will focus on                   recovering temporally diagnostic artifacts and subsistence                      remains. On this basis a tentative chronology can be constructed                and the first step of a subsistence reconstruction carried out.                                                                                                 Although the archaeology of this region is not well known, it is                clear that the Inca empire, centered in Peru to the South,                      extended this far North. Drs. Gumerman and Weismantel are                       interested in how, in this fringe of the empire the Inca                        maintained their control and how local inhabitants adapted to                   their incorporation into the empire. Ultimately, they plan to                   study contrasting environmental zones in Ecuador and compare both               across regions and across time. They will establish a pre-Inca                  baseline and use this to determine post-Inca contact changes.                   They will focus on utilization of food since manipulation of this               essential resource can serve both as a mechanism of social                      control and as a marker of status. Before such issues can be                    addressed however, it is necessary both to determine how best to                work in this little known region and to develop a detailed                      chronology.                                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new                light on how large complex societies develop and are maintained.                It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and                     develop analytic techniques which, hopefully, will be applicable                in many archaeological situations. It will also further the                     career of two young and very promising scientists.",
