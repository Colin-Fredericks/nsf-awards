 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Archaeogastropoda appeared in the Late Cambrian and                    rapidly radiated to encompass a wide range of morphologies.  These              included most of the morphotypes associated with basic gastropod                lifestyles.  A minor morphologic radiation occurred later with                  changes in shell ornamentation.  Archaeogastropods thus offer                   multiple character types and morphologic levels for describing                  changes through time in the patterns of morphology.                                  This project includes both phylogenetic and morphometric                   analyses of Early Paleozoic archaeogastropods.  These approaches                will be used to compare typical morphological distances of                      differences between sister species in three different morphospaces:             1) one based upon twelve \"basic-shell\" characters appearing at the              group's origin; 2) one based upon shell ornamentation, which did                not appear in most subgroups until the Late Ordovician; and 3) one              based upon character complexes thought to have a basic functional               utility.  Using ornamentation to compare the temporal patterns of               clade expansion in both \"early\" and \"later\" shell characters will               provide information on whether inter- and intraclade variation                  depend more on the time in which the clade radiated (i.e.,                      extrinsic factors) or upon the ages of the character states                     distinguishing them (i.e., intrinsic factors).  Examining                       phylogenetic patterns in a morphospace of character complexes will              describe the archaeogastgropod radiation in a biologically more                 meaningful manner and also provide an additional morphologic                    \"level\" to test for non-random sorting of clades.",
