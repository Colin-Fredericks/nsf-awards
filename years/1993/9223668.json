 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trends and volatility in primary commodity prices present policy                makers in developing countries with problems of both                            macroeconomic and microeconomic management, problems that will                  not be resolved until there exists a coherent and empirically                   supported theory of the determination of the prices of primary                  commodities.  The leading theoretical explanation of agricultural               crop prices rests on a combination of supply and demand together                with storage and profit-maximizing speculators.  This story is                  consistent with several stylized facts, but formal empirical                    analysis has only become possible with recent advances in the                   econometric analysis of nonlinear dynamic programs. Results have                been less than encouraging, at least for simple versions of the                 theory.  This research builds on previous analysis by the                       investigators and will enrich the basic model to the point where                it is either consistent with the evidence, or is clearly                        rejected.  The theory will be extended to accommodate growth in                 output, more complex supply patterns, and the flow of information               between crop years.  Empirical work will extend pervious analysis               to higher frequency data and will use extensive historical data                 on production, stocks, and future markets to test fuller versions               of the theory.",
