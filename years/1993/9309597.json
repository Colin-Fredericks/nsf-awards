They may also influence the development of connections between nerve cells.  One neurotransmitter that may have such dual functions is serotonin.  Preliminary experiments have shown that increasing serotonin in the superior colliculus, a part of the brain involved in vision and attention, stops the normal maturation of the projections from the eye to this structure.  In contrast, reducing serotonin during development appears to lead to an abnormally well-focused projection from the eye to the superior colliculus.  The proposed research will determine the mechanism(s) underlying these phenomena.  The hypothesis guiding this work is that serotonin influences development by altering levels of nerve cell activity in the young brain.  It is already known that reducing activity impedes normal maturation of connections between nerve cells, and high levels of serotonin may actually block communication between such cells in the eye and those in the superior colliculus.  Conversely, reduced serotonin levels increase communication between the eye and the brain and enhance normal developmental processes.  Whether or not these proposals are correct will be determined by: 1) testing whether or not serotonin affects communication between the eye and the developing superior colliculus; 2) providing a complete description of the effects of altered serotonin levels on the pattern of  connections between the eye and the brain; 3) asking whether there are effects of serotonin on the development of nerve cell connec tions whose activity is not influenced by this neurotransmitter; 4) determining whether the enhanced focusing of  nerve cell connections that occurs when serotonin levels are reduced still occurs when all activity is blocked by a nonspecific agent, tetrodotoxin.  ***                                                                                                                                       9309597  Mooney    Molecules that transfer information between nerve cells in the mature brain are called neurotransmitters.
