 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312971  Magnanti       This research will investigate complexity issues for the  variational inequality problem.  This is a new research direction  that aims to:  (1) provide new theoretical insights and a better  understanding for a very general class problem, as well  as for  several of its specializations and applications, and (2) create new  algorithms and algorithmic approaches for variational inequalities  and related problems.  Variational inequality problems (VIP)  provide a natural and efficient framework for unifying the  treatment of equilibrium problems encountered in areas as diverse  as economics, game theory, transportation, and regional science.   Moveover, variational inequalities encompass a wide range of  generic problem areas including mathematical optimization (linear  and non-linear), complementarity, fixed point, and equilibrium  problems.  The investigation aims to address several questions  concerning the complexity of variational inequality problems:  (a)  What is the most general subclass of VIPs that are solvable in  polynomial time?  (b) What is the complexity of VIPs or of VIPs  with special structure? (c) What is the relationship between the  complexity of computing equilibria and fixed points and the  complexity of algorithms for VIPs? (d) Can duality results for VIPs  suggest new efficient algorithms?  (e) What algorithms for VIPs are  efficient in practice?       Building upon many of the ideas used in recent research, this  investigation will draw upon methods developed in the past decade  in studying the complexity of linear and nonlinear programming  (e.g. potential function methods, volume estimates, duality  results) as well as other results from mathematical analysis such  as convergence properties of nonexpansion maps.",
