 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reading Rainbow is an eighty (80) part PBS children's series                    (15 of which are science programs) that entices children five                   to eight years old to read good books, thus addressing the                      national tragedy of more and more young Americans reading less                  and less.  The Emmy award winning series employs television to                  sell the joy of science and reading to young viewers.                                                                                                           This proposal seeks funding for five additional Reading                         Rainbow programs which will focus on scientific themes.  These                  programs will be added to the previously funded science                         programs (22) to become part of the on-going series in                          demonstrating to children how science is integrated into all                    aspects of our lives.                                                                                                                                           The Reading Rainbow series premiered in the summer of l983 to                   phenomenal critical and popular acclaim.  In the fall of 1990,                  Reading Rainbow expanded ta a year round, daily schedule--                      after having spent seven years as a summer series.  According                   to formal studies, the science shows are of great interest to                   children and pique children's interest in related science                       topics and books.  The series is no in its tenth season and                     its popularity has grown among young viewers as well as with                    parents.",
