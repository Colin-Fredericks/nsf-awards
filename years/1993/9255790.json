This                 project will bring together mathematicsteachers, assessment                     experts, mathematicians, and educators in a collaborative effort to             improve assessment in mathematics.  Eight teams of elementary and               middle school teachers, with prior experience in integrating                    technology into the math curriculum, will receive extensive                     training in developing assessment procedures that emphasize higher-             order thinking processes.  The teams will learn how to develop                  dynamic assessment materials; create assessment materials that                  incorporate innovative instructional technology; and field-test and             evaluate the developed materials in their classrooms.  Evidence of              teachers' capabilities and accomplishments will be collected                    through interviews, observations, and analysis of field-notes.                  Case studies will be developed to characterize teachers' efforts.",
