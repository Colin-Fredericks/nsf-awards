 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very high energy resolution (less than 5meV at count rates of 1kHz)             photoemission studies of solids at low temperatures will be                     undertaken on a recently built instrument.  These parameters are a              significant improvement over previously published work on solid                 samples, and allows photoelectron spectroscopy to make contact with             other experimental methods that study excitations with energies of              order kT.  Several specific experiments are proposed:  Studies of               the effects of the electron-phonon interaction on Fermi edges in                angle integrated spectra, and on individual surface state                       dispersion at small binding energy in wide band metals such as                  copper will be undertaken; this will yield detailed information                 about the interaction between electrons and phonons at and near                 solid surfaces.  Studies of emission from phosphorus donor levels               in silicon for concentration ranges near the metal/insulator                    critical concentration will determine the one electron density of               states and aid in understanding the competition between correlation             and disorder in driving this transition.  Studies of emission (peak             dispersion and line shape) and of the band-gap in conventional and              high temperature superconductors will help to determine the                     mechanism of superconductivity in these materials.                              %%%                                                                             The purpose of this research is to bring the power and                          discrimination of a newly developed high resolution photoelectron               spectrometer to bear on a number of current problems in materials               physics.  The improved resolution could impinge strongly on                     technological fields such as superconductivity and semiconductor                device operation, as well as in various related areas of more                   fundamental interest.  This research will extend the energy                     resolution of photoelectron spectroscopy by about an order of                   magnitude, permitting detailed studies of the electrons responsible             for device operation.  In particular, metal/insulator transitions               in semiconductors, the origin of the energy gap in high temperature             and conventional superconductors, and the interaction between                   electrons and atomic vibrations in more ordinary materials will be              investigated.",
