Nitric oxide (NO) is a recently discovered messenger molecule associated with a variety of functions throughout the body.  In the brain and peripheral nervous system, NO has been implicated in neurotoxicity associated with stroke and neurodegenerative diseases and it may be the retrograde messenger responsible for long-term potentiation, a process thought to be associated with memory and learning.  NO has also been implicated in cerebellar long-term depression, which is thought to be associated with motor learning.  NO is responsible for endothelial derived relaxing factor (EDRF) activity regulating blood pressure and in macrophages         Y       it mediates tumoricidal and bactericidal actions.  n-NOS requires Ca   2+   -calmodulin for activity.  Dr. Persechini's interest is to define structure-function relationships in n-NOS relevant to its calmodulin-dependent regulation by correlating structural alterations in n-NOS with measurement of binding and activation of n-NOS by calmodulin.  These investigations will be facilitated by utilizing information contained in the amino acid sequences of two homologous amino acid positions that differ between n-NOS and mac-NOS but are contained within the calmodulin-binding domain in n-NOS.  Proposed studies are part of an ongoing investigation of the role played by calmodulin in cellular regulation.  Calmodulin regulates the activity of several enzymes including at least four protein kinases, one protein phosphatase,  and nitric oxide synthase, that are at the top of regulatory cascades.  Dr. Persechini has two broad long-term objectives in this laboratory.  The first is to contribute to the development of a comparative understanding of calmodulin-dependent enzyme activation.  Given the large and growing number of calmodulin targets, such an understanding is clearly important.  His second long-term objective is to contribute to an in-depth understanding of one of two specific calmodulin-dependent enzymes.  It is primarily the second of these goals that is addressed here. ***",
