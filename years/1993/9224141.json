Adams of the Chemistry Department, University of                     South Carolina, on the synthesis and characterization of metal                  cluster compounds.  Carbonyl compounds containing platinum and                  iron, ruthenium or osmium will be prepared and characterized by                 IR, NMR, and X-ray crystallography.  The usefulness of the                      compounds as petroleum reforming catalysts will be tested,                      especially with regard to selective catalysis that might be                     associated through the cooperativity of different types of                      metal atoms.  Some of the models include compounds in which                     metals have segregated to particular layers within the                          structure, and the effect of this effect on catalytic activity                  will be investigated.  Alkyne substitution reactions will be                    used to test the reactivity of sites within the clusters.                       %%%                                                                             Mixed-metal and metal-alloy catalysts are employed industrially                 to promote hydrogenation reactions, but a molecular model of                    these compounds which can be used to understand the beneficial                  effects of the mixed-metal materials has not been synthesized.                  In this project, molecular models of mixed metal compounds will                 be prepared and their reactivity in various catalytic reactions                 determined.  The research could provide insights into the                       detailed mechanisms of catalytic reactions and aid in the                       development of selective hydrogenation catalysts.",
