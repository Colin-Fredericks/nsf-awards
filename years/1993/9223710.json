 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of a research program to study the               modification of solid surfaces by alkali metal overlayers.  The                 effort focuses on investigating the electronic promotion of surface             reactions and on the modification of the electronic and atomic                  structure of several important semiconductors and metals by alkali              overlayers and the catalytic oxidation and nitridation of                       semiconductors.  The project is based on technique of photoelectron             spectroscopy using the soft x-ray spectrum provided by the high                 brilliance 1 GeV electron storage ring at the Synchrotron Radiation             Center of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  In addition to the              electronic properties, information on the atomic structure of                   investigated interfaces is provided by the use of the relatively                new technique of photoemission extended x-ray absorption fine                   structure.                                                                      %%%                                                                                                                                                             Knowledge of the atomic and electronic structure of metal                       semiconductor and semiconductor/oxide interfaces is essential to                the basic understanding of these systems, as well as for the                    optimum performance of current and future electronic devices.  This             project coveres several experimental spectroscopic techniques using             existing national resources at the 1 GeV Synchrotron Radiation                  Center, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The work will                  provide valuable information on the electronic structure, atomic                geometry, and the microscopic mechanisms of important catalytic                 reactions like oxidation or nitridation of the semiconductor and                metal surfaces under investigation.                                                                                                                             The potential impact of this research on the applied and                        technological areas of metal/semiconductor interfaces is                        indicated by two recent U.S. patents.",
