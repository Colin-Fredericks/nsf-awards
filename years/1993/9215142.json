 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two-iron ((2Fe-2S)) ferredoxins comprise an important class of                  biological molecules whose function is incompletely understood at               the molecular level.  The investigators propose to study three                  classes of (2Fe-2S) ferredoxins: those found in mitochondria of                 steroid metabolizing tissue in vertebrates, those involved in                   photosynthesis, and those involved in nitrogen fixation.  Examples              of wild-type ferrodoxins from each of the three categories have                 been cloned and currently are overproduced in the PI's laboratory.              The investigators previously determined x-ray structures from                   examples of two of the ferredoxin classes and an NMR structure from             one.  NMR and x-ray studies of members of the other classes of                  (2Fe-2S) ferredoxin are underway.  The experiments are designed (1)             to develop an understanding of factors that determine the reduction             potential and electron delocalization in (2Fe-2S) ferredoxins, (2)              to elucidate mechanisms of electron transfer to and from these                  ferredoxins, and (3) to investigate the requirements and energetics             of (2Fe-2S) cluster formation.  Roles of individual residues will               be investigated by site-directed mutagenesis.  Stable isotope                   labels inserted at specific locations will be used to monitor the               electronic properties of atoms in the active site.  X-ray                       structures will be determined for interesting mutant proteins that              can by crystallized and analyzed either by multiple isomorphous                 replacement or by molecular replacement methods.                                %%%                                                                             One of the basic motifs found in proteins that function as electron             carriers is an iron atom coordinated by four sulfur atoms (an iron-             sulfur cluster).  Iron-sulfur clusters are found in all forms of                life from bacteria to man.  Iron-sulfur clusters can contain one,               two, three, four, or more iron atoms, and their affinity for                    electrons varies over several orders of magnitude.  They are                    involved in photosynthesis, respiration, nitrogen fixation, and                 many other important metabolic processes.  This research project is             designed to answer the following fundamental questions about                    proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters: (1) How does the                    sequence of the protein specify the structure of the iron-sulfur                cluster, the number of iron atoms and the geometry? (2) How does                the sequence of the protein determine the affinity of the cluster               for electrons and thus tune its reactivity for a particular                     process? (3) What residues in the protein are responsible for the               specificity of electron transfer, and how do they guide that                    transfer? This knowledge will enable one to design electron                     transfer proteins with desired properties.",
