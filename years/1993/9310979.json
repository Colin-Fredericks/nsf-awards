 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310979  Philbrick and Fritsch       Intercontinental plant disjunctions are ideal systems with  which to examine models of geohistorical change.  The flowering  plant genus Styrax provides one such system, with several species  of the Series Imbricatae occurring in California and in the  Mediterranean region.  This group plus 21 other living plant groups  sharing a similar distributional pattern have been proposed as  \"Madrean-Tethyan\" links based on morphological similarity: relicts  of a once widespread dry habitat-adapted vegetation belt stretching  from southwestern North America trans-Atlantically to central Asia  in the early Tertiary.  Alternative hypotheses for the existence of  these intercontinental disjunctions claim no evidence for a  Madrean-Tethyan corridor and maintain that taxa on either side of  the Atlantic only appear closely related, but have actually been  derived independently from mesic ancestors that migrated across  either the Bering or the North Atlantic land bridges.  The  objective of the work by graduate student Fritsch under the  direction of Dr. Philbrick is to test the Madrean-Tethyan  continuity hypothesis using Styrax as a representative group by  producing independent lines of evidence generated from  morphological, DNA, and protein data.   %%%       Genetic distance measures generated from isozyme and  chloroplast DNA variation within and among populations of Styrax  will estimate taxon divergence times, whereas phylogenetic  reconstruction of Series Imbricatae using morphological,  chloroplast DNA, and nuclear ribosomal DNA characters will test the  monophyletic status of the group.  Analysis of the data will  provide information indicating which model of Madrean-Tethyan  history is likely to be correct as well as provide a sound  classification of these plants for continuing taxonomic and  evolutionary studies.  ***",
