 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the insect nervous system is relatively simple, it                has not prevented these animals from engaging in quite complex                  behaviors.  One such insect behavior that has led to much human                 suffering is the one that allows a mosquito to find a host for a                meal of blood.  Using various chemical and visual signals that we               humans give off, mosquitos are able to locate us and ingest our                 blood, and in the process transmit often deadly disease agents.                 Dr. Klowden is an internationally renown expert on mosquito                     behavior in the complex environment.  He has identified times                   when the insect itself controls its behavior and does not seek a                host.  Using these periods of inaction, Dr. Klowden identified a                novel FMRFamide-related neuropeptide, Aedes Head Peptide 1, that                specifically inhibits host seeking behavior in the yellow fever                 mosquito, and prevents them from feeding on blood.  Using                       extremely difficult technical/surgical techniques, he can begin                 to unravel the mechanisms by which Aedes Head Peptide 1 prevents                mosquito host-seeking behavior from occurring, and how this                     hormone interacts with other factors.  The results from these                   fundamental studies are likely to lead to new discoveries that                  will substantially impact progress in the neuroendocrinology of                 insects and insect behavior.  In addition, basic findings derived               from this research should provide essential information needed                  for the development of better strategies for the control of                     populations of mosquitoes and the diseases that they transmit via               their blood-feeding activities.",
