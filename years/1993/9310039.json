 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310039  Mutz    An important force in contemporary political life involves what may  be termed \"impersonal influence,\" that is influence that derives  from people's perceptions of others attitudes, beliefs, or  experiences.  Others in this case refers not to close friends and  acquaintances, but rather to the anonymous others outside an  individual's realm of personal contacts.  For example, when the  outcomes of early presidential primaries affect attitudes toward  candidates in later primaries, or when the results of national  opinion polls influence subsequent political behavior, impersonal  influence is taking place.  Likewise, when people vote on the basis  of their perceptions of how the nation as a whole is faring  economically rather than on their own personal economic fortunes,  they are also being influenced by perceptions of impersonal others.    Influences are deemed impersonal in two respects:  they are  mediated and do not involve face-to-face interpersonal  communication, and they involve information about the attitudes,  beliefs and experiences of collectives outside of an individual's  personal lifespace.  Mass media play a crucial role in constructing  people's images of the larger social world outside the realm of  personal experiences and contacts.  These perceptions, in turn,  have important consequences for the political behavior of elites  and mass publics.    To date, the concern with social influence has been investigated  most thoroughly at the level of personal acquaintances and group  influence.  Nonetheless, a variety of contemporary theories and  research findings point to impersonal others as an important  influence on political attitudes and behavior.  In this  investigation, the researchers employ a hybrid methodology  involving experiments embedded within national opinion surveys.   This project will explore the social psychology of impersonal  influence in an attempt to understand when and why people are  influenced by their perceptions of mass opinion or expe rience.    Findings from this research will shed light on mass media's role in  contemporary political processes.  Although the potential for  impersonal influence is clear in a wide variety of contemporary  political situations, the extent of its influence and normative  implications are not.  In order to understand fully the  implications of these processes for American politics, it is  essential to understand the actual mechanisms by which impersonal  influence occurs.  ***",
