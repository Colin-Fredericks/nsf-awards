 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the following two topics:                                                                                                                  1)   The understanding of solar-terrestrial relationships             and the solar-interplanetary electrodynamical phenomena which                   control the propagation of energetic charged particles in                       the heliosphere over a 22-year solar magnetic cycle, and,                                                                                                            2)   The physics of solar flare charged particle acceleration              propagation and the associated neutron emission from solar flares.                                                                                                   The experimental approach to the first topic is based on using             charged particles as probes of the heliospheric magnetic fields.                For the second topic, the PI will investigate solar flare particles             acceleration through spacecraft measurements of the charge                      particles spectra, elemental and isotopic composition as a function             of time for nuclear species from hydrogen to nickel. Studies also               are made of solar flare neutron emission using a high altitude,                 equatorial super monitor. Both scientific objectives require the                continuing support of neutron monitors (for nuclei of relativistic              energies) and a network of instruments on spacecraft located                    throughout the heliosphere. This proposal includes support for the              standard neutron monitors at Climax, Colorado, and Mt. Haleakala as             well as the 18-counter super monitor on Mt. Haleakala. The data                 from this network are available to the scientific community. The                remainder of the proposal supports analytical and theoretical                   research directed to the research areas described above.",
