 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the determinants of industrial location i n               terms of both current and historical conditions.  The questions                 addressed include:  In what urban locations do different                        manufacturing industries in the USA concentrate and how much                    persistence in location patterns is there over time?  Can                       persistence be linked to dynamic externalities and how strongly                 do measures reflecting various externalities affect productivity                measures?  How strong is the direct link between industrial                     location patterns and local air quality and has the link weakened               in the last twenty years with stronger environmental regulation?                What is the indirect link between air quality and industrial                    location decisions, given the impact of air quality on wages and                rents through disamenity capitalization effects, which impact                   firms' costs?                                                                                                                                                   For metropolitan areas in the USA this study combines data from                 the Sixth Count of the 1970 Population census (detailed industry                employment), the 1972 Census of Manufacturing, the 1987 Census of               Manufacturing, and the 1970 and 1987 County Business Patterns                   publication (to fill in holes in the Census of Manufacturing                    created by censoring for disclosure reasons), and other                         government sources (City and County data Book, State and Metro                  Area Data Book, and EPA publications).  These data are used to                  estimate econometric models of where industries locate, their                   scale of operation, their productivity, and the nature and extent               of external economies of scale.  They are used to estimate models               of the determinants of urban air quality, account for the                       interactions between air quality and industrial composition, air                quality and wages and rents, and industrial composition and wages               and rents.",
