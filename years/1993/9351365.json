 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three sets of optical spectrum analyzers are being used for                     this project; one for each of the three work stations in the                    electro-optics laboratory. That laboratory is used for two                      undergraduate laboratory courses which have a total annual                      enrollment of about 105 students. In addition, about 20 senior                  projects and 10 directed independent studies are completed in                   that laboratory annually.The new equipment is being used by                     students for trouble shooting and as a means of graphically                     displaying and analyzing the spectra of optical sources,                        modulated optical signals, and what is happening to such                        signals at various points in an optical network. A total of                     three new experiments are being introduced, enabling the                        students to gain practical experience in characteristics of                     optical sources, longitudinal modes of the laser,                               photodetectors and spectral characteristics of fiber optic                      networks. The experience gained in using optical spectrum                       analyzers is stimulating and expanding undergraduate learning                   in electro-optics.",
