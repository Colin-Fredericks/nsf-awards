 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313475  Lewis  The University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez continues to be committed  to producing top minority students in science.  The research  faculty is not reluctant to having students participate in  research activities, thus providing them with excellent research  training opportunities.  Nevertheless, the University has had  difficulty in retaining highly qualified faculty due to the  deteriorating conditions of research laboratories.  Current  conditions also limit the number of students able to participate  in research activities. This award will provide funding for the  renovations of specific research laboratories in the Departments  of Biology, Geology and Chemistry that have negatively affected  the recruitment and retention of faculty within the three  departments.    Renovations within the Department of Biology will affect five  laboratories:  Molecular Genetics, Botany, Cell Culture, Animal  Behavior and Neotropical Systematic and Zoogeographic.  Research  activities pursued in these laboratories include:  the study of  molecular evolution through DNA sequencing, the population of  endangered plant species, development of monoclonal  immunoglobulins,  and the biodiversity and behavior of  invertebrates.  The Experimental Geochemistry research space will  be modernized to accommodate interdisciplinary studies that  address quantitatively the conditions obtained during complex  geological processes. Within the Department of Chemistry, the Wet  Chemistry and Small Instrumentation laboratories will be  renovated to support research projects relating to the  biosynthesis, molecular photophysics, and photochemistry of  natural products derived from tropical plants.  Once the  renovations are completed, the improved infrastructure will  facilitate recruitment of faculty members who are dedicated to  research and research training by helping to create an  environment in which competitive research can be undertaken.  ***",
