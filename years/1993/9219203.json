 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vicillin (or 7S) seed storage protein genes are expressed                  specifically in the apical and central regions (cotyledons, shoot               apical meristem and hypocotyl) of dicot plant embryos after the                 periods of cell division and morphogenesis.  THey are good markers              for the late stage of cotyledon maturation.  Necessary and                      sufficient information for apical expression in transgenic tobacco              embryos is contained within a fragment of DNA (UAS1, -295 to -109)              from a bean 7S gene (B-phaseolin).  We have used electrophoretic                mobility shift assays and methylation interference to identify UAS1             nucleotide motifs which are directly contacted by bean nuclear                  protein(s) in vitro.  In order to understand how the UAS2 element               regulates gene activation during development we are cloning cDNA                sequences that code for UAS1 binding proteins.  We will complete                cloning of cDNA sequences coding for bean nuclear protein(s) that               bind to the Vb1 and Vb2 segments of the seed-specific enhancer.  We             will also study the interactions between individual protein factors             and their target sites on the DNA and how they affect spatial                   regulation of gene transcription in tobacco plants.                             %%%                                                                             The rational design of improved agricultural crops regquires                    targeting novel gene activities to specific plant tissues and                   organs.  In order to accomplish that economically important goal,               a thorough understanding of the factors that regulate plant                     development must be achieved.  These studies on the interaction                 between specific DNA sequences and nuclear regulatory proteins                  leading to developmentally controlled and tissue specific gene                  expression will enhance our understanding of those mechanisms.",
