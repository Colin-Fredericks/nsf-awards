 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the Late 1950s, the Latin American Church has undergone                   radical changes in terms of theology and pastoral organization.                 Innovations such as liberation theology and comunidades eclesiales              de base (CEBs) have tended to reinvigorate the political role the               Church plays in society.  Moreover, in several authoritarian                    regimes, the Catholic Church as been the sole source of opposition.             Nevertheless, this change has not been uniform across Latin                     America.  Several national episcopates supported authoritarian rule             in the 1960s and 1970s.  This doctoral dissertation research                    investigation examines the role of religious competition (between               Catholics and non-Catholics) in determining whether the national                Church hierarchy endorses or opposes dictatorial rule.  The                     dissertation student investigates whether increasing presence of                Protestant sects in some countries has forced the episcopate to                 adopt membership-retention strategies that are antithetical to the              military's goal of suppressing subversive organizations.                        Furthermore, conflict between the Church and military regime is                 assessed concerning whether Church access to state patronage was                reduced during the early part of the century.  The student will                 combine historical research with field research (interviews with                church leaders) in Chile to examine this topic.",
