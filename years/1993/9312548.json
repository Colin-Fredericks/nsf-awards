The  Center continues to meet the renewal criteria requirements of the  I/UCRC Program.    A three-year continuing award is also included for an evaluator to  study the university/industry interaction occurring in the Center.    Additional funding is provided for a minority undergraduate student  to augment the Center's research program with a study \"Optical  Properties of Polymer Solutions.\"     The Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste  Management Office is providing funding to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center.    Funding is also provided by the U.S. Army Natick RD&E Center and  the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to obtain memberships in the  Center.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Massachusetts,  Amherst be awarded:  $40,000 for the first year of a three-year  continuing award; $8,000 for the first year of a three-year  continuing award; $5,000 for one year with funds provided by the  Women, Minorities and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants  Program; $10,000 for one year with funds provided by the U.S.  Department of Energy; $20,000 for one year with funds provided by  the U.S. Army Natick RD&E Center; and $20,000 for one year with  funds provided by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which the  university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will re commend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
