 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project investigates the operation of female                  choice of mates in a social environment characterized by male                   competition.  Recent studies of primate species with harem social               organization and large differences in size between sexes assume                 male-male competition is responsible for social structure, rather               than female choice.  However, an association between polygyny and               sex dimorphism does not exist in horses, and dominant harem                     stallions fail to sire nearly a third of the foals in their bands.                                                                                              This study at Assateague Island will examine four possible female               reproductive strategies for feral horses, and will combine detailed             field obserations of behavior and social organization withpaternity             assignment.  These data will allow a better understanding of the                mating system of horses and particularly the role of female choice              in harem social organizations more generally.  The contrast to the              usual situation in primates will be very instructive.                                                                                                           NSF funds are requested for the genetic laboratory phase of the                 project, otherwise supported by the Hill Foundation.  The project               will enhance the training of a young professional.",
