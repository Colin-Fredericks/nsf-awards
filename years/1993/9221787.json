 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Stephen Houston, Mr. Christopher Beekman             will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will continue               his ongoing archaeological research in the Atemajac and Tala-                   Ahualulco-Teuchitlan valleys in Jalisco Mexico. The region is                   extremely interesting because during the Classic period (A.D. 200-              900) it marked the boundary between two large complex polities, one             centered at Teuchitlan the other at the Central Mexican site of                 Teotihuacan. What Mr. Beekman wishes to study is the interaction                between these two \"states\", how they changed over time, and what                specific adaptations were made in the border region between the                 two. In order to accomplish this goal he will conduct a site survey             and note architectural forms and site distribution. He will also                collect surface materials including both pottery and obsidian stone             tools. Since designs on pottery relfect ethnic affiliation, be will             analyze the ceramics from this perspective to determine whether or              not ethnic differences are clearly defined and how this may change              over time. By conducting chemical analysis to determine clay source             as well as the points of origin for obsidian stone tools, he will               also gain insight into economic and trade relationships.                                                                                                        This research is important because it will provide insight into how             complex polities interact and how boundaries are established,                   maintained and altered over a long period of time. Over the ca. 700             time interval under study the relative powers of these two polities             changed and it will be possible to determine how direct contact and             relations varied along with this. The work will provide data of                 interest to many archaeologists. It will also assist in the                     training of a promising young scientist.",
