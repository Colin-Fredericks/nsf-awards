 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222493  Ganz    Fundamental aspects of molecular beam epitaxy of silicon,  germanium/silicon, and details of surface diffusion of atoms will  be studied using hot scanning tunneling microscopy.  The  instrumentation used and experimental approach followed will  allow atomic resolution imaging and electron diffraction to be  measured during the crystal growth process.  The effects of  temperature on the kinetics of film growth, as well as direct  determination of important growth parameters including  anisotropic diffusion, coarsening, binding energies, step  velocity, and diffusion across or reflection from step edges will  be studied.  These parameters are to be investigated for silicon  homoepitaxial growth on Si(100) substrates, and for Ge  heteroepitaxial growth on Si(100) with Sb as a surfactant.  %%%   This research is expected to provide fundamental new information  about semiconductor materials which are widely used for VLSI  technology.  State-of-the-art surface instrumentation and methods  are expected to reveal atomic scale features of surface  interactions in real time as reactions occur.  The semiconductor  materials under study have wide applicability in electronic and  optoelectronic devices, and a greater understanding of their  primary materials science properties is expected to improve the  performance of devices made from these materials.  New devices  and device configurations may result from these studies as well  as significant improvements in devices and integrated circuits  currently used in computing, information processing, and  telecommunications.  ***",
