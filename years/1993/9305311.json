 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER project will examine the feasibility of generating ice                in the decompression region of a supersonic jet, followed by a                  supersonic ice-blasting abrasion for the removal of paint and                   corrosion from a broad variety of industrial structures.  This                  approach will replace sand blasting abrasion, which has                         significant environmental and economic drawbacks.  The ability                  to generate at the desired location ice crystals of appropriate                 size for abrasive purposes has to be demonstrated.  Various                     abrasive particles, that become residue immediately after                       abrasion, are replaced by water that is available at almost any                 location.  A simplified analytical model for flow and heat                      transfer around small particles entrained by a supersonic jet                   indicates that water droplets will be formed.  The proposed                     experiments will test the model assumptions, identify other                     related phenomena, and finally test the feasibility of the                      approach.                                                                                                                                                       This exploratory research is relevant to environmentally benign                 manufacturing (e.g. abrasive blasting of nuclear power                          facilities  or coated mills) and to maintaining the civil                       infrastructure (e.g. cleaning of the lead-based paints from                     bridges, large structures and equipment, as well as toxic                       sandblasting storage).",
