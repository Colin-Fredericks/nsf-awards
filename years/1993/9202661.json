 "awd_abstract_narration": "The slow-spreading Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) consists of both               symmetrical and asymmetrical rift valley segments or spreading                  cells that are linked end-to-end by transform faults and \"non-                  transform offsets\" or accommodation zones and is similar to the                 structure of many continental rifts. Of the various components of               MAR architecture the most important faulting occurs at the major                border faults of asymmetrical (half-graben) spreading cells and at              the accommodation zones that link them to adjacent cells. Typical               examples of these feature are present in the MARK Area (23\"N on the             Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and can be investigated by Alvin in 1992.                        A joint U.S./French (F.A.R.A.) program of 20 dives to will be              attempted investigate the surface manifestations of extensional                 tectonics in the southern part of the MARK Area about 100 km south              of the Kane Transform. Two major geophysically defined structures               will be investigated. 1.) The primary target will be the zone                   teleseismic and microseismic activity along the steep eastern                   median valley wall at about 22'30'N (Toomey et al., 1985; 1988).                This is interpreted as a seismically active fault zone and perhaps              a juvenile detachment fault. 2.) The secondary target will be the               accommodation zone at the north end of the same spreading cell.                 This lies at the surface intersection of a zone at the north end of             the same spreading cell.  This lies at the surface intersection of              a major north-dipping intra-crustal reflector identified in recent              multichannel seismic reflection studies that may be a low-angle                 oblique-slip fault (lateral ramp).                                                   The Alvin dives will permit detailed mapping and structural                measurement of various features (fault surfaces, shear zones,                   foliations, lineations, dikes and flows, etc.) in outcrops of                   deformed basement rocks. The goal is to use the correlation between             seismic and geologic data to help bridge the gap between tectonic               processes and the creation of near-axial bathymetric features.",
