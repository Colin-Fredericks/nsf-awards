 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223212  Schrag    This research is in the general area of conformational dynamics in  polymer molecules in solution.  Experimental studies of the  oscillatory flow birefringence (OFB) and viscoelasticity (VE) of  polymer solutions subjected to small-amplitude, periodically time-  varying shear flows will be carried out under conditions that will  explore the entire motional regime of importance in these  experiments.  Some investigations will utilize custom  instrumentation  for wide effective frequency range measurements in  highly viscous solvents which also provide important temperature  dependence information; other instruments providing moderate to  high frequency data will be employed to obtain wide frequency  coverage in low viscosity solvents.  Detailed experimental studies  of the effects of solute-induced solvent dynamics modifications,  solute concentration, temperature, molecular weight, overall chain   geometry (branching), solvent quality and different polymer and  solvent species on OFB and VE properties will be initiated or  continued, and compared with various theoretical predictions.   Generalized bead-spring model calculations of the frequency  dependence of the polymer contribution to VE and OFB properties  (dilute solutions) will be carried out for irregular combs  (randomly placed branch sites), randomly branched chains and chains  with spatially varying hydrodynamic interaction to assess the  potential of chain dynamics in general, and these techniques in  particular, for detailed branching characterization of polymers.   Experimental studies and theoretical predictions of OFB and VE  properties of dilute block copolymer solutions will also be  undertaken to quantitatively assess the characterization potential  of this combination of dynamics experiments for block copolymers.    This research is a combined experimental and modeling study of the  behavior of polymers in solution, especially with respect to the  influence of the solvent of the motions of the macromolecules.   ***",
