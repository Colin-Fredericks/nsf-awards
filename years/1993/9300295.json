In                                      addition, a U.S. undergraduate student will                                     participate in the research and gain experience                                 in working with Bangladesh geologists.  The                                     project will be carried out in collaboration                                    with Dr. Monirul Hoque of the Department of                                     Geology, University of Dhaka in Bangladesh.  It                                 seeks to study the quaternary sequences of the                                  Bengal basin for petrographic, mineralogic and                                  geochronologic evidence of the tectonic history                                 of the adjacent mountain belts.  Sample                                         collection and sedimentologic observations in                                   the field will be followed by detailed analysis                                 of sediment composition and fission-track                                       geochronology.  Modal analysis of sandstones                                    and heavy-metal studies, complemented by                                        fission-track analysis of detrital apatite and                                  zircon, will be used to evaluate changes in                                     source-area composition, to determine unroofing                                 trends and rates, and to test hypothesized                                      episodes of uplift.  These data will be                                         compared to existing data sets for equivalent                                   deposits of the Sub-Himalayan Siwalik sequence                                  and the Bengal fan.                                                                                                                                             Scope:  This project is likely to provide                                       detailed quantitative data on the stratigraphic                                 record of the Himalayan collision.  It will                                     provide research opportunity in an excellent                                    natural laboratory for a graduate and                                           undergraduate students in a U.S. university.                                    It can also help the host country by provding                                   an improved understanding of the regional                                       geological framework and basin history,                                         important in developing petroleum resources of                                  the Bengal basin.",
