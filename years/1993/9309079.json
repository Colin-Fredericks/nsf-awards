In recent months, pulsed operation of zinc selenide based semiconductor blue lasers  has been demonstrated at temperatures up to 250 K. Higher performance, namely  continuous laser operation at room temperature, is desirable but has not been achieved due  to the difficulties in obtaining stable, low resistivity p type ZnSe and low resistance ohmic  contacts to n  and p type ZnSe. Due to these difficulties, the blue lasers which have been  fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to date have large forward voltage drops (15 30V) and also excessive power dissipation.  We plan to develop ZnSe blue lasers using organometallic vapor phase epitaxy  (OMVPE), with an emphasis on the development of low resistivity p type ZnSe and lowresistance ohmic contacts. P doped ZnSe will be produced by nitrogen doping from the  novel alkyl sources, trimethylamine, triethylamine, and triisopropanolamine. Low resistance ohmic contacts will be fabricated using a unique approach based on gradedbandgap alloys of HgZnSe. ZnSe based laser structures will be fabricated using ZnSe/Znl_  xCdxSe/ZnSe single quantum wells and the techniques described above. ***",
