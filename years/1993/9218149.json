 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of ten U.S. scientists in a               U.S.-Japan Seminar on Development and Future Dimensions of                      Structural Testing Techniques.  The seminar, which will be held                 in Hawaii June 28 - July 1, 1993, is co-organized by Professor                  Stephen Mahin of the University of California, Berkeley, and                    Professor Tsuneo Okada of the University of Tokyo.  The seminar                 focuses on three main themes:  technical aspects of existing and                emerging technologies for experimental analysis of structural                   components and systems, theoretical considerations related to                   test planning and execution, and methodologies and procedures for               documentation, dissemination, and sharing of experimental data.                                                                                                 Among the topics for discussion are:  laboratory automation,                    advanced loading techniques, advanced instrumentation,                          advancement of data acquisition and analysis, fabrication of                    specimens, scale effects, rate of loading effects, establishment                of appropriate loading condiditons, innovative test concepts,                   dissemination of experimental data, correlation of experimental                 and analytical data, and development of design criteria on the                  basis of test results.  This is the first meeting between U.S.                  and Japanese researchers in this field in nearly a decade.  It is               expected that the seminar will result in several new assessments                of procedures and recommendations on development of methods,                    facilities, and dissemination of information. //",
