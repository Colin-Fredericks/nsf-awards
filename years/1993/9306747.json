 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award provides partial support for the 7th Annual Pennsylvania                  State University Plant Physiology Symposium, organized by the                   Pennsylvania State University Graduate Program in Plant Physiology.             The topic for 1993 is \"Plant Signals in Interactions with Other                 Organisms\".  The symposium brings together 26 papers focusing on                the mechanisms and molecules involved in recognizing other                      organisms (including conspecifics), cuing defensive responses to                pathogens, herbivores, and parasitic plants, establishing                       relationships with microbial symbionts, manipulating floral                     attractants, and attracting protective arthropods.  Spatial scales              of these phenomena range from extremely local (e.g., gene                       regulation) through intermediate (e.g., fungal elicitors) to long-              distance (signals amoung plant individuals).                                                                                                                    The approach is comparative and synthetic.  The goals are to                    produce state-of-the-art reviews of each topic, but provide                     treatments that permit the evaluation of similarities and                       differences among various signaling mechanisms so as to put them in             suitable functional, ecological, and evolutionary contests.                     Another goal is to clarify present confusion about the functions of             multiple signals, and potential interactions among multiple signals             in single systems.                                                                                                                                              Plans are also presented for supporting posters and attendance by               graduate student and postdoctoral level scholars.  The proceedings              will be published by the American Societh of Plant Physiology.",
