The physiological dimension of the proposed  research focuses on intensive physiological performances under  natural conditions -- maximal production and maximal work load,  and the accompanying demand for energy.  Two model cases of this  are the peak parental production expenditures that occur in  lactating females and the peak behavior expenditures that occur  in males associated with mating, aggression and defense.  In each  aspect of the study, performances are quantified in terms of  proximal energy balance and its phenotypic variation, and then  the ultimate success will be evaluated in terms of demography,  i.e., survival and future reproduction.  The direct relationship  of daily energy expenditure, and the intermediary relationship of  body mass and condition to survival will be examined, recognizing  that reproductive performances may operate at similar peak levels  for all members of a population and that the resulting  reproductive output is individually optimized.  In freeliving  animals we measure energy expenditure using stable isotopes, and  body condition (fat vs. lean components) by total body electrical  conductivity.  The upper limits of female reproduction, intake  and expenditure will be investigated by experimentally  manipulating maternal food supply.  Overwinter energy balance  will be evaluated by radiotelemetry of torpor patterns in  hibernating squirrels.  Flexibility and variable reproductive  maturity in yearling males will be evaluated in terms of energy  balance and an experimental manipulation of energy supply.  This  research should contribute to an integrated understanding of how  variation in the physiology and behavior of individuals in a  population translates into the expression of survival and  reproductive success over the cou rse of life history.  ***",
