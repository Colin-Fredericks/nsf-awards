 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animals use sound for communication, particularly for highly               species-specific mating calls, as in birds and insects.  In                     crickets, females ready to mate show an easily measurable behavior              of turning toward the source of an appropriate mating call.                     Insects also have accessible single nerve cells that permit testing             for the neuronal mechanisms of whole behavior patterns.  Particular             single nerve cells in parts of the brain of female crickets have                been found to respond physiologically to key features of the male               calling pattern.   In this project a synthesized call is used to                see how changes in the call pattern change behavioral                           responsiveness of the females, and specific explorations and                    lesions of nerve cells in the brain are used to determine the                   neural circuit underlying the response to the call.  Hormonal                   effects also modulate the responsiveness of females as they become              mature, and this model system allows a novel approach to test                   directly the effects of a particular hormone on the neural                      mechanisms underlying the auditory response behavior.  This work on             an accessible, novel model system will provide important                        comparisons with other hormonally-modulated communication, and                  provides groundwork for examining the molecular mechanisms for                  these modulating actions.  The impact of this work will be not only             on auditory neuroscience, but on work relating neural mechanisms to             behavioral plasticity and development in general, and on                        understanding breeding in insect populations.",
