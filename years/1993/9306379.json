 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Zhang to work                in combinatorics.  The investigator will continue his                           investigations in the topics of circuit covers, circuit                         decompositions, integer flows, and edge-colorings of graphs.  The               major targets in this project will be the circuit double cover                  conjecture and integer flow problems together with some related                 problems, including the question of 3-edge-coloring for some                    families of graphs.                                                                  The research is in the general area of                                     combinatorics.Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to               study how discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of               discrete systems is extremely important to modern communications.               For example, the design of large networks, as in telephone                      systems, and the design of algorithms in computer science all                   deal with discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial                 research.",
