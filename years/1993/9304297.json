 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304297  Lightfoot    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Kent Lightfoot and  his colleagues will continue their archaeological research at the  site of Fort Ross which is located on the northern California  coast. Fort Ross was founded in 1812 by the Russian-American  Company, a mercantile monopoly that represented Russia's interests  in the lucrative North Pacific fur trade. The fort served as a  staging area for sea otter and fur seal hunts along the coast of  California and as an agricultural community for raising crops and  livestock. It remained in the hands of the Russian-American company  until 1841 when it was disbanded and the land sold. Fort Ross was  a multiethnic community and included Russians as well as a sizeable  contingent of Alaskan Aleut Indians who were imported to hunt.  Finally, local Pomo Indians were also associated with the Fort and  performed a number of tasks. The goal of Dr. Lightfoot's research  is to understand the ethnic interactions which took place and to  gain insight into how acculturation occurred. To accomplish this,  he will continue archaeological excavation with a focus on the  inter-ethnic areas of the site where, documents indicate, mixed-  group families lived. Pomo women married both Russian and Aleut  men. Dr. Lightfoot will clear large areas to reveal individual  households. He will analyze artifacts collected to determine the  degree of cultural syncretism which took place. Through use of  survey, documents sources and both Pomo and Aleut informants, he  will also attempt to reconstruct the larger settlement pattern and  cultural landscape.    Culture contact and change are  dominant forces in today's world as  even the most remote areas are drawn into global interaction and  economic systems. Anthropologists wish to understand the processes  by which cultural accommodation and assimilation take place and the  New World, because of its large size and its relatively recent  contact with the Old has proven a fertile ground for such  investi gations. Dr. Lightfoot notes that researchers have tended to  work with simple models which posit direct contact between  Europeans and a single Native American group. In fact, the reality  was often  more complicated since exposure was often mediated by  other Indian societies. Fort Ross provides an excellent example and  through a detailed examination Dr. Lightfoot hopes to determine how  mediated change, with Aleuts as intermediaries, took place.     This research is important for several reasons. It will increase  our understanding of inter-ethnic interaction and the process of  culture change. It will shed new light on California's early  history and assist in the training of several graduate students.  ***",
