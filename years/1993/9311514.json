 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wood rot fungus Dactylium dendroides excretes large amounts of              the enzyme galactose oxidase (GOase) into the extracellular                     medium1.  GOase has been classified as an alcohol oxidase, using O2             to convert primary alcohols (RCH2OH) into aldehydes (RCHO) and                  H202. GOase can react with a wide variety of primary alcohols,                  includingmany carbohydrates, such as glucose, cellobiose, maltose,              lactose, sucrose, and polymeric carbohydrates, including cellulose.             Although the oxidase reaction of GOase has been known for decades,              the main biological purpose of GOase has always been a puzzle.                  Recent work in the Branchaud laboratory indicates that GOase                    possesses multiple activities, including an iron reductase                      activity.  Fe(II) produced by the iron reductase activity and H202              from the oxidase activity could combine to produce hydroxyl                     radicals via the Fenton reaction.  The PI proposes that the                     principle activity of GOase in nature is to generate hydroxyl                   radicals for the purpose of breaking down wood cellulose and other              complex polymers.  The research examines and characterizes the                  multiple activities of this enzyme.                                             %%%                                                                             Galactose oxidase produces hydroxyl radical, one of the reactive,               broad specificity oxidants known.  Such a biocatalyst has potential             application in oxidatively degrading complex biomolecules in toxic              wastes and in developing more environmentally friendly bleaching                technologies.",
