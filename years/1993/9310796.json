With these resources NYSERNet will;       1. Establish and support new high bandwidth applications and  technical and end-user users groups;       2. Expand technical support and user services support for  its members and affiliates;       3. Provide significant advice and direction to New York  State's K-12 National Research and Education Network (NREN)  access efforts.       The challenge facing NYSERNet include: 1) delivering new  capabilities, such as: Image Transfer, Multi-Media Database  Access and Multi-Media Mail; interactive-network based distance  learning; and the other applications described above;               2) continually improving network services in support of research  and education to a widely varied and increasing user community of  researchers, scholars, and educators in the natural sciences,  social sciences, mathematics, engineering, humanities, and health  sciences; 3) insuring that, after the next several years of  planned changes to the NSFNET, NYSERNET's affiliates continue to  enjoy the interconnectedness they now have, both nationally and  internationally; and 4) increasing the utility of the Network to  both sophisticated and new users.       There are four dimensions of growth and development of this  community: 1) there will be more users at more NYSERNet member  and affiliate sites; 2) each user will make more use of the  network; 3) each use will be more complex; and 4) there will be  more new applications, especially in the areas of interactive  computing, visualization, and collaboration.  ***",
