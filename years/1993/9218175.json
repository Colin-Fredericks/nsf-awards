 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of 14 U.S. scientists in a                U.S.-Japan Seminar on the Origins, Development, and Spread of                   Prehistoric North Pacific-Bering Sea Martime Cultures, to be held               in Hawaii May 31 - June 6, 1993.  The co-organizers are Professor               Allen McCartney of the University of Arkansas and Professor Hiroaki             Okada of Hokkaido University.  In addition to the U.S. and Japanese             participants, scholars from Canada and Russia will be invited.  The             purpose of the seminar is to discuss archaeological data, methods,              and theoretical approaches appropriate to the study of prehistoric              maritime adaptations in the North Pacific-Bering Sea regions, with              emphasis on parallel and divergent cultural processes and possible              cultural connections between Asia and North America.                                                                                                            Knowledge of the dynamics and history of maritime adaptations is                basic to a full understanding of North Pacific and Bering Sea                   native cultures.  Earliest peoples reaching the Japanese islands                from the Asian mainland and reaching Alaska from Chukotka Peninsula             during Pleistocene times may have been, in part, maritime adapted.              Subsequent coastal societies of much of the past 10,000 years have              exploited the rich marine resources of these regions, giving rise               to historic Eskimos, Aluets, and Northwest Coast Indians in North               America and to Eskimos, Maritime Chukchi, Koriaks, and Ainu in                  Asia.  This conference will be the first opportunity for so many                archaeologists working in contiguous areas to discuss substantive,              methodological, and theoretical issues in detail.",
