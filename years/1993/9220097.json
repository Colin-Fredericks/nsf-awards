 "awd_abstract_narration": "My students and I are engaged in studies of the vertebrate                 neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems with an emphasis on                   function and evolution. We examine limb kinematics, muscle design               and spinal cord organization using a variety of techniques                      including high-speed photography and electromyography.                               The particular focus of this study is functional analysis of               the Avian shoulder. The project is designed to yield basic                      morphological and physiological data requisite for the eventual                 modeling and testing of the neural control of wing movements in                 birds. Evidence exists from studies of muscle is ordered according              to specific synaptic properties of the motoneuron which relate to               size. Theoretical considerations, however, have resulted in                     alternative hypotheses for the ordering of motor unit within birds.             To help clarify this important issue, we are studying the                       physiological profiles of isolated flight muscle motor units as                 well as their peripheral  and central anatomical organization in                two species with contrasting flight styles.                                          This study is designed to address fundamental questions                    concerning the evolution of neuromuscular organization across the               major vertebrate groups. Studies of birds will also provide data                useful for evaluating current interpretations (based primarily on               studies of the fossil bird Archaeopteryx) of the evolutionary                   origin of wings from the shoulder of early Mesozoic terrestrial                 archosaurs. Until we fully understand the musculoskeletal and                   neuromuscular basis of flight in a extant species, our                          understanding of the fundamental issue of the evolution of flight               among tetrapods will be hampered.",
