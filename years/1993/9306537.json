 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306537  Lighton    If any animals on Earth could as easily have evolved on a  different planet, in terms of sheer difference from humans, those  animals are insects.  For example, insects have arrived at  entirely different answers from ours to the problem of breathing,  or obtaining oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide from their  tissues.  Air is delivered directly to their tissues via internal  tubes or tracheae, rather than indirectly via the bloodstream, as  with us.  This allows insects to attain far greater metabolic  intensity, but imposes a penalty in terms of water-loss rates  from their respiratory systems.  Most insects exist in a  perpetual state of near dehydration because of their high surface  area to volume ration, so minimizing respiratory water loss rates  is extremely important to them.  They do this by breathing at  very infrequent intervals - perhaps once every five minutes in  insects as small as ants, using a complicated and poorly-  understood breathing strategy called discontinuous ventilation.  The proposed work will explore the occurrence, mechanisms,  biophysics, metabolic modulation, and water-loss significance of  discontinuous ventilation, using ants as experimental insects.  Because insects are by far the most numerous and successful  animals on the planet, the way they breathe is not only  intrinsically interesting; it has implications ranging from  applied science through theoretical biology to evaluating the  effects of pesticides and pollutants, and the biological  significance of global temperature changes.  ***",
