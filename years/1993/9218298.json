 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years there has been a renewed interest in                       the problem of unraveling the various possible causes of                        allocyclic variability in alluvial basin fills (e.g.                            tectonics, climate, subsidence, eustasy).  One approach to                      this problem has been the development of quantitative,                          physically based models for the filling of sedimentary                          basins, but these models have already evolved well beyond                       the data available to test and refine them.  There is a                         continuing need for new high-resolution data sets that can                      be used to evaluate the basic predictions of these models.                      The main goal of this project is to produce such a data set                     from the superbly exposed Tertiary alluvial systems of the                      SE margin of the Ebro Basin, Spain.   PI's will collect                         closely spaced paleomagnetic sections and measurements of                       gravel distribution and channel characteristics in three                        dimensions, in at least two adjoining alluvial fans of                          different sizes.  These data, together with ongoing modeling                    efforts, by the PI's will provide insight on how various                        causes of allocyclic progradation can be distinguished and                      in particular on the identification of true \"syntectonic\"                       conglomerates.",
