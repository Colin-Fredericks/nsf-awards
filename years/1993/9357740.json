 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores two new approaches to  engineering design.  Each of these threads is composed  of   synergistic subprojects; these subprojects  combine   analytical mathematics,  numerical simulation,  symbolic reasoning, and physical   experiments.    The  first approach is to actively use chaos to improve the    designs of various  engineering systems.  One example of this  is causing gases   to burn more  effectively by induction of  chaotic mixing in a combustion   chamber.  A small,  well-placed obstruction can interact with the inflow and with   the  chamber's  geometry to cause large effects:  chaos's  symptomatic   ``sensitive dependence on  initial conditions.''  These effects are tested both   experimentally and with  computational fluid dynamic simulations. Another example is    the use of chaos to  broaden the capture range of a phase-locked loop circuit.      The second  approach to improving engineering design is  through computer   automation.  The  ultimate goal of this  endeavor is a suite of programs that   explores different  high-level analysis and design paradigms.  Such tools would   not  only  streamline an engineer's problem-solving task, but  actually   amplify   creativity.  The first step  is a program that autonomously   constructs  mathematical  models from information about a system,  presented in a   variety of forms and  formats: measurements  made directly on the physical device;   a user's  observations  described to the program in varying degrees of   precision,  symbolically or graphically; partial models and hypotheses    suggested by a user;  and general mathematical theory that is  encoded in the   program's knowledge base.",
