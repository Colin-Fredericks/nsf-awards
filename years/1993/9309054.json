 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309054  Hudak  Shared-address distributed-memory massively parallel  processing (MPP) system offer the simplicity of a single  address space while maintaining the potential for teraflops  performance.  However, to obtain reasonable efficiency on  these systems, the programmer or compiler must specify and  appropriate distribution of work and data among the processors  and the physically distributed memories.  This project will  address the problem of determining the optimal distributions  for a given parallel application.    Ongoing research in compilation for MPP's has yielded a  collection of techniques for the specification of work and  data distributions for individual data-parallel loops.  This  project will combine those techniques with flow-graph  representations of data-parallel programs to generate code  which specifics the creation and alteration of work and data  distributions.  The distributions will be designed maximum  efficiency across program constructs for altering the flow of  control of a program, such as conditional statements (e.g., if  statements) and procedure calls.    The research will lead to the development of a software system  named DPF+, a new system that will analyze an partition data-  parallel programs as well as provide an efficient environment  for object-oriented data-parallel programming.  Data parallel  program can be built from user-defined objects, with the DFT+  compiler automatically tuning each object's procedures for  high performance on an existing shared-address spaced  multiprocessor system.  This research will greatly increase  the usability of MPPs, the portability of parallel programs  and the performance level achieved by users.  ***",
