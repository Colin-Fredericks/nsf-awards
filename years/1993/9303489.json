 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four investigators will study a variety of problems in                     algebraic topology.  (1) Edgar H. Brown, Jr. will continue his                  applications of the machinery developed in \"Continuous Cohomology               and Real Homotopy Theory\" to mod p homotopy theory, classifying                 spaces of foliations, and real homotopy type of Kaehler                         manifolds.  (2) Kiyoshi Igusa will study the relationship between               the higher Reidemeister torsion invariants (algebraic K-theory                  invariants associated to the diffeomorphism space of a smooth                   manifold) and the simpler cyclic homology groups associated to                  circle bundles.  In particular, he has a plan to prove a                        complexified version of a theorem of Bokstedt, which if proved                  would give an explicit realization of these difficult invariants.               The methods he will use are Morse theory, algebraic K-theory, and               cyclic homology.  (3) Jerome P. Levine will work on a direct                    topological description of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer rho-invariant               of an odd-dimensional manifold, and determining when it is a                    homotopy invariant.  In particular, he has a conjectured formula                for the jump along a path of representations.  He is also                       investigating the possible use of the algebraic version of the                  rho-invariant (a multisignature) to determine the torsion-free                  part of the homology concordance surgery group (Gamma-group) of                 Cappell-Shaneson.  He will continue to study the \"algebraic                     closure\" construction in group theory, particularly in its                      application to link concordance questions.  Several geometric                   questions reduce to purely algebraic questions about the                        algebraic closure of the free group.  (4) Daniel Ruberman will                  treat a number of problems in gauge theory related to the                       topology of low dimensional manifolds.  One main aspect of the                  work is the further development of gauge theory on 4-manifolds                  with boundary, via the moduli space of finite energy                            anti-self-dual connections.  Applications include obstructions to               the representation of homology classes by surfaces of low genus                 as well as a new knot cobordism invariant.  The project also                    includes a study of gauge-theoretic invariants of connections on                3-manifolds, and the relation of such invariants to the topology                of the space of flat SU(2) connections.  These invariants lead to               potentially new obstructions to a group's being the fundamental                 group of a 3-manifold.                                                               These various projects concern the topology and geometry of                manifolds, which are spaces locally resembling the familiar                     Euclidean spaces.  Three and four-dimensional manifolds provide                 models for the physical world of space and time, while manifolds                of higher dimension arise naturally as the parameter spaces for                 complicated systems involving many variables.  The fundamental                  problems about such spaces include their classification in terms                of numerical and algebraic invariants, the classification of                    their symmetries (or diffeomorphisms) and the determination of                  how one space may sit inside another (as a knotted curve sits                   inside of 3-dimensional space).  Brown is perfecting some of the                algebraic machinery required.  Igusa's part of the project                      studies ways in which complicated families of symmetries may be                 understood in terms of algebraic invariants derived from                        corresponding families of matrices.  Levine is investigating the                interpretation in topology of an analytically defined invariant,                as well its uses in the theory of knots.  Ruberman will use the                 Yang-Mills equations of mathematical physics to understand the                  nature of four-dimensional manifolds and the two-dimensional                    surfaces which they contain.",
