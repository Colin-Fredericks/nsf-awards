 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a project designed to establish the                         relationship between environmental temperature and the                          Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H) ratio in unexchangeable hydrogen in                    cellulose extracted from trees from locations covering a wide range             of climatic conditions.  The project will ascertain to what degree              factors other than temperature affect the Deuterium/Hydrogen (D/H)              ratio.  Among these might be humidity, growth history, the nature               of the root system and its relationship to the source water used by             the trees, and generally the relationship between the D/H ratio in              cellulose and the hydrology of the area.   The collecting sites are             located in Oregon, California, and Manitoba, Canada.  The                       resolution of these factors will allow the retrieval of climatic                information from many trees from different locations.  The                      Deuterium/Hydrogen records currently indicate unexpectedly that the             rate of global warming is greater in the 19th century than in the               20th century.  This is contrary to what is expected if global                   warming were directly related to the increase in atmospheric C02.               The confirmation of this result is critical to our understanding of             the role that C02 plays in affecting the earth's climate.",
