The 4 years will be divided into three 2 year cycles with 32                    teachers in each cycle.  In the first year each teacher will                    upgrade his/her content knowledge and pedagogical                               techniques.  The teachers will attend, in the Spring, a one                     week orientation meeting to create working teams each to                        consist of eight science teachers and eight math teachers                       (designated as Fellows), one National Re:  Learning Faculty                     member and to college faculty (one science, one                                 mathematics).  These teams will work together throughout the                    orientation and the Summer institute.  During the                               orientation a detailed Summer program schedule will be                          developed based on the specific needs of the Fellows.  An                       introduction will include the use of electronic mail                            networks and computer skills.  In the four week summer                          institute the Fellows will formulate essential questions,                       participate in experiments:  design, hands-on                                   laboratory/field work, data collection and analysis and                         problem solving and developing pedagogical skills in                            investigative style classes.  In the second year the Fellows                    will attend a spring orientation to assess the progress of                      implementation of math/science investigations in each school                    to develop additional essential questions and investigations                    and to identify pedagogical issues for examination during                       that summer.  They will also receive extensive training in                      classroom observation and debriefing techniques and learn                       skills of consultation and conflict resolution.  At the end                     of the project 96 math/science colleagues (each fellow                          mentoring 4 teachers).  The fellows will also work as                           consultants in some 200 other essential schools located in                      states across the nation.  Cost sharing is 13%.",
