 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is concerned with separating particles suspended in a                fluid by using field flow fractionation implemented with an                     ultrasonic acoustic force.  In field flow fractionation (FFF), the              fluid particle mixture is forced to flow through a thin channel.                A force perpendicular to the direction of flow is applied.  The                 action of the force on the particles is a function of the nature                of the force, and the identity of the particles.  To accomplish a               particular separation of particles, one selects a force which acts              with differing magnitude on the particles to be separated.  As the              particles move down the slit, the particles acted upon more                     strongly by the force move to the flow cell walls (if for example,              the force acts towards the walls) where they slow down since the                flow near the walls is slower.  Those particles which were not                  caused to move towards the flow cell walls travel with a faster                 velocity and begin to distance themselves from the slower moving                particles in the wall vicinity.  Eventually, at the cell exit, the              center moving particles elute first, and the slower moving                      particles exit later, thereby creating the separation.                                                                                                          The utility of FFF for a particular separation depends on the                   ability to select a force which can drive the perpendicular                     separation.  In this study, ultrasonic acoustic forces are used.                Standing waves with a frequency on the order of 1 Mhz are set up                across the flow cell, and the particles move by virtue of a second              order acoustic pressure force as given by equation (1) of the                   proposal.  The key advantage of using acoustic forces is that the               acoustic force can separate particles based on differing volume,                density or speed of sound in the particle medium.  The research                 will design and conduct ultrasonic FFF flow cell, and investigate               the ability to separate particles based on size and density.",
