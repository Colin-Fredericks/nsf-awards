 "awd_abstract_narration": "Li will use the concept of dual algebra to study the structure             of bounded linear operators acting on infinite dimensional Hilbert              space.  In particular, the dilation theory of contraction                       operators, the invariant subspace problem, and the reflexivity                  problem will be considered for more general classes of operators                and dual algebras generated by more than one operator.  Li will                 also continue her study of control theory via the commutant lifting             theorem.                                                                             The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
