We will attempt to demonstrate the                                              first observation of Rabi                                                       oscillations (RO) and resonant                                                  propagation of strong femtosecond                                               pulses in a semiconductor.  Rabi                                                oscillations and resonant pulse                                                 propagation, even self-induced                                                  transparency (SIT), have been seen                                              in atomic systems, but have not yet                                             been observed in semiconductors.                                                Our many-body calculations have                                                 predicted that RO may be seen in                                                semiconductors when femetosecond                                                laser pulses shorter than the                                                   dephasing T2 times are employed.                                                Also, these calculations predict                                                significant modifications of strong                                             pulse propagation and self-induced                                              transparency in semiconductors, as                                              compared to atomic systems.  One of                                             our goals is to perform cross-                                                  correlation experiments for pulses                                              tuned to the excition resonance in                                              a GaAs-AlGaAs multiple quantum well                                             sample to verify these predictions                                              and demonstrate the differences                                                 between SIT in semiconductors                                                   versus atomic systems.                                                          We plan to quantitatively                                                       investigate carrier relaxation and                                              dephasing in quantum wells as well                                              as in bulk materials under well-                                                defined conditions.  Theoretically,                                             we recently found a new undamped                                                acoustic plasmon mode in bulk                                                   semiconductors for suitable                                                     nonequilibrium carrier                                                          distributions. According to our                                                 calculations, the related ultrafast                                             carrier-carrier scattering and                                                  dephasing should be significantly                                               different for intrinsic, n- and p-                                              doped materials, since the                                                      electrons in low momentum states                                                are primarily responsible for the                                               acoustic plasmon damping.  Spectral                                             hole burning in the gain region of                                              semiconductors will be performed,                                               and polarization dephasing times                                                will be measured using the width of                                             the burned holes.  These                                                        measurements, which will be                                                     compared with our calculations,                                                 should yield important information                                              on carrier relaxation and dephasing                                             rates.",
