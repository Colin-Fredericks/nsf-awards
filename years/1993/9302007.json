The participants,               who will come from a academia, private and government research                  institutes, and industry, are mostly experts in either                          constrained approximation or constrained optimization.  While                   there is a nonempty intersection in the problems and techniques                 familiar to these two groups, there has not been much interaction               and cross-fertilization between them.  The purpose of the                       proposed workshop is to provide a pleasant and productive setting               for participants to engage in an interchange of ideas, to foster                collaborative research among the participants, and to expose                    young researchers and graduate students to the exciting                         mathematics being done at the forefront of these fields.",
