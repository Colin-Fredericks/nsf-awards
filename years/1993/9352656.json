The  mathematics faculty recognizes the need to utilize a computer  algebra system in these courses so that students spend less  time manipulating symbols and more time clarifying and  visualizing mathematical principles.  The center is serving as  a classroom for weekly precalculus-calculus sessions. It is  also serving as the location of weekly supplementary courses  for precalculus-calculus enrichment. Finally, it is available  to students outside of class for completing homework  assignments and for attempting to find answers to their own  independent questions. Students are improving their  communication skills as they work together in the  laboratory/classroom setting and as they integrate prose and  mathematical output into their assignments.        ***",
