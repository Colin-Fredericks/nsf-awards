 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is aimed at development of a novel method of                       controlling N2O emissions from fluidized bed coal combustors,                   involving injection of sodium vapor at very low levels into                     the flue gas leaving the fluidized bed.  The objectives of the                  Phase I effort are: (1) Demonstrate that sodium injection can                   cause substantially complete decomposition of N2O at                            conditions relevant to coal-fired fluid bed combustors; (2)                     Obtain chemical kinetic data for comparison with predictions                    of kinetic calculations; and, (3) Complete that comparison.                     Laboratory experiments will be carried out in a system                          consisting of four subsystems, a system for blending fixed                      gases and vaporized liquids, a sodium vaporizer, a reactor,                     and an analytical train.  The reactor to be employed consists                   of a quartz tube into which a length of steel tubing projects,                  with the main flow gas going through the resulting annular                      space and the nitrogen-sodium mixture through the steel                         tubing.  The analytical system will be centered around an NDIR                  instrument for N2O, with the analytical train also including a                  CO analyzer, a Pulsed Fluorescent SO2 analyzer, and a                           Chemiluminescent NOx analyzer.  Successful completion of the                    Phase I studies will provide a lab-scale demonstration of the                   process and provide a clear understanding of the chemistry                      involved.                                                                                                                                                       Considerable effort has been expended on development of fluid                   bed combustion technology for burning of coal with low SOx and                  NOx emissions.  Unfortunately, this technology approach leads                   to production of copious amounts of N2O emissions, an                           unacceptably serious drawback since N2O is both a greenhouse                    gas and a major contributor to depletion of the ozone layer.                    Accordingly, development of a means of dealing with this                        problem is of major importance to the viability of fluidized                    bed combustors for burning of coal.",
