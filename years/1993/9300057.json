 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Environmental                    Sciences at the University of Virginia to continue a                            successful REU SITE.  The 10 week research program for                          undergraduates will teach basic principles of ecology, and                      the methods by which scientists increase our understanding                      of the natural world will be detailed. The program will be                      comprised of three phases: I--Two weeks of formal lectures                      detailing the scientific method, hypothesis testing and                         experimental design; II-- 6-1/2 weeks of data collection and                    experimentation; and III--1-1/2 weeks of data analysis,                         interpretation and communication of results. The goal is                        show students how to \"do\" science and then give them an                         opportunity to conduct original and independent field                           research. Students are sought from a diversity of                               backgrounds, interests and home institutions. The focus of                      the program will be on testing hypotheses related to plant-                     animal interactions and/or population dynamics--topics that                     are felt to have considerable basic/applied interest, and                       high heuristic value. Students will conduct research in a                       field-station setting at the Blandy Experimental Farm, a                        biological field station of the University of Virginia, and                     will be immersed in a community of 15-20 graduate/post-                         doctoral researchers. Field trips will focus on issues                          related to conservation; a weekly seminar series at the Farm                    will also add to the research experience. A bio-ethics                          component is also included in the program consisting of                         weekly lectures/discussions lead by Mr. David Bosco,                            Instructor of Philosophy and Religious Studies at James                         Madison University. Faculty wages, and fees for laboratory                      space and dorm rooms are contributed as cost share items.",
