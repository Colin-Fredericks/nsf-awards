 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finding the exact solution to a number of fundamental  optimization problems (such as Bin Packing, Travelling  Salesperson Problem, Vehicle Routing Problems) is very likely to  be intractable.  One method of gaining an understanding of these  problems is to study them as stochastic models.  It is then  possible to estimate the average behavior of the optimal solution  and develop procedures that will produce solutions that, on  average, are close to the optimal.  The past research of the  investigator has demonstrated the relevance and the power of  various methods of this approach.  The main objective of this  research is to make further methodological progress in the  understanding of these stochastic models.  In an overwhelming number of practical situations, one is faced  with the problem of choosing, among a usually astronomical number  of possible configurations, the one with the lowest cost  (=optimal).  Even in very simple cases, this is intractable.  Since these problems must nonetheless be dealt with, getting a  deeper understanding of them is a goal of considerable  importance. One way to gain insight is to study these problems  under random input. Past research has demonstrated the relevance  to that study of sophisticated tools from various branches of  mathematics. The main objective of the present proposal is to  make further methodological progress through the study of a  number of concrete questions that crystalize the limits of  today's techniques.",
