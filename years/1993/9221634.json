 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal  of the project is to develop accurate and                             easy to use seismic hazard forecast models utilizing                            the neural network approach.                                                                                                                                    The neural network is a very versatile and efficient                            approach.  The main advantages of using the neural                              network approach in this project are that (1) it is                             not necessary to predecide about the mathematical                               form for the model in this approach, (2) it can                                 include a large number of variables without unduly                              increasing the computational effort and (3) it can                              easily update and improve the model as more data                                becomes available.  It is proposed to develop                                   models to predict the spatial distribution of                                   Modified Mercelli Intensity for the western, mid-                               western and eastern United States.  Also the models                             to predict the ground motion parameters such as                                 peak ground acceleration and response spectra will                              be developed for the western United States.                                                                                                                     The proposed study will be conducted over a period                              of two years.  During the first year, data collection,                          processing, and model formulation will be                                       undertaken and generic models for each of the three                             regions of the country will be formulated.  The                                 second year will be devoted to rigorous testing and                             fine-tuning of the models.  Sensitivity studies will                            be performed to identify the important input                                    variables..  Comparison with conventional seismic                               hazard/risk analysis models will be made to                                     evaluate the performance of the proposed models.                                Finally, application computer softwares will be                                 developed for public dissemination.",
