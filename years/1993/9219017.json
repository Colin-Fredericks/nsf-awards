 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goals of this project are to understand and describe              in detail the macromolecular interactions and biochemical                       mechanisms mediating transcription termination by RNA polymerase                III.  While important for understanding the synthesis of a number               of important small cellular and viral RNAs, the experiments                     proposed should also contribute to understanding fundamental                    biochemical properties shared by all RNA polymerases.  Experiments              are described that provide a further test of a proposed model for               termination by RNA polymerase III, in which transcription                       termination is dependent of the stability of the RNA-DNA hybrid                 upstream of the termination signal.  Using methods already                      developed that permit the uncoupling of multiple mechanistic steps              in transcription termination by RNA polymerase III, the                         relationship between polymerase pausing and transcription                       termination at weak and strong terminators will be analyzed.  The               identity and determinants of the cis-acting sequence signals for                transcription termination by RNA polymerase III will be further                 investigated with attention given to their role in promoting                    polymerase pausing and /or release from the DNA template.  Protein-             DNA cross-linking studies will permit the identification of                     subunits of RNA polymerase III that interact with the template, and             will perhaps allow identification of polymerase-DNA interactions                that are altered at the termination signal, relative to those                   present in a transcription elongation complex.  All these                       experiments will be conducted using purified RNA polymerase III and             \"tailed\" linear DNA templates that permit the analysis of                       activities associated with the RNA polymerase molecule in the                   absence of other proteins normally required for accurate and                    efficient transcription initiation by RNA polymerase III.  In some              cases, the results obtained will be confirmed by analysis of                    transcription reactions in oocyte nuclear extracts.                             %%%%                                                                            Cells and tissues regulate protein synthesis by several mechanisms              including the amount of RNA produced both as messenger RNA which                codes for proteins, and other forms of RNA which are components of              the protein synthesizing apparatus of the cell (5s RNA and tRNA).               This study focusses on the structure and stability of the RNA-DNA               hybrid which is formed when RNA polymerase III synthesizes RNA in               a complex of the three macromolecules.  The structure and the                   stability of these complexes once understood will yield methods to              produce greater quantities of proteins.  These studies contribute               to biotechnological applications involving specific protein                     production in cells.",
