 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222763  Levin      The purpose of this project is to investigate the origin of sex  differences in social behavior by examining bird song.  Bird  studies have focused on species in which only males sing, have  identified specific areas in male brains that control song  behavior, and have shown that these areas are turned on and off  by testosterone.  Non-singing females of these species don't have  these well-developed brain regions and lack significant levels of  testosterone in their blood.  Dr. Levin will expand this  understanding of the origin of sex differences in behavior by  looking at a tropical species in which both sexes sing, in which  sex differences are maintained in songs.  She plans to raise  young birds hearing only one male song, only female song, the  song of both sexes, or no song.  Examining what these birds learn  to sing and how their hormone levels change during song learning  will help reveal the roles played by hormones and social role  models in the development of sex differences in song.  She will  test any suggested role of hormones in song development by  examining song development in surgically castrated birds.      While the issue of the origin of sex differences in behavior,  particularly in humans, is a topic of much interest, it is  difficult to address in a rigorous, systematic fashion.  Studies  of bird species offer a unique opportunity to do so because the  avian nervous system is so amenable to study and because of the  vast array of species differences in the relative roles played by  males and females, population differences in sex-species  behaviors within one species, and individual differences within a  population that can be found among birds.  Avian systems have  been successfully used to generate and test proposed models in  other areas of interest, such as the inter-relationships of  hormones, aggression, and social environment, and the results of  these studies have proven to be remarkably parallel to those from  studies of primates and other ve rtebrates.  Thus, it seems likely  that simply by prudently choosing appropriate species, we can  exploit avian systems to reveal the mechanisms that might be  associated with the process of sexual differentiation in the  behavior of vertebrates.",
