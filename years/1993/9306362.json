Project funding will enable Dr. Zikri Altun of                                  Marmara University to work with Dr. Steven Manson                               and his team at Georgia State University.                                       Additionally, Dr. Manson will visit Dr. Altun's                                 laboratory and work with his team.   This new                                   collaborative research effort will focus on                                     photoionization of open-shell atoms using many-                                 body perturbation theory with particular emphasis                               on the very difficult transition metals and rare                                earth elements, and photoionization with                                        excitation of closed-shell atoms.  With the                                     advent of the new powerful synchrotron light                                    sources, these kinds of systems will be more                                    readily explored, thus rendering the proposed                                   studies quite timely.
