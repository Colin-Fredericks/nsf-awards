 "awd_abstract_narration": "The earliest phase of nervous system development is                             characterized by large scale movements of cells.  First,                        these cells must separate from the outer layer of the early                     embryo; secondly, they must obtain specific positions                           within the embryo.  To reach these positions, the cells in                      many cases must migrate considerable distances.  Upon                           reaching their proper location, they become stationary and                      form stable contacts with each other.  It is of great                           importance to understand on a molecular level how these                         cellular processes are controlled.  This project will use                       the embryonic optic lobe as a model system to analyze the                       molecular basis of morphogenetic movements during neuronal                      development.  Using a variety of markers, the  position and                     movement of these cells can be readily followed throughout                      normal and mutant development.  Experiments will focus on                       the phenotypic and molecular characterization of a gene                         called sine oculis (so), which is necessary for the                             development of the optic lobe.  Mutations of so cause                           failure of optic lobe invagination.  Most recent analyses                       show that so encodes a putative transcription factor, that                      is a protein that is capable of turning on or off the                           expression of other genes.  It is anticipated that the                          analysis of so and its function during the development of                       the optic lobe will answer many important questions.",
