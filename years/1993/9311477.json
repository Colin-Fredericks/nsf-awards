 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is focused on estimation problems involving infinite  dimensional parameters, such as cumulative distribution  functions, characteristic functions, error distributions in  regression models etc. Methodologically, a geometric approach has  been successfully developed to solve nonparametric estimations  problems from i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed)  data. This approach is also applicable to a wide range of  nonparametric and semiparametric problems, in which the  traditional restrictive i.i.d. assumptions can be relaxed. The  main emphasis is on the estimation of differentiable statistical  functionals. For a general differentiable transformation of the  unknown abstract parameter, the asymptotically efficient  estimates will be constructed using the geometric approach.  Complex statistical data that are collected in areas such as  medical, econometric, and engineering reliability studies often  cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical methods. The  diversity of people in clinical trials, the multitude of inputs  affecting economic outputs, and the intricate interaction of  components affecting the performance of sophisticated electronics  or equipment do not permit the use of simple statistical modeling  techniques. These applications require instead a new methodology  that is more flexible and yet does not sacrifice information  unnecessarily. The proposed research will develop methods for  estimating key features of complex statistical data.  These  methods do not depend on the validity of traditional assumptions.  Results of this work will be applicable to a rich variety of  areas, including the estimation of drug efficacy, a population  profile of potential patients, proficiency characteristics for  industrial output, and the probability of successful operation of  electronic equipment.",
