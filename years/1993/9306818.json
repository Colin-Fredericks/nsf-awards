 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306818  Dingle    Because most behavioral variation among individuals probably results from  interactions between genes and environments, it is advantageous to study the  behavior of different genotypes across a range of environmental conditions.  Using  this perspective, Drs. Dingle and Carroll will compare social, quantitative genetic,  and populational influences on the tactical decisions of soapberry bugs from two  different environments.  Working with an insect species permits raising many  generations in a short period of time, and so increases the chances of obtaining  reliable results.  Drs. Dingle and Carroll will experimentally manipulate the  environments that these animals experience to reveal how genes and environment  interact to create behavioral differences between populations and among  individuals.    The approach taken here exemplifies a new model paradigm for the study of  behavioral evolution.  Studies of animal behavior have previously examined  ecological and social causes of individual differences, but hardly any have  attempted to analyze how genes and the environment (nature and nurture)  influence behavior together.  Human psychology is an exception to this  generalization:  By combining pedigree information with environmental analyses,  the study of human behavior has advanced on levels little explored for other  animals.  Because so many individuals can be raised so quickly, and because they  have been found to have as much behavioral variation as do other kinds of  animals, insects are excellent model organisms for this kind of study.",
