 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320138  Dubowsky  This award, in the Small Grants for Exploratory Research,  supports  preliminary investigation of the potential role of robotics in  field conservation, restoration, and preservation, using as a  demonstration the exploration and later restoration of the historic  Navy vessel, the USS Constitution.  Thi effort seeks to determine  appropriate design approaches for multirobot systems to be used in  making measurements, detecting defects, and ultimately  participating in repair and restoration operations, and to identify  basic problems facing such robotic applications.  Questions include  modes of cooperation, communication demands, sensing demands, need  for minimalist computing, and need for separate systems for  inspection and remediation.  The project is expected to yield  valuable insights into the appropriate design and employment of  robots for such field conservation and restoration operations, and  also should lead to a highly-visible demonstration of robotic  capabilities in less-structured environments.  9It might also make  a good test of practical potential of the Brooksian approach to  multirobot architecture).  The PI will be working with  conservators, conservation scientists, and the Naval Historian for  the Constitution, and the overall operations will be guided by an  advisory panel.",
