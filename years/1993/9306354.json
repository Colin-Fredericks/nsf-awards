 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to continue an experimental and                  theoretical study of the interaction between redscale, an insect                pest of citrus, and Aphytis, an insect parasite that has been                   introduced and keeps redscale under economically satisfactory                   control in many areas in the world. The population abundance of                 redscale is not only kept far below the levels at which it is a                 pest, the populations are also remarkably stable. The central                   hypothesis of the proposed research is that the parasite achieves               these ends through the flexible responses exhibited by Aphytis                  individuals as they encounter scale insects. These individual                   responses, in turn, lead to changes in the scale and parasite                   populations, and hence in the future death rate imposed by the                  parasite. This study is aimed at: analyzing the factors that                    determine these decisions, determining their consequences for                   population dynamics by incorporating the description into                       mathematical models, and testing by field experiment whether                    the models in fact have correctly described the underlying                      processes.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This research should produce rarely-obtained insight into the                   processes by which field populations are regulated, and especially              into the role of individual parasite behavior in achieving this                 end. It will add to a general theory of parasite-host and                       predator-prey dynamics for systems in which the dynamics are                    more or less continuous throughout the year and there are                       overlapping generations. Most particularly, it represents one of                the few attempts to test detailed hypotheses about the mechanisms               underlying population dynamics of a particular system in the field.             The research should also provide insight that will be useful in                 solving insect pest problems in the future.",
