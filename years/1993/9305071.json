 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305071  Bass  A qualitative understanding of fluid migration in the Earth  requires accurate values of viscoelastic properties and the  compressibility of fluids.  We propose an experimental and  theoretical study of the elastic properties  (compressibility), relaxational properties (attenuation,  viscosity), and the equation of state of fluids of  geological importance, in particular, silicate melts and  supercritical aqueous solutions.  Physical mechanisms of  these properties and data reduction methodologies are  largely the same for both groups of materials, as is the  experimental data to be obtained for each.  In this sense,  it is natural and appropriate for silicate melts and aqueous  solutions to be encompasses in a single study of geological  fluids.  Specifically, we will measure the compressibility  and viscosity of silicate glasses and melts up to 1600oC  using the Brillouin light scattering technique.  Experiments  will be done under both dry conditions and in the presence  of H2O in order to investigate the effect of water on the  high T viscosity and elasticity of melts.  Similar  measurement on aqueous fluids will be made at lower  temperatures (T<700oC) and at high pressures up to 10 GPa  using an externally heated diamond anvil cell.  These  experiments will require a full analysis of the lineshape of  the Brillouin spectra.  Although the Brillouin technique  yields directly high frequency, unrelaxed properties, a full  analysis of the lineshapes allows the low frequency, relaxed  properties of the fluids to be extracted from the  measurements.  We can therefore investigate the frequency  dependence of the observed properties.  In addition, for  some of the systems investigated we will obtain data  sufficiently high temperature that the relaxed properties ar  obtained directly.  Molecular dynamics (MD) computer  simulations of the fluid properties will be used to identify  specific atomic mechanisms with the features displayed in  the light scattering spectra, and to extrapol ate the  properties beyond the range of measurements.  High frequency  dielectric permittivity of aqueous fluids will also be  obtained from the proposed optical measurements and compared  with results of MD simulations over a wide range of  frequencies.  These studies will allow more quantitative  models of fluid thermodynamic and transport properties and  fluid-rock interactions to be constructed.",
