The training of doctoral candidates will                 be accomplished through both research and enhanced educational                  activities centered around an integrated approach to addressing                 the interrelated problems of energy use and its effect upon the                 environment.  Research will focus on innovative approaches for                  improving the energy efficiency and reducing the environmental                  impact of systems for a number of applications within the major                 energy use sectors: energy conversion, industrial, commercial and               residential, and transportation.  Specific features of the                      training program will include: 1) industrial collaboration and                  apprenticeships, 2) establishment of a seminar series for                       doctoral students, industrialists, and utility representatives,                 3) development of a student-driven \"research roundtable\" for                    exchanging ideas between participating students and faculty, and                4) the development of new graduate courses.  The research and                   educational program will be in interdisciplinary effort involving               eight key faculty members from five major areas within the School               of Mechanical Engineering and supported by several well-                        established state-of-the-art laboratory facilities.  An award of                an NSF Graduate Research Traineeship grant would provide support                for ten traineeships and would create the basis for a new, long-                term program in an area of critical national need.",
