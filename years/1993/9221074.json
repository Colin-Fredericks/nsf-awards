 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mangrove forest habitats are highly productive ecosystems                  that have significant ecological, economic, and aesthetic value.                They are being degraded and destroyed world-wide by                             human-induced, local and global alterations of the coastal                      environment. Given the broad geographic distribution of                         mangroves, there have been surprisingly few studies of canopy                   tree regeneration and the interplay of tree life histories with                 this process. This study will investigate patterns and mechanisms               of canopy tree regeneration in a Caribbean mangrove forest, with                an emphasis on the role of disturbance-generated canopy gaps. The               study will identify the factors that control forest regeneration                and thereby shed light on important basic ecological questions                  concerning the relative roles of niche partitioning versus                      lottery processes in structuring plant assemblages. In addition,                the information gathered in this study is essential for                         predicting the consequences of different kinds of habitat                       alteration. In particular, this study will investigate the                      interactions of tree species life histories with seed dispersal,                soil nutrient levels, disturbance, herbivory, and interspecific                 interactions.                                                                   %%%                                                                             This study represents an important contribution to the                          understanding of processes and mechanisms associated with the                   dynamics of tropical mangrove forests. Despite the broad                        geographic distribution of mangrove vegetation, there has been a                paucity of studies on the natural disturbance regime and dynamics               of this important type of coastal vegetation. The research                      protocol described in this proposal contains one of the most                    comprehensive attempts to measure pattern and experimentally                    address processes in the regeneration of tropical mangrove                      forests.",
