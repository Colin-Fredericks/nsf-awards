The   Harvard College Observatory also provides substantial support to the Harvard Department   of Astronomy.  Staff and students participate in a wide range of research activities that   involve ground-based radio and optical observations of cosmic sources, balloon-borne   devices for x-ray observations, and theoretical and laboratory astrophysics.  The Institute   for Theoretical Atomic and Molecular Physics, of the Center for Astrophysics, attracts   visiting scientists and talented graduate students to pursue research in atomic and   molecular physics.  High School students are afforded the opportunity to learn astronomy   by enrolling in Project STAR, a pre-college program at the Center for Astrophysics,   designed to teach physics and mathematics using examples from astronomy.   Current climate conditions at the Harvard Observatory, an interconnected complex   of six buildings, constructed between 1846 and 1972, have been a major impediment in   conducting research.  Funds have been requested to upgrade the twenty year old chilled   water plant and distribution system of the Observatory.  The modifications of the facility   will consist of:  repiping the chilled water system, recommissioning the reheat system,   installing a direct digital control system for sensing control and monitoring of the chilled   water and heating systems, installing circuit chillers and pumps, and replacing fan coils.    The upgrades will provide effective year round cooling and climate control to the facility,   creating a productive research environment for staff and students.  ***",
