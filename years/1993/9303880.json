 "awd_abstract_narration": "Initial experiments to visualize components of the bacteriophage                T4 replication apparatus by cryo-EM, under enzymatically active                 conditions, have successfully identified distinctive assemblies                 of a complex of the replication accessory proteins bound to DNA.                These assemblies require continual ATP hydrolysis, have short                   lifetimes, and appear to comprise only a minority of the protein                in the sample; hence they are difficult to isolate for structural               analysis by means other than cryo-EM.  The next step in this                    project is determining the composition and arrangement of the                   proteins in these complexes, by a combination of cryo-EM, site-                 specific labelling (subunit-specific antibodies and covalent                    labels), and biochemical analysis.  The mechanism of formation                  and translocation of these structures will be examined, and their               interaction with the T4 DNA polymerase will be determined, to try               to understand the role of the accessory proteins in the process                 of replication.  The other elements of the T4 replication                       machinery, the DNA helicase and RNA primase, will also be                       examined by these methods, to determine their arrangement in                    enzymatically active complexes and their structural relationship                to the polymerase.                                                              %%%                                                                             Accurate and efficient replication of the genome is a critical                  process in all life.  Much progress has been made, primarily by                 biochemical analysis, in elucidating the molecular mechanism of                 DNA replication.  The complexity of the enzymes involved is                     greater than had been initially anticipated.  The interactions                  among the many proteins required for DNA replication have proven                particularly difficult to analyze directly, in part due to the                  transient nature of active replication complexes.  New                          technologies in electron microscopy, in particular the use of                   minimally-perturbing specimen preservation by cryogenic methods                 (cryo-EM), has opened new avenues to approach the study of                      active, chemically-sensitive macromolecular assemblies such as                  those which catalyze DNA replication.  Biochemical examination of               replication mechanisms in many different organisms has identified               common elements of the process, which allow structural                          information gained about simple systems (phage and bacteria) to                 be related to genome replication in higher organisms.  The work                 proposed here is an attempt to further the understanding of the                 mechanism of DNA replication by structural study of functionally                relevant complexes of the proteins of the bacteriophage T4                      replication apparatus (with DNA templates and products), and to                 correlate the structural analysis to steps in the enzymatic                     activity.",
