 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to create an interdisciplinary course in                     geometry and design.  The primary objective of the project is to                address a major challenge in mathematics education for                          undergraduates by creating a course, innovative in content and                  structure, that will demonstrate the links between artistic                     creativity and the logical processes of mathematics to art and                  design majors.  The course will use geometrical ideas as the                    organizing force which links scientific, artistic, and cultural                 subject areas.                                                                  The course will expose students to new processes of reasoning and               make them aware of the possibilities that can arise through radical             thinking and risk taking; and it will bridge the apparent gap                   between the realm of art and design and that of mathematics.  The               process of awakening students to their creative potential by                    allowing them to work with unfamiliar reasoning processes will                  widen their horizons and give them skills in new areas.  Students               will have the opportunity to test out the effectiveness of the                  concepts they have developed and bear witness to the reaction of a              public-at-large to their experimental efforts.                                  The materials developed for this course will be tested at several               sites in courses for liberal arts majors as well as for students of             art and design.  An advisory board will also assist in evaluation               of the materials.",
