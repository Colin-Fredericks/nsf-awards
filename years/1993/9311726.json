 "awd_abstract_narration": "Japanese has long been known for its elaborate system of                        honorific affixes which show respect for the person to whom                     or about whom one is speaking.  The researcher will                             investigate how honorific use varies in response to                             situational features and whether variation in honorific use                     correlates with variation in other stylistic markers.                           Conventional analyses of Western languages have generally                       treated style as involving variation along a single                             dimension of formality.  It has been assumed that co-                           occurrence rules exist such that speech which is formal in                      one dimension (e.g., word order) will be formal in another                      (e.g., word choice).  While Japanese honorifics are clearly                     related to formality, this investigator hypothesizes that                       honorifics are unrelated to other markers of formality.                         Therefore, it is possible that Japanese simultaneously show                     respect with one stylistic marker while showing intimacy                        with another.  This importantly suggests that formality is                      not a single dimension, but rather involves several                             analytically distinct features which influence different                        levels of the linguistic system.",
