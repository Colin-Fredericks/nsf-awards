Kuchar, University of Utah, will                                       examine three topics in quantum theories of                                     gravity and black hole astrophysics:  1) Gauge                                  formulation of gravity theories, 2) Fermion-                                    boson quantum equivalence, 3) Minisuperspace                                    quantization, and 4) Black hole electrodynamics                                 and the membrane paradigm.                                                                                                                                      In gravity theories, the researchers expect to                                  clarify the status of gravity or supergravity                                   as a gauge system, to extend the fermion-boson                                  equivalence from 1+1 to 3+1 dimensions and to                                   provide the general framework for                                               minisuperspace quantization and apply it to                                     spacetimes with horizons.  In relativistic                                      astrophysics, they intend to clarify the energy                                 generation close to the horizon of a rotating                                   black hole in simplified dynamo models of                                       active galactic nuclei.                                                                                                                                         This research in theoretical physics fulfills                                   the program objective of advancing scientific                                   knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    U.S. and Czech Republic to combine                                              complementary talents and pool research                                         resources in areas of strong mutual interest                                    and competence.  Funds for the project are                                      awarded through the US-Czech Joint Fund,                                        Prague, in accordance with established                                          guidelines.",
