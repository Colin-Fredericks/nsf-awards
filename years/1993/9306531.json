 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306531  Crowley    The composition of natural plant communities is typically  characterized in relation to factors such as temperature, annual  rainfall, and soil acidity.  However, surprisingly little is  known about specific adaptations of plant species to specific  soil factors, including limited availability of essential mineral  nutrients.  In the U.S., soils west of the Mississippi River are  predominantly alkaline (high pH), and often have very low levels  of plant-available iron (Fe).  Iron deficiencies are common in  many agricultural crops, including a number of important members  of the grass family such as corn, wheat, and barley.  Moreover,  one can speculate that limited iron availability in these soils  may be an important factor controlling the species composition of  the extensive western grasslands, which are highly significant to  agricultural production (i.e., grazing of livestock) and as  natural habitats and ecosystems.  To date, no detailed research  has been conducted to examine how native (and in some cases  introduced) grasses are able to thrive in soils that pose severe  iron-deficiency problems for agricultural crop species.  This  research by Dr. Crowley will, for the first time, comparatively  examine the specific processes that occur at the root-soil  interface of both adapted and nonadapted grass species.    In response to iron deficiency, both grasses (but not other  families of plants) and soil microorganisms secrete specialized  organic compounds call \"siderophores\" into the soil.  These  compounds have a very high affinity for iron, thus solubilizing  unavailable soil iron into forms that can be utilized by the  plant or microorganism.  The root surface of grasses support an  elevated population of microorganisms relative to the bulk soil,  and it is likely that there is intense competition between the  plant root and microorganisms for the limited amount of soluble  iron present.  Hypotheses to be tested in our research include  (1) grass species that are pa rticularly well-adapted to Fe-  limited soils excrete larger quantities of Fe-scavenging  siderophores than do nonadapted species, and (II) adapted species  are better able to capitalize on the Fe solubilized by  siderophores secreted by soil microorganisms.  The data he  obtains will be integrated into a conceptual model of the  interrelationships between roots, microbes and soil as they  contribute to the adaptation of certain grasses to iron-limited  soils.  ***",
