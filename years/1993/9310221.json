It will involve approximately ten months of field work in the Amazon, with six months on Banaw  and two months each on Zuruah  and Deni.  Texts and lexica will be collected and transcribed in each of these villages and further analyzed and processed by the PI both in Brazil and at his home institution.  Descriptive and theoretical articles on Banaw  phonology and morphosyntax will be submitted within the first two years of the project, followed by a detailed grammar of Banaw  to be produced by the end of the final year.  The work on Banaw  will serve as the touchstone for further grammatical description of Zuruah  and Deni and analysis of unresolved grammatical problems in the remaining Arawan languages, Madij , Paumari, Yarawara, and Yamamadi.  These studies will enable us to document and describe the basic features of the entire Arawan family, representing the first major study of an entire Amazonian family not of the Tupi or Ge phyla.  Moreover, initial studies of these languages by the PI have already shown them to be of great theoretical interest for morphological, syntactic, and phonological theories.  Also, this study will include the reconstruction of Proto-Arawan leading, it is hoped to the eventual genetic classification of this entire family.  Finally, since Arawan languages are all endangered, this study will also provide an irreplaceable source of information and perhaps stimulate outside interest in the survival of the languages and the pe ople who speak them.
