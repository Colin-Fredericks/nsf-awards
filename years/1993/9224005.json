The research will also  develop a unified logical framework as the semantics basis  for a multiparadigm declarative programming language  unifying functional, relational, and concurrent object-  oriented programming, and having powerful mechanisms for  programming-in-the-large.  The multiparadigm language will  be implemented by extending the current implementation of  the OBJ3 language which will be included as a functional sub  language.    The methods used to design the multiparadigm language are  based on an axiomatic theory of general logics that permits  combining logics supporting different styles of declarative  programming by means of mappings preserving the structure of  these logics. Examples of such mappings include sub logic  inclusions and translations between logics.    The results of this research will provide new methods for  specifying, programming and reasoning about reactive and  concurrent object-oriented systems at a high level of  abstraction, and for reusing such systems to increase  software productivity, as well as a language implementation  supporting these methods.  The results will also contribute  to the mathematical foundations of concurrent object-  oriented programming.  ***",
