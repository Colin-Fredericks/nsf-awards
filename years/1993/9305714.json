General theories of producer-services locations have  been evolving, with special attention in recent years given to  two divergent perspectives regarding the relative importance and  impact of factors like market size, agglomeration economies,  labor costs and quality, infrastructure, and amenities.  One  perspective holds that the knowledge-intensive nature of many  producer services requires frequent face-to-face contact and  sophisticated telecommunications equipment usually found in  higher-density urban concentrations.  The other perspective  posits that producer services follow firms in the goods-producing  sector and gravitate to lower-cost sites outside higher-ordered  urban centers.  This doctoral dissertation project will examine  the spatial dynamics over the last decade of one set of firms,  the U.S. investment-management industry.  Special attention will  be given to examining the spatial distribution of firms and their  assets, to assessing the impact of communications and information-  handling technologies on locational tendencies, and to  identifying the factors that account for the location of  different types of firms.  Both primary and secondary data will  be used to examine the pattern and structure of investment-  management industry location in 1983, 1987, 1990, and 1993, and a  mail questionnaire will elicit from leaders of firms factors that  influence their locational decisions.  Follow-up interviews will  explore important issues in greater depth, especially the extent  to which information transfer via telecommunications links has  become a viable substitute for face-to-face communications.       This industry-specific research will contribute to the  emerging body of knowledge about producer-services location, and  it will provide the basis for furthe ring analyses of the impacts  of telecommunication technologies and infrastructure on the  spatial concentration of financial services.  As a doctoral  dissertation improvement award, this award also will provide  support to enable a promising student to establish a strong  independent research career.  ***",
