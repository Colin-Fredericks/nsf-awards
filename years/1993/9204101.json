 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of intermittent demand interferes with efficient                    production and inventory control activities in US manufacturing                 firms.  While the key role of accurate and timely demand                        forecasting in planning production, inventories and work force,                 and economic lot sizing has received considerable attention, the                vast majority of forecasting research, and nearly all commercial                forecasting software, assume that demand is \"smooth\" rather than                intermittent.  Results of the Phase I Small Business Innovation                 Research (SBIR) study establish the technical basis for a new                   software tool that can be used to forecast intermittent demand                  and that is suitable for use on a desktop computer.  The                        objectives of the Phase II research focus on (1) gathering and                  analysis of more real-world intermittent time-series data; (2)                  implementation of a single-series method of Croston's for                       forecasting intermittent demand, including its extension to                     trending and seasonal data; (3) development of a new multi-                     series  forecasting approach based on stochastic process models                 that \"borrow strength\" across the items in a product line; (4)                  determination of the most effective use of sales-force judgments                of intermittent demand, including their combination with                        statistical forecasts' and (5) integration of the forecasting                   methods developed in Phase II, culminating in their                             implementation in a software prototype running on desktop                       computers.                                                                                                                                                      The project will provide a computerized state-of-the-art solution               to the intermittent demand forecasting problem.  A large                        percentage of US manufacturing firms stand to benefit from more                 efficient production made possible by such demand forecasting.",
