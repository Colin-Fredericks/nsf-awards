 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of               Professor Smith at the University of Notre Dame to study methods                to regulate the binding of small (amino acids, nucleosides,                     saccharides) and large (enzymes, glocoproteins) biomolecules to                 abiotic, boronic acid-based receptors by two avenues. The first                 involves the synthesis and study of a series of boronic acid                    crown ether molecules designed to heterotopically bind and                      cotransport water-soluble diol-ligands and metal cations across                 lipophilic membranes. This approach is based on ionic strength                  controlled binding. The second approach involves photoswitchable                receptors and is based on the photochemically controlled binding                of the biomolecules. The synthetic receptors will be lipophilic,                photoswitchable boronic acid azobenzenediol carrier molecules                   which will also be explored as light-powered transmembrane proton               pumps.                                                                          %%%                                                                             In this project Professor Smith will investigate methods of                     regulating the binding of various types of biological ligands to                abiotic, boronic acid-based receptors. Both ionic strength                      controlled and light controlled binding methods will be                         investigated. In the ionic based method the binding to the                      heterotopic receptors is controlled by metal ions, while the                    light controlled method involves photoswitchable receptors. This                research may have technological applications such as                            (bio)chemical purification devices, carriers for transport                      through lipophilic membranes, and controlled release materials.",
