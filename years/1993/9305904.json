 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is divided into two categories.  The                 first pertains to the hydrodynamic description of self-organizing               systems. Self-organizing automata or particle systems are open                  driven stochastic systems which evolve to a stationary                          distribution characterized by the nontrivial scaling behavior (as               a function of system size) known as self-organized criticality.                 We have previously established that many of these systems near                  equilibrium can be described in certain limits by nonlinear                     diffusion equations, with a diffusion coefficient which has a                   singularity at a critical value of the local density.  Scaling                  arguments suggest that the validity of this hydrodynamic                        description for the open (nonequilibrium) self-organizing                       automata depends on the size of the fluctuations in the local                   density in comparison to the rate at which the system converges                 to the critical density as the system size diverges. The purpose                of this research is to rigorously investigate the validity of the               singular diffusion description for the open systems, with the                   goal being general conditions for when fluctuations destroy the                 diffusion description.                                                               In the past several years there has been a  considerable                   amount of activity in a number of scientific communities                        regarding self-organized criticality.  Recent activity has                      focused on relatively simple systems, which, when simulated on                  the computer show broad distributions which change in a                         nontrivial way with the size of the system.  The purpose of this                research is to look at mathematical models which describe these                 systems.",
