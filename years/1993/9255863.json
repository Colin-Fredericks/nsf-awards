The Olympiad, held annually in a different country,                      provides opportunity for five students from each of about                       forty countries to participate in an international                              competition.  The Olympiad is a seven day event which                           consists of a theoretical examination of three questions to                     be answered in five hours and an experimental investigation                     to be done in about four hours.  Also included in this                          Olympiad are field trips to Busch Gardens, Williamsburg and                     CEBAF, time to interact, and ceremonial events.  The                            examination are critiqued, translated, graded and discussed                     with the team leaders during the Olympiad.  The selection                       process in the US gives opportunity for over 600 students                       and their teachers to become acquainted with the world class                    standards.  The AIP does the fund raising and the AAPT                          plans, organizes and implements the Olympiad.  Problems used                    to select the US team will be published in a magazine for                       physics teachers to demonstrate world-class problems.",
