 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will be conducted through tribally-owned                Little Big Horn College and on-site at the Crow and Northern                    Cheyenne Reservations in Montana.  It is designed to provide                    quality training for elementary teachers in the content areas of                science and in the discovery method of teaching science.  Project               staff will work directly with the elementary teachers in the                    classrooms to implement the discovery approach.  Summer institutes              will be held for residential training in field-based science,                   providing opportunities to incorporate the traditional relationship             of the peple to the land.                                                                                                                                       This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because it                 targets teachers of Native Americans in Reservation schools, and is             designed to enhance the science knowledge and teaching and to                   develop leadership skills of these teachers.
