 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer based data acquisition and testing is becoming                         more and more prevalent in the field of electronics. Presently                  the electronic technology equipment at Nassau Community College                 consists exclusively of discrete, non-computerized measuring                    instruments. The project is incorporating data acquisition into                 the Electronics program at Nassau Community College through                     upgrading one of their two electrical measuring labs by the                     incorporation of state of the art computer-based \"virtual\"                      instruments. Students using this lab are being exposed to the                   concept of computer based data acquisition and computerized                     data analysis over the two years they are in the electronics                    program. The project builds the integration of the data                         acquisition equipment and analysis programs into every                          electronics course containing a laboratory portion. The                         students knowledge of data acquisition and analysis is being                    gradually expanded semester by semester as new aspects in this                  area are presented. Upon completion of the program the project                  equipment will allow the student to have a thorough                             understanding of data acquisition.",
