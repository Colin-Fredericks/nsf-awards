 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the proposed project is to                     provide a laboratory experience for undergraduate engineering                   students in two new courses: ECS 312 Feedback Control Theory,                   and ECS 344 Thermal Systems. (These courses are required of all                 engineering majors at Trinity College.) This is being                           accomplished using a state-of-the-art remotely controlled 6-                    Pass Heat Exchanger and LabVIEW software with A/D interfacing.                  Students in Feedback Control Theory are developing a closed                     loop control system with a Macintosh Microcomputer that is                      already on hand and available for use. Students in Thermal                      Systems are using the equipment to study basic concepts                         involved in heat transfer and thermodynamics. The proposed                      equipment is also exposing the students to basic transducers                    and electronics, as well as computer controlled data                            acquisition. Currently, there is no engineering laboratory                      equipment at Trinity that would be appropriate for use in these                 new courses. This is a severe shortcoming of the engineering                    program that must be redressed.The project is also providing                    students with independent research and senior design projects,                  required of all engineering majors. It is providing unique                      collaborative opportunities for mechanical and electrical                       engineering students, such as the development of data                           acquisition and control software and its use in the analysis of                 heat exchanger performance.The proposed equipment is also being                 used to introduce non-engineering students to the basic                         principles of heat transfer, thermodynamics, and computer                       controlled equipment in two recently developed introductory                     technology courses. These courses are aimed at encouraging                      students to pursue science and engineering careers and to                       develop a quantitative understanding of technology.The                          equipment is also being used to attract Greater Hartford Area                   minority middle and high school students to engineering through                 the Connecticut Pre-Engineering Program (CPEP). Trinity College                 has participated in CPEP for the past 6 1/2 years by sponsoring                 Saturday and summer science courses for these students.",
