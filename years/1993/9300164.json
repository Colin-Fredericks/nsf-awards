 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gilbert  9300164    The studies by Dr. Gilbert on the mechanism by which a hormone  from the brain of the insect Manduca sexta acts upon specialized  glands (prothoracic glands) to cause these glands to begin  synthesizing a specific steroid hormone, an ecdysteroid.  Ecdysteroids are hormones that cause the insect to molt. i.e.  shed its exoskeleton, so that it can grow. They also elicit  metamorphosis, i.e. the means by which a caterpillar is  transformed into a pupa and then into an adult moth or butterfly.  The brain neurohormone is synthesized and released as a result of  environmental cues such as photoperiod and the synthesis and  release of Ecdysteroids by the prothoracic glands must be  extremely precise if the insect is to survive and be successful.  He is studying the means by which this peptide hormone interacts  with the glands, i.e. to stimulate the synthesis of a compound, a  second messenger, which in turn indirectly mediates the  phosphorylation (addition of a phosphate group) of specific  proteins that control ecdysteroidogenesis. By utilizing the  prothoracic glands which are composed of a single layer of  homogeneous cells, he should ultimately gain insights into the  mechanism of peptide hormone induced steroidogenesis that would  not be possible with the more heterogeneous adrenal gland.  ***",
