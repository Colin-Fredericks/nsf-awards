 "awd_abstract_narration": "Free radical chain reactions will be designed involving electron-               accepting and electron-donating alkyl radical additions to                      unsaturated systems that are both electron-rich and electron-                   deficient. Both types of radicals will be generated from                        alkylmercury halides. Reactivities of unsaturated systems toward                these radicals will be established from product analysis by                     competitive reactions. Demonstration of enhanced reactivity in                  electron transfer reactions of radicals will be an important goal               of this research. Complexation with nucleophiles has already been               demonstrated to increase the electron-donating ability of                       alkylmercury halides and similar nucleophilic solvent complexation              with paramagnetic species such as silyl radicals will be used to                increase electron transfer to an easily reduced molecule. The                   concept of radical activation in electron transfer processes by                 protonation or deprotonation will continue to be pursued,                       particularly in regard to the alkylation of aromatic systems.                   %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Russell at Iowa State University. The              formation carbon-carbon bonds is a process of considerable                      importance in organic chemistry. One method by which the formation              of carbon-carbon bonds is initiated is the addition of a carbon                 free radical (a trivalent carbon with one odd electron) to a                    carbon-carbon double bond. Only recently has the synthetic utility              of this reaction been vigorously pursued. In this research, new                 methods will be developed to facilitate this addition reaction. A               scale of reactivity of free radical addition to carbon-carbon                   double bonds will be developed and this will serve as a guide for               the synthesis of organic molecules.",
