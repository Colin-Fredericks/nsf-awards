 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is centered on the design of efficient  approximation algorithms for a wide variety of combinatorial  optimization  problems.  The main goal is to develop and  isolate general techniques which  lead to approximation  algorithms, to improve the currently best performance  guarantees for several combinatorial optimization problems  and to develop  efficient implementations for these  algorithms.    During the past few years  substantial progress has been made  in these directions; in particular, the  development of a  general approximation technique based on a primal-dual  approach which lead to the first and/or best approximation  algorithm for a  variety of problems including the weighted  matching problem, the  prize-collecting traveling salesman  problem, the generalized Steiner tree  problem and the most  general version of the graph augmentation problem.  This  research has demonstrated the usefulness of linear  programming techniques in  deriving approximation algorithms.  Linear programming is one of the main tools  that is to be  used in this project in order to derive improved  approximation  algorithms.",
