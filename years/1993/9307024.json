 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307024  Beuchat    Hummingbirds subsist almost entirely on a liquid diet composed of  floral nectar, and when energy demands are high they can consume  more than three times their own body mass in fluid per day.  At  the same time, however, the hummingbird's high metabolism  requires efficient extraction of nutrients and electrolytes from  a dilute food source that is passing rapidly through the  gastrointestinal tract for efficient nutrient extraction,  electrolyte conservation, and rapid elimination of water.    For a hummingbird to simultaneously balance energy, water, and  ion fluxes is a major challenge that raises fundamental questions  about hummingbird morphology and physiology.  This study proposes  to address a central problem:       In what ways and by what mechanisms do the kidney and  gastrointestinal tract of hummingbird contribute to water   and  ion homeostasis while at the same time allowing maximum  efficiency of energy acquisition?    Using isotopically-labeled markers in artificial nectar, I can  determine the fraction of ingested fluid that is absorbed by the  intestine and the capacity of the kidney to eliminate excess  water without depleting the body of electrolytes.  The efficiency  of energy and nutrient extraction are determined under conditions  that influence the hummingbird's energy requirements, its  electrolyte balance, and the quality of its diet.  Together,  these studies will provide information about the unique  adaptations that allow hummingbirds to specialize on a liquid  diet.  ***",
