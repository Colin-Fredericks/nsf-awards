 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is directed at understanding the physical and             chemical basis of specific antibody-antigen binding.  The                       experimental systems to be studied are three antibody/protein                   complexes and four antibody/hapten complexes for which high                     resolution X-ray structures and binding data re available, plus                 data on binding differences for point amino acid mutations and                  hapten analogue binding.  The focus will be on two key aspects: 1)              The role of solvation, which involves both electrostatic and                    hydrophobic interactions. 2)'Association entropy' effects, meaning              the loss of translational/rotational entropy upon association, with             the concomitant gain in vibrational entropy of the complex, and the             change in conformational mobility of groups involved in the                     intermolecular contact.  A combination of theoretical approaches                will be used, the aim being to develop computationally feasible yet             quantitative methods for calculating both differences in binding                energy, and absolute binding energies.  This will enable specific               questions of biological importance to be addressed, including                   identifying the overall driving force for binding, contributions to             specificity, the role of electrostatic complementarily, whether                 induced fitting is important, the intrinsic antigenicity of surface             groups, and the effect of amino acids mutations and substitutions               on binding energies.  Electrostatics will be treated using a                    continuum treatment of solvent with an atomic detail representation             of the molecule, using the Finite Difference Poisson-Boltzmann                  (FDPB) method.  Dynamic aspects will be handled by a method which               combines the FDPB method with molecular mechanics (FDPB/MD).                    Hydrophobic interactions will be treated using surface free energy              relationships, modified to account for shape effects, calibrated on             small molecule solvent transfer data.  Translational and rotational             entropies effects will be estimated from changes in the rotational              and translational partition function upon binding.                              %%%                                                                             The ability of an organism to produce molecules that bind                       specifically to certain 'target' molecules or parts of 'target'                 molecules, but not to other molecules, gives rise to the phenomenon             of biological recognition at the molecular level.  This process of              molecular recognition underlies many fundamental biological                     processes including catalysis, gene transcription and the immune                response.  The design of drugs also involves creating or modifying              molecules to recognize given biological target molecules.  In                   physical terms recognition occurs because a molecule binds more                 tightly to its 'target' than to other molecules.  It is known that              the tightness of binding is determined by how much energy is                    released (the binding energy) when two molecules are brought                    together.  it is also known that contributions to the binding                   energy come from the interaction of the two molecules with each                 other, the interaction of each molecule with its surroundings,                  especially water, and from the change in shape and mobility of each             molecule upon binding.  However it is not yet possible to calculate             the binding energy accurately, even if the structure o the two                  molecules is known.  This impedes both our understanding of what                properties of molecules are necessary for recognition and the                   ability to design molecules to  recognize a given target.  The                  recognition of foreign antigens by antibodies is one of the key                 properties of an immune system, and one of the most studied                     examples of molecular recognition:  The structures of at least                  seven antigen/antibody complexes are known at the atomic level, and             their binding energies have been measured.  Therefore these systems             have been chosen for a detailed theoretical study of binding.  The              aim of the proposed research is to apply recently developed methods             for simulating the behavior of molecules to the problem of                      calculating the different contributions to the antibody-antigen                 binding energy.  The goal is to identify the properties of the                  antibodies important for tight binding and specificity, and to                  improve the ability to calculate binding energies.",
