This program is modeled after the highly successful NSF funded  TexPrep curriculum, with some modifications to suit the local  conditions.  The target population for JJSCC is students entering  grades 7-9 from selected schools in New York City.      The Program consists of: (1) a structured schedule from Mondays  through Thursdays during the summer including courses in computer  science, logic, probability and statistics, and problem solving;  and (2) informal field trips, hands-on project workshops, and SEM  career counseling on Fridays during the summer and six Saturdays  during the academic year.  Guest speakers serve as role models and  provide the participants with personalized exposure to the  multitude of career opportunities in the fields of science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM).    The curriculum emphasizes the students' development of abstract  reasoning and problem solving skills.  All courses will be taught  by using \"team-teaching\" and \"cooperative learning\" techniques.   Students will be encouraged to work together and to utilize peer-  tutoring by establishing \"Academic Fraternities\", a model  introduced by Treisman.  Computers and calculators will be an  integral part of the program.    The John Jay Summer Computer Camp will enroll 35 students in JJSCC  I (level 1) the first year (June 28, - August 2, 1993); and 55  students in each of the second and third years, 30 for JJSCC I  (level 1) and 25 for JJSCC II (level 2).",
