 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on statistical aspects of two  classes of image models: Gibbs random fields (GRFs) on discrete  lattices (Part I) and deformable templates on continuous domains  (Part II).  For the first class, the purpose is to fit a GRF  which generates images with analytical and visual characteristics  similar to those of natural textures.  This includes parameter  estimation and model selection: the former is an inference  problem of estimating the unknown parameter (maybe high  dimensional) contained in the energy function that induces the  GRF; the latter is a multiple decision problem of choosing an  energy function from a finite set of candidates.  Some  complicated issues, such as possible long-range dependence and  indirect observations, will also be considered.  The second class  is studied in the context of object detection from laser radar  sensors.  The particular objects considered are human faces in an  unconstrained environment.  The face detection is formulated as a  Bayesian inference problem, which consists of the prior (shape  models), the likelihood (data models) and the algorithms  (simulation from the posterior and inference based on the  posterior). In particular, the simulation will be carried out by  jump-diffusion processes and the inference is to identify the  number of object(s) corresponding to the maximal posterior  probability.       Texture is a dominant feature in representation of various  kinds of images.  The first part of the proposed research  attempts to render textures from statistical point of view.  For  instance, wood grain shows strong directional tendency but sand  patterns appear isotropic and random. Such a difference can be  represented in images created by computer graphics using  different parameters for the same model.  The second part of the  proposed research will try to answer the questions \"Is there any  specific object in the picture?\" \"If yes, how many?\"  Here a  model-based approach is taken which not only provides an swers to  those questions based on the observed images but also quantifies  the chance associated with each answer.  Therefore, we should  seek answers that are more likely (with greater chance) to be  correct.",
