 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen sulfide, which is naturally produced in marine sediments,              is poison to most living organisms. However, some animals from                  sulfide-rich environments avoid this poisoning with sulfide                     detoxification reactions at the cellular level, and these oxidation             reactions may be a potentially useful source of energy. The goal of             this project is to determine if sulfide inhabitants gain sufficient             cellular energy from sulfide oxidation to support cellular work.                The experimental tissue choice will be ciliated gills from two                  species of marine mussels, one from sulfide-rich environments and               one from sulfide-free environments. Gills are hard-working tissues              that act as the primary interface between filter-feeding animals                and their environment. In the presence and absence  of sulfide, we              will measure several parameters of cellular energy metabolism,                  including energy production by the mitochondria and energy                      consumption by the gill cilia. This research will begin to address              basic questions concerning the regulatory mechanisms that                       coordinate cellular energy consumption with energy production; the              molecular and cellular mechanisms that allow survival in natural                stressful habitats; and the invasion of the sulfide habitat by                  marine invertebrates that may have led to the eventual development              of the symbiosis between invertebrate hosts and sulfide-oxidizing               bacteria. It will address questions concerning the contribution of              sulfide systems to the total productivity of estuaries.",
