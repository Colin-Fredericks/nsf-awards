This  information will come from (1) an analysis/evaluation of  Federal Register filings of cooperative research ventures  that are required under the National Cooperative Research  Act of 1984 and are maintained-but not analyzed--by the  Office of Technology Commercialization of the Department of  Commerce and (2) survey/analysis of collaborative research  activities from a sample of 250 US manufacturing firms for  each of the years 1990-1993.  The Principal Investigator has  received agreement from the Bryan School of Business at the  University of North Carolina at Greensboro to maintain  (annually resurvey) and expand (at least 50 new firms will  be added to the base each year) the project for at least  five years.  The data base, which will be available to other  researchers upon request, will be used to identify trends in  the various dimensions of industrial cooperative research  arrangements.    The project will be completed in three phases: Phase I will  include analysis and evaluation of the population of Federal  Register filings and creation of a data base of related  information.  Phase II will consist of the collection of  survey-based information from a sample of 250 U. S.  manufacturing firms related to annual collaborative efforts  (quantified in a number of dimensions) for each of the years  1990-1993 and the creation of a. longitudinal data base.  Phase III represents the expansion of the longitudinal data  bases over a five-year period after the project is completed  using institutional resources.",
