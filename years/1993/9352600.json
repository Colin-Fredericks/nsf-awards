 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves the implemention of an integrated or                       common laboratory to be used by engineering students in their                   introductory mathematics, physics, and engineering courses. The                 proposed laboratory is part of a novel curriculum revision                      experiment which is being funded separately as part of the NSF                  sponsored SUCCEED program.                                                      The planned curriculum revisions address critical issues in the                 restructuring of the undergraduate engineering curriculum and                   a new experimental model for undergraduate engineering                          education is developed. In particular, a new model for                          integrating mathematics, physics, and introductory engineering                  at the critical freshman year is being implemented. The project                 seeks to develop an early exposure to engineering and an                        emphasis on the common knowledge base from mathematics,                         physics, and the engineering method at the freshman year.                       Innovative features of the  integrated teaching approach                        include: (1) a flexible hours per week distribution concept                     between mathematics, physics, and engineering, (2)                              implementation of \"just-in-time\" learning concepts between the                  three subject areas and, (3) a common computer- oriented                        laboratory for the three subject areas.",
