 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this project is to develop the                       functional framework that supports concurrent engineering in design             and manufacturing.  The purpose is to shorten the design cycle                  time, to increase productivity and, more importantly, to come up                with optimum or near-optimum design and production plans.  In order             to accomplish this goal, two specific objectives are identified.                The first one is to characterize the various mechanical functions               for creating the functional structure of a product.  The functional             structure will facilitate the integration of the functional                     requirements into various activities of the product cycle so as to              serve as the links among design, process planning, manufacturing,               assembly, and inspection.  The second objective is to develop a                 functional tolerancing framework based on the characteristics of                the required functions.  Using the tolerancing scheme, the current              practice of tolerance representation can be extended and applied                to the products that are sophisticated in function and/or                       complicated in geometry.                                                             The research will result in a systematic approach for the                  characterization and representation of the functional requirements              in mechanical design.  It will provide a basis for integrating                  design intent into the product cycle so that higher level of                    decision making and complex reasoning for the determination of                  optimum product design and process planning become possible.",
