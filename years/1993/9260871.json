 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on the feasibility of using                air-sparged, hydrocyclone flotation technology in the recovery of               oil that has contaminated water.  This technology was developed                 originally for efficient removal of fine particles suspended in                 water by flotation.  This technology combines froth flotation                   principles with those obtained by use of a hydrocyclone.                                                                                                        This technology has shown promise in being applied to the                       concentration of metal ores and other minerals of industrial                    significance, cleaning of coal and in the treatment of wastewater               from deinking processes.  This project addresses its potential                  for removal of oil from water that has been contaminated with oil               as from accidental spills or as derived from remediation of oil-                contaminated soil.  The proposal leading to this award was                      submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small Business Innovation                   Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental Systems.",
