 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project has as its first objective the completion of               the analysis of seminal experiments on the diffusion of muonic                  hydrogen atoms (up and ud) in H2 and D2 gas, and the use of these               results to design and undertake an experiment to measure the rate               of the reaction up>nv in the triplet state of the up atom. The                  purpose of this experiment is to measure the pseudoscalar                       coupling constant in muon capture to 10% accuracy by a method                   independent of radiative muon capture experiments.  Techniques                  involving scintillation counters and neutron sensitive liquid                   methane-filled proportional chambers will be used.  The second                  purpose of the project, to be carried out simultaneously with the               muon capture studies described above, is to establish the                       existence of 2S state metastability in muonic boron, and to begin               the measurement of parity non-conserving (PNC) effects in muonic                boron.  The PNC experiment will make use of the directional                     correlation between the decay electron of the muon and the M1                   photon emitted from the metastable muonic boron atoms. Techniques               involving scintillation and solid-state detectors will be used.",
