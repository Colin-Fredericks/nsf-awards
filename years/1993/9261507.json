 "awd_abstract_narration": "Immunoassay has proven to be the most selective method for                      detection and identification of biological agents.  Optical                     fluoroimmunoassay (FIA), with single photon counting capability,                is supposed to be the most sensitive technique.  Unfortunately,                 due to the high autofluorescent background from bulk samples, the               sensitivity of FIA is often reduced.                                                                                                                            In response to the need for this technology, Physical Optics                    Corporation (POC)C) proposes to develop a compact, highly sensitive             (0.01 picomole/ml) near-real time (less than 1 minute) biological               instrument based on optical evanescent wave detection.  The scope               and versatility of this proposed method can be enhanced by                      combining the principles of fluoroimmunoassay and POC's                         holographic planar waveguide technology.  Application of POC's                  proprietary transparent Moth Eye structure will increase the                    surface area of the waveguide, which is the sensing area of the                 device.  The increase in surface area will enhance device                       sensitivity by two orders of magnitude over fiber optic sensors.                                                                                                The advantages of the proposed system include the conditions that               it involves no wash, no analyte separation, no autofluorescence,                and it can be simultaneously used to detect multiple analytes.                  The resulting device will be robust, easy to use, low cost, and                 will have low maintenance and calibration requirements.",
