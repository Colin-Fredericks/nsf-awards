 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three-year project, Science And Youth (SAY), integrates                  the existing curriculum, instructional design, and training                     capacity of the 4-H Science Experiences and Resources for                       Informal Educational Settings (SERIES) project with high                        school students exploring careers in teaching at eleven                         existing \"teaching magnet\" high schools across the country.                     The SAY project expands the quantity and quality of informal                    science education experiences by accomplishing the following                    objectives: 1) prepare one thousand teenage teachers/leaders                    to present SAY activities to forty thousand elementary school                   age youth: 2) involve participating youth in a total of five                    hundred community service projects; 3) involve five hundred                     teenage leaders in mentoring relationships with local                           scientists, and; 4) have seventy-five percent of the                            participants continue their education in science and/or the                     teaching profession.                                                                                                                                                 SAY uses a teens-as-leaders model to engage younger youth                  (ages 9-13) in hands-on, inquiry-based science activities that                  result in science-based community services projects.  SAY                       offers youngsters a vehicle for experiencing how science                        problem solving strategies are applied to home and community                    problems.  The pedagogy of the SAY project represents the best                  of current research on science education, and offers an                         innovative model for the preparation of a new cadre of science                  teachers.",
