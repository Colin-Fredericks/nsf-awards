 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305721  Honeycutt    A new telescope will be installed and equipped with advanced  instrumentation for automated photometry and spectroscopy.   Information on the time variability of astronomical objects is  often critical to understanding the nature and evolution of stars  and galaxies.  This new telescope will provide a way to acquire  data on a variety of time scales in an efficient manner that does  not require the astronomer's presence at the telescope.  This is a  new capability for stellar spectroscopy whose feasibility has only  recently been demonstrated.  The objects to be studied include  cataclysmic variable stars (CVs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs).   Members of the CV class include dwarf novae and novae.  This new  telescope will provide a long-term photometric and spectroscopic  monitoring of several kinds of CVs.  Such observations bear  critically on poorly-understood evolutionary relations between the  numerous CV types.  The optical variability of AGNs and other kinds  of high energy source will also be monitored with the new  telescope.  These observations will be correlated with measures at  other wavelengths and with particle detector experiments.  The  methods to be employed in this work are charge-coupled-device (CCD)  photometry and CCD echelle spectroscopy.  The instrumentation will  be carefully matched to the  telescope and to the detectors to  provide optimized sensitivity.  The completed telescope will also  be used extensively for student training in astronomical research,  in astronomical techniques, and in low-light-level instrumentation.  ***",
