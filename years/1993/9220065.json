 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existence of basaltic volcanism in McMurdo Sound has been                   attributed to a mantle hotspot, or alternatively, to structurally               controlled eruptions related to continental rifting and extension               in the Ross Sea.  The goals of this award are to: 1) characterize               the mantle source beneath the region and understand its origin,                 and 2) determine the relationship between the volcanism and the                 proposed hotspot and/or extension-related tectonic origin.                      Existing isotopic data suggest that these basalts have unique                   radiogenic lead and non-radiogenic strontium isotopic                           compositions that are compatible with derivation from a                         hypothetical class of mantle called HIMU (meaning high uranium to               lead ratio).  This type of mantle could be produced by one or                   more of the following processes; recycling of oceanic crust into                the mantle, metasomatic addition of uranium, metasomatic removal                of rubidium, or lead loss to the core.  Helium isotopes have not                yet been used extensively to study HIMU mantle.  However, helium                isotopes will be useful for characterizing HIMU mantle sources of               basalts and identifying the processes involved in its production                because helium isotopes can help distinguish between undepleted                 mantle and mantle that has been involved in mid-ocean ridge or                  subduction processes.  Thus, helium isotopic data from the                      McMurdo Sound region will help to understand the nature and                     origin of HIMU mantle sources in Antarctica and elsewhere in the                world.  In addition, new helium isotopic data from this area,                   coupled with strontium, neodymium, and lead isotopes, will help                 determine whether the McMurdo Sound basalts are associated with a               hot mantle plume, involving undepleted mantle, or whether they                  are associated with extension related magmatism that would not                  require involvement of a mantle plume.  Isotopic ages of the                    volcanic rocks which would be produced in the course of this work               will also help document the temporal and tectonic controls on                   volcanism.",
