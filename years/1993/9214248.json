The project will                                                 test laboratory models and full-                                                scale prototypes of a device called                                             foundation isolation tube which is                                              intended to greatly reduce damage                                               to structure foundations caused by                                              expansive soils.  In both sets of                                               tests, the performance of                                                       instrumented drilled shafts                                                     constructed both, with and without                                              foundation isolation tubes will be                                              monitored during periods of soil                                                moisture variation.  Comparison of                                              the performance of these shafts                                                 will verify the effectiveness of                                                this mitigation technique in                                                    reducing axial loads due to the                                                 vertical movement of expansive                                                  soils.  The results of this                                                     research will provide an improved                                               understanding of the nature of                                                  subsurface moisture migration in                                                the vicinity of drilled shaft                                                   foundations.  Guidelines for the                                                use of this technique will be                                                   developed allowing geotechnical                                                 engineers to design more reliable                                               and economical foundations in                                                   expansive soils sites.",
