 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants are an inexpensive source of complex molecules.                     Several industries are based on chemical feedstocks of plant                    origin, ranging from flavors to pharmaceuticals.  The biosynthetic              pathways of plants may be more effectively manipulated through                  viral gene amplification than by conventional genetic engineering.              We propose to amplify specific target RNAs in transgenic plants                 based on viral RNA replication.  The 5' and 3' viral replication                origins of tobacco mosaic virus will be combined with an internal               target sequence to be amplified.  Recombinant messenger RNA will be             synthesized from a gene inserted into the tobacco chromosome under              transcriptional control of a nominally constitutive promoter.  In               the presence of helper feasibility, we will quantify amplified gene             expression using the messenger RNA for the enzyme chloramphenicol               acetyltransferase (CAT) as a target sequence.                                   %%%                                                                             Because the levels of amplification and timing of expression will               be controlled by the helper virus, this technique will                          significantly extend the types of genetic manipulations possible in             transgenic crops.  Efficient production of high value biochemicals              in plants will create new opportunities for domestic growers and                strengthen the ability of the agricultural sector of our economy to             compete internationally.",
