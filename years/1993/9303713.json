Problems to be considered                 involve both large numbers of parameters and large numbers of                   observations.  Log-linear models, conditional log-linear models,                latent-class models, canonical models, and association models are               to be explored.  Large-sample approximations are to be considered               for distributions of maximum-likelihood estimates, Pearson and                  likelihood-ratio chi-square statistics, and measures of                         predictions.  Analyses are to be developed without the assumption               that the underlying model is correct.                                                In large-scale surveys and censuses, statistical analyses                  are commonly performed on very large samples.  In such analyses,                models used to approximate the observations often involve very                  large numbers of unknown quantities which must be estimated from                the sample in order to apply the model.  In the proposed                        research, approximations are developed for the variability                      expected from the estimates of unknown quantities and for                       measures of the value of the model for construction of predictors               of future observations.  In contrast to usual statistical                       analyses, the methods developed apply even if the proposed model                is not entirely consistent with the data.  It is shown that                     approximate models can be quite valuable in statistical work even               when they do not fully describe the data.",
