The project will run for eight weeks,               with several faculty participating either in an official capacity               or as interested volunteers.  The theme of matrix theory and                    itsapplications is not only readily accessible to undergraduates                but will also allow them to attack a progressive series of                      problems of increasing difficulty and generality.  Several of the               projects will benefit from exploration using sophisticated                      mathematical software packages for symbolic and matrix                          calculations.  A written final report together with interim oral                reports will be required.  Visits to facilities where actual                    mathematical applications are carried out, such as the                          NASA/Langley Research Center, INCASE, the Virginia Institute of                 Marine Science and the Continuous Electronic Beam Accelerator                   Facility are scheduled.",
