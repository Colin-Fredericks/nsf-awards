 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to create a modern, distributed, visually                    oriented computing environment to support undergraduate                         computer science instruction. The environment will encourage                    experimentation with algorithms and programs.                                   Students exposed to algorithm animation techniques in the                       classroom will be able to use this software to explore the                      properties of algorithms on their own in the laboratory.                        Through such experimentation, students will discover properties                 of algorithms by themselves, leading to deeper understanding of                 the basic building blocks of all software.                                      A suite of state-of-the-art graphical tools will assist the                     students in designing, analyzing, implementing, debugging, and                  testing complex programs. By using powerful analysis tools,                     students will be able to discover the structure of existing                     large programs. Other tools will assist them in developing                      complex programs better and faster and ensure that they are                     thoroughly tested. The skillful use of such tools leads to                      major increases in both software quality and programmer                         productivity.                                                                   Hypertext-based tools with powerful searching capabilities will                 give instant access to documents in a large technical database,                 which includes on-line documentation, classnotes, and                           tutorials.                                                                      The environment will consist of an array of networked UNIX                      workstations and servers supporting powerful graphical user                     interfaces, and appropriate software to facilitate the                          experimentation envisioned in this project. Integration of this                 environment into our curriculum will give our students a better                 understanding of fundamental principles and practical                           techniques available to produce quality software and better                     prepare them for the requirements of computer professionals in                  the 90s.",
