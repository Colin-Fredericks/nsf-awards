 "awd_abstract_narration": "Designing with composites has often been based on a \"black                 aluminum\" approach.  Some design tolls have been developed to                   advance the design of composites in the past decade.  The                       manufacturing processes of composites have also been dominated by               manual operations.  Nearly all manufacturing methods used today are             by batch rather than continuous process.  An Industry/University                Cooperative Research Center on Composites at Stanford University                could provide a better mechanism to achieve efficiency and economy              in material and processes in terms of energy consumption, dual-use              technologies, and friendliness to the environment.  The Center will             focus on the integrated material and processing technology such as              thermoplastic composites and continuous manufacturing processes for             low-cost civilian applications.                                                      A planning meeting will study if industry will support an                  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center on Composites                   Technology to be headquartered at Stanford University.  The meeting             will assess industry interest and determine if the Center has                   sufficient support and merit to meet the Industry/University                    Cooperative Research Centers Program criteria.  The proposed                    research projects will address:  1) computer-based data base for                composite design; 2) process research on continuous or fast                     consolidation such as pultrusion and thermo-forming; 3) research in             methodology of testing, inspection, maintenance, and repair of                  composite material; 4) ultrasonic welding of thermoplastics for                 assembly and repair; 5) design of low-cost glass-thermoplastics                 tapes for structural composite; 6) design of low-cost stiffened                 composite panel.                                                                     The Principle Investigator is recognized as an eminent                     researcher and has the resource for this planning meeting.                           The Program Director recommends Stanford University be awarded             $10,000 for three months.",
