The effort will  focus on understanding the fundamental processes of epitaxial  growth and on developing new, controlled approaches to epitaxy.  Several complementary growth monitors will be utilized in the  studies; reflection high energy electron diffraction and  reflection mass spectroscopy will be applied during  growth to monitor the structural and chemical evolution of  surfaces during molecular beam epitaxy.  Scanning tunneling  microscopy will be applied during growth interruptions to  eliminate ambiguity in the interpretation of diffraction  measurements.  Initial work will focus on the role of impurities  in the pinning and disordering of steps, on the structure of III-  V semiconductor surfaces, and on mechanisms for strain  relaxation.  The research will also be extended to the  growth of iron nitride, a new magnetic material.  %%%  The fundamental research conducted on epitaxial crystal growth is  expected to improve the technology of the primary materials that  are used in microelectronics and micromagnetics.  Techniques to monitor the fabrication of a thin film that are  sensitive enough to monitor each atomic layer as it is added to  the film will be developed and used to control the fabrication  process so that new and more perfect structures can be created.  ***",
