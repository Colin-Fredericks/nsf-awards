The               conference will augment the group already in Hawaii with others                 whose work relates to the possibility of an Asia-Mainland origin                and who have established themselves as among the chief                          proponents, or the chief critics, of one or another of the major                extant hypotheses as to those origins. Evidence for the various                 hypotheses will be presented and debated during the four-day                    conference. The proceedings will be published in a single issue                 of Oceanic Linguistics: Special Publications.",
