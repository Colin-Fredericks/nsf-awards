 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experimental methods in the proposed research involve the                 cloning and sequencing of gap junction genes from the tobacco                   budworm and the fruitfly.  Gap junction  gene fragments will be                 isolated from cDNA libraries by polymerase chain reaction                       amplification using PCR primers synthesized from candidate insect               gap junction protein sequence already in hand.  PCR products will               be cloned, sequenced, and used to screen insect cDNA libraries for              full length gap junction genes.  Candidate genes will be molecular              characterized and confirmed to code for authentic gap junction                  protein in functional Xenopus oocyte expression assays and by                   immunocytochemistry.  Nucleic acid and antibody probes will be                  developed against gap junction genes and their proteins for use in              future studies which will utilize Drosophila as a model for                     investigations on the role of gap junctions in tissue growth and                patterning in multicellular animals.                                            %%%                                                                             The goal of the proposed research is to characterize at a molecular             level the gap junctions in insects.  Gap junctions consist of                   plasma membrane-associated protein channels through which ions and              small molecules pass directly between cells.  Gap junctions are                 thought to be involved in the cellular exchange of signalling                   molecules which regulate tissue growth and patterning.  Drosophila              provides a powerful experimental model to investigate the                       involvement of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication in             development.",
