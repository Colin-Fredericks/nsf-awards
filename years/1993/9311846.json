Demographic data                     provide little insight into what it is about spousal qualities                  and the stresses that couples confront that leads to unhappiness                and divorce. Recollections can be distorted as a consequence of                 the experiences associated with the divorce process. This                       research will use longitudinal data covering the first twelve                   years of the marital experience to overcome these handicaps.                                                                                                    This research seeks to determine the connection between the                     social and psychological characteristics partners bring to                      marriage, the early years of their marriage, and the cohesion and               stability of their union over twelve years. Data gathered between               1981 and 1983 will be supplemented with new data on parenting and               on economic hardship to predict more than twelve years after                    couples were wed: (a) the stability of their marriage (married                  vs. divorced); (b) the length of time (in months) their marriage                lasted; and (c) their level of marital satisfaction (for those                  still married). Changes in levels of compatibility also will be                 examined in regard to preferences in leisure activities and                     household work.                                                                                                                                                 The investigation extends a large-scale social psychology study                 on courtship and the early years of marriage into a long-term                   prospective study of the causes of dissatisfaction and divorce.                 It represents the first effort to trace over time the evolution                 of relationships that develop distress or end in divorce. The                   study should be valuable for marriage counselors working with                   couples either contemplating marriage or already married and                    should provide a firmer and deeper theoretical and substantive                  understanding of marital relations, in particular, and human                    relationships, more generally.",
