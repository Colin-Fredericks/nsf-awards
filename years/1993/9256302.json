 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of the National Science Foundation                 Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to increase the numbers of             talented U.S. undergraduates enrolling in doctoral programs in                  critical and emerging areas of science and engineering.  Proposals              were solicited from institutions whose existing facilities and                  staff could accommodate additional graduate students in Ph.D.                   programs of high quality.  The program is also intended to                      contribute to strengthening the Nation's human resource base across             all geographic sectors and among all under-represented groups.                  Graduate Research Traineeship awards are packages of student                    support.  The colleges and universities that receive the awards are             responsible for the selection of trainees, retention of trainees,               and administration of traineeships.                                                  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute will support Ph.D. students               in applied mathematics; the program addresses the following                     concerns:  (a) the academic need for applied mathematicians to                  provide academic training of students, (b) the industrial need for              applied mathematicians to maintain U.S. industrial competitiveness,             and (c) the need to increase the number of women and minority Ph.D.             applied mathematicians.  Students in the program will learn                     mathematical modeling, numerical computing, an outside (other than              mathematical) area, as well as a substantial background in the more             traditional areas of mathematics.  The program includes student                 participation in workshops and panels on mathematical problems in               industry where students can work with student-faculty teams to                  solve industrial problems.  Current areas of departmental research              include physical mathematics and modeling, nonlinear analysis,                  scientific computation, mathematical programming and operations                 research, and applied geometry.",
