 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9353279  Kennesaw State College  Marietta, GA    Lester, Army    \"Summer Science Camp For Precollege Minorities in Science and Engineering\"    The underrepresentation of African Americans, women and other minority groups in science,  engineering and math (SEM) is growing at an alarming rate.  While much effort is directed  toward this problem relative to inner city populations, the omission of rural and suburban  students excludes a valuable source of potential scientists, teachers and engineers.  This proposal  is designed of offer a four-week college/community operated summer science camp that will  foster the efforts of Kennesaw State College, local school systems and community organizations  to (1) help break the negative stigma of SEM related subjects; (2) help students develop the skills  and motivate them to do well in these courses; and (3) to provide less targeted students with  information on career opportunities in SEM.  Twenty-five 7th -9th grade students of suburban  Atlanta (Cobb County and Marietta City School Systems) will take part in this program.  Six  staff members and several volunteers will coordinate activities that include lectures and seminars,  guest speakers, laboratory studies, group research projects, career exploration, academic  enrichment and field trips.  Course work will cover a board range of SEM related courses, with  an emphasis on how such courses impact living organisms.  Special emphasis will be placed on  the teaching of science as a process.  The science camp component will start on June 13, 1993  and end on July 9, 1993.  Tutoring and mentoring will continue throughout the academic year.   The effectiveness of this program will be determined by the students' attitudes and behaviors  toward science, success of the participants in science classes and science fairs, and major/career  selection in college.",
