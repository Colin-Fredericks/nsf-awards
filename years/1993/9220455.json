 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns electronic transport in ultra-small metallic             structures.  These are structures in which one or more dimensions               are of order 1000 \u001a or less.  Fundamental questions concerning                  electron motion in disordered systems will be investigated.  These              structures will also be used as tools for the study of fundamental              physical phenomena.  Topics which will be investigated include the              effects of reduced dimensionality on the behavior of magnetic                   impurities (Kondo effect), nonlinear behavior in the presence of                microwave fields,  magnetization reversal through quantum tunneling             in individual 100 \u001a particles, and superconductivity in one                     dimension.                                                                      %%%                                                                             Ultra-small metallic structures form the basis of all current                   microelectronic devices.  The small size of these devices is                    central to their high performance and low cost, and thus there is               a continuing desire to develop ever smaller devices.  The purpose               of this research is two-fold.  First, to study the fundamental                  properties of metallic structures with sizes below 100 nanometers.              While this is considerably smaller than currently available                     commercial devices, structures in this size range will be of great              importance in future generations of devices.  It is important to                understand the behavior of these structures, particularly since                 they will likely exhibit new properties which are not found in                  larger structures.  Second, these structures will be used as tools              in the study of fundamental phenomena.  In many cases these                     structures can be used to probe effects which are not accessible                with larger structures.  Examples include superconductivity in one              dimension, and the effect of confinement on magnetic ions in                    metals.",
