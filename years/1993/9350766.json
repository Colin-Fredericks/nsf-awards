The emphasis is on  learning through student access to instrumentation rather than by  observation of teacher-executed demonstrations. With the  acquisition of modern equipment for biotechnology, students will be  able to culture living cells, isolate cellular organelles and  biomolecules, perform intricate analysis of these, and  investigate  the behavior of cellular components in normal and abnormal states.  Phase-contrast microscopes will permit study of structure and  function in intact, living cells. In all instances the experiments  will foster basic inquiry skills associated with the scientific  endeavor and will be models of science as it is practiced in the  technological arena. The results will be to provide future teachers  with appreciation and understanding of the interdependence of  science and technology and to train the all students in skills  vital to achievement of their career goals.",
