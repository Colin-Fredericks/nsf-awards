GT-                 SUPREEM is an eight-week summer research program designed to                    attract qualified minority students into the field of electrical                engineering.  Ten students of a least junior-level undergraduate                standing will be recruited annually on a nationwide basis and                   paired with both a faculty and a graduate student mentor to                     undertake research projects in the Georgia Tech School of                       Electrical Engineering.  The students will be housed on campus, and             in addition to lodging and a travel allowance, will be provided                 with a $3,000 stipend.  At the conclusion of the summer, the                    students will be expected to prepare both oral and written                      summaries of their research projects.  It is anticipated that this              experience will encourage these students to become applicants for               graduate school in ensuing years.",
