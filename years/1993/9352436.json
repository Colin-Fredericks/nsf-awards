One of  the specific goals is to introduce into the genetics and  developmental biology laboratories new exercises that promote  a better understanding of modern molecular biology concepts.  Students will be introduced to current biotechnology by hands-  on experience in bacterial and plant transformation as well as  plasmid extraction and restriction mapping. The analysis of  gene organization and expression by non-radioactive Southern  blots and Western blots analysis will expose students to  methods of basic and biomedical research. Acquisition of  equipment for DNA and protein electrophoresis and supportive  equipment will bring the existing departmental facilities for  undergraduate teaching to the state of the art of biological  techniques. Since molecular techniques are becoming an  integrative common line in all the biological sciences,  including ecological and evolutionary biology, these  laboratories will be an asset for Biology majors and allied  health students with diverse professional interests.  ***",
