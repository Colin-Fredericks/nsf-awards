 "awd_abstract_narration": "A pilot program will be developed which will serve as a model for               a year-long three-course series to meet the general science                     education requirement for students from 30 majors and the non-                  science colleges across 20 California State University campuses.                The major objective is to test the feasibility of using material                integrated and presented, not by discipline, but by common features             across the disciplines. Students are expected to achieve a deep                 understanding of the scientific method and the most important                   theories and mechanisms of seven sciences (Astronomy, Physics,                  Geology, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science and Mathematics)                  through a series of computer modules using systems process as                   unifying themes to present, explain and show the similarities                   between in-depth case studies from the disciplines. The pilot will              emulate the innovative, hybrid method planned for 30-week courses,              using computer-based multimedia modules that provide computer-based             self-study, use of case studies from the individual disciplines,                weekly group discussion, skill training sessions and general                    assembly debates, and a fully inter-disciplinary lab, all involving             team teaching.                                                                  The project would result in twenty specific products that are                   highly portable to other campuses including multimedia modules,                 their multidisciplinary team-produced \"scripts\",study pamphlets for             each module, guidelines for discussion groups and one set of seven              interdisciplinary laboratory protocols.",
