 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weak localization of electrons in thin metal films is used to                   observe electron scattering from impurity atoms arising from spin-              orbit and magnetic electron-impurity atom interactions.  Transport              data measured as a function of an applied magnetic field can be                 interpreted to yield information about the electronic structure of              the impurity atoms.  Earlier research on s and p impurities is                  being expended and extended to include d impurities.  An additional             subproject will investigate thin films under the influence of a                 high current density.  This corresponds to a steady non-equilibrium             state with the electron temperature considerably above the phonon               temperature.  Such measurements yield information about the                     electron-phonon system, the electron-phonon interaction and the                 Kapitza resistance between film and the substrate.                              %%%                                                                             Because of quantum effects, electrons in metals display both                    particle and wave properties.  At low temperatures, the electron                waves are coherent over extended distances and influence the                    properties of the metal.  In particular, the transport properties               such as the resistance are modified because the electron waves can              interfere with each other.  An external magnetic field alters the               phase of the electron waves and modifies the interference.  As a                consequence the resistance depends on the magnetic field.  (For                 historical reasons, this phenomena is called weak localization).                A careful analysis of the magneto-resistance reveals detailed                   information about the fate of the electrons as a function of time.              For example, we can determine the rotation of the electron spin as              a function of time on the very short time scale of pico-seconds                 (one millionth of a millionth of a second).  Such a rotation occurs             when the electron encounters impurities and is called spin-orbit                scattering.  This scattering is being studied for various impurity              atoms (copper, zinc, gold, tin, etc.) in host magnesium metal.  The             research provides important information about the magnetic and                  electronic properties of metals and alloys and will aid in the                  development of new materials with useful properties, particularly               at low temperatures.",
