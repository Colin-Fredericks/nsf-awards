 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313334  Sherman  Research and research training activities are integral to the  success of the psychology faculty and students at St. Olaf  College.  The Department of Psychology is experiencing an  increase in student demand in cognitive science, neuroscience and  animal behavior research.  Holland Hall, home to the psychology  department, was constructed in 1924 as the college's first  science building and was last renovated in 1970.   Laboratories  designed twenty years ago no longer meet the needs of the current  discipline. This award will provide funding for the modernization  of psychology research laboratories at St. Olaf College.  The  laboratories that will be affected by the renovations involve the  areas of: perception, neuroscience, operant conditioning,  computation, psychophysiology and two support rooms.  The  renovations will rectify problems by configuring laboratory  space, making it accessible to persons with disabilities;  providing sound attenuated and electrical shielding where  necessary, and correcting plumbing, ventilation and climate  control systems.  This modernization will significantly improve  the infrastructure required for individual faculty,  collaborative, and undergraduate research and research training  in the Psychology department at St. Olaf.  ***",
