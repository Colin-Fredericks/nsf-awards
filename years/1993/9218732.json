 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen sulfide is an extremely toxic industrial waste responsible             for a number of deaths in California in the last year alone.  These             incidents involved a paper recycling factory in Los Angeles                     enveloped by a cloud of toxic sulfide gas and a railroad spill of               metam sodium resulting in the release of methyl isothiocyanate and              hydrogen sulfide gas as breakdown products.  The proposed project               investigates sulfide detoxification in the peripheral tissues of a              marine worm.  Although our previous studies of adaptations to low               oxygen and sulfide indicate that this animal detoxifies sulfide in              internal fluids, the question of how the body tissues are protected             or tolerate toxic sulfide remains unanswered.  Preliminary data                 suggest that the peripheral tissues possess distinct sulfide                    detoxification or tolerance mechanisms, including the presence of               sulfide-oxidizing bodies and symbiotic bacteria.  The binding or                transformation of sulfide to nontoxic forms of sulfur in the                    external body tissues.  Elucidation of these peripheral defense                 mechanisms will provide a significant contribution to the                       understanding of tolerance and treatment of sulfide poisoning.                  Additionally, the studies outlined in the proposal will contribute              to the well established field of sulfide metabolism and                         detoxification in animals.  Funding of the research project would               result in continued assistance to undergraduate and graduate                    students and be a significant contribution to the research                      environment at San Francisco State University.",
