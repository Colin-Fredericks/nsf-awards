 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309179  Gedney  The purpose of this project is the  development of techniques that will  provide the fullwave analysis of  complex electrical interconnect  networks of VLSI packages.  To  facilitate the accelerated  development of high performance  VLSI devices, accurate and  efficient analysis tools are  essential for the proper design of  the electronic interconnects.   Principally, these methods will  provide, 1) the extraction of  transmission-line equivalent  circuit parameters over a broad  frequency range, 2) the modeling of  coupling between interconnect  etchs, signal lines, leads, or  other coupled lines in complex  environments, and 3) accurate  simulations of pulse propagation on  three-dimensional interconnect  networks.  The proposed analysis  techniques are based on: i) a  generalized Yee-algorithm based on  unstructured grids, and ii) a time-  domain finite element method based  on higher-order vector elements.   These methods are extremely robust,  and are capable of simulating  temporal field in complex  environment, as well as being  highly computationally efficient.   Furthermore, they are designed to  be interfaced with computer aided  modeling and tools to facilitate  the design engineer.  The  simulation of complex electrical  interconnect networks will lead to  sizable problems with potentially  109 degree of freedom.  To  facilitate problems of this scale,  efficient prarallel algorithms are  proposed.  Specifically, spatial  decomposition techniques will be  used for both the generalized Yee-  algorithm and the time domain  finite element method, while  efficient iterative matrix solution  algorithms based on domain  decomposition methods, e.g.,  additive Schwarz methods with a  coarse preconditioner based on a  wire-basket based method, will be  studied for the time-domain finite  element method approach.  ***",
