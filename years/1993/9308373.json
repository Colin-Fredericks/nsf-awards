 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous resampling methods for variance estimation and                    confidence intervals in sample surveys have been proposed in the                statistical literature.  In most cases, their theoretical                       properties are not well understood and there is little evidence                 that the methods offer a significant improvement over standard                  approaches based on linearization and normal approximation.  The                proposed research involves extending recent foundational work on                resampling techniques for data obtained by stratified random                    sampling to more complex survey designs. In particular, this                    involves the development of Edgeworth expansion theory                          appropriate for double sampling and two-stage cluster sampling                  plans. A second component of the proposal describes a                           nonparametric prediction-based approach to inference in sample                  surveys which utilizes existing bootstrap methods for estimating                conditional distributions. In addition to theoretical work, a                   thorough numerical investigation of the proposed methods will be                conducted and applications to real data will be presented.                           In today's \"Information Age\" an ever-increasing quantity of                data is collected and the need for reliable data summary                        techniques has never been more critical.  Unfortunately, much of                the data encountered in practical problems does not satisfy the                 conditions necessary for standard statistical methods to work                   well.  The sheer quantity of information often prohibits or, at                 least, inhibits the identification of these potential                           difficulties and hence blind application of many statistical                    procedures is commonplace.  In addition, there is a constant need               to develop new statistical methodology which can be used to                     analyze increasingly complex sampling designs. The proposed                     research is part of an ongoing effort to develop widely                         applicable and \"robust\" statistical methods for analyzing survey                data. The proposed methods will utilize widespread access to                    faster computers allowing statistical techniques which were not                 feasible only a few years ago to be used routinely.",
