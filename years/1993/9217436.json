This project investigates the use of the binary-pair partitioning  (BPP) method, which partitions an N-way classification task with  N*(N-1)/2 pair-discrimination classifiers, in the problem of  speaker and dialect identification.  The complexity of the BPP  networks grows with N2 and the method, which has been examined in  a preliminary way for speaker identification, is well suited for  cases where the talker identification task involves a large number  of speakers (N>100).  The preliminary studies of speaker  identification with the BPP method involved 100 male speakers  belonging to three dialect regions of the DARPA/TIMIT database.   The system performed with 100% accuracy in a text independent than  results reported in the literature for similar tasks.  The BPP  approach is also suited for tasks where multiple elemental  decisions can be combined to obtain an overall decision, such as  dialect or language identification.  Refinements and extensions to  the method will be investigated, such as (1) enhancement of the  input features, (2) the effects of noise and channel distortion on  performance, (3) performance in a speaker verification mode as well  as in an identification mode, (4) performance in sex and dialect  identification, (5) improvements that this method may provide for  speech recognition, and (6) training of BPP networks to minimize  the probability of error rather than the mean square error.",
