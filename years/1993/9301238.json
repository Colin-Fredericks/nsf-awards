 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project convenes a US-Japan Workshop on Earthquake                         Protective Systems in Tsukuba, Japan in December 1992.  This                    Workshop will involve researchers and designers from both                       countries to discuss progress in the development and                            application of earthquake protective systems to bridges.                        Topics to be covered include:  (1) innovative protective                        systems; (2) design methods for base isolated bridges; (3)                      design of utilities carried by isolated bridges so as to                        accommodate movement; and (4) full-scale verification of                        performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A comparison of US and Japanese isolation designs for the                       same bridge will also be made.  Designs will be completed                       before the 1992 Workshop, so that the results are available                     for presentation and discussion.  The program also includes                     site visits to several base-isolated bridges as well as                         several major bridges currently under construction in Japan.                                                                                                                                                                                    The Workshop is expected to produce recommendations about                       cooperative research projects which are of benefit of both                      countries.",
