 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305250  Magnus  This project will employ x-ray diffraction methods to establish  the three-dimensional structures of an important class of  biological macromolecules known as hemocyanins (\"blue bloods\").   Proteins that bind and carry oxygen are of fundamental importance  to multicellular animals.  Hemocyanins are of particular interest  because they are larger and more complex aggregates of subunits  than have routinely been studied previously and because of the  interest in the chemical nature of the interaction between copper  and oxygen.  The structures of hemocyanins, copper-containing  oxygen-transport molecules found in a variety of invertebrates  including shrimps, lobsters, crabs, scorpions and spiders, show  the oxygen binding geometry in atomic detail.  Because the data  collection time for an x-ray diffraction experiment usually spans  several days, the actual mechanistic steps involved in binding,  which occurs on a millisecond time scale, are not observed  directly.  Instead by studying the protein structure in the  presence and absence of oxygen, it is possible to deduce which  the 628 amino acid residues that comprise the hemocyanin protein  subunit are likely to be involved in oxygen binding and its  regulation.  These predictions may be tested by using molecular  biological techniques to produce genetically tailored versions of  hemocyanin whose properties may also be examined  crystallographically and spectroscopically.  %%%  The goal of the proposed project is to extend understanding of  how protein structure effects control of functions in  hemocyanins.  These copper-containing proteins are responsible  for facilitating oxygen uptake and delivery in a variety of  invertebrates.  Cooperative ligand binding in the large molecular  weight subunit aggregates that comprise hemocyanin is modulated  by an assortment of effectors including protons, divalent cations  and chloride ions.  The proposed x-ray crystallographic studies  of the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, will prov ide  information of the conformations of high and low affinity forms  of hemocyanin, leading to a better picture of how cooperative  ligan binding occurs.  Complementary functional studies will be  performed using spectroscopic and kinetic measurements to  characterize hemocyanin fragment, subunits, aggregates and  chemically modified forms.  ***",
