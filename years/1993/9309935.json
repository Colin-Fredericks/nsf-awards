 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309935  Eaton    Much of the recent macroeconomic literature seeking to explain  international differences in labor productivity and in growth  rates assumes severe impediments to international capital  mobility but instantaneous international transmission of  technology.  In contrast, much of the international trade  literature has treated technology as imperfectly mobile, and has  sought to attribute differences in growth rates and in living  standards to differences in available technologies.  The purpose  of this research is to answer the following questions: (1) What  factors determine the rate at which innovations emanate from  different countries?  (2)  To what extent and how rapidly do  innovations in particular countries affect productivity  elsewhere?  (3)  How do countries differ in terms of their  propensity to absorb innovations from other countries?  (4)  What  are the implications of the answers to the previous questions for  long-run growth and productivity differentials?  The relationship  between technology and international economic growth is one of  the central issues in the economics of global change.  Future  scenarios about the long-run consequences of different  environmental policies depend on our understanding of this  relationship.  Also the emphasis on international capital  mobility makes the research relevant to the debate about the  significance of investments in national civil infrastructure  because one of the principal arguments for investing in civil  infrastructure is that it improves U.S. productivity and growth  rates relative to other countries.    More specifically, the investigators analyze theoretically and  econometrically the process of technological innovation at the  national level, and the diffusion of technologies across  countries.  One component of the project is the development of a  macroeconomic model of a set of interdependent economies that  incorporates technical progress and capital accumulation at the  national level as explanations fo r growth, and that allows for  varying degrees of international mobility of both capital and  technology.l  The model is adapted and used for econometric  estimation and simulation.  Initially the focus will be at the  aggregate level, with subsequent work studying the creation and  international diffusion of technology within individual  industries.  The analysis will make use of OECD data on industry-  level productivity, R&D expenditures, and scientists and  engineers, the Yale-Canada patent data, and national accounts  data provided by the World Bank and by Heston and Summers.  ***",
