 "awd_abstract_narration": "9253358  Bowen    The National Teacher Enhancement Project (NTEP) is a  collaborative five-year effort of the Department of Energy  (DOE) national laboratories to improve science education in  grades K-8.  The project is designed to create cadres of  lead teachers who will serve as role models and mentors for  their colleagues and who will be district leaders in  systemic reform initiatives.  Several additional  laboratories will be included in the current effort.  The  laboratories will optimize their impact on science and  mathematics education by strengthening their growing  collective efforts and by providing regional teachers with  access to resources through the DOE national network.   During this project over 240 teachers will receive direct  training at the laboratories, and each of them will conduct  inservice programs for other teachers in their schools, this  impacting a large number of teachers nationally.    This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because  it is a leadership project which will bring elementary  teachers into the science community, provide extensive  networking among teachers and the National Laboratories, and  leverage effective synergy among the participating  Laboratories through its truly collaborative design.  It is  also consistent with FCCSET and other national efforts to  coordinate, facilitate, and strengthen efforts to improve  science education.     Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 120% of the amount  requested from NSF.  ***",
