 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312648  Cushing         Under this project, the Evergreen State College, Oregon  Graduate Institute of Science & Technology, and the Washington  Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education will  integrate into undergraduate curricula at Evergreen State recent  research results in object-oriented databases, scientific data  management and visualization, higher order logics, and neural  networks. These curricular innovations specifically target non-  Ph.D. granting institutions.         Two interdisciplinary Evergreen programs will serve as  prototypes: (1) the software engineering of scientific  applications, and (2) advanced studies in theoretical computer  science, mathematics and cognitive science. Expected outcomes of  the work are three-fold: (1) Course materials such as syllabi,  workshops, and case studies; (2) A model for non-Ph.D. granting  institutions for initiating programs of excellence in advanced  computer science; and (3) A model for disseminating computer  science curricular innovation. Incorporated in the project are a  number of activities designed to increase the participation of  women and minorities, including special efforts with Native  Americans.         Dissemination is effected through workshops, designed in  conjunction with the Washington Center and conducted jointly by OGI  researchers and Evergreen faculty. Workshops addressing course  materials will be offered first on a regional basis, using proven  methods for curricular innovation. Later, national workshops will  address the curricular innovations developed as well as the  development, assessment and regional dissemination of those  innovations.  ***",
