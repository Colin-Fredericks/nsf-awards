The conference will focus  attention on the Foundation's role in the education of minorities  who are underrepresented in science, engineering and mathematics  (SEM) fields.  Conference activities will include research  presentations by more than 300 student participants in NSF-  sponsored research projects, and hearings on major issues  identified in the 1992 conference Action Plan.  The university  would prepare an abstract of student presentations, and design and  schedule activities to encourage student interactions with role  models and other minority SEM students, leading to the formation of  a support group to reinforce student selection of SEM majors and  careers.  Grant activities also would include scheduling student  travel and hotel accommodations, and arranging transportation to  the conference for local area precollege and college students.",
