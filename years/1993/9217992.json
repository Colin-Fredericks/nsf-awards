 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of 14 U.S. scientists in a                U.S.-Japan Seminar on Dynamics, Photophysical and Photochemical                 Events Involving Clusters, to be held in Hawaii December 16-19,                 1993.  The co-organizers are Professor A. W. Castleman, Jr. of                  Pennsylvania State University and Professor Tamotsu Kondow of the               University of Tokyo.  In addition to the U.S. and Japanese                      participants, a scientist from Germany has been invited.                                                                                                        During the last decade or so, there has been a dramatic growth of               activity in the field of cluster research.  Reference to clusters               permeates the literature of a very broad cross section of basic                 and applied science from that dealing with condensed matter and                 surfaces to interstellar space.  In particular, clusters provide                a unique way of investigating properties of matter at different                 degrees of aggregation and therefore yield information on                       changing properties and reactivity that serves to bridge the gas                and condensed state.                                                                                                                                            The seminar is organized around eight general topics in the area                of the dynamics of isolated cluster systems:  electronic effects;               electron solvation; cluster spectroscopy and structure; cluster                 properties, structure, and formation; dynamics and photophysical                events; reactions in hydrogen bonded and van Der Waals systems;                 reactions of semiconcuctor and metallic systems; and collisions                 with surfaces and condensed matter.  This meeting, which will                   emphasize recent advances and develop ideas for future research                 direction, should lead to collaborative research activities                     between U.S. and Japanese scientists in this important field.",
