 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this effort is to develop a parallel 3D fast boundary               element method with enhanced computational speed, low storage                   requirement and reduced inter-processor communication overhead.                 A preliminary 2D calculation carried out at Continuum Dynamics,                 Inc. has demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed new method.               It is based on an application of a fast methodology which we                    recently developed for a fast vortex computation.  A new inter-                 processor communication algorithm with low overhead, which we                   developed for the parallel fast vortex method, will be used.  Two               applications of the new method will be carried out:  (i)  flow                  around solid body for aeronautical application and pharmaceutical               application.  The proposed enhancement to the boundary element will             allow realistic representation of the complex surface geometry                  encountered in a complete aircraft configuration or a protein                   macromolecule using as many as tens of thousands of computational               boundary elements.",
