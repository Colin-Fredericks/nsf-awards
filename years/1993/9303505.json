 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with bounds for mean values in                  additive number theory, and the local solubility of simultaneous                additive equations.  The principal investigator intends to improve              estimates in Vinogradov's mean value theorem by incorporating the               ideas behind the new refinements in the corresponding work in                   Waring's problem.  These improvements will have consequences beyond             additive number theory.                                                              This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
