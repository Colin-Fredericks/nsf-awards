 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project in chemistry is                       between Dr. David Hunkeler of Vanderbilt University and                         Dr. Dusan Berek of the Polymer Institute, Slovak Academy                        of Science.  The researchers will use the concept of                            chromotographic invisibility to identify critical                               conditions where the retention volume of a polymer in a                         mixed element is independent of molecular weight.  They                         will compare two approaches for generating critical                             conditions:  (1) Belenki's method where the elution                             strength of the binary mixture is varied to control the                         adsorption and exclusion of the macromolecules and (2) the                      Hunkeler-Macko-Berek technique where the thermodynamic                          quality of the mobile phase is varied to balance the free                       energy of adsorption and precipitation with that of                             redissolution and exclusion.  The influence of                                  temperature, pressure and sample concentration on the                           behavior of selected polymers at their critical conditions                      will also be evaluated.  The critical conditions will be                        correlated with properties which characterize the                               macromolecule in solution.  The identified critical                             conditions will then be applied to the separation and                           identification of polymer blends and block and graft                            copolymers according to their molecular weight and                              composition.                                                                                                                                                    This project in polymer research fulfills the program                           objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and pool resources in areas                       of strong mutual interest and competence.",
