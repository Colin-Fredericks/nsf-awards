 "awd_abstract_narration": "A dramatic seasonal increase in toxicity of monarch                        butterflies appears crucial to their spring and summer                          recolonization of North America.  Monarchs larvae feed on milkweed              plants and sequester poisonous cardenolides from them.  These                   chemicals protect the butterflies from predation because they are               bitter and cause birds to vomit.  Monarch butterflies migrate each              fall to Mexico, then reinvade eastern North America the following               spring.  Since cardenolides change during the annual migration                  cycle, monarchs feeding on different milkweed species lose their                deterrent qualities at different rates.  Fall migrants feed on a                weakly emetic milkweed; subsequent cardenolide loss leads to a                  partial breakdown of their chemical defense in Mexico, where                    orioles and grosbeaks eat millions of butterflies each winter.                  However, monarchs that survive and migrate back to the USA lay                  their eggs on extremely poisonous southern milkweeds, producing a               new generation of apparently toxic butterflies that complete the                spring migration northward to Canada.  Bioassays using birds and                chemical assays of the cardenolides will document the postulated                increase in toxicity of the spring generation.  The results should              provide definitive evidence that the milkweed-based chemical                    defense of the monarch is a predictably dynamic phenomenon                      inextricably entwined with its annual migration cycle.                          %%%                                                                             Logging of the fir forests in central Mexico is destroying the                  overwintering habitat of the monarch butterfly.  Because of this,               the monarch's migration in Eastern North America has been                       designated an endangered biological phenomenon, a new category of               biodiversity conservation.  This research program will document the             biology of the spring remigration before the predicted collapse of              the monarch population over the next 10-15 years.  It is also                   relevant to conservation of milkweed habitat in eastern North                   America for the maintence of monarch population in spring & summer.",
