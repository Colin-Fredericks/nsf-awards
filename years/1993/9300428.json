 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at the                      University of Central Florida will expose ten undergraduate                     students, chosen from institutions throughout the Southeast to                  thirteen weeks of research experiences in the development and                   applications of lasers.  A primary emphasis of this program will                be to encourage talented undergraduate students, in particular                  women, minorities, and persons with disabilities, to pursue                     graduate studies in the field of electro-optics and lasers.  Eight              internationally recognized faculty in the Center for Research in                Electro-Optics and Lasers (CREOL), which is a recognized center of              excellence in optics and laser research, will be Research                       Supervisors in this program.  The program will include: 1) An                   introductory course in the basic principals of optics and lasers;               2) A course on laser systems; 3) Weekly Research Seminars by the                CREOL faculty and other experts organized specifically for the REU              students; 4) Biweekly industrial visits to the numerous optics and              laser companies in the Orlando area; 5) Weekly classes and                      discussion sessions on issues of ethics in science and engineering              research; 6) Continuous monitoring of the students' progress by the             principal investigators.  All of the activities will take place in              the summer term of 1993.",
