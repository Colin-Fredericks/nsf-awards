This year's symposium is                  organized by David McClay, current President of the SDB.  The title             of the meeting will be \"Annual Meeting of the Society for                       Developmental Biology\" with a broad range of topics selected for                the six platform sessions.  Topics will include \"Gamete                         Morphogenesis, Fertilization and Egg Activation\", \"Cell                         Interactions\", \"Pattern Formation\", \"Transcriptional Regulation in              Development\", \"Axial Organization of the Embryo,\" and \"New                      Approaches Being Applied in Model Developmental Systems\".  Each                 session will include several different animal and plant model                   systems in order to show the diverse mechanisms for solving a                   variety of developmental problems.  In addition, several                        minisymposia are being planned on plant developmental genetics.  In             the past five years the meeting has been of medium-size (300-400                registrants) with a single platform session (about 30 speakers                  total) and 60-80 posters presented at two sessions.  This year, the             last day of the meeting will be held at Woods Hole, a short                     distance from Providence, RI.  The symposium on the last day will               celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Woods Hole Embryology                    Course, a course that has had a strong role in the training of                  developmental biologists in the United States and around the world.             The meeting is attended by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows,             and senior researchers.",
