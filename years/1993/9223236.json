 "awd_abstract_narration": "Are recessions cleansing?  Do they weed out outdated technologies               so that firms emerge lean and mean?  Do recessions have permanent               effects on the level of productivity and output?  Are more new                  products introduced during booms than during recessions?  Are                   business cycle fluctuations bad for innovation and hence growth?                This project helps answer these questions by examining the                      interaction between innovation and business cycles.  The                        investigation involves both structural modeling and empirical                   research.                                                                                                                                                       More specifically, the model of process innovation developed                    emphasizes the learning curve dynamics of adopting a new                        production process.  The model has a rich set of testable                       implications, and these will be confronted by U.S. data on                      manufacturing industries.  The data are culled from a compendium                of trade journal articles covering 1972 to the present.  The                    focus is on the cyclicality of product innovation, and on whether               most new goods are producer or consumer goods; durable or                       nondurable goods; complements or substitutes for existing goods.                The model of product innovation is guided by the empirical                      evidence documented in the data set.  The analysis is of research               firms facing exogenous demand shocks.  Implications of durability               of the new products and substitutability between new and existing               products are developed.",
