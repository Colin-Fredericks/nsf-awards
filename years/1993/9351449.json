 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351449  Anderson  The laboratory sequence of the introductory physics courses  required of all science majors, \"Fundamentals of Physics I and  II\", have been redesigned and upgraded through the addition of  computer-assisted laboratories (CAL) that focus on multiple  concept experiments (MCE), and that employ \"state-of-the art\"  data acquisition techniques.  Although the multi-concept  approach normally entails complicated set-ups and complex data  collection, the use of data acquisition instrumentation  simplifies the procedural aspects of such experiments.  The MCE  series being implemented are based on magnetoelastic phenomena;  simple harmonic motion and resonance; elastic properties, speed  of sound, and modulus; damping, Q and efficiency; magnetic  fields in induction; and ferromagnetism, permeability, and  magnetostriction.      CAL software is being utilized that is portable between  different computer platforms and that can be easily programmed  to do sophisticated control and analysis of any type of  experiment.  The selected software - Lab View II - employs real  and virtual instruments.  The students simply use a window  interface to select the experiment.  After reviewing the  procedure and performing an optional tutorial and simulation,  the students set-up the experiment using both real and virtual  instruments.    Computer-assisted instructional modules (not part of this  grant) enable students to engage in self-paced study and review  of course content, including the laboratory experience.    ***",
