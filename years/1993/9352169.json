The specific experiments are:   1. to measure magnetic field exposures such as those due to  household appliances and distribution or transmission lines,   2. to calculate the electric and magnetic fields under  transmission lines,   3. to determine experimentally and numerically the magnetic  fields around different wiring configurations, (The design of  different devices such as electric blankets will be related to  this experiment.)   4. to determine experimentally and numerically the magnetic  fields around different types of motors, and   5. to calculate the electric field around and in a dielectric  sphere exposed to a given electric field. (This experiment  provides a model for a biological cell in an electric field and  the effect of the electric field on the cell.)  ***",
