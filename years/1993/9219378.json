 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Woodbury proposes to investigate the mechanism of initial                   electron transfer in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers.                 Particular interests lie in furthering the understanding of the                 role that the protein matrix plays in modulating the thermodynamic              and kinetic parameters of photosynthetic electron transfer.  To                 this end, Dr. Woodbury will utilize a combination of directed                   mutagenesis to alter the amino acids near the reaction center                   cofactors and transient spectroscopy to assay the kinetics and                  thermodynamics of electron transfer between redox active cofactors              as well as to identify the mechanistically important intermediates              involved in this reaction.  Several specific projects are proposed.             One involves the use of site-directed mutagenesis to investigate                the effect of hydrogen bonding on the redox properties of the                   initial electron donor and then to determine the effect of changing             this important thermodynamic parameter on the electron transfer                 mechanism.  Dr. Woodbury will perform most of the fast spectroscopy             in this project; the mutants were designed and constructed by Allen             and Williams.  Another project involves comparing the electron                  transfer mechanisms of reaction centers from different organisms by             exchanging regions of DNA sequence between the reaction center                  genes of these organisms.  At the level of the protein backbone,                the reaction center has a near two fold-rotational symmetry.                    However, the amino acids present on the two sides are largely                   different.  The result is that electron transfer is very                        asymmetric, occurring almost exclusively down one of the two                    possible pathways, even though two pathways exist with chemically               identical cofactors.  This will be studied by exchanging regions                between the two sides and performing spectroscopic analysis of the              direction, kinetics and intermediate states involved in initial                 electron transfer.                                                              %%%                                                                             There are two broader goals of the project.  First, an                          understanding of solar energy conversion during photosynthesis is               itself a major interest of this laboratory.  Essentially all of the             energy used by living organisms ultimately comes from this source,              and a mechanistic understanding of this process could be very                   useful in the development of molecular devices that require a                   specific energy input (which is what a reaction center really is).              Second, the reaction center provides an excellent laboratory for                the study of cofactor-protein interactions in general.  There are               few protein-chromophore systems where reaction mechanism can be                 probed in such detail on time scales as short as femtoseconds                   (which encompasses the time scale of molecular motion).  Here                   again, the information obtained from these studies can be used in               the rational design of many types of molecular devices and in the               understanding of a very wide range of protein-mediated chemical                 reactions.",
