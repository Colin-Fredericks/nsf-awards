 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the generalization of the                  two well known regression models for duration times, the                        proportional hazards model ant the accelerated failure time                     model, to a mixed model with both fixed effects and a random                    effect.  In particular, the objective of this research is to                    consider score and likelihood ratio tests for the presence of the               random effect in the proportional hazards model and to consider                 both a method of estimation for the regression coefficient and                  nonparametric likelihood estimation of the error distribution in                the mixed effects, accelerated failure time model.                                   Many areas of scientific endeavor, such as demography,                     duration analysis in economics, reliability in manufacturing, and               survival analysis in medical studies, are confronted with                       dependent duration times.  This research is concerned with a                    generalization of two often used models to a model which is more                realistic.",
