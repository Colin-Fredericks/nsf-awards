 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the primary challenges facing philosophy of science today is             to explain, if not to justify, scientific methodologies for                     learning about the world.  Dr. Mayo is developing a model of                    experimental testing that resolves key questions in philosophy of               statistics and answers the current challenge facing philosophers of             science to demonstrate the rationality of science.                                                                                                              Dr. Mayo's testing model is based on standard Neyman-Pearson (NP)               statistics.  Despite its widespread use in science, NP theory has               been the center of disputes raised by nearly all philosophers of                statistics and confirmation, and many scientists as well.  Dr. Mayo             aims to resolve these criticisms.   She is setting out a framework              in which statistical tests link data to hypotheses via a series of              models.  She shows how piecing together local statistical tests                 permits errors to be detected and corrected, and argues that,                   suitably reinterpreted, NP methods provide an adequate account of               what permits us to learn from experiments.                                                                                                                      Dr. Mayo uses the resulting account of experimental inquiry to                  grapple with key obstacles to theory testing:  theory ladeness of               data, relativity to background assumptions, and underdetermination              of theory by data.  The challenge to overcome such obstacles,                   raised by Thomas Kuhn and many others, has influenced the thinking              in many fields.  The audience for this project includes                         philosophers, statisticians, scientists, historians, sociologists,              and students of interdisciplinary studies in science and society.",
