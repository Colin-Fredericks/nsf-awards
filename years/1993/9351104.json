 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital Imaging is an emerging discipline with widespread                       applications in science and engineering.  We are introducing                    digital image acquisition and processing as standard techniques                 throughout our laboratory curriculum.  Recent advances in                       digital video and in the power of microcomputers have made                      imaging technology a powerful and cost-effective new tool for                   data acquisition and analysis in undergraduate physics                          laboratories. Inexpensive systems are now available which can                   capture full-motion digital video directly to computer disk at                  live video rates.  We are using these systems to improve                        laboratory instruction in our introductory, modern physics, and                 advanced laboratories.  Each laboratory station is being                        networked and equipped with a television camera, video                          acquisition hardware, and a computer capable of processing and                  displaying video images. In the introductory laboratory these                   systems are being used to study motion, wave phenomena and                      optical diffraction and interference.  Live video is especially                 well suited for the quantitative motion studies since it is                     capable of capturing and quantifying a wide variety of                          phenomena without the construction of special apparatus.  With                  video, motion is recorded far more completely than is possible                  with photogates even when trajectories cannot be predicted.                     For advanced laboratories we have purchased an instructional                    scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and a powder camera and                     develop experiments using digital image processing techniques                   to compare images of atomic structures (ATM) with electron and                  x-ray diffraction patterns. Standardization of imaging hardware                 and software across our curriculum allows students to build                     skills efficiently, preparing them for research with four                       faculty members who use digital imaging techniques.  We make                    full-motion and still frame images and curricular materials                     available to others by maintaining a listserver and supporting                  anonymous file transfers (FTP) via the Internet.",
