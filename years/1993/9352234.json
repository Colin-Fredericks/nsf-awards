Specifically the project has  three main purposes: (i) introducing symbolic computation to  freshmen, (ii) introducing field programmable gate arrays  (FPGA) to sophomores, and (iii) connecting entry level students  using personal computers (PC) to workstations using X-Windows.  It will change the course content in all of our freshman,  sophomore, and junior electrical engineering classes. Teaching  freshmen Maple (symbolic computation) and MATLAB (high level  numerical computation) will make them more effective in all of  their mathematics, science, and engineering classes. Using  FPGAs with the proper software will allow sophomore digital  electronics students to solve real world problems within the  time constraints of a weekly laboratory session. Running X-  Windows with Microsoft Windows on PCs will give beginning  students access to a variety of easy-to-use graphics based  tools on the PCs, the Electrical Engineering Department SUNs,  and the Tech Computer Center workstations. This will provide  workstation tools to a wide audience, in a friendly atmosphere,  at a low cost per user.  ***",
