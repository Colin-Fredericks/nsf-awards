A series of experiments will   examine these factors at the individual, intraspecific, and interspecific levels in   the laboratory and in the field. Field experiments using labeled phosphorus and   carbon will be used to monitor transfer of nutrients from mycorrhizal fungi to   plants and vice versa. Studies will be conducted at the Smithsonian Tropical   Forest Research Institute to address the role of fungi in the restoration of   degraded tropical forest ecosystems.  %%%  This study will obtain the first tropical data on the complex interactions of light,   infection, and translocation, and will demonstrate the extent to which these affect   individual plant production in a community, as well as local community dynamics.   These data are critical for a better understanding of the belowground ecosystem   and how it affects natural succession and reforestation in the tropics.  ***",
