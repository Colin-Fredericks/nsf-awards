 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311210  Whitham       Primary work has detect an interaction involving beavers, leaf  beetles, and cottonwood trees:  beetles appear to hypothesis that  beetles benefit from beaver herbivory.  cottonwoods contain  salicin, a chemical that is an effective defense against mammalian  herbivores but is sequestered and used by the beetles for their own  defense,  the PIs pose that beetles are attracted to beaver-cut  trees because the resprout growth is both nutritionally superior  and chemically better defended.    Beetles fed resprout growth develop faster, weigh more at maturity,  and are better defended against predators than those fed  nonresprout growth.  This study expands previous work to assess  whether 1) resprout cottonwood is nutritionally a better food  resource for beetles and 2) resprout cotton wood contains more  defensive chemicals that directly benefit the beetles.  The study  also examines the importance of beaver herbivory in affecting the  distribution of beetles and will examine the generality of this  interaction by censuring other river systems.  %%%  Indirect interactions between distantly related taxed have rarely  been studied in detail.  The current study focuses on such on  interaction.  This is important to identify in the cottonwood  system because beavers are keystone species that can alter the  environment at the landscape level, & cottonwoods are currently  suffering widespread dieback in the western US..  ***",
