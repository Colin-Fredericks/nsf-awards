 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of hypersonic aircraft requires a high degree of                    system integration.  Design tools are needed that can provide                   rapid, accurate calculations of complex fluid flow patterns.                    Existing methods, while reasonably accurate, are much too                       efficient design.  This project addresses that need.  The                       application of neural networks will be used to model coolant flow               patterns.                                                                                                                                                       First, the ability of neural networks to model coolant flow will                be demonstrated at the component level.  A single heat exchanger                component will be modeled by a neural network and trained using                 data generated by the existing flow equations.  Then multiple                   components in series within a flow leg will be modeled using a                  series of neural networks.  Next these legs will be joined in                   parallel to form a heat exchanger panel.  Finally, various                      combinations of panels in series and parallel will be molded                    using hierarchical neural networks.  A combination of neural                    network software and computational hardware will be proposed for                a potential Phase II effort in which this computational                         capability will be made user friendly and accessible to design                  engineers with minimal neural network background.",
