 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Hopkins, of the University of Pittsburgh, will                        synthesize transition-metal compounds having conjugated bonding                 systems with support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                      Organometallic Chemistry Program.  These compounds will                         incorporate an array of bonds to achieve this objective,                        including metal-metal delta bonds, metal-ligand pi bonds, and                   ligand pi bonds.  In most of the compounds the metal centers                    will be molybdenum and tungsten, and the ligands will include                   phosphines, alkylidenes, alkylidynes, and bridging dienes.  The                 compounds to be synthesized will include both monomeric species                 as well as polymers.  Assessments of the effects of conjugation                 will be made by low-temperature electronic spectroscopy, NMR                    spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and resonance Raman                            spectroscopy.  A number of the compounds will be investigated                   for their nonlinear optical properties.  The research will                      generate an extensive comparison of the effects of conjugation                  in inorganic and their classic organic analogues.                               %%%                                                                             A fundamental concept in organic chemistry is conjugation,                      i.e., the effects of alternating single and multiple bonds.                     Conjugation has major effects on the properties of organic                      molecules.  The present study will determine the degree to                      which this concept can be applied to inorganic chemistry, and                   in particular to compounds where metal atoms are essential                      participants in the conjugation.  Metal atoms have more diverse                 modes of bonding than carbon atoms (including \"delta\" bonding),                 which raises the potential for conjugation in such systems to                   have even more profound effects than are found in organic                       systems.  The present research will entail the synthesis of                     compounds designed to engage in conjugation, the elucidation of                 their structures, and measurements of their physical properties.",
