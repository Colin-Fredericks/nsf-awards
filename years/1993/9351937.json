 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351937  Kerlan  The objectives of this project are to: (1) demonstrate to our  students and colleagues the benefits of collaborative teaching  and learning; (2) promote an appreciation of the multiple and  integrated anatomical and physiological responses involved in  the functioning and survival of the whole organism (3) provide  opportunities for cooperative learning in problem solving  course laboratories and (4) encourage new areas of faculty-  student research. The purchase of Macintosh IIvx personal  computers, NuVista frame grabber and BIOPAC data acquisition  systems, a Cameron Blood Gas Analyzer, Cole-Palmer refrigerated  bath, and Reichert-Jung cryostat will improve and expand  laboratories in three courses and undergraduate research. This  modern easy-to-use and precise equipment will support  anatomical and physiological laboratory experiments at the  cellular, tissue-organ and organismal level. This project is  significant because for the first time at this institution we  propose to bring together students from the Comparative  Vertebrate Anatomy and General Animal Physiology courses to  resolve interdisciplinary-based questions by integrating  concepts from complimentary disciplines. We anticipate that  faculty and student interest generated by our collaborative  teaching will continue as faculty-directed student research.        ***",
