 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                   Dissertation Research program.  It will be a study of work                      attitudes, contrasting male and female workers' group orientation               in Japan and the United States, based on statistical analysis of an             existing dataset of 8,302 survey respondents.  Statistical                      techniques such as regression and path analysis will apply four                 conceptual approaches: culturalist theory, the cultural contingency             model of worker attitudes and behavior, Koike's model of skill                  acquisition, and a conflict model of labor control.                                                                                                                  This research will contribute to the sociology of gender and               work roles, as well as to comparative studies of Japan and the                  United States, potentially contributing to American industrial                  policy.  In addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the              research, this award will materially assist a highly promising                  student in completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it             contributes to future scientific manpower and the thorough training             of the next generation of sociologists.",
