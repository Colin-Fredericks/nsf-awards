 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Nanofabrication Facility (NNF) at Cornell University               is an interdisciplinary center, the primary role of which is to                 provide resources and technical expertise to researchers in                     microstructures science, particularly in the areas of advanced                  lithographies, nanostructure physics, scanning tunneling microscopy             for fabrication and analysis, optoelectronic and electronic                     applications, microfabrication applications to biology, and related             areas.  NNF provides equipment, training, and expertise to leading              edge research in a \"hands-on\" environment where the user is                     responsible for the conduct of that research.  This orientation is              unique.  In keeping with this role, NNF is conducting a Research                Experiences for Undergraduates program over a ten week period.  In              some cases, NNF facilities are used for only a small, but crucial,              part of the fabrication or experimentation.  Most of the projects               would not be possible without NNF resources.  In all cases, the                 attraction of NNF is the quality and open access to central                     advanced laboratory resources, and the ability to accomplish                    complex or unusual microfabrication in a routine way.",
