The focus  of the Laboratory is placed on the practical hands-on  experiments that deal with identifying and resolving problems  associated with network operation and management, performance  and communication protocols, particularly with multimedia  service applications on the state-of-the-art facilities. New  experiments include a series of increasingly complex problems  ranging from monitoring performance of each network component  to designing an application program to multiplex, transmit and  receive multimedia services at different service access points.                                        The Laboratory includes  representative standardized networks and services from LAN and  WAN: Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, X.25, Frame Relay and ATM  (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). Multimedia workstations equipped  with video and voice capabilities and protocol analyzers are  access points to the networks for laboratory students.  Interface, bridge and switching equipment connects the  networks. TCP/IP, OSI protocols and network management  softwares are implemented. The laboratory gives students  practical experiences of the real network environment with  advanced multimedia services. Furthermore, this laboratory  enhances and strengthens the undergraduate communication  network design course, encouraging students to pursue further  research activities.  ***",
