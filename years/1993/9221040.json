 "awd_abstract_narration": "professor Richard Ernst of the University of Utah will conduct                  research on the chemistry of metal-pentadienyl compounds with                   funding from the IBO program of the Chemsitry Division.                         Titanium will be the primary metal center, with other                           early-transition metal centers such as chromium and zirconium                   playing a secondary role.  Coupling reactions of the                            coordinated pentadienyl ligands with unsaturated organic                        molecules can form organic rings, and they will be explored                     extensively by Ernst.  Ligands containing two conjugated                        pentadienyl fragments (open fulvalenes) will also be studied                    for their ability to bind two metal centers;  paramagnetic                      derivatives of such dinuclear compounds will be of interest                     because the conjugation should foster strong communication                      between the two metal centers.                                                  %%%                                                                             Atoms of titanium and other metals will be attached to organic                  molecules containing five-membered carbon chains with two                       double bonds.  By modifying the organic molecules in this way                   they can react with other organic molecules containing one                      double bond to form organic rings.  Such ring-forming reactions                 will be investigated in some detail because of their potential                  as routes to complex organic products.",
