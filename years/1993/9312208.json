Participating in this conference will be three  Moroccan and five Tunisian mathematicians who  have a research interest in this topic; these  individuals will also be participants in a post-  conference workshop organized by Drs. W. Connett  and A. Schwartz of the University of Missouri at  St. Louis.  The purpose of the workshop is to  discuss and develop collaborative research  projects involving the group from North Africa  and their U.S. counterparts.  This cooperative  activity will bring together highly regarded  experts from the U.S., Morocco, and Tunisia  representing a number of universities.  A goal of  this joint meeting is to reinforce and extend an  international network of American and North  African mathematicians that will endure beyond  the conference/workshop.  This activity partially  supports the participation of approximately 12  U.S. and 8 North African scientists.     This conference/workshop in mathematical science  fulfills the program objective of advancing  scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts  in the United States and North Africa to combine  complementary talents and present research  results in areas of strong mutual interest and  competence.  This activity has an educational and  outreach effort that has the potential for  generating new scientific activity and new  international linkages.  ***",
