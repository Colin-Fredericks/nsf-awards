Significant evidence points to a  disproportionate impact of industrial environmental hazards on poor  and minority communities but little is known about the place of  regulatory mandates and administrative enforcement practices in the  creation of such disparities.  This study will consider this  question in the context of agency responses to air pollution odor  nuisance complaints, a regulatory arena subject to common law  reactive structures and a commitment to local norms and  environmental diversity.    Detailed case studies derived from interviews of agency staff and  administrative records will be used in an analysis of the place of  community and complainant identity in the public nuisance  enforcement policies of three air pollution control agencies.   Intra-agency comparison of complaint based enforcement within  demographically distinct communities will be combined with inter-  agency comparison of the handling of such disputes.  The two tiers  of this comparison will allow distinctions to be made between the  contributions to implementation outcomes of, respectively, legal  mandates and administrative choices.  ***",
