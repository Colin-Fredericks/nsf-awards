 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the mechanism by which cellular factors                 initiate DNA replication in yeast.  One of the few cellular factors             known to be required for this process is a multi-subunit protein                complex called Replication Protein A (RPA).  RPA is  conserved                  throughout eukaryotic species, including the yeast S. cerevisiae.               Biochemically, the remaining initiation factors will be isolated                from yeast cells using an \"origin unwinding\" assay that mimics an               early step in the initiation reaction.  This assay is dependent                 upon RPA and a yeast origin of DNA replication but is relatively                simple because it separates  initiation from the elongation phase               of DNA replication.  Protein-affinity chromatography, using RPA as              a specific ligand, will be used to enrich for rare proteins that                interact with RPA at initiation.  These factors will be purified to             homogeneity and used to raise specific antisera.  The purified                  proteins will be characterized to identify DNA-binding and DNA                  helicase activities.  A crucial prediction about these initiation               factors is that their activity will be regulated throughout the                 cell-cycle.  The antisera will be used to study cell-cycle-                     dependent modifications to the protein and changes in their                     activity.  The ultimate goal of this approach is to reconstitute                complete DNA replication in-vitro and study its regulation.                     %%%                                                                             It is known that DNA replication is necessary for a cell to divide,             yet little is known about how the process actually begins.  This                study intends to identify the factors that initiate DNA replication             using the well-characterized and highly conserved yeast system.                 Protein factors that initiate DNA replication will be purified                  using a DNA sequence that initiates replication in yeast.  These                proteins will be studied in order to understand how their activity              is controlled.  Since yeast cells use many of same proteins that                human cells use to replicate their DNA, it is likely that                       understanding this simple model system will shed light on how DNA               replication is controlled in human cells.",
