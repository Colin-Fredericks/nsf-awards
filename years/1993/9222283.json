 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain is especially vulnerable to damage in the neonatal and                early fetal period.  Early brain damage can lead to a bewildering               variety of behavioral problems.  Damage early in development does               not necessarily cause the same effects as damage in adulthood.  Dr.             Berger Sweeney has developed a novel model system for studying the              effects of early brain damage.  She has found that lesions of an                important nucleus in the forebrain the nucleus basalis of Meynert               (nBM) cause unusual cellular formations in the sensori motor cortex             in adulthood and have severe deficits in spatial navigation.  She               hypothesizes that the behavioral and morphological effects are due              to transient depletion of cholinergic afferents to the cortex.  She             will now determine whether the affected behaviors are ones known to             be dependent on cholinergic function or whether the deficits are                due to some more nonspecific effect of the early lesion.  She will              also attempt to reverse the effects of the early lesions by                     augmenting the function of the depleted transmitter.  The results               will greatly strengthen our understanding of the mechanisms by                  which early brain damage affects behavior and may set the stage for             developing effective therapies.***//",
