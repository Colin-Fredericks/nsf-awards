These TP microspheres behave in many ways like true neurons; they display membrane potentials, generate action potential-like electrical discharges in response to light, form junctions, and extend axon-like outgrowths.  Thus, TP microspheres can be c onsidered \"protoneurons:, the scientific study of which may help to elucidate which basic properties of modern day neurons are ingerent to these protocells that assemble in a nonrandom way under conditions believed to have existed on the primitive Earth.  In the proposed research, the chemical, electrical, and possible psychological microspheres will be studied.  The electrophysiological responses to light will be quantified and possible ion channel-like characteristics of their membranes explored.  Finally, whether any relatively permanant change in the behavior of TP microspheres can be induced by experience will be explored.  This will be determined by testing interconnected networks of TP microspheres for basic learning processes known to occur in both vertebrate and invertebrate species, as well as in single-cell eukaryotic organisms.  The basic learning processes to be investigated include habituation, sensitization, and possible associative changes which might occur in TP microspheres electrical response to light, as a result of experience. ***",
