 "awd_abstract_narration": "In phagocytosis, binding of a particle signals a rapid                        recruitment and polymerization of actin that drives pseudopod                   extension.  Although cell-surface receptors for phagocytosis have               been identified in platelet, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear                 leukocytes, the molecular details of how receptors signal the                   dynamic changes in the actin-based cytoskeleton are unclear.  The               long-term goal of this project is to understand how specific                    localized cytoskeletal responses occur in the phagocytic process.               The specific objective of this proposal is to identify cell surface             molecules responsible for the recognition and binding step of                   phagocytosis.  A primarily biochemical approach will be used, with              the expectation that the knowledge gained will guide a molecular                genetic analysis of phagocytosis in Dictyostelium discoideum.                   The purpose of these studies is to generate a based of knowledge                that will support and guide future biochemical and genetic analyses             of the interactions between cell surface molecules and the                      cytoskeleton.                                                                   %%%                                                                             Phagocytosis, or \"cell eating,\" is a process whereby cells bind to              and subsequently internalize particulate materials.  The process is             critical to free-living amoebae, who depend on phagocytosis of food             particles (e.g., bacteria) for their survival.  The process is also             critical to mechanisms of animal defense against microbial                      pathogens, both in invertebrate systems, where phagocytic cells may             be the primary mechanism of immunity against such pathogens, and in             higher animals, including man where phagocytosis serves a far more              complex series of immune functions.  Phagocytic processes are also              involved in a broad variety of non-immune related cellular \"clean-              up\" functions, such as the clearing of smoke particles in the lungs             by macrophages.  This project has the potential to increase our                 understanding of this fundamental life process.",
