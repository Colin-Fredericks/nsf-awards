 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics program presently supports an introductory                          laboratory environment which encourages students to design                      their own experimental approaches to problems and communicate                   those approaches in an informal manner.  Laboratory activities                  are heavily oriented toward exploratory planning activities                     with an emphasis on graphical presentation and analysis of                      data.  The student directed experimental design coupled with                    graphical analysis requires that large amounts of data must be                  rapidly acquired, and analyzed.  To support this need 10                        networked micro-computer based data acquisition and analysis                    systems, together with a variety of sensors, are being                          introduced in the laboratory.  Each micro-computer provides an                  icon oriented interface (Lab-View) consisting of virtual                        instruments and virtual probes that may be schematically linked                 to reflect individual student approaches toward an experimental                 problem.  High level commands allow the students to acquire,                    display, and analyze data ways which they find most meaningful.                 The computing environment is sufficiently powerful to include                   new probes as demand warrants, and thus provides added                          incentive for more advanced students to attempt alternative                     experimental strategies. The flexibility in the icon oriented                   interface also allows the laboratory to gracefully adapt to new                 experiments and to individual learning styles, thereby                          enhancing student development of science skills and concept                     understanding.",
