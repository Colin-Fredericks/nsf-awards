 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are working to improve a lower division general physics                      (electricity and magnetism) laboratory which is taken by about                  260 science and engineering students each semester at San Jose                  State University.  We are developing experiments on magnetism                   by having students measure the magnetic field with Hall probes                  interfaced to a personal computer in a wide range of                            situations, and also observe the motion of charged particles in                 electric and magnetic fields.  We are also improving and                        reorganizing some of our existing experiments on electricity                    and electrical circuits.  The new and improved experiments help                 students develop better understanding for the abstract concepts                 of electric and magnetic fields, reinforce classroom lectures,                  and provide to students hands-on experience in working with                     modern instrumentation.  Funds were obtained for the                            acquisition of 12 transverse and longitudinal Hall probes, 12                   personal computers, and 12 Pasco e/m apparatuses with Helmholtz                 coils and power supplies.",
