 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental and computational methods will be applied to determine             the kinetic acidities of a variety of hydrocarbons. Experimental                methods will include the determination of exchange rates from                   cyclohexylamine-N-t catalyzed by cesium and lithium                             cyclohexylamides by tritium NMR. Some rates will be determined for              deuterium exchange with cyclohexylamine-N-d2 using mass                         spectroscopy and deuterium NMR. Theoretical calculations will be                carried out for proton transfer reaction between various                        hydrocarbons and bases, and compared to experimental results.                   Calculations of ion-pair SN2 displacement reactions will be                     continued. These reactions show unusual highly bent transition                  states and may give relative reactivities different from the                    corresponding ionic reactions.                                                  %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Andrew Streitwieser at the University              of California, Berkeley. The acidity of very weakly acidic                      hydrocarbons will be determined by recently developed sensitive                 techniques. This will extend an important body of knowledge.                    Theoretical calculations will be made that relate to the acidity of             hydrocarbons and the results will be compared to the experimental               findings. This work will provide a fundamental understanding of                 weakly acidic hydrocarbons and the consequences to chemical                     reactivity of the carbon-hydrogen bond in hydrocarbons. Additional              calculations will be carried out on a fundamental displacement                  reaction process in organic chemistry. Preliminary calculations                 have shown an unusual geometry in the course of this reaction and               this work will be continued.",
