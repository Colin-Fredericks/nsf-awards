Clark Larsen  SBR-9305391    It has become a truism that the Spanish Conquistadores had a devastating effect on the health of Native Americans throughout the New World, as documented in various locales by dramatic population declines.  However, the extensive findings to date from Spanish Florida (La Florida) indicate that, although the catastrophic effects of Old World pathogens on native populations were important and very common consequences of contact, these effects should be viewed as a single facet of a complex, multifaceted problem. Equally important for understanding the contact issue are questions relating to how native populations responded and adapted to great social, dietary, and behavioral changes in a number of settings over relatively long periods of time.  Besides the immediate declines in many areas due to epidemics, in many regions, generations of survivors continued to respond to new and novel challenges despite deteriorating circumstances.  It is essential to move away from single cause explanations of population change to reach a broad-based understanding of decline in health, diet, the social fabric of Native American groups after 1492.    This study will undertake detailed and extensive bioarchaeological analyses of remains from a large region of La Florida, and over a long time interval.  In particular, the impact of European arrival and the establishment of missions will be studied, along with how native populations accommodated new demands associated with changes in activity (eg. demands for labor) and died (eg. more reliance on maize as a dietary staple) .  ***  P:\\anthro\\jfried\\9305391.abs                             u    ~               PJPx PJ&JPP.JP(Px ~ x   G          (I 4:V4:V:xP            \u0131  \u0131 \u0131   p$  pp%$        $@      M G         kNH    G   pkG      $ $   @$    $@       i  \u0131\u0131    \u0131\u0131 v  \u0131          \u0131    \u0131  rFTV V 4V  \\:  4V VV%$  $  % $          $    %  U V$  $  $            $  $  Gr(rPPIPPP(PIP(PPx ~VUx xN       k  (r VV~ V:V M  \u0131    k i        \u0131       G        $   GGGGG     G          HqN G  HG     j  @   $        $@$      G    \u0131   \u0131    q i \u0131   \u0131 \u0131 \u0131\u0131\u0131      MVV:\\ \\    .   <                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   A   C                                       \"   $   &   (   *   ,   .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      $           $           $           $              F                                   .                                       <         .     :  1 Courier    Symbol  & Arial  1 Courier  1 MS LineDraw                             v                 h     Q  %   e   e                    =        Jonathan Friedlaender Jonathan Friedlaender",
