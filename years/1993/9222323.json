 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Nowak's research is aimed at obtaining additional knowledge of              the mechanisms underlying N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)                           receptor-channel function in mammalian brain neurons.  The NMDA                 subclass of glutamate receptors are coupled to nonselective cation              channels permeable to Ca2+ and blocked by Mg2+ in a voltage-dependent           way.  It is Ca2+ entry through NMDA channels which is thought to                serve as a trigger for some of the plastic changes observed during              nervous system development and in learning.  Thus, the overall goal             of the research is to address the question, \"how can the apparently             high influx of Ca2+ through NMDA channels as demonstrated by dye                measurements be reconciled with all of the factors which would tend             to limit Ca2+ entry\"?  One possible explanation is that there is                more diversity among NMDA receptor-channels than previously                     recognized with some putative forms of the channels being                       relatively insensitive to blockage by Mg2+.  Dr. Nowak's first                  series of experiments will involve an examination of the                        similarities and differences in biophysical parameters between NMDA             channels in cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons where                 different forms of the channels are predicted to occur.  She will               then perform additional experiments designed to examine the                     potential sites of Ca2+ interaction with NMDA channels.  All of the             proposed experiments are designed to explore the fundamental                    role(s) played by two divalent cations found in physiological                   fluids, namely Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions, in regulating the functioning of             a major class of neurotransmitter-activated receptor-channels in                brain neurons.",
