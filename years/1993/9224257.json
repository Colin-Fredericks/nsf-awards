 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigation involves surveys on political culture               and political participation in mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong                 Kong during the winter of 1993-1994.  The research provides the                 first empirical data on behavior and culture under these three                  regimes collected under a common analytic program.                                                                                                              The project is designed around two core analytical issues.  First,              in these three political systems rapid changes are occurring in                 both political institutions and political culture (values and                   beliefs).  The political behavior of citizens (voting, contacting               government officials for favors, etc.) is also changing.  By                    studying members of a single historical culture who are living in               settings that have different developmental levels, institutional                systems, and political sub-cultures, the project is able to                     determine whether cultural changes or insitutional changes have                 stronger effects on changes in individual citizens' political                   behavior.                                                                                                                                                       Second, the project analyzes the cultural dimension of regime.                  change.  The investigation looks at citizens' attitudes in each                 political system toward the political authorities, the regime, and              the nation, especially attitudes concerning regime legitimacy and               citizen's political identifications.  The researchers explore                   whether each political system has internal consensus or                         disagreement over major values; what the major issues of political              value cleavage are; and, whether disagreements fall along elite-                mass lines or are located among sectors of the mass population.                                                                                                 Many of the data are designed to permit comparison with data                    collected in the United States, Western Europe, Russia, Japan, and              elsewhere.  The project provides a baseline for future studies of               change in the three Chinese political systems.",
