The production rates of various types of glueballs at high momentum transfer will be calculated.  Another QCD prediction concerns the decays of heavy quark-light quark bound states; all potentially observable two body decays of such systems will be investigated.  It has been known for some time that quarks and leptons come in families, and it is known that there are only three light neutrino's; thus the neutrino of a fourth family must be very heavy.  As a result, the charged lepton of the fourth family might be very long-lived, with lifetimes ranging from nanoseconds to years.  The phenomenological implications of such long-lived leptons will be studied in detail, and the other implications of models which contain such leptons will be studied.  Finally, high precision electroweak  studies require better knowledge of the cross-section for electron-positron scattering in the 1-9 GeV energy range,  and the possibilities of CEBAF making such a measurement in the future will be investigated.    e proven leadership than Harris in terms of representing LBL.  If RHIC representation is most important, followed by institutional representation, Nagamiya would be a stronger choice than Harris.           Moniz would much prefer a smaller and wiser committee than is presently constituted.  He felt that many of the recent committee did not perform to the level that one should expect of NSAC.         r;   7 r4 F(} ~  t  F     M    F   F&   F  t  i M      M  F   SQRV   f   N;   F   u|< t  ^{  t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 !         !
