 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355491  Bowen    Oklahoma State University, in collaboration with seven two-year,  Native-American-serving colleges, Connors State College,  Northeastern Oklahoma City, Oklahoma State University-Okmulgee,  Rogers State College and Tulsa Junior College, requests support to  plan for the establishment of a center of excellence to increase  the recruitment, advancement, and graduation of Native American  students in baccalaureate science, engineering and mathematics  (SEM) degree programs.  These eight institutions of higher  education are already major contributors to the SEM \"pipeline\" for  these students and provide SEM education to the thirty-eight  federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma.  Each of these  institutions has well established relationships with tribal  governments in Oklahoma.  They operate many human-resource-  development projects focused on the 252,420 Native Americans living  in Oklahoma.  We propose to plan for this new center by an  exploration process with the Native American communities of  Oklahoma and elsewhere in the nation to identify those activities  that will be most effective in serving the needs of Native  Americans, establish governance for the center to include tribal  and community representation along with industry and higher  education, and form an external advisory committee of Native  American SEM professionals.  Central to this exploration process  will be a planning conference to be attended and led by Native  American SEM professionals, faculty and administrators, students  and parents, tribal officials and other community leaders with  representative from business, industry and government.  The outcome  of this conference will be a plan for the center designed by and  for Native Americans.  The outcome of this conference will be a  plan for the center designed by and for Native Americans.  The  center will be executed by the proposing institutions of higher  education, but will be governed, operated and evaluated by Native  Americans with shared respons ibility for quality control.",
