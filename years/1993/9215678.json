 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support the participation of twelve                   U.S. scientists to participate in a seminar/workshop on plant                   biotechnology and the engineering of plants for the future to be                held at Cairns, Australia in September 1993.  The American                      coordinators are Dr. Sheila McCormick from the University of                    California Plant Gene Expression Center at Berkeley and Dr. Niels               Nielson from the Department of Agronomy at Purdue University.                   The Australian coordinators are Dr. T. J. Higgins and Dr.                       Elizabeth Dennis from the Institute for Plant Production and                    Processing of the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry in Canberra,                 and Dr. Adrienne Clarke from the School of Botany at the                        University of Melbourne.  This project is being conducted under                 the U.S.-Australia Cooperative Science Program and support in                   Australia is provided through the Department of Industry,                       Technology and Commerce (DITAC).                                                                                                                                Emphasis in the program will be given to four areas that are                    considered likely to generate significant advances in plant work.               These areas include new strategies for pest and disease                         resistance, manipulation of reproductive biology, novel genes for               agriculture and plant genome structure.  The seminar will provide               a forum in which the strong and weak points of the current                      research can be examined and new research directions and                        approaches will be considered.  By bringing together leaders in                 each of the four areas mentioned, it is anticipated that there                  will be an exchange of ideas and techniques that can be used in                 engineering plants for the future.  This program should also                    facilitate the establishment of new cooperative research efforts                among the participants.",
