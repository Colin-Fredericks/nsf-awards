Feeding  adaptations and behavior are fundamental aspects of mammalian  evolution and ecology and have been well studied in both primates  and herbivorous hoofed mammals. In contrast, Faunivorous mammals  (species that consume vertebrate and invertebrate prey) have  received comparatively little attention. Yet, faunivores include  a wide range of mammals, such as insectivores (e.g. shrews),  carnivores (e.g., cats),  piscivores (e.g., fish-eating bats),  and omnivores (e.g., pigs). They range in size and shape from  shrew with a mass of less than two grams, to polar bears, which  exceed 500 kilograms. In spite of this diversity, faunivorous  mammals are united by the necessities of capturing, killing, and  consuming prey. Anatomical specializations of the skull and teeth  for these activities are apparent at both macroscopic and  microscopic levels and include increased skeletal and dental  strength, accentuated cutting blades on the teeth, and load-  bearing modifications of skull architecture. Over the past ten  years, research in cranial and dental structure has accelerated  and diversified, benefiting from the application of several new  technologies such as scanning electron microscopy and computed  topography. It is now time to bring together previously  independent researchers for not the synthesis of work-to-date and  an appraisal of current and future research directions.  ***",
