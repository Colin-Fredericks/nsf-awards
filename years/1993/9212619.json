 "awd_abstract_narration": "9212619  Baldridge    This is a Research Opportunities for Women (ROW) award to Dr. Kim  Baldridge at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC).   Computational chemistry is an area constantly in demand of  faster, more efficient tools to model chemical reactions.  This  is of growing importance as more and more researchers meld  experiment with theory in order to elucidate more fully  information concerning complex reactions.  The study of reaction  mechanisms and the prediction of rate constants by semi-empirical  and ab initio methods is limited by the computational effort  needed to calculate reactive potential energy surfaces(PESs).   The advances made in the calculation of energy gradients and  higher order derivatives of potential surfaces however, have been  an important factor in reducing this effort, in particular by  allowing efficient calculation of the potential along a minimum  energy reaction path(MEP).  This raises the question of the  accuracy with which the MEP for a reaction must be calculated in  order to obtain a reaction path representation well enough  converged to calculate accurate thermal rate constants.  The  answer highly depends on the size of the molecular system and the  complexity of the chemical reaction.  Dr. Baldridge's proposal  addresses these problems at the algorithmic level and, via  parallelization, at the hardware level.  She proposes to build on  work already undertaken in order to complete the redevelopment of  a much needed computational chemistry package (MOPAC) for the  parallel computing environment.  MOPAC is a widely used semi-  empirical quantum chemistry code for the study of chemical  reactions.",
