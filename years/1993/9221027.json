 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms live in environments that vary in complex ways in                space and time.  Although this statement is obvious, our                        understanding of how complex environments affect evolutionary                   processes is still rudimentary.  This study will be one of the                  first to investigate the evolutionary response to environmental                 changes over time.  The experimental organism is a small pond                   dwelling crustacean, the water flea Daphnia pulex..  The                        experiment will contrast evolutionary responses to three types of               temporal variability:  constant, variable and predictable,                      variable and unpredictable.                                                          The benefits of this study are two-fold.  First, this study                will greatly extend our fundamental understanding of the                        evolutionary processes.  It will be one of the first forays into                an area of evolution that has been long recognized as important,                but until now has not been studied.  The results have the                       potential for being a significant next step in the merging of the               fields of evolutionary biology and developmental biology.                       Second, the results of this study will be useful in the                         development of crop strains.  A crucial goal in agricultural                    genetics is the breeding of strains that will do well over a wide               range of growing conditions.  This goal is especially critical                  for farmers in underdeveloped or developing nations where control               of growing conditions is poor.  By understanding the constraints                on how organisms can adapt to variable environments, we can                     better meet this goal.",
