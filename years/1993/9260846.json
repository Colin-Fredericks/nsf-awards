Biodegradable                                                   microparticles are being studied                                                extensively as a means to deliver a                                             wide variety of drugs in a                                                      controlled manner.  Technology now                                              allow desired release profiles to                                               be achieved by judicious choice of                                              biodegradable polymers, particle                                                size, and drug loading.  The                                                    release profiles may last from                                                  weeks to years, depending upon the                                              materials and parameters used.                                                                                                                                  One significant obstacle to                                                     controlled drug delivery systems is                                             the difficulty encountered in                                                   administering these microparticles                                              by injection.  The particles have a                                             tendency to settle quickly in                                                   saline.    This makes it difficult                                              to administer the entire injection                                              volume and also causes the                                                      microparticles to clump in the                                                  needle of the syringe, making an                                                injection impossible.  Using                                                    viscous injection media is                                                      currently the procedure used to                                                 attempt to inject biodegradable                                                 microparticles.  This research                                                  involves a novel, proprietary                                                   method with which biodegradable                                                 microparticles containing drugs can                                             be surface treated so that they can                                             be suspended in aqueous media for                                               long periods of time.  The novel                                                technique is based on a proprietary                                             processes of the star-burst type.",
