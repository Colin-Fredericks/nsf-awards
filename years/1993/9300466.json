 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Northeast Missouri State                       University (NMSU) Science Division to continue a successful                     NSF-REU program .  During the summers of 1993 and 1994 seven                    undergraduate students will be given  financial support to                      allow them to participate in and  intensive, full-time                          research experience.  As demonstration of its strong                            commitment to undergraduate research, NMSU will make several                    contributions, including: clerical support, free on-campus                      room and board and a waiver of tuition and fees for 3                           college credits to student participants.                                                                                                                        Students, 3 from NMSU and 4 from off-campus, and 7 faculty                      mentors will form a research team, focusing on the study of                     a single system: grass/fungi endosymbioses. Students will be                    selected based on their independence and motivation,                            research potential, and professional goals. Discussions                         between student and mentor will form the basis for  matching                    students to specific research areas. Students will work in                      research areas that range widely from chemical analysis of                      fungal alkaloids, to ecological and physiological                               implications for grasses of harboring a fungus, to effects                      of fungal alkaloids on insect and mammalian consumers of the                    fungus. The central focus will integrate study at different                     levels of biological organization and will help foster unity                    and community among group members. The program includes                         several opportunities for students to communicate their work                    to others, including a required oral presentation of their                      findings, and is aimed to develop project ownership by the                      student.",
