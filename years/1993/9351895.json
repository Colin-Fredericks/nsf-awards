Polarized light microscopes  are being used in the early part of the undergraduate  curriculum, while existing departmental equipment is being used  in upper division work.  The entire curriculum consists of  several experiments with optical chemical microscopy, followed  by infrared microspectro-scopy, fluorescence microscopy, and  scanning tunneling microscopy.  The experiments are carried out  in general chemistry (both \"majors\" and \"non-majors\"), organic  chemistry, physical chemistry, and instrumental analysis.  Additional use of the polarized light microscopes is being made  in student research, by geology students, and in a chemistry  high school outreach program.  The program in chemical  microscopy is  providing students with the opportunity to  visualize matter and reactions in unique ways, while exposing  them to a wide variety of problems and materials relevant to  the marketplace.  ***",
