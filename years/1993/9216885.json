 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposes to investigate the behavior of marine clays               under large strains with wave and tsunami loadings.  The wave                   induced forces have been continuously transporting soft sediments               from shallow water depths to deeper part of the ocean.  It is                   proposed to examine the stability of the marine clays by                        subjecting them to similar stress paths and damage caused by the                waves.  A special testing device will be used to subject the                    clays to circular stress paths which can not be applied in                      conventional available apparatuses.  Additional tests are                       proposed to relate Plasticity index, overconsolidation ratio and                anisotropy of clay to coefficient of permeability.  Finally an                  effort will be made to develop or modify and incremental                        constitutive model which can simulate the effect of rotation of                 principal stress direction.  The International Workshop held at                 Case Western University on July 22-24, 1987 clearly indicated                   that none of the existing constitutive laws can predict that                    behavior under such a stress path.",
