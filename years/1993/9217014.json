 "awd_abstract_narration": "The literature on marine benthic ecology and evolution  has               generally  ignored fertilization rates as an important factor  in               the  life  histories of benthic species, many which are important               resource species.  These rates have implicitly been assumed to be               uniformly high and thus not a terribly significant factor in  the               establishment of the adult populations.  There are now  a  number               of  data  sets  which  raise doubts about the  validity  of  that               assumption.  The  research will determine rates of  fertilization               among  natural populations and will explore some of  the  factors               controlling these rates in reef communities.                                         Using the Caribbean gorgonian, Plexaura A, as a model system               Drs. Lasker and Coffroth will determine rates of fertilization of               eggs  released  in synchronous spawning events.   Plexaura  A  is               clonal and often has skewed ratios of male and female colonies on               different reefs.  This will enable comparison of rates from reefs               which  differ  in  current regime and  in  the  density  of  male               colonies.  Using  random amplified polymorphic  DNA  (RAPD)  from               individual planulae larvae, they will conduct paternity analyses,               determine  the  proportion  of  fertilizations  attributable   to               specific male clones, and determine the effects of clone size and               distribution on fertilization.  If rates are low and are affected               by  factors such as population density, then it will be necessary               to   incorporate  fertilization  rates  in  analyses  of  benthic               population animal dynamics and evolution.",
