 "awd_abstract_narration": "The newly constructed Sevilleta Field Station serves a large                    number of scientists who study the extensive and                                ecologically diverse region of central New Mexico.  The                         region  incorporates transition zones among numerous biomes,                    including Great Plains Grassland, Chihuahuan Desert, Great                      Basin Shrub-Steppe, Interior Chaparral, Mogollon (Pinon-                        Juniper) Woodland, and Montane Forests.  Additional biotic                      assemblages within these biomes include Rio Grande \"Bosque\"                     (Riparian  Cottonwood  Forest ) and Wetlands, Subalpine                         Forests, and Subalpine Grasslands.  Much of the current                         scientific  research in the region focuses on biotic                            responses to climate change at various spatial and  temporal                    time scales (seasonal , annual, and long-term), biodiversity                    issues, and ecosystem restoration  following natural and                        anthropogenic disturbance.                                                                                                                                      Funding levels for the current year's research activities                       exceeds $7.25 million, and continues to increase.  At                           present, there are 70 scientists and graduate students                          working on 49 active research projects in the Sevilleta                         region.  The Sevilleta Field Research Station provides                          logistical support to a large proportion of these projects.                     The Sevilleta Field Research Station has expanded with the                      construction of new residences and laboratory facilities to                     meet the growing demand for field logistical support.                                                                                                           This project will increase the research support capability                      of the Sevilletta Field Research Station.  The construction                     of a lath house and experimental garden, that will be used                      in germinating and establishing native plants for a variety                     of research and educational projects will add significantly                     to station research capability.  In addition, the station                       will provide an indoor storage facility for field equipment,                    and a workshop area for equipment construction and                              maintenance.   This addition to the station will                                significantly expand the botanical and genetics research                        opportunities on the Sevillets, and provide greater                             logistical support for virtually all ongoing ecological                         field research activities in central New Mexico.",
