 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Chemistry program supports research on catalysts for silicon                    polymerization to be carried out by Dr. Joyce Y. Corey of the                   Department of Chemistry, University of Missouri-Saint Louis.                    She will develop improved organometallic compounds to promote                   coupling of hydrosilanes to form silicon-functional chains,                     rings, and polymers.  Combination catalysts of                                  dichlorobis(cyclopentadienyl)metal compounds, where the metal                   is Zr, Ti, or Hf, with butyl lithium have been used for this                    purpose, but control of chain length and structure have not                     been achieved.  Corey will vary the structure of the catalyst                   as well as the metal used in order to target the synthesis of                   specific catenated compounds and, in the process, improve                       understanding of the catalytic requirements for                                 dehydrocoupling.  New types of monomers will also be used in                    the dehydrocoupling reactions to form novel oligomers and                       polymers.                                                                       %%%                                                                             Polymers formed from chains of silicon form a variety of                        materials which have potentially useful electronic properties.                  Some applications in photoconduction, microlithography, and                     photoinitiated polymerization of vinyl monomers have been                       reported.  Manipulation of the properties of these materials                    will require synthetic methods which can control the length of                  the polymer chain, its shape, and the attachment of functional                  groups.  Dr. Joyce Y. Corey will explore additional synthetic                   methods which control some of these factors in the formation of                 silicon polymers.",
