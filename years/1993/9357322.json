 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357322  Baker  The bacterial virus Mu i a member of a diverse group of genetic  elements that promote insertion of their own DNA into the genome of  a host cell by a specialized type of genetic recombination known as  DNA transposition.  Many elements, including retroviruses, utilize  this mechanism of integration, allowing them to insert at nearly  random sites in the host DNA.  The long term goal of this project  is to understand the molecular mechanism of transposition.  The  extraordinary efficiency of Mu transposition, and the nonpathogenic  nature of the virus, make Mu an ideal system for mechanistic  studies.  Recently, it has become clear that the active form of the  Mu transposase is a tetramer of the protein bound to the paired  ends of the element DNA.  Current knowledge of the chemical  mechanism of transposition based on work principally from the Mu  and HIV systems make it very attractive to consider that the  protein is activated by tetramer assembly and that the active  center of the protein may lie at constructed tetramer interface.   The experiments proposed here will locate and dissect the regions  of the transposase involved in catalysis and in tetramer contacts.   The roles of individual monomers within the active tetramer will  also be investigated.  %%%  Transposition is the recombination reaction by which a genetic  element is moved from one DNA to another.  Studying this important  process will lead to better understanding of HIV DNA integration,  as well as other complex DNA-protein interactions such as  replication, transcription and RNA processing.  ***",
