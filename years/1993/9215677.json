The activity                                   allows the two teams to join forces in working                                  on complementary projects involving information                                 processing tasks and draws upon a study                                         of children's use of hypertext retrieval                                        systems at UCLA and studies of engineers' use                                   of computer aided design systems (CAD)                                          in Australia.                                                                                                                                                   The UCLA team will contribute the information                                   retrieval expertise and a large body of data                                    already available for analysis. The                                             Australian team will contribute the computer-                                   modeling expertise. Plans are for the                                           Australians to visit UCLA in the first half of                                  1993 to assist in the design of the Science                                     Library Catalog monitoring analysis algorithms                                  under the counterpart Australian grant. It is                                   expected that the UCLA team will go to                                          Australia in August 1993 to further the data                                    modeling and conduct a comparative analysis                                     thus using the complementary expertise in                                       online monitoring of the two teams. Dr Hiller's                                 work deals with a number of methodological                                      issues relevant to studying human-computer                                      interaction in general and information in                                       particular, including graphical data display                                    and expert vs. novice user comparisons.                                         Dr. Borgman's expertise is in the analysis of                                   transaction logs of information retrieval                                       systems and user behavior. Ms. Goldstein's                                      work will be incorporated in her dissertation.",
