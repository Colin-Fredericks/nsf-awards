 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a one year funding participation in a joint project of the              Committee on Human Factors of the National Academy of Sciences and              the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board.  The national                agenda helps to define and shape the field by describing the                    current state of the technology and its potential, and to suggest               a rationale and priorities for the near-and long-term allocation of             R & D resources to further technology development and                           commercialization.  The agenda, based on a comprehensive review of              software, hardware, human-computer interfaces, and generic research             issues that cut across many application domains associated with                 this technology, is prepared by a multidisciplinary committee of                researchers and developers in the public and private sectors.                   Several federal agencies are currently considering or already have              research and development programs involving one or more aspects of              applications of virtual reality research and development including              equipment design, scientific visualization, the management of large             multifaceted databases, and applications for training and the                   performance of tasks in remote environments.  Also, there are                   groups doing industrial and academic research in this area.  The                study increases the shared understanding of the state of the art,               of the full range of potential applications, and of the most                    critical and promising directions for future research.  The study               takes a broad view of the themes and principles across applications             such as examining the issue of how much reality is appropriate to               provide maximum benefit.  The study committee, as other National                Research Council study committees, provides a forum for experts                 with different perspectives to examine all sides of an issue and                present an integrated, balanced and objective view.  They bring                 together sponsor liaisons to share ideas and concerns with                      committee members and one another.  This project, with NSF's                    participatory funding, produces an NRC report addressing research               and development opportunities in the field of virtual reality.  The             estimated total cost for the committee operation is $468,900 over               an 18-month period.",
