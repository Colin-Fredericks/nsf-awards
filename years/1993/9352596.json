 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is the result of two years of planning to                         integrate a hardware concepts experience within the software                    oriented coursework in computer science. Too often students are                 given the impression that software development is associated                    with data handling that leads only to calculations, reports,                    and printouts or visual displays of one form or another, with                   little or no appreciation for the fact that computers must                      often monitor and control physical processes as well. We are                    therefore proposing an integration of external devices and                      embedded software into instruction in a range of courses rather                 than just those that would normally include this. The general                   theme is to create multiple experiences with the integration of                 hardware and software concepts throughout a number of the                       courses in the undergraduate curriculum (all of which are                       either required or advanced technical electives in the major).                  The plan is to acquire the hardware for this project, set it up                 and test it with respect to inclusion in our target classes,                    then implement and refine this infusion of conceptual/practical                 material into our classes with significant gains in depth and                   understanding as the thread is followed through the classes                     from one level to the next. Each of the investigators has                       special contributions to make to the overall project, including                 an enormous amount of quality instructional experience. They                    form an effective support component to ensure that the range of                 activities planned are completed. The team is compatible,                       enthusiastic, and motivated. The hardware systems for the                       project have been carefully selected for potential use in the                   broadest range of classes from beginning programming principles                 to advanced system software and real-time systems.",
