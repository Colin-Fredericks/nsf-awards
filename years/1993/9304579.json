 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of tradeoff between current and future reproduction                 (\"cost of reproduction\") is central to life history theory, and so              to our understanding of the evolution of reproductive                           characteristics.  For birds, existing empirical demonstrations of               this tradeoff are all flawed by poor choice of experimental                     species, short-term experiments, and drastic manipulations.  Hence              a fundamental tenet of evolutionary theory remains to be tested                 rigorously in this group.  This proposal describes an experimental              test of the hypothesis that the cost of reproduction is a                       significant selective agent in the evolution of reproductive rate.              Specifically, the study can test the hypothesis that adding only                one additional offspring to a brood imposes a cost of reproduction              large enough to impose natural selection against that experimental              brood size.  By using an appropriate study species yielding large               samples and adopting a long-term perspective this study avoids the              flaws of previous work in this area.  This study builds on 10                   years of field work by the principal investigator with the study                species on related problems.                                                    %%%                                                                             Research of this type, in addition to being of fundamental                      importance to theoretical and empirical population biology, should              have positive bearing upon such emergent modern themes as species               conservation and biological diversity.  As well it may yield                    information useful in the commercial breeding of fowl for food.",
