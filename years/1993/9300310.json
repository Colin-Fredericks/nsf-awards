Research will take place primarily on the Navajo Indian Reservation, with multiple levels of analysis being pursued.  These levels include: 1) identification of the uses to which computers and related artifacts are applied; 2) microanalysis of instances of computer use, focusing on the relationship between Navajo conversational patterns and the interactive demands imposed by computer software; and 3) attention to the economic and political environments into which technology is introduced.  Methods will include ethnographic observation and interview techniques, as well as the use of video and audio recordings (and transcription) to capture and identify patterns of behavior and problems of interaction at the micro analytic level.  Results will be of interest to studies of Native American relations with the dominant culture; culture, science and technology programs; discourse centered approaches to culture change; and studies in human-computer interaction and inter ethnic communication.  ***     v     & < t 2       T        & |               PR&+D & T   y               ZX&+E & U   y           : r w ; v   V   N c < u & D & D   & D           !     ^& D & T 2 +   & \\     6  8 N       < u  P      ; w   4  4       N   v     & 2       T    >   t     >   tJ           &     4  p                  v        a     t   4  r     \u0131 &     >   ti           &                 4     t        k               v              t   4     B         8    &     E     s       F      _^ZY X  SQW& = u         &                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 !         !
