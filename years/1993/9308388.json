 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Walz  Abstract    The traditional methods for studying deposition of colloidal  particles onto solid surfaces are the rotating disc and packed bed  experiments.  When the results of such experiments are compared  with current theoretical models, substantial discrepancy is  frequently observed.  Possible reasons for this disagreement  include the large number of factors affecting the deposition rate  and the fact that the measured rate in these experiments represents  an average over many particles and capture sites.  This research  proposes a new approach to studying particle capture through the  use of two novel optical techniques:  total internal reflection  microscopy (TIRM) and radiation pressure (or \"optical tweezers\").   These  techniques will allow measurement of the deposition rate of  a single particle at a fixed position on a solid surface to be  taken under carefully controlled conditions.  The objective will be  to measure the effect of specific factors on the rate of particle  capture.  The experimental apparatus will be designed such that  ionic strength, viscosity, fluid velocity, particle size, and net  particle weight can be adjusted.    The results of these measurements will provide new insight into  deposition mechanisms applied in a large variety of industrial  processes.",
