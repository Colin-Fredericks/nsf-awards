 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last two decades will be noted in history as a period in which              many nations have abandoned authoritarian institutions and command              economies, replacing them with fledgling liberal democracies and                market institutions.  As has been evident, the transition to free               market economies can put a significant burden on citizens.  Many                scholars have argued that the economic chaos that accompanies these             changes seriously undermines the successful transition to democracy             and free markets.  This investigation explores whether in fact                  there is a linkage between economic performance and support for                 these fledgling democratic and capitalist institutions.                         The challenge of transition to democracy and free markets is one                faced by many nations in the last couple of decades.  The Latin                 American countries have been confronted with the dilemma of                     institutionalizing democratic reforms while simultaneously                      confronting the serious problems associated with reform of their                economic sectors.  Additionally, the former Communist regimes of                the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Eastern and                    Central Europe have faced the simultaneous challenges of economic               chaos, market reform and democratization.  Hence, many scholars                 have argued that nascent democratic regimes falter when the mass                public is burdened with a deteriorating economic situation.                     The major impetus for the proposed investigation is the fact that               this broadly held presumption does not fit with the limited                     empirical evidence that we have at the individual level.  Recent                exploration of the link between economic deterioration and support              for democratic and free market institutions suggests no consistent              relationship.  Individuals in the European portion of the former                Soviet Union do not seem to ground their support for democratic                 institutions on the assessments of the government's economic                    performance and the economy seems to be only weakly related to                  support for free market institutions.                                           The purpose of this project is to expand the analysis beyond this               specific context in order to determine how general the Soviet                   findings actually are.  The goal is to test these propositions in               a number of different national contexts where the society is                    confronted with the simultaneous challenges of implementing radical             economic plans that threaten the well-being of the average citizen              and also of building democratic institutions.                                   The project will be composed of the following four components:  a)              to assemble recent public opinion survey data from Eastern and                  Central Europe and from Latin America that include questions on                 support for the free market and for democratic institutions; b)                 within each nation to explore the link between individual                       assessments of economic performance and support for democratic                  institutions; c) to investigate whether these relationships vary in             any systematic way from one nation to another; and, d) to promote               closer cooperation among the world academic communities interested              in these issues.",
