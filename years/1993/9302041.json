 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The              research addresses recovering the 3D shape of an object from its 2D             image contour.  Existing 3D shape recovery algorithms tend to rely              on parametric models to uniquely constrain the underlying 3D                    surface.   Often, real-world scenes are too general to describe                 using parametric models.  This researcher has discovered that                   certain non-parametric shape models allow a much greater flexibilty             while at the same time providing constraints that can be used in                the shape recovery process. Using planar symmetry as a model, the               PI has constructed a symmetry analyzer, SYMAN, that finds axes of               symmetry from contour. In addition, he has developed algorithms                 that use symmetry and orthogonality as object-based heuristics to               constrain or recover 3D shape from image contour.  With this award,             the research is extended to mathematical study of the surface and               projective properties of curved symmetric surfaces as well as their             application to the shape recovery problem, and use of                           \"crystallographic\" methods to describe and recover shape by viewing             classes of shapes with similar structure as being equivalent, so                that all \"octally symmetric\" objects (e.g., spheres, cubes,                     superquadrics) might be considered equivalent.",
