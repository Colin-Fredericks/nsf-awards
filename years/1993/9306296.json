 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will consider one of the ultimate issues of                       biodiversity research: is an all-taxa biotic inventory at a single              site feasible? If so, what are the, strategies, protocols,                      resources and time required to carry it off?  The 3-day workshop at             the Univ. of Pennsylvania will involve 42 scientists whose                      expertise will encompass biotic sampling, survey and inventory,                 ecology, systematic studies, curatorial matters and                             computerization/networking of the data for most terrestrial                     organisms.  The PI, a leader in biodiversity research and                       conservation, followed up on a recent international biodiversity                conference by developing this workshop and attracting its                       participants. He will produce a workshop document which could be                the initial blueprint for planning such an all-taxa survey.                     %%%                                                                             This workshop is a first bold step toward tackling one of the great             issues in biodiversity research, management and conservation: is an             inventory of all species of organisms at one geographic site                    feasible?  If so, how can it be accomplished and what are the                   necessary resources?  If successful, the long-term effect of the                workshop on the infrastructure of science will be substantial and               broad.  Three immediate major benefits of the workshop will be:                 bringing together of multidisciplinary workers; development of data             management techniques for taxonomic and ecological information;                 answers to principle scientific questions concerning biodiversity.              The potential benefits of an all-species inventory would  initially             be to society in demonstrating that sustainable use of biodiversity             through discovery and use of genetic and other resources is                     economically worthwhile.",
