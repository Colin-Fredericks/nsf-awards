 "awd_abstract_narration": "Econometricians have long found it useful to separate inferential               problems into statistical and identification components.  Studies               of identification seek to characterize the conclusions that could               be drawn if the researcher had available a sample of unlimited                  size.  Studies of statistical inference seek to characterize the                generally weaker conclusions that can be drawn given a sample of                positive but finite size.  Statistical and identification                       problems limit in distinct ways the conclusions that may be drawn               in empirical research.  Statistical problems are most severe when               the available sample is small.  Identification problems are most                severe when the researcher knows little about the population                    under study and the sampling process yields only weak data on the               population.  The proposed research continues the investigator's                 program of work on identification problems in the social                        sciences.  Four projects are planned: (1) continued research on                 the selection problem; (2) analysis of identification in the                    presence of errors in data; (3) study of identification of                      endogenous social effects; and (4) investigation of the use of                  subjective data to identify personal expectations.                                                                                                              One of the most exciting and novel parts of the project involves                the use of subjective data to identify personal expectations.                   Distinguishing the objective and subjective determinants of                     behavior may be the most challenging identification problem                     facing social scientists.  It is certainly the problem that most                clearly separates the social from the natural sciences, where the               units of analysis are not thought of as possessing free will.                   For many years, economists have exercised a self-imposed                        prohibition on the use of subjective data in empirical analysis.                Economists have sought to infer the subjective constructs of                    economic theory, namely preferences and expectations, almost                    entirely from data on actual choices.  But, economists do not                   know whether they are making valid inferences on preferences or                 wrong inferences based on incorrect expectations assumptions.                   This project develops methods that will permit economists to                    rethink their research conventions and entertain seriously the                  collection and analysis of subjective data on expectations and                  preferences.",
