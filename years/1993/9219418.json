 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structural and functional properties of cytochrome P450                     proteins and their regulation will be examined for a number of                  Antarctic fish species. These proteins are critical in the                      metabolism and biological action of many hormones, as well as                   pollutants and carcinogens. Some of these proteins are induced by               pollutant chemicals and are ideal markers for exposure. The genes               for several P450 proteins, and the gene products will be studied.               The P450 that is induced by hydrocarbons or polychlorinated                     biphenyls and the receptors involved in the regulation of the gene              will be characterized. The objectives are to identify structural                and functional adaptions of membrane bound enzymes, their gene                  regulation and receptor mechanisms in stenothermal cold-adapted                 animals. Additional objectives are to provide a molecular and                   mechanistic basis for evaluating the degree to which foreign                    chemicals may be acting in Antarctic fish. These studies should                 provide a definitive baseline and archival samples of numerous                  species, against which results of future samples and analyses can               be compared. The results will have implications for detecting and               following the present and future effects of chemicals in the                    Southern Ocean and may distinguish between chemicals with global                and/or local Antarctic sources.",
