The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a four-month                                            postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Carter D.                                    Hull of Florida State University to work with                                   Dr. Gudmundur Palmason at Orkustofnun                                           (Icelandic National Energy Authority) in                                        Iceland.                                                                                                                                                        This research project takes an integrated                                       approach for producing detailed thermal and                                     fluid histories of hydrothermal systems.                                        Fluid, vein mineralization, and reservoir rock                                  samples from geothermal systems will be                                         collected, identified, and analyzed during the                                  four month period.  Chemical geothermometers                                    will be applied and multicomponent chemical                                     equilibrium models developed with the fluid                                     analyses.  Light-stable isotopic ratios and the                                 activities of radionuclides in the 238U and                                     232Th decay series will be measured for                                         selected fluids and minerals.  Light-stable                                     isotopic data can be used to characterize                                       fluids and applied in studies of water-rock                                     interaction.  The ages of hydrothermal                                          minerals, redistributions of radioisotopes, and                                 residence times of fluids in the reservoir can                                  be calculated from disequilibrium in the U-Th                                   series.  U-Th disequilibrium and the                                            distribution of radionuclides in hydrothermal                                   systems can be very useful as natural analogs                                   for the transport and sorption of radionuclides                                 in repositories.                                                                                                                                                This award recommendation provides funds for a                                  stipend of four months, international travel,                                   an allowance for in-country travel, chemicals,                                  and excess baggage and an administrative                                        allowance for Florida State University.",
