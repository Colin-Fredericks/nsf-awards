The students are encouraged to explore  setting their own parameters for the data acquisition  procedures and then to explore in greater depth problems which  particularly interest them.  The project is being implemented  in the two semester General Physics class, which is taken by  all Physics, Chemistry and Biology majors.  Each pair of  students provided with a computer interface setup which  consists of a Macintosh LCII computer and a Vernier Universal  Lab Interface with the appropriate transducers.  These setups  are being used in new experiments to study the details of  collision dynamics, phase change, Newton's Law of Cooling, and  waveform analyses related to the Doppler shift and  electromagnetic induction.  These setups are also being used to  improve existing experiments on moment of inertia and the  pendulum.  This project is significant because it provides the  only opportunity in our curriculum for science students to gain  experience with data acquisition by computers. Some of the new  experiments also contain innovative elements which may be  incorporated into laboratories at other schools.        ***",
