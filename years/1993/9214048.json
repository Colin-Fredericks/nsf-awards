 "awd_abstract_narration": "A set is recursively enumerable (r.e.) if there is a                       computable enumeration of its elements.  An r.e. set also has an                information content called its Turing-degree; an r.e. set with                  maximum information content is called Turing complete.  The                     collection of r.e. sets form a lattice, and this lattice is the                 most natural setting for studying r.e. sets as sets.  A property of             r.e. sets is invariant if it is respected by all automorphisms of               this lattice.  This project will study invariant sets, and                      automorphisms of this lattice, and their relationship to the                    degrees of r.e. sets.  In particular it will continue the recent                research with Soare studying r.e. sets which are not automorphic to             any complete set (with the hope of finding some general classes of              invariant sets), and studying r.e. sets which are automorphic to a              complete set (with the hope of finding some general constructions               of automorphisms).                                                                   Recursion theory treats an abstract model for computability                that ignores practical limitations of time and space.  In other                 words something is theoretically computable according to this model             if memory and run-time requirements can be shown merely to be                   finite without regard to how large they might actually be.  This                simplification permits a deeper understanding of the nature of                  computability.  Furthermore, it is also clear that in cases where               something can be shown not to be recursively computable, it has                 certainly also been shown not to be computable in any practical                 sense.  Finally, the habits of mind developed by the study of                   recursion theory turn out also to be of practical value, and former             students of this investigator can be found in industry doing                    software development as well as in mathematics departments training             another generation of logicians.",
