 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop a laboratory for the modular learning                  of system integration and control. It takes a unique approach                   that can be ported to other schools. A modular laboratory will                  be created with mix and match high-level components which be                    configured in a variety of ways to represent different systems                  and the problems that are often encountered in real-world                       situations. This modular laboratory has distinct advantages                     over hard-wired CIM cells and low-level commercial kits.The                     equipment requested consists of table-top sensors, data                         acquisition components, indexing table, conveyors, robots, CNC                  mill, computers, non-contact barcode readers, data                              communication components, local area network, and multimedia                    upgrade tool kits which will supplement existing equipment to                   make the modular laboratory possible.This project is an                         important step in the department goal of continuous improvement                 in CIM teaching. A significant number of students will benefit                  from the project, including IE students who are required to                     take the courses, and students from other departments who                       regularly take the courses as electives. There will also be an                  impact on junior high and high school students, teachers, women                 and minority groups during the summer from workshops to be                      sponsored by the department.",
