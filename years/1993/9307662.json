 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307662  Mayer     Fundamental materials science investigations of ion- and  thermal-induced transformations/reactions in III-V semiconductors  and copper-silicon systems will be conducted.  It is proposed to  investigate the reactions of alloying elements in Cu and oxide  formation in Cu3Si/Si.  The study of alloying elements in Cu will  be an important factor in the use of Cu for integrated circuit  metallization for adhesion and formation of diffusion barriers.  The controlled formation of oxide layers at low process  temperatures may offer a method to form this oxide on silicon.  Since electrical activation of Si-implanted GaAs is a sensitive  function of implantation dose-rate and substrate temperature it  is planned to investigate ion induced defect interaction by the  combined use of electron microscopy, electrical analysis and ion  channeling.  %%%  An understanding of dopant activation in ion-implanted GaAs is  important to integrated circuit applications.  Research will be  conducted on fundamental ion-solid interactions as well as  factors that influence the electronic and optical properties of  semiconductor material combinations with potential advantages in  electronics and photonics applications.  The semiconductor  material combinations under study have wide applicability in  electronic and optoelectronic devices; thus the research results  are expected to provide the basis for continued improvements in  the performance of advanced devices and integrated circuits of  the type used in computing, information processing, and  telecommunications.  ***",
