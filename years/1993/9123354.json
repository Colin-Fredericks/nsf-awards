 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present project hinges around a central concept known as                    \"flutter derivatives\" which are quantities that need to be                      identified in certain aerodynamic contexts.  Such derivatives                   arise, for example, in regard to a body placed in a cross-wind                  flow, where the dimensionless form of the aerodynamic lift, drag                or moment is given by a coefficient C that changes according to the             angle of inclination of the body.                                                                                                                               The flutter derivatives C' prove to be of key importance in the                 response of bluff structures- like long bridges- to wind, as their              characteristics clearly define the possible proclivity of the                   bridge to become unstable in the wind.                                                                                                                          Focusing on the engineering design of bridges, knowledge of the                 coefficients C' for bridge deck forms has heretofore been acquired              exclusively by means of wind tunney experiment.  Now, however, with             advances in computational fluid dynamics, the possibility arises                of acquiring knowledge of C' via calculation alone.                                                                                                             such studies lie in the realm of research and development, and a                back-and-forth exchange between calculation and wind tunney                     experiment is needed.//",
