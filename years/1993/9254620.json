 "awd_abstract_narration": "SciTech Clubs for Girls, a three year old program, aims to                      encourage continuing interest in science and mathematics                        among 9-14 year-old girls.  It gives them an experience in                      building a hands-on science exhibit for display at SciTech,                     a hands-on science center.                                                                                                                                      Based on recent research, this program strikes at four major                    forces that keep girls out of the pipeline to careers in                        mathematics and science.  Mentors by female professionals,                      the girls learn the safe use of tools, a principle for                          science, confidence in building things, and the pride of                        building and exhibit for use by tens of thousands of                            visitors yearly.                                                                                                                                                Recently SciTech received a $125,000 grant from Youth ALIVE|                    A National Initiative of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest                     Fund to continue the program for 3-years and to expand it.                      We will reach 20 clubs of girls each year from organizations                    that serve girls.  The program will reach older and younger                     girls and their female leaders.  We will also reach into the                    intercity of Chicago to serve more minority girls.  Under                       the YouthALIVE| grant we will carefully evaluate results and                    begin to disseminate the program to other museums                               nationally.",
