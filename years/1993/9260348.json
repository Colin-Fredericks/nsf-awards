 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of their speed and cost effectiveness, machines are                     continuing to replace \"unskilled\" human labor.  If the United                   States is to maintain its competitiveness in the world markets, its             machines must become still more sophisticated, replacing human                  labor in more complex or dangerous tasks.  This transition would                be greatly accelerated if machines could \"see\" like humans.                                                                                                     The front end preprocessor for human vision is the retina.  By                  parallel edge processing, it transfers to the brain, in real-time,              the essential characteristics of the scene being viewed.  The brain             then interprets the image outline and initiates behaviors.  This                is a project for a very high-performance retina-like                            microelectronic processor called the Super Retina Analog Parallel               Processor (SRAP).  The SRAP is a high-speed analog parallel                     processor that outputs retina-like compressed-image information.                It is faster than the human retina and in addition, could be used               in the infrared as well as the visible spectrum.  It is equivalent              to hundreds of conventional digital processors working in parallel              and is orders of magnitude smaller in size, weight, and cost.                                                                                                   The research objectives are:  1)  Define the imaging requirements               for SRAP-relevant machine and robotic vision scenarios, isolating               and emphasizing near-term commercial applications.  2)  Translate               these requirements into modifications of the baseline SRAP chip                 designs with as much general applicability as possible.  3)  Verify             the function and fabrication of the chip designs by SPICE                       simulations.",
