 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310508  Davies  Plants are confronted with potentially harmful environmental  factors such as insect attack, drought, heat, cold and UV  irradiation.  They have evolved strategies of accommodation,  whereby they can perceive and respond to such stimuli without them  resulting in death.  These strategies require integrated mechanisms  where stressful conditions experienced by one part of the plant  elicit responses in distant parts.  Some of these responses need to  be extremely rapid, and thus conventional explanations involving  manufacture and transport of diffusible chemicals (hormones) may  not be sufficient.    This proposal fcuses on two types of rapidly-generated and  transmitted signals which we have described recently in both  sunflower and tomato: action potentials (APs), which result from  the activity of voltage-sensitive (voltage-gated) ion channels; and  variation potentials (VPs), which are based on pressure-sensitive  (stretch-activated) ion channels and result from rapid changes in  the hydraulic condition of cells and tissues in proximity to the  xylem.  In the research proposed here, we will perform treatments  to selectively evoke or repress either or both of these electrical  signals in order to determine their role in modulating the  expression (up-regulation and down-regulation) of various genes.  ***",
