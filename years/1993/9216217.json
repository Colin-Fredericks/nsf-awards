 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Bulgaria research project between Dr. B. Clark Burchfiel                of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dr. Christo Nikolov                Dabovski of the Geological Institute, Bulgarian Academy of                      Sciences proposes an interdisciplinary program designed to                      document and understand late Cenozoic extensional deformation in                Bulgaria from a regional tectonic and process oriented                          perspective.  Bulgaria is part of the broad eastern Mediterranean               region of active extensional tectonism.  Bulgarian geologists                   have done excellent work on the late Cenozoic tectonics of the                  region and this permits a rapid synthesis of existing data and                  focusing on the key areas within Bulgaria where additional work                 will enhance the data so that the study of both local and                       regional extensional processes can yield well constrained                       results.  The research consists of two parts: (1) a study of                    young extensional deformation in Bulgaria from a regional and                   process-oriented perspective, and application of fluid dynamic                  concepts to understanding the role fo lower crustal flow.  These                two basic goals overlap in that models of lower crustal flow                    driven by extensional deformation will be applied to gravity,                   topography and geomorphological data from Bulgaria.                                                                                                             Both parts of the research are of broad applicability in                        understanding the relationship between surface deformation and                  deeper processes in the crust and mantle: the first part bears on               the relationship of subduction and its driving forces to regional               deformation in the upper lithosphere, while the second is an                    essential step toward understanding the processes and                           consequences of continental deformation.                                                                                                                        This project in geological sciences fulfills the program                        objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                 experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                      complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong                     mutual interest and competence.",
