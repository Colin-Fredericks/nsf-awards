 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forest canopy communities are important in maintaining the                      diversity, resiliency, and functioning of the ecosystems                        they inhabit.  With the increasing interest and amounts of                      data on forest canopies that are resulting from new access                      techniques, ecologists require the development of tools to                      manage and analyze their data and a means for comparing data                    from disparate studies.  Ecologists will need to deal with:                     1) new types of data, 2) a great deal more data, and 3) the                     necessity of sharing data among researchers who have                            separate research questions.  The project will bring                            together forest canopy researchers (\"domain scientist\"),                        quantitative scientists, and computer scientists to work                        towards establishing methods to collect, store, display,                        analyze, and interpret three-dimensional spatial data                           relating to tree crowns and tree canopies.  This award will                     support the following planning activities to: 1)  compile an                    array of research questions and needs that involve canopy                       structure from domain scientists; 2) examine potentially                        applicable information models and software tools that are in                    used in allied fields; and 3) develop conceptual models and                     recommendations for the types of format of information and                      analyses necessary to answer research questions posed by                        forest canopy researchers.  Anticipated products include:  a                    specifications list of questions and needsof domain                             scientists; and annotated compilation of potential tools                        from allied fields; an information model that will be tested                    with data collected from a forested study site were we can                      gain access to the canopy with a large construction crane;                      and an explicit set of steps to implement the model and                         generate the methods to collect and analyze three-                              dimensional spatial data. This award is being jointly                           supported by the Ecological Studies and the Database                            Activities in the Biological Sciences programs.",
