 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among many mantle plumes, the Kerguelen plume stands out as                     a large, long-lived plume manifesting itself as the                             Kerguelen Plateau, one of the two giant oceanic plateaus of                     the world.  The P.I.s propose to investigate geochemical                        aspects of the evolutionary history of the plume.  Our                          effort will be focused into two separate projects:  (1)                         Basalt project (Frey) will focus on the old plateau basalt                      lavas in the northwestern province.  Geochemical                                characterization of these oldest basalts will present clear                     understanding of secular isotopic variations observed on                        younger eruptives.  Comparative studies between the                             Kerguelen and Hawaiian plumes will provide important                            information on how different parts of mantle plumes are                         tapped and on how mantle plumes evolve geochemically.  (2)                      Xenolith project (Shimizu) will focus on detailed                               petrography, mineral chemistry (major and trace elements)                       and isotopic compositions of lower crustal and mantle                           xenoliths.  The P.I.s intend to obtain definitive answers on                    whether granulites are pieces of ancient continental crust                      or young basaltic crust recrystallized in the granulite                         facies conditions.  Upper mantle xenoliths will also be used                    to investigate the plate setting, a possible involvement of                     ancient continental lithosphere, and interaction between                        plume-derived melts and lithosphere/asthenosphere.",
