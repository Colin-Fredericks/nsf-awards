 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site award provides support for six undergraduate                 researchers working with faculty advisors.  Research projects                   will be chosen from five areas.  Five faculty will contribute to                the project. They will focus on topics such as hyperbolic                       geometry of surfaces and geometric group theory with special                    interest in circle packings of surfaces and how the combinatorial               structure of surfaces restricts their geometry.  Also considered                will be studies of fundamental groups and covering spaces with an               eye to constructing all covering spaces of spaces with given                    monodromy groups. Work will also be done on polynomial                          factorization such as the computation of Galois groups as                       permutation groups.  This research involves computer algebras                   systems such as Mathematica. Other students will focus on large-                scale numerical modeling of geophysical flow, the application of                optimization methods to the retrieval of the earth's structure                  and of groundwater aquifer.                                                          Florida State University traditionally conducts several                    undergraduate research activities each year.  Additionally, there               is an Alliance for Minority Participation program on campus to                  add to the opportunities for students to meet and take advantage                of seminars, visiting speakers etc.  Two major campus institutes,               one in geophysical fluid dynamics and one in supercomuting also                 add to the intellectual life and experience of the students.",
