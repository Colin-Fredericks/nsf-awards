 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a study of late Cenozoic vegetation in the                  Transantarctic Mountains using palynology of tills and marine                   sediments.  The record of terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica                  since the onset of glaciation at about 40 Ma (Ma = million years                before present) is poorly known.  It was thought to have been                   expelled from Antarctica during a late Oligocene glaciation (30                 Ma), and certainly lost by middle Miocene time (15 Ma).  However,               well-preserved twigs, leaves, roots, and pollen of Nothofagus                   (southern beech) and coniferous pollen are now known from the                   mid- to upper Pliocene Sirius Group (86oS latitude; 1800m above                 sea level) in the Transantarctic Mountains.  Nothofaguso survival               until at least the late Pliocene implies a Neogene climate 15o to               20oC warmer than today, even during glacial periods.  Based on                  one interpretation, onset of the present cold polar climate, loss               of the plants, and growth of the present ice sheet all occurred                 within the last 3 Ma.  If the plants, which require mean summer                 temperatures warmer than 5oC, grew at high elevations (1500m) in                the Transantarctic Mountains, then a lush vegetation should have                grown at sea-level which should have produced a rich pollen                     record in Pliocene coastal sediments.  The goals of this study                  are to understand the late Cenozoic vegetation history of the                   continent and thereby to constrain models for the history of the                Antarctic ice sheets and to resolve the question of Pliocene                    warming in the southern hemisphere.",
