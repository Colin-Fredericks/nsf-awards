 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Construction Decision Support System for Delay Analysis (DAS                - Delay Analysis System) for use on personal computers was                      developed to integrate existing project control systems and                     scheduling programs by adding the capability of determining                     possible causes for delays and suggesting alternative courses of                action to prevent further delays. The DAS was designed to                       demonstrate the importance of providing an interactive                          environment for knowledge acquisition to improve project controls               and analysis processes.  The development of the interactive                     system enhances information processing and decision-making                      capabilities.  The ability to monitor the progress of a project,                and to determine possible causes of delays and suggest corrective               actions with the aid of a personal computer provides consistent                 evaluation of project performance.                                                                                                                              The objective of the second phase of the DAS research is to                     include additional knowledge bases related to contract and                      project parameters such as different types of projects, different               locations of projects, and different types of firms to increase                 its usefulness to the diverse segments of the construction                      industry.  The data collected will be analyzed using hypothesis                 testing to determine whether there are correlations between the                 different parameters and types of delays.  The results of this                  analysis will be used to refine the DA system submodels.                        Additional research objectives include conducting research in the               area of international delays, including cultural factors, and                   creating new submodels that will contain knowledge on delays                    related to international construction.  Research will also be                   conducted into resolution upon completion of construction                       projects.",
