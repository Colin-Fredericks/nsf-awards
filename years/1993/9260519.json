 "awd_abstract_narration": "As electric power utilities are faced with the                                  prospect of operating under conditions of ever                                  increasing complexity, the need for accurate system                             modeling is becoming paramount.  Utilities must be                              able to accurately predict the response of their                                system due to the installation of new devices or the                            operation of their existing system closer to                                    constraint boundaries.  It is essential that power                              system simulation models reflect the characteristics                            of the actual system as accurately as possible.  This                           research would use an innovative approach to lay                                the foundation for an analysis package that would                               accurately determine the modeling parameters of                                 synchronous generators using standstill and on-line                             measurement techniques.  The proposed research                                  would establish the feasibility of using a Prony-                               based algorithm to extract data from various                                    synchronous machine test procedures that have                                   recently been developed for frequency domain                                    parameter identification.  It is thought that this new                          approach, if found to be feasible, will reduce the                              risk of damage to the synchronous machines under                                test, provide for faster determination of the                                   required parameters, provide for better noise                                   rejection in evaluating the retrieved waveforms, and                            be more cost effective to utilities and regulatory                              agencies.",
