 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308889  MYERS       Most research on urban residential mobility treats the  housing stock and the households moving through it as separate  objects of analysis.  Housing research has been conducted with  only slight regard to population dynamics, and population  research has under-emphasized the housing in which people live.  Both housing units and households have life cycles which are  joined together by an occupancy of some duration.  This linkage  between specific housing units and specific households requires  study in order to gain a better understanding of urban  residential structure.  This research project will test a theory  of the role of time in urban residential structure and housing  relocation by integrating housing stock, population, and the  residential mobility process that links the two.  It uses a model  of cohort layering to integrate housing construction and aging,  cohorts of householders, and occupancy cohorts defined by year  moved into the unit, thus joining the histories of individual  households and housing units.  This framework will be used to  test for differences in residential mobility rates observed  across metropolitan areas in the United States.  Multivariate  models will be estimated to explain the persistence of  occupancies from 1980 to 1990 for different types of households  and dwellings under different metropolitan conditions.  Data will  come from the Public Use Microdata Sample of the U.S. Census.       Age of housing is an important factor in residential  mobility of households, but it is unclear what role housing plays  in this process.  This research will combine both spatial and  temporal dimensions of household residential mobility to give a  clearer understanding of how households and housing units combine  in time and space to define rates of residential mobility in  urban areas.  The model to be developed through this research  will be able to be implemented with readily available census data  for any location in the nation, which will make it  of use to both  researchers and policy planners wishing to understand how housing  age affects relocation.  ***",
