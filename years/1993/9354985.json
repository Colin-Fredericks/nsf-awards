The goals of  the program are to educate individuals who will be well-versed both  in a subject area (mathematics, physics, chemistry, or biology) and  in the cognitive issues related to learning that subject; who will  maintain a strong connection to educational practice through  teaching and applying research to instruction and assessment and  who will influence the educational process through their  contributions as researchers, educators, administrators, and  developers of formal and informal educational materials.  This  program results from a partnership between interdisciplinary  faculty groups at the two universities.  Each partner brings  distinct and complementary contributions to the program.  Together,  these two faculties provide a unique approach to the fields of  mathematics and science education, an approach that is  simultaneously based on the changing natures of mathematics and  science and their place in undergraduate education and on the  learning and teaching of basic science and mathematics concepts.   The traineeships will allow an additional five applicants to be  admitted to the program.  Special efforts will be made to recruit  from underrepresented groups.  ***",
