 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306367  Roder  The main objective of the proposed work is to gather kinetic and  structural information on the initial stages of protein folding.   The time resolution of kinetic folding studies will be extended  into the sub-millisecond time range by using laser flash  photolysis and improved rapid mixing techniques to initiate the  folding reaction.  The resulting conformational changes will be  monitored by transient spectroscopy in the visible and near-UV  region, as well as steady-state fluorescence and picosecond   time-resolved fluorescence.  These techniques will be applied to   cytochrome c and variants prepared by site-directed mutagenesis.   By taking advantage of the redox and ligand binding properties of  the covalently attached heme group, it is possible to initiate  the folding reaction of cytochrome c by photoreduction, or by  photodissociation of a carbon monoxide ligand bound to the  reduced heme iron in the unfolded protein.  The collapse of the  polypeptide chain will be monitored by time-resolved fluorescence  in conjunction with rapid mixing techniques, initially using  continuous-flow and later a jet mixing device for measurements on  a sub-millisecond time scale.  %%%  The question of how a polypeptide chain can spontaneously fold  into a biologically active protein is of fundamental and  practical importance throughout molecular biology, but we are  only just beginning to unravel some of the principles of this  remarkable reaction.  Because of the limited time resolution of  conventional kinetic techniques, there are at present no direct  experimental observations on protein folding events on the sub-  millisecond time scale.  Yet, these rapid structural events are  key to understanding how protein folding is initiated, which is  the focus of numerous theoretical efforts to solve the protein  folding problem.  Kinetic studies involving novel optical  triggering and fast mixing methods will provide unique insight  into chain collapse and secondary formation during early  stages  of protein folding.  ***",
