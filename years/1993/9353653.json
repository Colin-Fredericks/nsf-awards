The projects are  grouped into three general areas  of activity including travel associated with grant or collaborative  research opportunities,  disciplinary research conferences, and educational programs to  increase the number of women  and minorities in science disciplines.  Travel programs involve  opportunities for junior faculty  to visit program officers in federal agencies and to explore  collaborative research opportunities  in national research labs and industry.  Conferences include an  international conference in atomic  collisions physics, an intrastate conference in regulatory peptide  research, and possibly an  additional intrastate conference to stimulate increased  collaboration among scientists of the state's  four research universities.  Educational programs are focused on  engineering and biomedical  science at the pre-college level, biochemistry at the college  level, and water science at the  graduate level.",
