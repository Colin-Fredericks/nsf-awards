 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306313  Levine  This proposal concerns the calculation, from first principles, of  the linear and non-linear optical properties of semiconductor  crystals using ideas based upon band theory but in which the self-  energy corrections have been included. The work, to date, has  calculated the dielectric response of a range of semiconductors to  high accuracy; the evaluation of the nonlinear susceptibility for  second-harmonic generation in several III-V systems and the  calculation of the optical activity of selenium. The proposed work  will concentrate on creating a new GW code; including spin-orbit  effects; studying linear and second-harmonic optical response in  technologically relevant systems; intercomparing the optical  properties of isolated and solid-state condensed molecular systems  and studying higher response functions (eg third-harmonic  generation) in silicon.  %%%  This proposal concerns principally materials theory; that is the  direct calculation of specific materials properties - in this  particular case the optical properties of insulating and  semiconducting crystals. The materials of interest vary from  technologically important semiconductor device-related materials  (such as quartz, strained GaAs and silicon) to biologically  relevant molecular crystals (such as urea). The optical properties  of interest range from the linear (simple interaction) to the  nonlinear (more complex interaction with light). The state-of-the-  art today allows calculation of such properties to a few percent  accuracy and indeed allows the prediction of optical behavior in  systems which are not-yet made and/or difficult to make. Thus  \"materials by design\" is a viable near-attainable objective for  this work.  ***",
