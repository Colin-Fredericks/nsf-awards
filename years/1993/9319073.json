 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319073  Desharnais       The investigator and his colleagues conduct an  interdisciplinary research program to test nonlinear population  theory: they construct and analyze mathematical models, design and  implement biological experiments, develop and apply statistical  techniques for the analysis of data.  For the biological  experiments an organism is used that is easy to culture, has a  short generation time (i.e. yields long time series data) and  allows an accurate census of animal numbers: flour beetles of the  genus Tribolium.  In the first part of the study the objectives are  model identification and parameter estimation.  In the second part,  the concern is to document transitions in the qualitative behavior  of the demographic dynamics.  Rates of reproduction and adult  mortality are manipulated in order to cross boundaries in  parameter space from stable equilibria, to periodic cycles, to  chaos.  In phase three the objectives are to test hypotheses  concerning the existence of these unusual demographic dynamics and  develop methods for identifying these phenomena in experimental  data.  A major contribution of this project is an unequivocal  example of experimentally manipulated transitions between  qualitatively different dynamical behaviors of a biological  population as predicted by a mathematical model.       In the last ten years or so, the recognition that simple  equations can generate complex dynamics has led to an outpouring  of fascinating theoretical possibilities for the explanation of  population time series data.  Understanding the observed  fluctuations in animal population numbers is a central question in  population biology; it has far-reaching applications in areas  ranging from food production and pest control, to the management  of renewable resources, to the conservation of species diversity.  The hypothesis that fluctuations are the result of nonlinear  dynamic forces has proved to be elusive to test due to the  difficulties of gathering adequate ecological da ta, of  experimentally manipulating ecological systems, and of evaluating  complex mathematical models with ecological data.  In this research  project the investigators' approach to testing nonlinear  population theory is to connect mathematical models rigorously  with experimental biological data by means of newly developed  statistical methods for nonlinear time series.  The project is  unique in its interdisciplinary approach because it involves both  theory and experimentation and utilizes the talents of the  biologist, statistician, and mathematician.  It is unusual in the  field of population biology to have an interdisciplinary effort in  which investigators from all of these disciplines are involved in  all aspects of the project, from experimental design and  implementation, through theoretical modeling and analysis, to  statistical testing and verification.  The ultimate goal is to  demonstrate the usefulness and importance of nonlinear mathematics  in gaining a rigorous understanding of the dynamics of animal  populations and in particular of fluctuations in population  numbers, be these fluctations regular or \"chaotic.\"",
