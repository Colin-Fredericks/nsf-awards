 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353808  Morrow    The purpose of project GenderWise is to facilitate the development and implementation of new  mathematics intervention programs modeled after SummerMath.  For eleven years, SummerMath  has been providing young women in high school with new opportunities in mathematics.  Each  summer, as a result of participating in SummerMath, young women return to schools with  increased confidence, problem solving skills, and independence.  The SummerMath curriculum  will be revised and expanded, teacher guides for that curriculum will be developed, classroom  videotapes will be produced, and a workshop for intervention program developers will be  conducted at Mount Holyoke College.  Among the modifications of SummerMath curriculum  are the addition of geometry units incorporating the use of Geometer's Sketchpad software,  expansion the algebra units, incorporating the use of Function Probe software, and revision of  existing curriculum, including the integration of more extensive calculator-based problems.     Teacher guides to the curriculum will be written that outline equity considerations for young  women, as well as supportive strategies for many types of effective classroom interactions.   They will also include the goals and objectives of each unit, mathematical connections between  units, and assessment activities for each unit.  The set of videotapes developed will demonstrate  \"learning in action\":  teachers interactions with students, and student interactions with  mathematical materials and with each other, including student presentations to other students.   Finally, a five day intensive workshop for teams of intervention program developers will be held  in the summer of 1994 at Mount Holyoke College.  This workshop will be a training session for  the materials and pedagogy that have been developed.  Workshop participants will learn  strategies for teacher feedback and student self-evaluation.  Programs developed by the workshop  participants will enable many young women to exp erience the positive effects of a gender  equitable mathematics learning community.  The curricular materials produced will have  significance for the larger mathematics education community as an example of rich and  stimulating mathematics and teaching practices that are connected to the lives of young women.  ***",
