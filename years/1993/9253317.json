 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant funds a 3 year project to inservice and supports                      teacher trainers n Virginia and eastern North Carolina.  In                     addition, the project would develop a network of leadership                     teams, each composed of one mathematics and one science                         teacher.  Thirty of these teams act as site coordinators for                    interactive telecourses that use TRANSIT (Technology Reform                     and Specialists Inservice training) materials developed at                      Ohio State University and NASA Langley.  The courses primarily                  focus on innovative methods of teaching mathematics and                         science and include significant amounts of appropriate                          technology for grades 6-12.  Through a combination of video                     demonstrations, interactive dialog with the  VANT (Virginia                     Network for Technology) staff, \"hands-on\" work with the site                    coordinators, and time to practice new techniques in each                       teachers's classroom, the participants modify their own                         teaching to meet new NCTM standards and respond to local                        concerns.                                                                                                                                                       Each year, fifty mathematics or science teachers form Virginia                  and North Carolina attend a 2-week inservice in the summer to                   learn to become lead teachers.  Twenty of them are chosen to                    form 2-person telecommunication site coordinator teams.  Ten                    new teams are formed each year.  Theses teams are chosen for                    their expertise and for the availability of a satellite                         receiving station.  In turn, these sites are connected to Old                   Dominion University and become telecourse and inservice                         training centers for additional teachers.  All site                             coordinators receive two site visits from the VANT staff for                    support and are invited to participate in two academic year                     one-day inservice workshops.  In each of the subsequent two                     years, fifty additional teachers are directly trained and new                   centers formed until 150 teachers have been trained directly,                   20 telecommunication centers formed, and thousands of teachers                  trained at these sites.",
