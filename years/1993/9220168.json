 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate and efficient processing of primary transcription products             is absolutely required for normal gene expression in eukaryotic                 cells.  Integration and coordination among the individual reactions             which constitute a functional RNA processing pathway are the                    subjects of this research.  Splicing and transport of tRNA                      transcripts in yeast and in Xenopus have been chosen as                         experimental models based on the availability of a large number of              tRNA genes for analysis detailed information regarding both tRNA                structure and mechanisms for tRNA processing, and the development               of a range of assay systems for measuring splicing and transport                reactions.  Quantitative microinjection of synthetic RNA substrates             into oocyte nuclei is used to measure both splicing and transport.              Experiments are proposed in two areas.  The first is a systematic               mutational analysis of tRNA gene mutations affecting IVS + and IVS-             tRNA transport.  The second is an analysis of the distinct  yeast-              like and vertebrate tRNA splicing pathways and their function in                oocytes.  Injection of splicing intermediates and coinjection of                yeast tRNA ligase will be used in this second experimental area.                Long term goals include analyses of potential regulation through                the use of alternate processing pathways and mechanisms for                     coupling of the splicing and transport steps.                                   %%%                                                                             Precursor transfer RNA molecules undergo shortening before they                 become mature molecules that can function in ribosomal protein                  synthesis.  They must also be transported out of the nucleus of                 eukaryotic cells.  These important steps in the gene expression of              functional tRNAs is the subject of this research.",
