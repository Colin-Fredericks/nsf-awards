 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematics department of Calvin College in                 conjunction with the mathematics department of the University                   of Tennessee, Knoxville, under the ILI-LDD program is                           developing and maintaining a readily accessible depository for                  mathematical software and related materials used in education                   at the two- and four-year college and university                                levels.Computer programs serve several important roles in                       education. They make possible visualization of mathematical                     objects in a way inconceivable 30 years ago. They allow                         instructor and student to generate examples quickly. They often                 serve as model exercises for students to program, testing their                 knowledge of newly learned concepts. Many instructors have                      taken advantage of this and have written software specifically                  to illustrate or explore a mathematical concept. Several years                  ago, much of this software was distributed through software                     exchanges, such as Kinko's, and the user paid a modest fee.                     Internet has made distribution of software faster, easier, and                  available world-wide.The Mathematics Archives, started by                       volunteer efforts, are the only archives in the world totally                   dedicated to posting, reviewing, and supporting software                        suitable for mathematics education at the college and                           university level in a form that allows for downloading by                       anonymous ftp.  This project is expanding the services of the                   Archives to facilitate locating and downloading software,                       reviews, Mathematica notebooks, and other documents in                          electronic form. In addition, the Archive is being moved to a                   dedicated site which will allow for quick expansion and                         maintenance of the Archives.",
