The objective of this renewal project                                   is to extend the studies of deterioration to                                    dolomites and limestones, building materials                                    that are much more  porous than marble.                                                                                                                         This research is likely to lead to a better                                     understanding than now exists of the role                                       played by air pollutants in accelerating the                                    deterioration of materials and structures                                       that are exposed to the pollutants.  This                                       knowledge may be applied to engineering                                         design of structures to minimize damage from                                    air pollutants and to establish the economic                                    value of pollution abatement measures in                                        comparison with the structural deterioration                                    to pollutant exposures.//",
