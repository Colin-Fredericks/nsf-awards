 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of its dilation property, the wavelet transform is the                  preferred approach for processing broadband signals in both civil               and military environments.  Unfortunately, its computation requires             a large number of numerical operations.  In many situations, this               may be prohibitively expensive is not unrealistic.  Analog parallel             processing techniques including optical methods are either                      unsuitable or not accurate enough for practical applications, and               hence, for possible commercialization.  Switched-capacitor                      techniques, which substitute appropriate combinations of high-                  speed switches and capacitors for resistors, are not used in VLSI               implementations of active filter designs.  The most important                   property of a switched-capacitor circuit is that its clock                      frequency controls the filter parameters.                                                                                                                       The purpose of this proposal is to implement the wavelet transform              using switched-capacitor circuits.  What makes this possibility is              the observation that the dilation effect in a wavelet filter can                be realized by the adjusting of the clock frequency.  By using                  current VLSI techniques based on the proposed scheme, large numbers             of wavelet filter channels can be fabricated on a single chip.                  These IC chips can be used as standard components in a signal                   processing unit having increased resolution.  They will also offer              reliable real-time processing and full compatibility with other                 state-of-the-art electronic equipment.  Near future                             commercialization of these devices is anticipated.",
