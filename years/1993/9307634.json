Frogs and  insects can be quite similar in their modes of sound communication.  In both taxa, males  produce sounds that elicit a response in other males or in potential female mates.  These  responses may be sounds or movements towards or away from the sound source.  There is  clear convergence in the research methods used by scientists studying the physiological and  evolutionary mechanisms of acoustic communication in frogs and insects.  This symposium  will bring together researchers in anuran and insect sound communication to identify  similarities and differences in the behavioral, neurophysiological and evolutionary  mechanisms of acoustic communication in anurans and insects.  Topics will include  chorusing and signal interaction, signalling energetics, behavioral and neural mechanisms of  sound recognition and localization, heritability and sexual selection.  This symposium should  build several new bridges between researchers studying these separate zoological taxa and  lead to future research efforts that synthesize and build upon the work of all investigators of  animal sound communication.",
