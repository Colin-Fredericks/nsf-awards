 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224575  Brown  This is a collaborative research on verified hardware synthesis  between Cornell University and Oxford University.  The projects  at Cornell and at Oxford are aimed at synthesizing correct  hardware.  These projects each use different (though related)  languages and different target architectures.  By combining  expertise of the two groups a set of tools and methodologies will  be developed which allows the designer a great deal of  flexibility.  The primary tasks of the project are:    Sharing Tools  The main benefit will be to share tools so that  each group can take advantage of developments from other  projects.    Development of Common Intermediate Form  In order to facilitate  sharing of tools a common intermediate form will be developed.    Comparison of Verification Techniques  Both groups are working on  proofs of correctness for their compilers and the languages being  studied are quite similar.  However, the proof techniques being  used are substantially different.    Comparison of Target Implementations  The two groups have access  to different sets of target hardware.    Development for Different Applications  While the compilation  systems developed are similar the target applications are  different.  ***",
