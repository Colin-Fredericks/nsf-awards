 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                 support travel to Brazil for Rainer Bleck of                                    the University of Miami, along with a graduate                                  student, in collaboration with Edmo Campos of                                   the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.  The                                       project aims to study, in a numerical                                           framework, dynamic and thermodynamic processes                                  governing oceanic circulation in the tropical                                   Atlantic.                                                                                                                                                       The model to be used is the thermodynamically                                   active version of the Isopycnic Coordinate                                      model developed at Miami by Bleck and others.                                   The model's main advantage in this context will                                 be to eliminate inadvertent, numerically                                        induced vertical heat diffusion.  The                                           researchers also plan to conduct a                                              comprehensive study of the oceanic response to                                  atmospheric thermodynamic forcing.  They will                                   also focus on the main interannual and decadal                                  variability signal, commonly called the                                         \"Atlantic SST dipole.\"  The U.S. side will                                      benefit from access to equatorial phenomena of                                  water mass exchanges, which will add                                            significantly to the U.S. models of circulation                                 in the North Atlantic.  The Brazilian side will                                 gain an enhanced capability in ocean modeling,                                  which will position the country to contribute                                   to future research on global climate change.",
