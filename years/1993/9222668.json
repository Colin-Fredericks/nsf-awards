 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops and tests a theory of relational                     cohesion that indicates how and when power in negotiations affects              the development of commitment among parties to an exchange.  It                 does so through three laboratory experiments, one on each of three              commitment behaviors: (1) staying in the relationship even if                   better ones become available; (2) giving each other gifts that do               not require immediate reciprocity; (3) contributing to a joint fund             with the other.  Each experiment will assign 80 same-sex dyads to               one of four experimental conditions in a standard two-party                     explicit bargaining setting.  The theory and experimental test will             suggest how an exchange relationship having an instrumental                     foundation becomes more expressive if exchanges are successfully                negotiated over time.                                                                                                                                                This project will contribute to our understanding of the                   emergence of commitment in human interactions, illuminating how                 people come to have positive emotions toward each other quite                   beyond the satisfaction of self-interested needs.  It provides an               important link between laboratory social psychology studies of                  exchange and the sociology of emotions, a field that has grown                  substantially in very recent years.",
