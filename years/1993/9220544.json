 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University Wisconsin is requesting funds to add 12 new 2               and 4 year colleges and universities to its state wide higher                   education network which already comprises over 30 institutions.                 The proposal requests partial funding for participation in NSFNET               through an additional connection with CICNET, the regional network              attaching to NSFNET in the Wisconsin Area as well as partial start-             up funds for the necessary routers, circuits, and operating support             to facilitate the fullest possible participation.  The educational              institutions that will participate include: Cardinal Stritch                    College, Concordia University, Marshfield Medical Research and                  Education Foundation, Mount Senario College, Northland College,                 Viterbo College, Wisconsin Board of Vocational, Technical and Adult             Education, Chippewa Valley Technical College, Moraine Park                      Technical College, Wausheka County Technical College, and Western               Wisconsin Technical College.                                                         The network will provide a consistent statewide architecture               for NSFNET access for a broad variety of entities engaged in                    education and research.  This cooperative network will provide                  gateways to regional, national, and international networks and will             be consistent with their standards.  It will further the                        institutions' work in enhancing the state's economic development                through a well-educated workforce, accessible training                          opportunities, and research and development partnerships.  Another              goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative projects and                 sharing of resources between institutions, including those outside              the state.                                                                           The universities need greater functionality and network speed              to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                   transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail               system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the link.              This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore                    innovative educational resources.",
