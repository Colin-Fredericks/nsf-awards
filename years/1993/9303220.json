 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Grant to work in             number theory, specifically, the theory of Gauss sums.  Gauss sums              are ubiquitous in number theory, playing a role in class field                  theory.  The argument of the quadratic Gauss sum was found by Gauss             himself in 1805 after a four-year search.  No progress was made on              the arguments of cubic Gauss sums for 170 years, when Cassels and               Mathews related the argument to elliptic functions.  Professor                  Grant proposes to study the argument of quintic Gauss sums using                the arithmetic of curves of genus 2.  Specifically, he plans to                 apply his previous work on the arithmetic of curves of genus 2 and              their Jacobians.                                                                     This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it hlas become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for               computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
