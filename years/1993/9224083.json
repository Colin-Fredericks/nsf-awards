 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell division in animal cells culminates in cytokinesis, the                  separation of two daughter cells.  The force generating apparatus               for this cleavage is the contractile ring, a transient actin-myosin             organelle that is attached to and exerts tension on the plasma                  membrane.  Many facets of cytokinesis remain to be elucidated.                  These include the source, composition, and interaction of                       contractile ring components, the regulation of contraction, and the             spatial positioning of the contractile ring.  The proposed                      experiments address several of these aspects.  Monoclonal                       antibodies, which were prepared against actin-associated proteins,              have allowed identification of several protein components of the                contractile ring in sea urchin eggs.  These proteins will be                    purified and characterized in vitro, particularly with regard to                the proteins with which they interact.  The functions of the                    proteins in vivo will be investigated in microinjection experiments             with the antibodies prepared against them.  The regulation of                   contraction will be examined by investigating whether changes in                myosin phosphorylation occur at cytokinesis when the amount of                  myosin in the cytoskeleton increases.  The results of the proposed              experiments will allow a molecular description of the functions of              several components of the contractile ring and thus increase our                understanding of this dynamic structure.                                        %%%                                                                             Reproduction is the most fundamental aspect of all living things.               Cell division is an intrinsic part of this phenomenon for all                   cellular organisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic.  For                       Protistans (single-celled organisms), reproduction is, simply, cell             division.  For multicellular organisms, cell division is key to                 reproduction, not only for generating germ-line cells (gametes,                 spores) but also for regenerating whole organisms from spores or                zygotes (development).  In multicellular organisms, tight                       regulation of the mechanism whereby daughter cell cytoplasms are                partitioned from each other during cell division, including the                 precise position of the cleavage furrow, is invariably crucial for              subsequent development of the organism.  Thus, this project                     addresses one of the most fundamental aspects of animal life on                 earth.  The cleavage mechanism is known to involve an actomyosin                based contractile apparatus, the contractile ring, which girdles                the cell at the cleavage furrow at the cytoplasmic face of the                  plasma membrane.  The goals of this project are to discover what                other proteins, besides actin and myosin, are in the ring, how the              ring components function to cause the constriction of the membrane              at the cleavage furrow, and how all this is regulated.  The                     approaches to be used will combine rigorous in vitro biochemical                analysis with experimental manipulations and observations in vivo.",
