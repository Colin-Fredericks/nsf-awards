 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353561  Snow    \"The Connecticut Museum Collaborative for Science Education\" is teacher enhancement program that will serve approximately 5,000 middle school teachers (and their students) from throughout Connecticut over a three-year program period.  The proposed program has been developed cooperatively by four of Connecticut's Science Museums and Centers (The Discovery Museum, The Maritime Center at Norwalk, Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, and Talcott Mountain Science Center), in consultation with the school districts they serve and the Connecticut Academy for Education in Mathematics, Science, and Technology, the State's leadership organization solely devoted to enhancing education in mathematics, science, and technology.    The Collaborative seeks to enliven and enhance the teaching of science, mathematics, and technology by drawing upon the resources of Connecticut's science-rich institutions and related businesses and industry.    The proposed project will provide direct services to a core group of 72 middle school teachers and their students in eight urban and suburban school districts at the four participating museums and in their classrooms, as well as teacher training, curriculum development, and networking activities.  Larger numbers of teachers and their students will be served through a planned series of interactive video teleconferences.    A theme-based approach will be followed in which the unifying theme of \"Earth Resource Monitoring\" will serve to connect the activities at the four cooperating museums.  The central concept of the project is collaboration among museums throughout the state to provide a bridge between science-rich institutions and the schools for teacher enhancement, curriculum improvement, and student enrichment.  Special program components involve the participation of business and industry through \"Video Field Trips\", and parents through a \"Family Science\" activity.    The involvement of the Connecticut Academy for Education in Mathematics, Science and Technolo gy as a member of the \"Connecticut Collaborative\" provides a direct link for integration of project activities into Connecticut's NSF-funded Statewide Systemic Initiative.",
