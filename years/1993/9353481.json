 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353481  Soloway    At the heart of a working science literacy is the ability to create  models that explain real-world phenomena.  However, constructing,  simulating, and validating models poses a serious challenge for  students.  Just as professional computational scientists rely on  technology in their model creation activities, we propose  developing a Computation-Enhanced Science Learning (CESL)  educational approach that provides comparable technological support  for students and teachers.    ScienceWorks, the technological component of CESL, will provide  scaffolded, computational modeling tools that enable students to  create computational models; this activity should lead to a deep  understanding of the science phenomena.  The disposition to then  see scientific phenomena as analyzable systems should also develop  as students gain expertise over successive investigations.   ScienceWorks will afford students access to a broad range of  functionality, e.g., video simulations, data visualization  representations; the actual computations will be carried out by  off-the-shelf, professional software mediated through ScienceWorks'  open architecture.    CESL/ScienceWorks will be used on a daily basis at a public high  school; additionally, an informal network of ScienceWorks-using  schools will be supported over the Internet.  A longitudinal  assessment will be conducted to determine the impact that  CESL/ScienceWorks has on student's learning of science content and  science process; transfer ability will also be assessed.  Findings  from this effort should provide guidelines for the development of  next-generation, educationally-sensitive software.  ***",
