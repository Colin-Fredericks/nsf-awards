Debra W. Stewart                                    and Norman A. Sprinthall of the State                                           University in Raleigh and Dr. Renata Siemienska                                 of the University of Warsaw will investigate                                    ethical decision making among local public                                      administrators in two provinces in Poland.  The                                 study aims to understand:  1. how non-elected                                   public officials in the new Poland exercise                                     discretion inherent in the public                                               administrative role when they confront ethical                                  dilemmas;  2. the variables associated with the                                 exercise of alternative models of ethical                                       reasoning among this group;  3. the                                             organizational, contextual, demographic and                                     attitudinal correlates of principled reasoning                                  among these officials.  Working collaboratively                                 with investigators in Poland, Dr. Stewart will                                  survey 300 local public administrators and                                      conduct in-depth interviews with 20 of these                                    civil servants in five towns within each of two                                 provinces in Poland.  As power increasingly                                     devolves to local government, it is important                                   to know how new managers are using their newly                                  sanctioned discretion and how the ethical                                       models they employ shape that action.  Data                                     generated in this study will lead to a                                          comparison of modes of ethical response across                                  U.S. and Polish government officials.                                                                                                                           This project in sociology fulfills the program                                  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                                  enabling leading experts in the United States                                   and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                                     talents and pool resources in areas of strong                                   mutual interest and competence.",
