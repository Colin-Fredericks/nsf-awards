 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Botany at the                    National Museum of Natural History to help support 48                           undergraduate students over a three year period who will                        participate in both a formal curriculum and closely                             supervised independent research in areas such as                                systematics, botany, zoology, and paleobiology.  Research                       and training in organismal biology, systematic, and ecology                     has declined at most universities over the last decade, even                    though these fields are critical for evaluating and                             addressing loss of biodiversity and global change.  Museums                     still carry out basic research in these fields, but have had                    little to do with undergraduate education.  The National                        Museum of Natural History (NMNH) Research Training Program                      at the Smithsonian Institution is designed to stimulate                         undergraduates to pursue careers in the natural sciences                        through a balanced program of hands-on research, scientific                     lectures, and group discussions.  The 10-week long summer                       program emphasizes an independent research project                              supervised by a member of the scientific staff.  The                            training value of the project is enhanced by a set of                           lectures, discussions, field trips, and laboratory and                          collections demonstrations.  The strengths of the NMNH                          Research Training Program are the large number of research                      staff (over 120 Ph.D.-level scientists and 250 technicians),                    the breadth of research projects (e.g. morphological and                        molecular systematics, paleobiology, behavior,                                  morphometrics, ecology), the size of the collections (more                      than 119 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils,                         etc.), and the excellent libraries (over 1 million texts and                    journals).  The combination of these resources creates an                       unparalleled environment for getting undergraduates started                     on careers as researchers in the natural sciences.  As of                       1992, students who complete the Program now have the                            opportunity to apply for a Pew Fellowship in Systematic                         Biology at the Smithsonian that will allow them to continue                     their research training at the NMNH through the end of their                    undergraduate education.",
