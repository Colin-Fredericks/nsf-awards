 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research planning grant for women focuses on the examination               of the direct effects of climate change on the physiology and                   behavior of birds.  The specific aims are to delineate the limits,              functional ranges, and interrelationships of thermogenic and                    locomotor capacities of the house finch in relation to various                  climatic conditions.  The principal objectives of this research                 are: 1) determination of the effects of wind and ambient                        temperature on energy metabolism, thermoregulation and locomotion               of the house finch, and 2) comparisons of the energy expenditure                for thermoregulation of sedentary and active birds under various                temperature and wind conditions.  House finches undergo dramatic                seasonal changes in thermogenic endurance.  Thus, the relationship              between regulatory thermogenesis and exercise-generated heat during             winter and summer seasons affords an interesting comparison.                                                                                                    This design and the testing of the hypotheses will define the                   limits and functional ranges of metabolic, thermoregulatory and                 locomotor capacities of the house finch under more ecologically                 significant temperature and convective conditions than previous                 laboratory investigations.  This information is critical for 1)                 determining how close these birds are operating to the limits of                their functional capacities in nature, 2) providing a mechanistic               link between shifts in activity patterns in response to changes in              thermal environments, and 3) predicting the survival potential of               these birds in different thermal environments.  The understanding               of the links between physical environments and individuals is of                great theoretical significance.  Such individual-based models can               be used to predict responses at the population and community level              of organization.  This is particularly relevant for assessing                   predictions concerning global climate change, which anticipate                  major shifts in abundance and distribution of animal populations.               Thus, individual-based models as used in this study can make                    significant contributions as initial steps toward an understanding              of the driving forces of larger-scale changes in population                     dynamics.",
