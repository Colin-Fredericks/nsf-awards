Sponsorship is by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Data and Computing Division, the University Programs Office, the Equal opportunity Office, and NASA Headquarters.  Based on the success of the 1991 and 1992 meeting, this period is to support the third meeting of the MU SPIN Users Working Group, September 12   14, 1993 at a hotel near the Goddard Space Flight Center.  The meeting is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas on networking to support interdisciplinary research.  Funding will support the cost of participant travel, meals, and meeting arrangements.  The project is directly related to the interest of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate in that CISE is actively supporting programs to enhance the opportunities of underrepresented population in the computer field.  Access to adequate facilities, and the interchange made available by the network connections is an important aspect of this effort, and the program of the workshop should enhance the opportunities of the participants. ***",
