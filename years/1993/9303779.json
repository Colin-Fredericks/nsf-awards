 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303779  E       The investigator studies two problems in fluid flow. (1).  Statistical behavior of two dimensional turbulence.  There are  two major problems in this area.  The first is concerned with the  spatial (scaling) behavior and the second the temporal scaling  behavior.  Classical theory attempts to answer these questions  via Kolmogorov-like arguments.  Recently this classical picture  is challenged by a combination of very detailed numerical and  analytical results of E and Majda.  The investigator continues  this study to establish an alternative picture for 2D turbulence.  (2). Mathematical and numerical problems for incompressible flows  in the presence of boundaries.  In particular, the  investigator studies the separation of boundary layers and the  approximation to Navier-Stokes equation before the separation.   Recently he has shown that in the presence of an adverse pressure  gradient the steady boundary layers have to separate and  separate self-similarly.  Now he takes up the unsteady Prandtl  equation, examining its validity in describing the boundary  layers in the zero-viscosity limit.  Previous results of Fife et.  al. are restricted to the class of solutions satisfying some  uniform bounds (independent of viscosity).  The existence of such  a class is in doubt.  On the numerical side, the investigator  studies numerical methods with vorticity boundary conditions  through the introduction of a simple model problem that captures  the essence of the full problem and is explicitly computable.   Such a program has already been carried out for the projection  method by E and Liu.       One can view both problems as preparation for  studying turbulence.  In reality, most turbulence is generated at  the fluid-solid boundary through friction.  Large-scale  computing offers another dimension for studying such problems.   But the efficient exploitation of this new dimension also  requires powerful numerical methods.  At the present time, even  the basic issues in formulating a nu merical method are unsettled  whenever boundaries are present.  Insight can be improved  drastically if simple representative models are introduced.  This  motivates the investigator's study and design of numerical  methods. Understanding of turbulence is a central problem in  applied mathematics, with broad scientific and technological  ramifications.  ***",
