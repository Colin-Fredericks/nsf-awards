 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the structures of weakly bound molecular                        complexes are to be investigated by means of high resolution                    Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy.  The project has six                  components: binary complexes containing 1) sulfur dioxide                       molecules, 2) water molecules, 3) cyclopropane molecules, and                   4) rare gas atoms; 5) complexes formed by three monomer                         molecules; and 6) high temperature investigations.  The                         complexes will be formed in the supersonic expansion into a                     vacuum of a high pressure mixture of component gases with a                     neutral carrier gas.  Through this expansion the complexes are                  also cooled to very low translational and rotational                            temperatures, about 10 degrees above the absolute zero.  The                    work will provide information on the structures and internal                    motions (dynamics) of the complexes, as well as on their                        electronic properties such as the electric dipole moment.  The                  results will provide fundamental information about the nature                   of weak interaction forces between molecules and on                             intermolecular potential functions, and will contribute to the                  data base needed to develop and test models and theories which                  can guide chemists and biochemists in how compounds can                         interact and grow into larger clusters.                                         %%%                                                                             The clusters which will be studied constitute a state of matter                 that is intermediate between that of the dilute gas and the                     condensed phase and play a crucial role in condensation and                     evaporation phenomena.  Weak intermolecular forces also play a                  decisive role in the structure and function of biological                       systems, in which parts of a biological molecule interact with                  other parts to give it a structure characteristic of its                        function. Fundamental investigations on intermolecular forces                   as conducted in this research will also contribute to the data                  base on which the theories for the prediction of new                            biochemical substances can be tested and calibrated.",
