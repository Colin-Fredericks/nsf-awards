 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric frontal zones, the transition zone between                     relatively warm and cold air masses, are highly turbulent.  In the              this zone, kinetic energy is dissipated and internal waves are                  generated which may result in severe convective activity or                     turbulence far from the front.  Both of these processes have                    implications for atmospheric predictability.                                         The principal investigator will employ two approaches in the               study of frontal zones.  He will analyze observations taken during              a recent field program designed to investigate frontal processes                known as STORM-FEST, and will use wavelet decomposition as his                  principal analysis tool.  He will also conduct a number of modeling             experiments with the goal of isolating the physical processes                   important for frontal evolution.                                                     Many of the important physical processes that govern the                   behavior of weather systems occur on scales which are not                       explicitly resolved in numerical prediction models.  The ultimate               goal of this study is to provide information which will allow the               development of representations of such and, thereby, improve                    numerical weather forecasts.",
