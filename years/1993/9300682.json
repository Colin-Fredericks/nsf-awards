 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project conducts studies in steel-concrete composite                       structural systems which are becoming more prevalent in building                frame construction today.  A common type of composite structure                 is a steel frame with composite primary columns.  This combines                 the advantages of a light-weight, ductile steel frame with the                  added stiffness of steel-concrete composite columns to control                  lateral drift.  The focus of this research is on the performance                of connections to concrete-filled tube columns.  An inelastic                   seismic analysis of building frames, an inelastic finite element                analysis of the specific details and experimentation of critical                connections are carried out.                                                                                                                                    The current limited practices of these composite elements and                   provide guidelines for the safe and economical design of                        connection details are assessed.  Connections with elements that                penetrate the steel tube and steel-to-steel connections to the                  exterior of the tube wall are investigated.  Several detailing                  issues are considered, including: embedment length of members                   without shear connectors, required thickness of the tube wall in                the area of the beam-to-column joint, required vs. available                    bonding between the steel tube and concrete core, creep and                     shrinkage of the concrete core, and crushing of the concrete and                buckling of the tube wall at the connection.                                                                                                                    It is expected that results from this research will stimulate                   wide-spread interest in the design community.  Composite                        construction has many advantages over the more traditional                      structural systems, and this research will be the first step in                 making concrete-filled steel tube columns more feasible and                     practical for future use.",
