 "awd_abstract_narration": "Circadian rhythms are an adaptation of organisms to the regular                 daily change of their environment.  Although much is known about                the formal properties of circadian rhythms which allow them to                  synchronize to the daily light/dark cycles, almost nothing is known             about how these rhythms work on a biochemical level.  This project              is two-fold.  First, the simplest organism now known to express                 circadian rhythms will be used namely, prokaryotic cyanobacteria.               Second, genetic tools will be used to analyze its mechanism.  A                 reporter gene encoding a bioluminescence enzyme has been attached               to an endogenous promoter.  Not only does this construct make these             cyanobacteria bioluminescent, the glow meets all of the salient                 criteria of circadian rhythmicity.  This is the first \"artificial\"              overt rhythm of a circadian clock yet described.  This unique case              of circadian gene expression is being exploited to: (1) identify by             action spectroscopy the photoreceptor involved in the clock's                   entrainment; (2) analyze the control pathway by which the circadian             clock regulates this \" artificial\" rhythm; and (3) search for genes             which are involved in the clock's central mechanism.                            %%%                                                                             Using a simple bacterial system should accelerate the                           identification of cellular mechanisms by which daily rhythms.  Dr.              Golden is collaborating  with Dr. Carl Johnson of Vanderbilt                    University on this project.",
