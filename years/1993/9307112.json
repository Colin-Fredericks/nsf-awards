 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the hallmarks of a eukaryotic lifestyle is that RNA is                distributed unequally among cellular compartments.  Highly                      regulated mechanisms exist for the temporal and spatial assignment              of specific RNA molecules to particular nuclear and cytoplasmic                 domains.  Intricate cellular machinery accurately sorts,                        distributes, targets, and anchors the RNA to its final destination.             This asymmetric sorting of RNA and protein underlies the classical              embryological concept of cytoplasmic localization, whereby cell                 fate is specified by the region of egg cytoplasm inherited.  Recent             studies indicate that the nonrandom distribution of messenger RNA               and protein may be intrinsically generated by the egg cytoskeleton.             Similarly, in differentiated cells, the cytoskeleton may provide an             asymmetric framework for the regional distribution of mRNA and                  perhaps the functional specification of cellular processes such as              dendrites, axons, or lamellipodia.  Each of the major cytoskeletal              structures --- microtubules, intermediate filaments, and                        microfilaments --- have been implicated in the general process of               mRNA localization.  One approach to understanding how and why the               translational machinery interacts with the cytoskeleton is to                   biochemically purify and reconstitute ribosomes and other                       translational factors with mRNA and a single cytoskeletal element.              Progress towards realizing this goal has been made with the in                  vitro assembly and isolation of a polyribosome -poly(A)+RNA-                    microtubule complex from sea urchin eggs and embryos.  The goal of              this pilot study is to test the hypotheses that the mRNAs in these              complexes code for microtubule-associated proteins and that the                 polysomes are targeted to microtubules via nascent polypeptides                 with microtubule-binding domains at their amino termini.                        %%%                                                                             There is a long and controversial history of observations of                    messenger RNA association with cytoskeletal elements in various                 cell types (including mammalian cells, higher plant cells, and                  invertebrate cells).  These observations have been difficult to                 interpret due to problems of potential artifacts arising from the               methods employed to study the phenomena.  The approach to be used               in this pilot study, using in vitro techniques and highly purified              components, will allow the stated hypothesis to be tested while                 avoiding some of the artifacts that plagued earlier approaches to               the problem.   Because of the controversy surrounding the general               field of study, and the degree of risk in this pilot project, a                 Small Grant for Exploratory Research is an appropriate funding                  mechanism for the project.",
