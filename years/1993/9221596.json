 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted on the structural and                    thermodynamic properties of complex, partially ordered materials.               Two types of materials, quasicrystalline alloys and ferrofluids,                will be described by models which capture the most relevant                     energetic and geometrical constraints, while remaining simple                   enough to perform accurate, analytic calculations of statistical                properties.                                                                                                                                                     Quasicrystals, a common but complex structure type in intermetallic             alloys, appear to be intermediate between conventional crystals and             metallic glass.  Employing geometrical tiling models as a shorthand             description of real atomic positions, the phase diagram and phase               transitions among equilibrium structures will be investigated as                functions of interactions, composition and temperature.                                                                                                         Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of microscopic permanent                  magnets.  In addition to technological applications, these                      materials are of intrinsic scientific interest because they provide             an approximate realization of a dipolar hard sphere fluid.  This                work will establish the nature of phases between the dilute                     isotropic gas and the close-packed magnetically ordered solid.                  %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted on the basic properties of               two partially ordered complex materials.  Quasicrystals, which were             discovered over a decade ago in certain intermetallic alloys,                   remain a mystery as to the mechanisms which produce this unusual                structure.  Ferrofluids, artificial magnetic materials with many                applications, are interesting on a fundamental basis and as a real              material system.  Both of these fascinating materials will be                   studied using the latest techniques in statistical physics and                  computational science.",
