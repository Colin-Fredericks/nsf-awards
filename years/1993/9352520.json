The ROV is  receiving a wide interdisciplinary use in the education of  students across the breadth of the institution.  Technological  development in new areas such as ocean exploration requires the  training of engineers and scientists with capabilities to  adequately attack new and challenging problems.  Similarly,  major future breakthroughs in all areas of oceanography will be  made by detailed understanding of ecosystems and their  interrelationships.  An important role in this effort and in  the development of appropriate undergraduate curricula is being  played by the selective sampling and inspection capabilities  provided by vehicles such as this ROV.  The equipment and  facilities necessary to support the proposed ROV operations  include the Ship Hydrodynamics Laboratory (SHL) and the  University of Michigan's Research Vessel Laurentian which  operates in the Great Lakes as part of the NSF/UNOLS Fleet.  ***",
