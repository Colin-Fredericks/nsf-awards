The stated                                       objectives of this joint meeting are to improve                                 our knowledge of economic, political and socio-                                 cultural effects of international labor migration                               on the Maghrib as well as reinforce and extend an                               international and interdisciplinary network of                                  American and Maghribi scholars that will endure                                 beyond the project.  This project partially                                     supports the participation of approximately six                                 U.S. and 18 North African scientists.                                           Participants will present papers that will be                                   compiled and published as a conference volume.                                                                                                                  This conference/workshop in social science                                      fulfills the program objective of advancing                                     scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts                                in the United States and North Africa to combine                                complementary talents and present research                                      results in areas of strong mutual interest and                                  competence.  This activity has an educational and                               outreach effort that has the potential for                                      generating new scientific activity and new                                      international linkages.",
