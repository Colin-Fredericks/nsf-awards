 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316130  RIERDAN    On May 15, 1993, three gunmen robbed a restaurant and held ten  people hostage.  The hostages were bound and gagged and, with guns  held to their heads, their lives were threatened.  Although the  hostages were not physically harmed, their terrifying ordeal lasted  for almost two hours.  The willingness of the hostages and their  families to participate in this research study provides a rare  opportunity to examine memory for an extraordinarily stressful  personal event that occurred in a natural context.  The hostages  will be interviewed about their memories of the robbery at two time  periods, one month and six months following the event.  Hostages  will be asked to recount the event in their own terms.  Then, they  will be asked a series of specific questions about the robbery,  including information about the gunmen, other hostages, and the  rescue.  Finally, they will be asked about their own psychological  reactions to the event, including persisting visual or sensory  images, feelings, and thoughts.  Hostages also will complete  several personality tests.  Memory accuracy will be evaluated by  comparing hostages' reports to available objective information  about the robbery.  Memory consistency will be evaluated by  comparing event descriptions provided by the different hostages,  and also by comparing individual hostages' memories across the two  time periods.  Memory integration, the degree to which the memory  has been incorporated into a stable sense of self, will also be  assessed.  Relationships between memory and personality test scores  will be examined in order to determine if certain psychological  attributes make it easier for a person to integrate the memory of  a horrifying event into his or her ongoing life and sense of self.  In addition to the hostages themselves, one male and one female  member of each hostage's family will be interviewed.  The  interviews will assess the family members' memories of learning  about the robbery from the hostages.  The  family members also will  complete several personality tests.  As with the hostages'  memories, the accuracy, consistency, and organization of family  members' memories will be evaluated.  In addition, family members'  own psychological reactions to the hostages' trauma will be  assessed.  This study is unique in examining memories of both the  people directly experiencing a life-threatening event and also  their close family members. Evaluating memories of an  extraordinarily stressful event will not only inform the scientific  study of basic cognitive processes, it should also deepen our  understanding of the psychological processes affecting eyewitness  testimony and successful adaptation to life-threatening events.    ***",
