 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glucocorticoids, a family of steroid hormones secreted primarily                by the adrenal glands, bind selectively to protein receptors in                 the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the formation of new                memories.  Both the pyramidal cells of the CA1 region and granule               cells of dentate gyrus within the hippocampal structure show                    extensive hormone binding, much higher than the rest of the                     brain.  These steroids are normally secreted at basal levels                    unless elevated during times of stress.  Chronic elevations of                  physiological glucocorticoids, for example during prolonged                     stress, have been shown to have deleterious effects on pyramidal                cells of the hippocampus and this is alleviated by removal of the               adrenals.  Long-term adrenalectomy is not without cost to the                   hippocampus, however, since this treatment causes loss of granule               cells in the dentate gyrus.  Thus, in selective regions of the                  hippocampus, basal levels of glucocorticoids actually protect the               cells from dying.  Dr. Roy will characterize the anatomical                     changes that occur to the dentate gyrus following adrenalectomy.                Furthermore, since this is a critical brain region for learning                 and memory, he will correlate changes in the anatomy with                       performance in tests of spatial memory.  The results will not                   only yield vitally significant information about the basic                      function of glucocorticoids in neuronal survival and cell death,                but will also define its behavioral consequences when this                      protective effect of hormones is removed.  Information about the                basic processes underlying the death of subpopulations of brain                 cells as well as the mechanisms that prevent cell death in a                    healthy brain may impact greatly on our appreciation and                        treatment of such brain disorders as caused by stroke,                          Alzheimer's disease, and the normal aging process.",
