The                               information on dynamics will be obtained by                                     analyzing line shapes of ESR spectra of spin                                    labels and/or spin probes incorporated in the                                   polymer systems; the phase structure will be                                    characterized by both ESR and DSC data.  An ESR                                 imaging system will be used to gain a spatial                                   resolution of ESR data.                                                                                                                                         This research in materials research fulfills the                                program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S.                               and Czech Republic to combine complementary                                     talents and pool research resources in areas of                                 strong mutual interest and competence.  Funds for                               the project are awarded through the US-Czech                                    Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance with                                          established guidelines.",
