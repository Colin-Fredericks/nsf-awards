 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310403 Collins          The use of plasma and beam processing of materials is ibiquitous in the manufacture of semiconductors and integrated circuits.  Plasma processing is also continuouslu elvolving due to the changing needs of modern devices.  Nevertheless, plasma processing of optoelectronic, magnetic, and microelectronic devices is absent from the curricula of many universities.  An elective undergraduate or first year graduate coourse, \"Plasma and Beam Induced Chemisty for Materials Processing will be developed\".  It will emphasize the fundamentals of plama based processing (etchinng, deposition, ashing) and yet be technically current with regard to manufacturing applications.  The course is intended for students about to enter the high technology micro /optoelectronics workforce as well as for practicing engineers.  Dissemination and deployment of the new course to other universities as  well as industry will occur via the preparation of transportable instuctional materials including high quality lecture handout, videotaped lectures whih are highly correlated.  Hence, students on campus as well as at remote sites can easily follow the lectures.  The  pedagogy will be improved by 1) transforming the hard copy lecture handoutsss into a set of disk based notes (which can be continually updated), and 2) computer enhancement of the videotaped lctures to include animation, graphial display of mathermatical operations, and digitized video and photographs of plasma processing tools and results from these processes.  The fully developed course will be disseminated via conventional videotapes and satellite transmission through the National Technololgy University.",
