 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes studies on cellular components that are                 involved in harvesting the energy of sunlight and making that                   energy useful for the production of sugars and carbohydrates in                 the cell.  The organism being investigated is in the group of                   algae known as diatoms and is named Phaeodactylum tricornutum.                  Diatoms are very abundant in both marine and fresh water                        environments.  In fact, these organisms may be responsible for as               much as 20% of the total CO2  fixation on the earth.  We have                   been studying both the structure of the light harvesting                        polypeptides of Phaeodactylum and the way in which they are                     targeted from the cytoplasm of the cell to their final location                 in the cell plastid, an extremely important organelle specialized               to perform photosynthesis.  By understanding how proteins can be                specifically placed into different subcellular compartments like                the plastid, we may be able to control both the constituents and                the levels of specific constituents that are located in those                   compartments.  This may prove very important in increasing the                  photosynthetic capabilities of organisms and ultimately in                      culturing these organisms in 'ocean field' (aquaculture) for the                production of feed for livestock.",
