 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neighborhood models of plant competition have recently proved of                considerable use in predicting consequences of local interference               to plant population dynamics.  In tropical forests, competition is              but one of several kinds of local interaction thought to be                     important; others significant interactions include the effects of               \"natural enemies\" on growth and survivorship of conspecific trees               (the \"Janzen-Connell effect\"), and local pollen limitation of                   reproductive output in obligately outcrossing species (a form of                \"Allee effect\").  This research will develop general neighborhood               models that incorporate competitive interactions as well as Janzen-             Connell and Allee-type interactions in tropical tree populations.               Empirical analyses and simulation studies will make use of                      extensive data sets available from 50 hectare forest plots at Barro             Colorado Island, Panama and at Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia.  An              important facet of developing these models will be a focus on                   dioecious tree species.  The fact that female trees produce seed,               while male trees do not, provides an unexplored aspect of spatial               analyses aimed at elucidating patterns of seed dispersal, and for               detecting and measuring Janzen-Connell and Allee-type interactions.             It is expected the models will be particular useful in predicting               consequences of habitat fragmentation on tropical tree populations.             %%%                                                                             Spatial interactions in tropical forests have received relatively               little research attention.  A variety of hypothesized mechanisms                has been advanced for explaining the maintenance of tree species                diversity in tropical forests, including niche partitioning on                  edaphic gradients, Janzen-Connell effects, \"regeneration niche\"                 differences, demographic \"storage effects,\" and size structure                  effects but these potential mechanisms have generally been modeled              in isolation such that effects of interactions have been ignored.               Recognition of this shortcoming in previous models may represent                the best hope of addressing predicted responses of rainforest trees             to habitat fragmentation and other massive anthropogenic changes in             the forested tropics.",
