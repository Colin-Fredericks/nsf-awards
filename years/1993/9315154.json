The seminar, which will be held March 12 14, 1995 in San Diego, CA, is being co organized by Professor Thomas Mallouk, Department of Chemistry, Pennsylvania State University, and Professor Kohei Uosaki, Department of Chemistry, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.  The seminar will focus on recent advances in the fundamental science of light dirven electron transfer at semiconductor surfaces, and new applications of semiconductor photochemistry.  Seminar sessions will be organized around themes of fundamental studies of charge transfer, photoelectrochemistry, photosensitization and photocatalysis, new materials and devices, and novel applications of semiconductors.  Understanding electron transfer and chemical reactivity at the interface between semiconductors and solutions is key not only to emerging energy conversion technologies, but also to a variety of newer applications including environmental remediation, microlithography, optical computing, and information storage.  Both the fundamental and applied sides of the problem are now the subject of intense research and development efforts in both countries.  The seminar will bring together U.S. and Japanese specialists from strong research programs to exchange information o n new developments in this field.",
