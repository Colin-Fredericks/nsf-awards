The properties of these clusters which                   are being studied include their structures, their stable and                    metastable photoexcitations, and their photofragmentation                       pathways.  These clusters may serve as models for solid                         semiconductor systems.                                                          %%%                                                                             The currently available computational methods for describing                    the electronic and geometric structures of molecules are in                     need of considerable improvement to make them both more                         accurate and reliable as well as cheaper to use.  This project                  involves just such advances, with applications to the study of                  gas-phase clusters comprised of carbon, silicon, gallium, or                    arsenic atoms.",
