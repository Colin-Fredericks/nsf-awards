 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mixed effects models are used with data where several  observations are made on each of several different subjects and  the observations are assumed to be generated by a model function.   Some of the parameters in the model function are assumed to be  common to all subjects (fixed effects) and some vary between  subjects (random effects).  The purpose of the analysis is to  estimate the fixed effects and characterize the distribution of  the random effects. Linear mixed effects models, in which all the  parameters occur linearly in the model function, provide an  explicit objective function to define maximum likelihood or  restricted maximum likelihood estimates.  We will investigate  properties of these estimates including the asymptotic  uncorrelation of the fixed effects and the variance-covariance of  the random effects.  This work includes determining effective  parameterizations of the variance-covariance of the random  effects.  Using this we can assess the effectiveness of the  two-stage algorithm for nonlinear mixed effects models proposed  by Lindstrom and Bates.  The type of mathematical modelling which statisticians call  \"mixed effects\" has been widely applied in pharmacokinetics, the  study of the rate at which the body absorbs and eliminates drugs.   This statistical tool allows, a pharmacologist to build a  mathematical model of the pharmacokinetics of a drug in the  \"average\" person, then update that model with a few concentration  measurements on a particular person.  In this way, we augment  limited information on the individual with general information  about the population to establish more accurate dosage schedules.   This saves both time and money.  We will be developing  statistical techniques to make the development of mixed effects  models easier and more accurate.",
