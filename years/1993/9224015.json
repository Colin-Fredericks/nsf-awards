This professional development  fellowship will enable a social scientist who has been studying  these developments to gain training and experience in the  neurosciences and coordinate that training with study of the  historical evolution and institutionalization of neuroscience.  She  will use this background to complete research on the connections  between the development and directions of this scientific field and  its consequences for various social groups.  The award provides for  tutorials, coursework, and laboratory work under the guidance of  the neuroscience faculty at the Johns Hopkins University.  It also  allows the awardee to interview a number of the past presidents of  the Society for Neuroscience.  At the conclusion of this period,  she intends to have a detailed chapter outline for a monograph on  autonomy and power in the neurosciences.  ***",
