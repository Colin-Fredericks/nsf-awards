 "awd_abstract_narration": "Voltage-sensitive sodium channels are responsible for the rising                phase of the action potential in excitable cells, including central             and peripheral neurons, heart, skeletal muscle and neuroendocrine               cells.  Sodium channels in brain are heterotrimeric complexes                   composed of alpha, beta-1 and beta-2 subunits, while sodium                     channels in heart and skeletal muscle are heterodimeric, composed               of alpha and beta-1-like subunits.  The structure of sodium c                   channels in neuroendocrine cells has not been identified.  Previous             work by this investigator has resulted in the molecular cloning and             functional expression of the beta-1 subunit of the rat brain sodium             channel.  Co-expression of cloned beta-1 subunits with alpha                    subunits in Xenopus oocytes results in increased peak current,                  acceleration of inactivation, and a shift in the voltage dependence             of inactivation to more negative membrane potentials.  It is                    hypothesized that the level of expression and functional properties             of sodium channels in excitable cells depends not only on the                   expression and properties of alpha subunits but also on the                     expression and functional interaction with beta subunits.  The goal             of these studies is to identify the sodium channel alpha and beta               subunits that are expressed in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells               by hybridization to known alpha and beta subunits, determine the                structure of chromaffin cell beta subunits by molecular cloning and             assess the role of beta subunits in chromaffin cell sodium channel              functional expression, including stimulus-secretion coupling .                  Methods to be employed include:  1) molecular cloning of chromaffin             cell sodium channel beta subunits, 2) identification of chromaffin              cell sodium channel alpha subunits by hybridization studies, 3)                 blockade of chromaffin cell sodium channel beta subunit expression              in vitro through the use of antisense RNA or antisense                          oligonucleotides and in vivo through the use of gene disruption                 experiments, and 4) overexpression of chromaffin cell sodium                    channel beta subunits by transfection in vitro and by transgenic                expression in vivo.                                                             %%%                                                                             Voltage-sensitive sodium channels are an important component of the             mechanism  by which excitable cells respond to and transmit                     signals.  Examples of excitable cells include nerve cells, muscle               cells and neuroendocrine cells.  Sodium channels are composed of                subunits.  The subunit composition of sodium channels differs in                different cell types.  The subunit structure of sodium channels in              neuroendocrine cells, such as chromaffin cells of the adrenal                   medulla, has not been determined.  These studies will use                       techniques of molecular biology to identify the sodium channel                  subunits that are expressed in adrenal medullary chromaffin cells               and assess their role in chromaffin cell function.",
