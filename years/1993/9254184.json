 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on experience in programs to upgrade the educational                   background of personnel working in industry, Dutchess Community                 College will develop an integrated curriculum which could                       become a certificate program in basics for industrial                           technicians.  A faculty team will develop a single, unified                     course integrating elements from what are currently separate                    courses in introductory mathematics, chemistry, physics,                        English and reading.  Modern manufacturing will be used as the                  integrating theme.  The project will significantly change the                   undergraduate learning experience through the employment of new                 curricula, innovative laboratories, new delivery systems, and                   fresh instructional materials.  It is hoped that the project                    will be a blueprint for the development of an industrial                        technology certificate granting program which could be                          replicated by other institutions of higher education,                           particularly technical colleges.",
