 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309393  Allman    One of the many mysteries of human perception is that after seeing  random contours linked together just a few times, observers cannot  help but see them as a whole, even when they are later unlinked.  These illusory contours have been called \"cognitive\" contours  because they exist only in the mind, not in the stimulus. With this  new three year grant from NSF, Dr. Allman will investigate the  neural basis of this phenomenon. In pilot work, he has found that  animals develop the ability to see these cognitive contours as  rapidly as humans. He has thus created a completely novel paradigm  for the study of perceptual learning. He will now record in visual  cortex to search for the actual neuronal changes that occur during  the formation of the perceptual illusion. He will thus be able to  describe the neurobiological correlates of a perceptual phenomenon,  making this a first attempt to describe events at the mind/brain  interface.             ***",
