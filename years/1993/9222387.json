 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will provide theoretical investigations of several                areas which are crucial to the emerging class of wide bandgap                   semiconductor compounds comprised of group three-nitrides.  A range             of basic properties, including the electronic transport and optical             properties of aluminum nitride, gallium nitride and indium nitride,             will be calculated by means of first-principles methods.                        Calculations of the dependence of the electronic properties on                  strain and optical phonon distortions will provide information                  needed in the modeling of high temperature transport.  The optical              response functions and other spectroscopic information will be                  calculated for both the zincblende and the wurtzite forms.  The                 nitrogen vacancy, an important defect for the quality of the                    material, will be investigated.  The project will study the                     corresponding properties for ternay alloy systems composed of                   aluminum and gallium, and indium and gallium with nitrogen, as well             as the pseudo-binary alloy of silicon carbide with aluminum                     nitride.  This part of the work will make use of appropriate                    statistical models in the treatment of disorder.  The optical                   properties of small period superlattices and the band-offsets of                heterostructures will be studied.  The work is expected to have a               significant impact on the characterization efforts of material                  produced by novel growth techniques currently under development.                This will assist the development of opto-electronic devices                     operating at short wavelengths and at high temperatures.                        %%%                                                                             Computationally intensive research will be conducted in order to                calculate the properties of a new class of semiconductor compounds              which have the potential for many applications.  These complex                  materials, which are based on the nitrides, are particularly useful             for their optical properties in addition to their electronic ones.              Also, these are hard materials which can function at high                       temperatures.  Thus, applications requiring opto-electronic devices             operating at high temperatures will benefit.",
