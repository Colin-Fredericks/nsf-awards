This network in cooperation with sixteen (16) Illinois                     colleges and universities (Aurora University, College of Saint                  Francis, Illinois Central College, Knox College, Lewis                          University, Monmouth College, Moraine Valley Community College,                 National-Louis University, North Central College, Rockford                      College, Roosevelt University, Rosary College, Saint Xavier                     College, Southern Illinois University Medical School Library,                   University of Health Sciences/ The Chicago Medical School, and                  William Rainey Harper College) requests support to connect these                institutions to netIllinois.  The requested connections will                    support connectivity to netIllinois,m CICNET, NSFNET, and the                   greater Internet.  It will also provide access to state,                        regional, and national computing resources and databases; and                   foster communication and collaboration among teachers, students,                scholars, and researchers at these institutions and their peers                 within the worldwide education and research community.                               The network will provide a consistent statewide architecture               for NSFNET access for a broad variety of entities engaged in                    education and research.  This cooperative network will provide                  gateways to regional, national, and international networks and                  will be consistent with their standards.  It will further the                   institutions' work in enhancing the state's economic development                through a well-educated workforce, accessible training                          opportunities, and research and development partnerships.                       Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative                      projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including               those outside the state.",
