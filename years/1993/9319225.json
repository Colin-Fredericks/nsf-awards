 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319225  Martis    This project creates a relational database on congressional  history, 1788-1992, that permits secholars, for the first time, to  use easily an unprecedented range of variables pertaining to  congressional careers, committees, elections, party and roll call  voting, presidential relations, and workload.  Some of the material  to be contained in the new database is now archived in separate  Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research  databases; other major aspects will be newly created.  What is  truly path-breaking about the project, however, is not only the  range and scope of the data, but its relational structure.   Scholars will be able to link easily data on different  congressional dimensions, facilitating the study of their  interrelationship in ways that until now have been virtually  impossible.  Project participants will apply this data to their own  research on the development of congressional careers; the  institutional impact of party realignments; the institutional  effects of elections; the development of congressional-presidential  relations; and the potential of national legislatures to resolve  sectional conflict.  These are but a few examples of the various  kinds of topics scholars will be able to undertake more easily and  more comprehensively.  ***",
