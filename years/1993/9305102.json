The Conference will be                 sponsored by the International Committee on Natural Zeolites and                the State University of New York, College at Brockport.  Between                200 and 250 participants are expected from more than 30 countries.              Zeolite '93 will bring together geologists, mineralogists, surface              chemists, crystallographers, mining engineers, sanitary engineers,              agricultural engineers, petroleum engineers, chemical engineers,                agronomists, horticulturalists, animal scientists,                              aquaculturalists, and marketing specialists to discuss the latest               scientific findings and activities in the growing field of natural              zeolites.  The Conference will comprise four days of technical                  sessions, a mid-week, all-participant field excursion to a major                zeolite deposit in southwestern Idaho, and a three-day, post-                   conference optional field trip to important zeolite deposits in                 eastern Oregon.  Invited symposia will be held each morning on the              most significant areas of zeolite research, followed by afternoon               poster presentations of all submitted papers, unopposed by other                technical activities.                                                                                                                                                Zeolite '93 will treat all scientific and technological aspect             of natural zeolites--their diagenesis in volcanogenic sedimentary               formations, their occurrence in pore spaces in petroleum                        reservoirs, their basic crystal structure and mineralogical                     character, and their structure-controlled ion-exchange, adsorption,             hydration-dehydration, and catalytic properties.  The basic science             behind many of the recently developed applications for these                    materials will be discussed, including their use as slow-release                carriers of nitrogen for plant growth; as dietary supplements in                animal nutrition; as filters of ammonium from potable water and                 municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewaters; as                         demineralizes for radioactive cesium and strontium in nuclear                   effluents and spills; as barriers in nuclear-waste containment; as              exchangers to remove lead, cadmium, and copper from drinking water,             industrial effluents, and mining and milling wastes; as ammonia                 sorbents for pet litters and feedlot manures; as deodorizers in                 refrigerators and medical facilities; and as substrate in soilless              agriculture, so-called zeoponics.",
