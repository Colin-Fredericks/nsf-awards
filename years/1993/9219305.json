 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the morphological and biochemical                        specialization demonstrated by the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe               grisea.  Asexual spores of M. grisea attach to plant surfaces,                  initiate growth through the emergence of a germ tube, and                       differentiate an infection structure called an appressorium (1).                The appressorium is a specialized cell capable of generating                    enormous turgor pressures that facilitate the direct penetration                of the plant epidermis (2).  Large, swollen, infectious hyphae                  rapidly appear within and between plant cells (3).  Finally,                    surface borne conidiophores produce numerous asexual spores to                  reinitiate the disease cycle.  The goal of this research is to                  understand the biochemical events that key disease-related                      morphogenesis in M. grisea.  Genetic and biochemical investigations             can identify components in this process that could elucidate                    central processes in fungal cell morphogenesis and may provide                  strategies for the development of novel disease control measures.               Previous investigations identified a genetic locus termed SMO1 (4).             Phenotypic analysis suggests that the SMO gene product plays a                  central role in establishing the polarity of cell growth and                    morphogenesis in particular disease-related cell types of M. grisea             and thus Smo-mutations reduce pathogenicity towards rice.                       Additionally, mutations at this locus occur at a high frequency in              certain genetic backgrounds of M. grisea.  The SMO locus has been               cloned by a novel mapped based cloning procedure developed by this              laboratory for M. grisea.  The studied have demonstrated that SMO               is closely linked to chromosomal duplication.  To advance the                   understanding of the SMO locus and its relationship to fungal                   growth and disease-related morphogenesis, three related                         experimental strategies will be used: (1) A fine structure analysis             of the SMO locus and smo-minus. (2) Cytological and biochemical                 identification of the SMO protein and more refined characterization             of the duplication around the SMO locus. (3) The isolation and                  characterization of additional mutations affecting disease-related              morphogenesis in M. grisea.                                                     %%%                                                                             The fungus Magnaporthe grisea is an economically significant                    pathogen of rice.  The goal of this research is to increase our                 understanding of the process by which this fungus undergoes the                 structural changes necessary to initiate an infection.  The                     investigator will be studying a gene which he has already shown to              function in the development by the fungus of a specialized                      infection structure and will identify and characterize other                    mutations affecting morphogenesis related to the infection process.",
