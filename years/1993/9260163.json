 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of materials chemistry and in the subfield of               organometallic chemistry.  The thrust of this activity is to                    experimentally test the feasibility of designing novel                          unimolecular source reagents that will enable the deposition of                 titanium nitride (TiN) by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at                    temperatures below 500 degrees C without contamination by                       chlorine, carbon, or particulates.  TiN is rapidly becoming an                  important material as a barrier layer in very large scale                       integration (VLSI) direct random access memories (DRAMs), as an                 antireflection coating and as a \"glue\" layer between noble metals               and silicon dioxide in both memory and logic devices.  The TiN                  CVD precursors identified for evaluation represent a novel                      alternative to the present physical vapor deposition technology                 which, because of the high temperature required, is unsuitable for              device fabrication as device features shrink to ultra large scale               integration (ULSI) dimensions.  In this size domain, CVD will be                the manufacturing method of choice.  Unfortunately, no TiN                      precursors presently exist that allow CVD of TiN at low                         temperatures without contamination problems.                                    %%%                                                                             In this SBIR Phase I research, Advanced Technology Materials                    should demonstrate the feasibility of the synthesis and utility of              the proposed new unimolecular CVD source reagents for the low                   temperature, contaminant-free production of TiN.  The successful                identification of such precursors would allow for their                         demonstration in full scale memory device fabrication in Phase II               and to be rapidly commercialized in Phase III.",
