 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each year for three years, 40 teachers of high school                           psychology will be chosen to attend a four week workshop at                     the University of Houston.  The workshop has a multiplicity                     of components where each of the teachers would learn about                      psychology, educational theory and research, aiding the                         development of effective demonstrations and teaching                            techniques, and fostering communication between high school                     and college teachers.  Over the course of the next two                          years, each teacher will agree to complete a research                           project in some particular area of psychology.  Each teacher                    is expected to access an electronic network where a five to                     ten page update will be posted at least once each month.                        These updates will be prepared initially by the faculty of                      the University of Houston and Western Carolina University,                      but will be broadened in succeeding years to include faculty                    from other universities.                                                                                                                                        The cost share of this project represents 21.3% of the grant                    request.",
