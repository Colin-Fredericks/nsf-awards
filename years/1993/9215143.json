 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior research in modeling software failure rates has  been based on mathematical models of hardware reliability.  These models do not reflect the measurable, internal  characteristics of the software systems.  One measurable  characteristic of software, its complexity, has been shown to  correlate well with measures of software failure.  Thus,  incorporating software complexity measures into existing  reliability models provides substantial improvement in  their accuracy.  Creating a mathematical model of software reliability is  similar to creating a hypothesis for a scientific experiment:  the model must be validated through experimentation.  In this  research, data collected during the development of the Space  Shuttle onboard flight systems provides an experimental  project in which the hypothesized reliability models are  studied.  One of the most important aspects in the comparison  of different reliability models is their predictive quality.  The goal of software reliability modeling is to predict the  future failure behavior of software using past and present  data.  New reliability models with relative and functional  complexity are compared to existing models in terms of their  predictive quality and quality of fit.",
