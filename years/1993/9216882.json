 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dissolved copper in surface seawater in many locations exists                   primarily in complexes with strong organic ligands, which are                   distinguished by their complexing strengths.  However, these                    ligands have never been isolated and characterized;  thus, almost               nothing is known about their chemical nature.  Isolation and                    characterization of these ligands is extremely important to our                 understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of copper and the                   ligands themselves, and perhaps that of other metals which may be               similarly complexed.  Recently, immobilized metal (Cu2+) affinity               chromatography (IMAC) has been used to purify extracellular copper-             binding proteins produced by marine bacteria, and also to isolate               and partially characterize organic compounds with affinity for                  copper from estuarine, coastal, and open ocean waters.  IMAC-                   isolated ligands have depth distributions similar to those of                   ligands that strongly complex Cu in the Atlantic and Pacific.  This             pilot project will determine whether IMAC, using either established             or modified protocols, can isolate these ligands, ligands detected              in seawater by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry                  (DPASV) and ligand competition/differential pulse cathodic                      stripping voltammetry (LC/DPCSV).  The appropriate IMAC protocol                will then be used in conjunction with DPASV and LC/DPCSV to                     characterize the ligands in coastal surface seawater with respect               to:  their concentrations, conditional stability constants,                     relative proportions of protein and polysaccharide comprising them,             and molecular weight.",
