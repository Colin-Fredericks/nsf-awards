 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests request support for U.S. scientists to              participate in a SCOPE sponsored workshop on Phosphorus Cycling in              Terrestrial and Aquatic Systems.   The goal of the workshop is to               collect and integrate data, concepts and models on phosphorus                   cycles in a global context.  In addition, a symposium will be held              during the workshop with the aim to present integrative ecosystem               analyses on phosphorus inputs, transformations, transfers and                   losses in Hungary.  The Hungarian analysis will focus on three                  systems:  (1) The Balaton Lake basin, an inland closed watershed,               (2) The Danube, as an example of a major river system with                      pollutant phosphate inputs from intensive agriculture, major                    cities, and industries, that accumulate in its course through                   several countries with widely differing environmental protection                standards, and (3) Hungarian agriculture, which has been plagued by             inefficiencies of nutrient use and resultant off-site                           contaminations.                                                                 The global analysis is based on the results of 4 previous                       workshops, held in Europe, South America, Southeast Asia and                    Africa, and aims at the integration of knowledge across boundaries              of ecosystems and regions while exploring the links between                     phosphorus and other element cycles.                                            %%%                                                                             Both the global and Hungarian perspectives will be provided by                  recognized experts from several disciplines through presentations               and working groups with the following mandates:  (1)  To synthesize             chapters on the major cycles and transfers of phosphorus based on               prepared manuscripts and extensive discussion and review sessions               for the production of a book to be published by John Wiley in the               SCOPE series; (2) to develop concepts and models applicable across              ecosystems and test them against the Hungarian case studies; and                (3) to facilitate discussions and cooperation between Hungarian,                U.S., and other invited experts with the aim to foster future                   cooperation and provide guidelines for environmental planning.",
