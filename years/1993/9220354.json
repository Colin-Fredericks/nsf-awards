 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to gain an understanding of the                    social nature of Japanese quality control circles by examining                  the objectives, motivations, and attitudes of workers who                       participate in these circles.  Such circles group workers who are               responsible for the manufacture of a variety of items in a                      factory setting.  Their purpose is to provide management with                   suggestions to improve the quality and efficiency of production.                Previous studies have focused on how management organized such                  circles and the goals they established.  However, this study                    looks at such circles from the point of view of the workers and                 therefore seeks to determine whether worker goal's are in                       conflict with management and how management and workers negotiate               mutually beneficial relationships in the pursuit of commons                     goals.                                                                                                                                                          The research will provide valuable training in developing                       ethnographic research skills in Japan.",
