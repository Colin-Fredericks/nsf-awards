Two main objectives of this project  are to formulate neural network  controllers based on adaptive  critic designs and stochastic  representations of uncertain  nonlinear systems.  Hamiltonian and  its derivatives which occur in the  formulation of optimal control  problems are proposed in the  adaptive critic design.  A constant  network configuration controller  and an online-modified network  configuration controllers are  proposed based on neighboring  optimal control theory.  The  stochastic representations of a  plant are proposed to be based on  filtering theory.  Furthermore,  classes of problems are described  on which these network controllers  are proposed to be investigated.   It is hoped that the results of  this study will substantially  improve understanding of the  adaptive critic based neuro  controllers and the stochastic  neural network representations of  uncertain nonlinear systems.  ***",
