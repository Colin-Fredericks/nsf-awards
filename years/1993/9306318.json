 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support research in the analysis and                     development of algorithms for large-scale convex programming                    problems.  Two of the most versatile algorithms have been                       interior point methods and splitting methods based on the                       proximal point algorithm.  Specific areas of research will                      include:  (1) the interior point transformation, involving the                  analysis of the mapping in interior point methods that sends an                 interior feasible pair to its coordinatewise product; (2)                       infeasible interior point methods, including bridging the gap                   between the feasible and infeasible interior point methods; (3)                 convergence of the proximal point method, including the analysis                of the global and local convergence behavior of the proximal                    point method and its modifications; and (4) interior point                      methods for nonlinear problems, involving the development of                    practical interior point methods, especially primal-dual methods,               for special classes of nonlinear programs and monotone                          complementarity problems.                                                            Two of the most important modern algorithms for the                        numerical solution of large-scale convex programming problems                   have been interior point methods and proximal point methods.                    Both of these methods have had a major impact on modern numerical               solution techniques for problems that were previously thought to                be intractable because of their massive size.",
