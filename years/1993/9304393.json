 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304393  Gross    This project focuses on the regulation of binding of epidermal  growth factor (EGF) by its receptor (EGF-R).  The time course of  binding of a fluorescent derivative of EGF (f-EGF) to the EGF-R  will be studied at the level of single cells by the use of  quantitative optical microscopy.  Preliminary data indicates that  the binding of f-EGF to cultured A431 cells proceeds over a  biphasic time course that is not consistent with the commonly  accepted model of EGF/EGF-R in which two EGF-R affinity classes are  postulated to exist at fixed densities on the cell surface.  A  ternary complex model has been developed that is consistent with  the individual cell binding data.  It is proposed that actin/EGF-R  interaction through specific binding domains modulates the affinity  state of the receptor.  Recent studies have shown that the EGF-R is  an actin-binding protein.  Microinjection of HL-33, a peptide that  competes for the actin binding site with the EGF-R, will be used as  a probe of this interaction.  Preliminary f-EGF binding data to  individual A431 cells also indicates that the kinetics of binding  are variable between cells.  The consequences of this variable  timing and degree of primary signal input on subsequent individual  cell responses will also be examined by quantitative, single-cell  fluorescence imaging.  A consequence of the predicted interaction  of the EGF-R with actin is that some individual EGF-Rs will be  immobilized in the plasma membrane, and that the immobile receptors  will be preferentially of the high-affinity class.  Measurement of  the mobilities of individual EGF receptors on stimulated and  unstimulated cells forms an important test of the actin-regulation  model.  Single receptors will be labeled by biotinylated anti-  receptor Fab' fragments and fluorescent streptavidin-latex  nanoparticles or streptavidin-colloidal gold particles as  visualization probes.  The lateral mobility of individual EGF-Rs  will be followed before and during EGF challen ge, and will be  examined in individual cells microinjected with the HL-33 competing  peptide.  Correlations between individual EGF receptor movements  and the affinity state of the receptor will be examined.  The  lateral mobilities of individual EGF-Rs will be compared to those  for individual LDL receptors.  (The LDL receptor system is thus far  the only one in which individual receptor movements have been  described; in this system three classes of lateral movement were  characterized including random, directed, and no mobility.)  %%%  The goal of this research is to better understand the molecular  interactions between a cell surface protein that is known to  regulate cell growth, the epidermal growth factor receptor, and the  signal molecule that activates it, epidermal growth factor (EGF).   The interaction of these two molecules on individual cultured cells  will be studies using fluorescently labeled EGF and quantitative  optical microscopy.  The results of this study of the EGF receptor  system will add much to knowledge about molecular details of the  mechanism by which growth factors signal cells to divide.  ***",
