 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318076  Broering  The Georgetown University Medical Center Library will extend  multicampus network access to four teaching hospitals, Arlington  Hospital, DC General Hospital, DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center  and the Georgetown University Hospital.  The network will provide  faculty, staff, students and researchers with access to the  Library's Knowledge Network of databases, to the Internet system,  and to E-Mail services on the campus high speed network.  The  project will promote collaboration, sharing and information  exchange to support education and related patient care and  research.  It will facilitate Georgetown's goals to enhance  education at clinical rotation sites and to provide outreach  services in the community.  This proposed Internet link is a  logical step in sharing resources generated through the Integrated  Advanced Information Management System (IAIMS) project at  Georgetown.  The four project objectives are to   1.  Establish a network link to the affiliated teaching hospitals.  2.  Share resources, by providing access to the Library's Knowledge  Network of bibliographic informational, document delivery and full-  text databases.  3.  Provide access to the Internet to promote collaboration and  information exchange.  4.  Provide E-Mail services to students, residents and faculty to  improve communication in the learning process.  The network architecture will include routers, cables and modems  needed to install the link to each hospital.  The project will  include (1) a connection via leased telephone lines for Arlington  Hospital (2) a security controlled Internet connection for the  Georgetown University Hospital (3) dial-up access for initial  experimentation at DC General Hospital and the Veterans Affairs  Medical Center.  Georgetown will extend dial-up Internet access to  local practitioners. Library access is a major emphasis of the  project as the Knowledge Network's bibliographic, informational,  document delivery and full-text databases are a vital element  of  the clinical teaching programs.  The security control system to be  developed by the Georgetown University Hospital will be shared with  the participating hospitals as their network needs evolve.   Collaboration between the hospitals will emerge through the  teaching programs.  The project will benefit nearly 5,000 health  professionals at the four hospitals and over 1,000 Georgetown  students and residents.  Increased use of the network is envisioned  as the potential benefits are realized.",
