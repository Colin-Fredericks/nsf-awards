 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311357          The purpose of this project is to address the lack of instructional resources as the undergraduate level and to support the ongoing research and teaching efforts at the graduate level in the area of queueing network theory and applications.  Another major objective is to be better prepare students in the area of performance modeling using queueing networks, so that they can help industry to make effective use of performance analysis tools and packages in managing their operations.          The work will make a significant contribution to the preparation of students in the systems analysis and design area.  It will do so by bridging the gap between research and instruction in the area of performance modeling using queueing networks.  With exposure to recent developments in the performance analysis area, students will be able to help industry in making effective use of this technology.  Using currently available commercial software tools they can then help industry to remain competitive in the global environment.  With regard to engineering education, this effort will contribute to the attainment of a much needed science base for production or manufacturing systems design.  It also has the potential for greatly increasing the use of queueing theory in practice.",
