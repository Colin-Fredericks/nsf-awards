 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hydroperoxyl radical plays an important role in the                    photochemistry of both the troposphere and the stratosphere.  In                the troposphere, HO2 participates in ozone formation chemistry in               urban environments.  Recombination of HO2 is the only known source              of atmospheric hydrogen peroxide, which is important in the                     chemistry of acid precipitation.  Direct measurements of                        atmospheric hydroperoxyl radical concentrations would provide                   important data for use in testing and improving models of                       atmospheric photochemistry.                                                                                                                                          The proposed research will utilize near-infrared diode lasers              to measure tropospheric HO2 concentrations by absorption in                     spectroscopic bands near 1500 nm.  This approach offers improved                sensitivity, as compared to mid-infrared methods, due to the high               power and improved optical characteristics of near-infrared diode               lasers.  In Phase I, laboratory experiments will be conducted to                measure the absorption cross sections of HO2 near 1500 nm.  The                 results of these experiments will provide a basis for critical                  assessment of the feasibility of this technique for tropospheric                measurements and will establish the crucial design parameters for               development of field instrumentation in Phase II.",
