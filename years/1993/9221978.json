 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are fish species known as \"weakly electric\" fish, because                 they emit a small discharge from an electric organ.  They use                   electroreceptor organs in the skin to detect changes in the                     electric field that surrounds them, somewhat like echolocation                  behavior.  One whole part of their brain is called the                          electrosensory lobe (ELL), where the nerve signals from                         electroreceptors are integrated with nerve signals from other parts             of the brain, including information about body position, about the              commands for timing of the electric organ discharge, and about                  other stages of electrosensory processing.  Modulation of sensory               input has been demonstrated here in the changes in effectiveness of             the contacts between nerve cells, known as synaptic plasticity.                 This work uses electrophysiology and anatomical tracing of the                  processes of single nerve cells to determine how cells within ELL               respond to electrosensory and central inputs, and to determine the              basic anatomical circuitry of ELL.  This model system is useful not             as a \"simple\" one, but as one which may help to understand the real             complexities of sensorimotor integration linking sensation to                   behavior in the vertebrate central nervous system.  Using this                  unusual non-human sense will provide insights about how central                 brain structures modify the flow of sensory information, how                    sensory information is modulated by commanded motor activity, and               how synaptic plasticity affects functions of sensory processing and             network functions.",
