 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312235  Kinner  This is an award to support research the  objective of which is to obtain a more  complete understanding than now exists of the  factors affecting protozoan transport  behavior in groundwater.  The project  involves determination of the sources of  organic carbon used by the aquifer protozoa,  the variation in numbers and diversity of  trophic and encysted protozoa in response to  temporal variations in geochemical and  biological parameters, and the extent of  protozoan activity and diversity in the  unsaturated zone as a function of depth to  the water table.  It is a renewal of research  conducted previously under NSF Grant No. 90-  12183. The project involves field studies in  cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey  (Ronald W. Harvey) at its groundwater  contamination site located at the Otis Air  Force Base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts and  also includes a subcontract for collaboration  on groundwater microbiology with the British  Museum of Natural History (Alan Warren and  Gianfranco Novarino).    This research is expected to provide  information on the role that protozoan  transport through aquifers and sediments  contaminated by organic chemicals plays on  microbial populations in aquifers.  This has  significant implications for both public  health and for potential use in  bioremediation of contaminated aquifers and  sediments.  Results may be applied in  engineering design of systems for  decontamination of aquifers using a  bioremediation process alone or as part of a  system that includes physical and chemical  processes.",
