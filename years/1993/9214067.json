 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is on the time-dependent Yang-Mills-Higgs                     equations. These are nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential                  equations which are invariant under the Lorentz group and the                   infinite dimensional gauge group.  The investigator has proved                  that under certain situations it is possible to construct                       solutions to the equations which correspond to motion of the                    vortices or   monopoles according to a finite dimensional                       Hamiltonian system on the configuration space.  These                           approximations are known to be valid on long but finite time                    intervals.  The present aim of this investigation is to extend                  this understanding to more general   situations, in particular to               monopole scattering which is described by geodesics with respect                to the Atiyah-Hitchin metric on the moduli space.  A longer term                aim is to extend the understanding to infinite time -- it is                    conceivable that asymptotically the solution approaches a                       combination of vortices and monopoles moving according to the                   Hamiltonian system on the configuration space in the maximum                    norm.  The reason for this   conjecture is the dispersion of                    radiation.  Another long term aim is to extend the understanding                to the equations of general relativity in which black holes take                the place of vortices and monopoles.                                                 The work has possible applications to superconductivity and                particle physics in addition to being of mathematical interest.",
