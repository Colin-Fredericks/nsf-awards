 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354936  Person    Fluid circulation, composition, interaction, and history are of  fundamental importance in understanding crustal dynamic processes  as diverse as the evolution of mid-ocean ridges, basin formation,  collision tectonics, climate change, ocean history, paleolimnology,  and the fate of pollutants.  The GEOFLUIDS program embraces this  commonality on a global scale as a unique organizational concept  for multi-disciplinary graduate training and research in crustal-  scale geohydrology at the University of Minnesota.  A candidate who  masters the underlying principles and global linkages will be  especially prepared for academic and societal contributions in the  21st century.    The Winchell School of Earth Sciences recently established the  endowed Gibson Chair and Gibson Visiting Professorships in  hydrogeology, along with state-of-the-art modeling facilities and  matching support.  Coupled with the recent growth of the  Limnological Research Center, new directions in stable-and heavy-  isotope geochemistry, and exceptional analytical facilities,  critical mass now exists for collaborative guidance of new  educational initiatives and interdisciplinary research  opportunities in crustal-scale geohydrology for Graduate Research  Traineeships.  The Ph.D. program combines Geosciences and a  University Water Resources Minor,  GRT students will gain unique  experience through collaboration with national laboratories and  international research efforts.  The GEOFLUIDS program includes  proven strengths in effective scientific management of university-  wide interdisciplinary graduate reseach training as well as  recruiting and outreach to attract outstanding undergraduates.   Recruitment plans include a weekend short course for undergraduates  and training workshops for their professors from Midwestern  colleges, partnerships with historically Black institutions with  professorship, and a lively interdisciplinary seminar forum.   Matching funds totaling $20,000/year will be used to fac ilitate the  administration and recruitment of the GEOFLUIDS program.  ***",
