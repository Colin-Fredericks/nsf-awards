Stable oxygen and carbon isotope data suggest WSBW                                                                                                may have dominated ocean circulation at several times in the past,                                                                                              but stale isotope signatures are not unique water mass tracers.                                                                                                 Due to the short oceanic residence time of Nd and the distinct Nd                                                                                               isotope input values to different water masses, this Nd isotopic                                                                                                system may be a conservative tracer of water mass.  Fish tooth                  apatite may provide a deep water record through Nd isotopes.  This                                                                                              study  should aid in evaluating the timing and mechanism of the                 rare earth element (REE) uptake in fish tooth apatite by examining                                                                                              samples from two deep sea sites with different lithologic controls                                                                                              on diagenetic alteration.  It should also allow us to determine                 fish tooth composition across the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, a time                                                                                             of proposed WSBS formation.  Major changes in the mode of ocean                 circulation in the past would impact nutrient distributions and                 redox conditions, as well as the transfer of heat and air/sea                   exchange of atmospheric gases that directly influence global                    climate.",
