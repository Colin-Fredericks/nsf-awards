The conference will be  held for two days just prior to the 1994 National Science  Teachers Association Annual Convention in Anaheim, California.  The  conference will include invited papers, panels, and working groups  to evaluate current practices and future directions in science  education for students with disabilities.  The major purpose of the  conference is to educate science teacher educators, science  teachers, and professionals providing services and/or equipment to  persons with disabilities as to what resources and strategies are  effective in providing science education for persons with  disabilities.  Recommendations for improved practice will be shared  and responded to by participants.  Information in areas of career  concerns, teacher education, methods, materials/programs,  dissemination, evaluation and assessment, and educational  organizations and agencies will be compiled and prepared into a  document for conference participants.  A publication will be  developed following the conference, and become available to  interested individuals and agencies at a nominal cost.  ***",
