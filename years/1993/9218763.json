 "awd_abstract_narration": "The enzyme adenylosuccinate synthetase obtained from E. coli is                 dimeric and binds three substrates plus a metal ion.  The chemical              mechanism of the function of the synthetase is approached from a                number of points of view.  Specific amino acid residues involved in             binding and catalytic processes are examined via chemical and                   metagenesis approaches.  These studies require considerable                     spectroscopic effort to localize the observed effects.  Chemical                and spectroscopic exchange studies will be performed to get at                  central questions of the timing and order of binding and catalytic              steps.  Ongoing crystallograpic studies of wild type and mutant                 enzyme as well as enzyme in the presence of inhibitors will be                  continued.                                                                      %%%                                                                             Adenylosuccinate synthetase is involved in the conversion of AMP                from IMP.  By virtue of its location at the beginning of a                      metabolic pathway, this enzyme is subject to a number of controls               of its catalytic activity as part of the overall metabolic                      integration of the cell.  The proposed research explores the                    complex interactions which exist between the enzyme and metabolites             and inhibitors it binds.  The proposed research will identify the               order and tightness of binding of effectors, substrates, and                    products, will identify catalytically important structures in the               enzyme, and will identify and characterize intermediates occurring              along the reaction pathway.  Studies of the three-dimensional                   structure of the enzyme, using X-ray crystallography, will be                   continued.",
