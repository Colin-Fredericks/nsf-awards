 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an ongoing U.S.-Japan collaborative research                project between John Beavan and Chris Scholz of Lamont-Doherty                  Geological Observatory, Columbia University, and Teruyuki Kato,                 Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo.  This project               is part of a five-year collaboration to resolve several major                   problems related to the active tectonics of the Philippine Sea                  Plate and its boundaries through collection and analysis of                     Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements at sites                           strategically placed along the eastern, western, and northern                   boundaries of the Philippine Sea Plate in southeast Japan, the                  Ryukyus, Taiwan, and in the Bonins, Marianas, and Micronesia.                                                                                                   During the two-year period of the grant, the following specific                 topics will be addressed:  (1) determination of accurate                        Philippine - Eurasian Plate and Philippine Sea-Pacific poles and                rotation rates; (2) the magnitude of plate driving forces at                    trench boundaries; (3) the mechanism of back-arc spreading; (4)                 the mechanism of strike-slip in the forearc; (5) the mechanics of               arc-continent collision; and (6) the distribution of deformation                and seismic hazard in southeast Japan and Taiwan.  In addition to               the principal investigators, others involved in the project are                 Dan Davis, SUNY Stony Brook; Steven Roecker, Rensselaer                         Polytechnic Institute; Kazuro Hirahara and T. Tanaka, Kyoto                     University; and I Murata, T. Kato, and S. Nakao, University of                  Tokyo.  This grant complements a grant from the NSF Earth                       Sciences Program, which is funding the research in the United                   States.",
