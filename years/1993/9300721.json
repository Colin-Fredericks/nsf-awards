 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large number of univariate distributions that have been                thoroughly studied sometimes have been developed for use in                     statistical analyses of data; other distributions arise from                    natural probabilistic or physical considerations, from                          statistical properties, or as limiting distributions.  Most of                  the well-known distributions arise in more than one way.                             Although univariate distributions provide information about                individual measurements, they cannot facilitate studies of                      relationships between measurements.  In many situations in the                  physical, biological, and economic sciences, it is just these                   relationships that are of interest, for which multivariate                      distributions are required.                                                          The goal of this proposal is to contribute to the                          understanding of multivariate versions of the well known                        univariate theory, with emphasis on life distributions.  This                   subject is particularly timely because recent increases in                      computational and computer graphics capabiliteies have made the                 use of multivariate distributions much more broadly practical.                  Multivariate models are now particularly poorly understood in                   terms of underlying structures that unite many multivariate                     families into cohesive units.  Meaningful derivations of                        multivariate distributions can shed light on which models to use                in different applications.  A consequence of this research is                   that flexible models useful in describing multivariate data will                become available.",
