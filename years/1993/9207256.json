 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the development of new algorithms for the               rapid analysis of macromolecular conformation and for their                     integration into the Graphical Representation and Analysis of                   Surface Properties (GRASP) computer program.  GRASP was designed                as a research tool to facilitate the analysis of the structural                 and energetic properties of proteins and nucleic acids.  The                    program is distinct from existing ones in that it allows rapid                  evaluation of conformational and binding energies based entirely                on physical properties that can be mapped onto the molecular                    surface.  This in turn is represented using a fast surface                      rendering algorithm, for display and manipulation by graphics                   workstations.  The underlying scientific component of this                      project is based on the ability to calculate the conformational                 and biding free energies of macromolecules by using a continuum                 treatment of solvent.  GRASP will exploit a new version of the                  DelPhi program for electrostatics and a new treatment of the                    hydrophobic effect which evaluates the relevant interactions                    based on surface area and curvature.  When combined with a                      traditional \"gas phase\" force field, these methods should allow a               complete evaluation of free energies including solvent effects.                 We plan to develop algorithms which make it possible to carry out               accurate calculations in relatively short periods of time.   By                 fully integrating them into GRASP we intend to make these methods               available to the scientific community.  The graphical component                 of GRASP emphasizes the mapping of all physical properties onto                 the molecular surface.  This ability gives researchers the                      potential to obtain novel insights into protein and nucleic acid                structure and design.  The fact that it will run on graphics                    workstations implies that its capabilities will be readily                      available to a large number of researchers in the biological and                chemical communities.",
