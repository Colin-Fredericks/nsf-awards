 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main thrust of this research concerns computer simulations of               biological molecules.  A new class of Monte Carlo simulations has               been developed by the principal investigator which (slightly)                   relaxes the usual Markovian constraint to enable greatly improved               efficiency for systems with important inhomogeneity and local                   anisotropy.  These new and quite general methods will be used to                investigate models of biological molecules.  The research will                  study equilibrium fluctuations of such molecules and continue work              on the protein folding problem.  Calculations of free-energy                    differences and potentials of mean force will be carried out using              multiple histogram techniques developed by the principal                        investigator.  Another important area of application is the                     determination of the structure of biological molecules from x-ray               scattering.  One of the most effective current methods of                       optimizing the fit of the structure of x-ray data involves                      simulated annealing with molecular dynamics.  The application of                new Monte Carlo simulation methods has promise of improving the                 efficiency of some of these structure determinations.                                                                                                           The award is funded jointly by the Materials Theory program in the              Division of MAterials Research and the Computational Biology                    Activity in the Division of Biological Instrumentation and                      Resources.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This computational research will focus on algorithm development for             Monte Carlo simulation and applications to problems of biological               importance.  Simulations will be done on the behavior of biological             molecules and the folding of proteins.  The research has great                  potential should these new Monte Carlo simulations be shown to be               competitive with conventional molecular dynamics techniques.  The               research is jointly funded by the Materials Theory program and the              Computational Biology Activity.",
