 "awd_abstract_narration": "The faculty of the Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, in             conjunction with the physics faculty in the Science & Mathematics               Department, at GMI Engineering & Management Institute (GMI-EMI)                 have recognized the need for upgrading the electronics curriculum               to include more comprehensive coverage of solid state materials and             devices. To this end, a course Solid State Devices, was added to                the curriculum to provide undergraduates with a workable                        theoretical background in the field. Through this project, GMI-EMI              adds a laboratory component to the course. Such a supplement                    enhances understanding by providing a hands-on !earning environment             where students can practice the science of solid state device                   characterization and correlate their observations with well                     established theories.                                                           Specifically, the solid state materials and device curriculum                   component at GMI-EMI is enhanced by adding experimental                         investigations in the areas of: 1. Fundamental semiconductor                    transport parameters; 2. Deep energy impurity levels; 3.P-N                     junction device characterization; and 4. MOS device                             characterization. The proposed experiments are intended to foster               a depth of understanding, an appreciation for theoretical models,               a sense of practicality, and an element of interest, excitement and             enthusiasm among students.                                                      The major equipment purchased includes current sources,                         electrometers, capacitance meter, monochromator, cryostats, and                 microcomputer hardware/software for instrument control and data                 acquisition. This equipment facilitates dynamic laboratory                      investigations and promotes clear conceptual understanding for the              students.",
