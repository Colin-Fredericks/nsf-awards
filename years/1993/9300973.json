 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is proposed on a variety of problems in statistical               decision theory.  The main focus of this research is the                        evaluation of inferential methods with admissibility as one                     evaluative criterion.  The connection between the admissibility                 of formal Bayes rules and the recurrence of symmetric Markov                    chains forms an important portion of the theoretical background                 for this work.  In a nonparametric setting an alternative method                of inducing inferences is proposed.  This alternative is easily                 implemented numerically and has connections with both frequentist               and Bayesian bootstrap procedures.  Another area of proposed                    research concerns questions related to the asymptotic                           distribution of eigenvalues, eigenprojections, and singular                     values.  Previous work contains new techniques which provide a                  unified treatment of eigenalues and singular values.                            Applications of these results to concrete examples and extension                of the basic results to eigenprojection problems is proposed.                        Statistics deals with the activity of making statements                    about populations on the basis of available samples or data.                    Since information is most often incomplete, such statements are                 typically in error.  The quantification of this error is a                      standard statistical activity and is often expressed in terms of                probability.  The research supported by this grant concerns                     various methods for quantifying statistical errors and the                      properties of such methods.  The ultimate goal of the research is               the development of new statistical methods for obtaining                        probabilistic quantification of errors in inferential statements.",
