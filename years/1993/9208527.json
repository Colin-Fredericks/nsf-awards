 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new physical state of long-chain polymers is becoming                         increasingly important in technology.  In this state the ends of                the polymer chains are forced to crowd together at a surface, thus              causing them to elongate one another.  The resulting stored elastic             energy gives rise to striking spatial patterns and mechanical                   responses which have not been explained.  Recently we have                      developed a new theoretical method for treating this mutually                   elongated state of 'end-confined\" or \"tethered\" polymers.  We will              apply the method to understand the layer of end-grafted polymers                often used to stabilize colloidal particles.  We will calculate the             functional form of the osmotic-pressure corona around such                      particles responsible for steric stabilization.  End-confined                   polymers in, for instance, a lamellar stack of copolymer layers                 flow in a distinctive way because their entanglements are quite                 different from those in simple polymer liquids.  We will calculate              the relaxation of stress with time in this state using recent                   theories of entangled-polymer motion.  We will explore the                      distinctive local elastic properties of the layer by calculating                the linear response of the pressure to a nearby perturbation of the             density.  Finally, we will calculate the interaction energy induced             by bridging of surfaces, for instance by triblock polymers.                     %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be undertaken on the properties of                    polymers which are attached at one end to a surface.  This                      attachment causes the polymers to interact in a way which produces              unusual properties which will be explored in this research.  The                results of this work will produce a deeper understanding of this                class of polymers and provide a foundation for commercial                       application.",
