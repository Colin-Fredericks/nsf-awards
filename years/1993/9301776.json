The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Steven D.                                    Biller of the University of California, Irvine                                  to work with Professor Alan A. Watson at the                                    University of Leeds.                                                                                                                                            They plan on examining characteristics and                                      detection techniques associated with ultra-high                                 energy (UHE) cosmic ray interactions.  This                                     study will have direct application to the next                                  generation of cosmic ray detectors being                                        designed to examine UHE radiation in terms of                                   composition, primary energy spectrum, and                                       potential point-sources of astrophysical                                        emission.  By doing this project at the                                         University of Leeds, Dr. Biller will have                                       access to the following:  (1) data from four                                    different experiments, spanning over seven                                      decades in detected particle energies (i.e. the                                 Haverah Park Array - formerly located at Leeds;                                 GREX - located at Leeds; the Whipple Cerenkov                                   Telescope - located in Arizona; and SPASE -                                     located at the South Pole), (2) two data sets                                   containing reported detections of point-sources                                 (Haverah Park - Cygnus X-3; Whipple - Crab                                      Nebula, Markarian 421, and Hercules X-1; (3)                                    expertise in computer modeling of air-shower                                    interactions (Michael Hillas).
