A  fundamental breakthrough occurred when H. Hedenmalm discovered a  factorization of functions in Bergman space analogous to the  classical one of F. Riesz which helped clarify the structure of  the Hardy spaces.  Among the goals of this research, work will be  done to describe the invariant subspaces of the analytic Lebesgue  spaces, on understanding the nonstandard invariant subspaces and  determining the domination relations on zero sets.  Work will  also be done on the Green's function for the biharmonic operator  in n-dimensional Euclidean space and algebras of harmonic  functions in three-dimensional space.  The latter is concerned  with locating those complex harmonic functions whose modulus is  also harmonic.  These are thought to be the closest  generalization to odd dimensions of analytic functions.       Complex analysis has a long, distinguished mathematical  history.  It has been a basis for studies in diverse areas as  number theory, computation, approximation theory and potential  theory.  Although the classical theory has been thoroughly  investigated for centuries, the newer Bergman spaces have been  slow to develop, despite their recognized importance.  The recent  work of Hedelmalm has completely changed the landscape to a point  where one fully expects major thrusts to take place in this area  similar to those which occurred when the theory of Hardy spaces  flourished in the 1950's and 60's.   ***",
