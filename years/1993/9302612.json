 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABAG recently developed estimates of uninhabitable dwellings                    in future earthquakes affecting the San Francisco Bay Area.                     George Washington University used these estimates in                            developing projections of shelter populations in future                         earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay Area.                                                                                                                      This project expands these efforts by more systematically                       examining data on the residential structures tagged by local                    government building officials as unsafe (red) or limited                        access (yellow) following the Loma Prieta earthquake in                         accordance with the ATC20-California Office of Emergency                        Services procedures for postearthquake safety evaluation of                     buildings.  The data on daily occupancy load of Red Cross                       shelters following that earthquake also are examined.                                                                                                           The project has five principal objectives: (1) develop                          models of housing habitability based on intensity, distance                     from fault source, and underlying geologic materials for the                    San Francisco Bay Area; (2) model how shelter populations                       are related to structural damage, including data on                             buildings that are redtagged as uninhabitable, as well as                       yellow-tagged as damaged based on actual Loma Prieta data;                      (3) assess the demographic characteristics of the shelter                       population versus the overall impacted population through                       use of the 1990 Census (conducted only five months after the                    earthquake) and Red Cross data from the Loma Prieta event;                      (4) relate the recovery time of the impacted housing stock                      to the structural type of those buildings for Loma Prieta;                      and (5) apply these lessons to future Bay Area earthquakes.                                                                                                     The goal of the project is to improve the nation's emergency                    planning, disaster response and residential rebuilding                          efforts in future earthquakes.",
