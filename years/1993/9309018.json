 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past two decades, shifting intellectual currents and                 real-world developments have stimulated strong interest in the                  impact of objective economic conditions, such as unemployment and               inflation, and subjective economic perceptions on public support                for political parties and their leaders in representative                       democracies.  To date, however, fundamental questions remain                    unanswered, and theoretical controversies and empirical                         disagreements continue over economic influences on party support.               This project addresses important debates by testing multivariate                models using monthly time series data to be gathered in Great                   Britain in the 1992-1997 period.                                                                                                                                Principal theoretical controversies involve whether citizens'                   party-support decisions are based on:  1) evaluations of personal               or national economic conditions and, relatedly, attributions of                 government responsibility for such conditions; 2) past or future-               oriented economic judgments and, relatedly, willingness to reward               or punish governing parties for good/improving or bad/deteriorating             economic performance, respectively, or to support a party based on              perceptions of different issue priorities; 3) \"cold calculations\"               or emotional reactions to economic information.  Also important is              the extent to which party identification as a component of party                support is driven by ongoing economic performance evaluations.                                                                                                  This project addresses such theoretical concerns and data                       limitations.  Regarding the former, the advantages of studying                  British party support during a five-year period are: 1) economic                effects on party support should be substantial - the economy is a               matter of longstanding public concern; 2) social-class differences              may characterize responses to economic conditions and their impact              on party support; 3) the multiparty system facilitates studying how             party-system context influences the political economy and dynamics              of support for opposition as well as governing parties; 4)                      economics is not all a changing mix of political events, some being             part of the ongoing political process and others being                          unanticipated by politicians and public alike, should influence                 short-term movements in party support, including party                          identification.                                                                                                                                                 The research uses data from existing questions about relevant                   economic and political variables, together with data from new                   questions added to monthly surveys (May 1992-April 1997) conducted              by the British Gallup organization.  By adding questions to                     existing ones in 60 surveys, this cost-effective project can                    produce the key variables and sufficient time point needed for                  aggregate-time series analyses of party support during the maximum              constitutional term of the current British parliament.  The                     research promises to substantially enhance our understanding of the             key issues of the research.",
