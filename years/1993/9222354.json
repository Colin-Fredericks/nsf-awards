 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Hungary research project on \"N-Body                                     Scattering Theory\" is between Drs. Colston                                      Chandler and Archie G. Gibson of the University                                 of New Mexico and Dr. Gyula Bencze of the                                       Research Institute for Nuclear & Particle                                       Physics, Hungarian Academy of Sciences.  The                                    researchers will continue examination of the                                    Coulomb interaction, a difficult, few-body                                      problem in theoretical physics for which no                                     practical, mathematically rigorous theory exists.                               Work will emphasize code development to evaluate                                scattering amplitudes numerically for proton-                                   deuteron scattering, treating the Coulomb                                       interaction exactly.  The researchers will pursue                               work on a scattering theory to more accurately                                  account for electron correlations in atomic                                     breakup reactions.  Finally, they will study the                                Coulomb reaction for three particles interacting                                with repulsive Coulomb interactions to determine                                how to incorporate into the scattering theory a                                 practical distorted wave approximation for                                      breakup wave functions.  The inclusion of breakup                               channels in scattering calculations is a topic of                               considerable interest at present in both atomic                                 and nuclear physics.                                                                                                                                            The researchers also intend to continue their                                   theoretical and numerical work on breakup                                       amplitudes in the context of the Chandler-Gibson                                equations.  The specific problem to be addressed                                is a simplified model for neutron-deuteron                                      scattering, though the techniques should be                                     applicable to more general problems.  Study will                                also be initiated to develop a practical N-body                                 distorted wave approximation for three-cluster                                  breakup wave functions.  Success in any of the                                  proposed studies would have considerable                                        practical application in atomic or nuclear                                      physics, or both.                                                                                                                                               This project in theoretical physics fulfills the                                program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in Hungary                                and the United States to combine complementary                                  talents and pool resources in areas of strong                                   mutual interest and competence.",
