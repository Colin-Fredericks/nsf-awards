 "awd_abstract_narration": "9320717  McCoy  The research to be performed under this SGER grant will further  develop, and make known to the research community, a new  mathematical framework for accommodating the wide range of length  scales for observing material heterogeneity.  The PI will carry out  research employing the newly developed Theory of Multiresolution  Decomposition, which is based on the use of discrete orthogonal  wavelets.  This approach will be applied at the interface of  mechanics and of materials science through the \"Theory of Phase-  Space Substructuring\" that allows for the rigorous investigation of  the physics of across-scale coupling... an issue which is central  to the application of mechanics to materials science.  By  application of this new methodology, a class of problems which,  hitherto, was inaccessible (namely, that category of phenomena in  which different stochastic processes are operative on different  length scales) now becomes amenable to rigorous analysis.  This  type of problem is typically encountered in investigations which  have as their goal an understanding of how the macro properties of  materials depend on their microstructure.  ***",
