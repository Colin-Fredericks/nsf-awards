 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353820  Goldsmith    In the proposed 12 month project, Education Development Center,  Inc.(EDC) will undertake a research project designed to investigate  the role of affect in the process of teacher development in  mathematics instruction.  The research will use a case study  methodology to investigate how it feels for teachers to undertake  to change their mathematics practice, and how teachers' affective  states influence the process itself.  Five or six teachers  participating in a newly beginning teacher intervention project at  EDC will serve as the subjects for the investigation.  The study  will use both interview protocols and observations of teachers in  their classrooms and in teacher inquiry groups to gather data.   Analysis will focus on articulating the kinds of feelings teachers  experience as they work to transform their practice; the kinds of  conditions that stimulate strong emotional responses in teachers;  articulating the ways in which emotions can energize or interfere  with the process; teachers' awareness of their own affect and its  influence on their practice; and whether there are \"signature\"  emotional mixes that characterize certain phases of the process of  teacher change.  Outcomes of the study will be written up for  publication and presentation at relevant professional meetings.   The results of this preliminary investigation will also be used to  develop future plans for more comprehensive investigations of this  issue.  ***",
