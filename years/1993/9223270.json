 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bird is organizing a one and one-half day conference/workshop               to be held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the American               Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in February 1993              in Boston Massachusetts.  The aim of the program is to assist                   educators and administrators in the development of undergraduate                and graduate level programs that address the wide range of ethical              concerns associated with professions in the sciences and                        engineering.  The workshop consists of lectures, symposia,                      discussion groups, demonstrations  wand worships designed to                    provide educators with theoretical foundations and practical tools              for addressing issues of professional ethics.  The sessions                     identify the ethical concerns of science professionals in a wide                range of sciences including the physical, biological, social and                information sciences and engineering.  Sessions are also to                     facilitate discussion within and across disciplines, and provide                the opportunity both to clarify issues and to learn about teaching              strategies, techniques and tools that have been developed.",
