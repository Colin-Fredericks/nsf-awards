 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is made by the                        Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program to support                  the development of a new method for determining the symmetry                    and geometry of gas phase transition metal carbonyl anions.                     Dr. Steven W. Buckner of the Chemistry Department, University                   of Arizona, will construct a CO laser that will cover                           wavelengths in the range 1600 to 2000 inverse centimeters.                      This will enable detailed examination of the C-O stretching                     bands of various complexes.  The experiment will be a new                       application of wavelength dependent infrared multiphoton                        dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy.  In addition to  providing a                 new structural probe of these species, should the early phases                  of this work be successful, light-driven bimolecular reactions                  of some organometallic ions would be investigated.  Detailed                    mechanisms of complex gas phase photochemical reactions could                   thus be determined.                                                             %%%                                                                             Full understanding of gas phase organometallic chemistry                        requires investigation of both  structural changes and                          energetics during the course of reactions.  Here a novel                        experimental approach to obtaining such important information                   is proposed.  Because difficulties with sensitivity of the                      method and rearrangement of the reactants could limit its                       utility, the research is supported by a small exploratory                       award.  If successful, however, the method would be helpful in                  understanding photochemical and catalytic processes.",
