 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309349  Gaillard  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which is to gain a fundamental  understanding of the fate of trace metals in  freshwater sediments.  The investigator plans  on using an approach that involves both  experimental and mathematical modeling of the  problem, assessing the extent to which trace  metals could be buried permanently in  sediments or remobilized into overlying  waters under natural conditions.  The  experimental work involves determination of  trace metal distributions in interstitial  waters and bulk sediments and on the  measurement of trace metal binding to  sediment particles and authigenic particles.    The proposal leading to this award was  submitted in response to NSF 92-122, Research  Initiation Awards Program Announcement and  Guidelines.  Results are expected to provide  a more fundamental understanding than now  exists of phenomena that are associated with  the processes by which trace metal  constituents of sediments in lakes and  streams can pollute the overlying water.   This in turn can lead to an improvement in  predicting the behavior of trace metals in  sediments and potentially find application as  a prognostic tool for assessing the release  of metals from polluted sediments.",
