 "awd_abstract_narration": "The global environment is a major issue between industrial and                  developing countries.  The proposals advanced by the United                     Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro during June 1992 relating                the environment with international debt, investment and                         technology policies are properly regarded as general equilibrium                phenomena, centering on the behavior of markets.  This is because               the environmental actions of a country affect the others, and the               markets for environmental resources affect all other markets.                   This project addresses the following unanswered questions:  Why                 do developing countries specialize in the production and the                    export of goods which overuse environmental inputs such as rain                 forests?  What is the role of international trade in global                     environmental issues?  Is it possible to protect resources                      without interfering with free markets?  When is market                          intervention required?  Will taxes on the use of environmental                  resources improve the pattern of trade and of resource use?                                                                                                     The research is based on the analysis of a general equilibrium                  model of North-South trade where the environment appears as a                   renewable common property resource such as aquifers, fisheries                  and forests, whose by-products are used as inputs to the                        production of traded goods.  The data will be provided by                       simulating the model for representative examples, and used as a                 foundation for evaluating two alternative policies.  The first is               levying taxes or imposing quotas on the use of the environmental                resources.  The second is promoting changes in property rights                  for the environmental common property resources.  The simulations               use parameters obtained from innovative arrangements involving                  property rights in the case of the US and UK pharmaceutical                     industries and Central and South American rain forests.                         Illustrative case studies are given by two pharmaceutical                       companies in the US: Shaman Pharmaceutical of California, and                   Merck and Co. of New Jersey.  Both use biodiversity from Latin                  American and Central American forests to develop medical                        products.",
