 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, Dimension Technologies Inc.  (DTI) proposes to                 investigate issues related to a color version of the high                       resolution illumination scheme being investigated under the current             NSF program number ISI-9161185,  titled \"Demonstration of a Method              of Creating a Very High Resolution Autosteroscopic Flat Panel                   Display.\"                                                                                                                                                       The work will involve research into a field-sequential color                    illumination technique for liquid crystal displays that promises                to allow the creation of ultrahigh resolution two-dimensional or                autostereoscopic three-dimensional images  DTI has augmented its                staff with experts in the fields of color and psychophysics for                 purposes of this research.  We believe the technique proposed has               features that overcome some of the problems and limitations                     associated with previous field-sequential color illumination                    schemes, while simultaneously allowing the creation of images that              have greater resolution than that provided by the LCD pixels                    themselves.                                                                                                                                                     If Phase 1 is research is successful,  it would lead to the                     development of a prototype display that would use low cost LCD's                yet be capable of very high resolution.  We are convinced this                  would broad appeal in the display industry which perpetually seeks              higher resolution and improved manufacturing yields at lower costs.",
