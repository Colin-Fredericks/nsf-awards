 "awd_abstract_narration": "The details of the molecular mechanisms underlying subglass                     relaxations in amorphous polymers remain largely a mystery.                     Although there is a considerable body of useful experimental                    description, the experiments are rarely specific in revealing the               nature of the motions taking place.  Molecular modelling or                     simulation is becoming of increasing value in interpreting the                  details of molecular motion.  An important recent advance has the               been the ability to generate, via molecular dynamics (MD)                       simulation, detailed description of the structure and packing in                amorphous polymeric melts and glasses.  In the present work, such               advances in modelling will be exploited in describing subglass                  relaxations.  The work will be done in association with dielectric              relaxation experiments.  Systems to be studied include subglass                 processes in main-chain liquid crystalline aromatic polyesters;                 subglass processes in other aromatic polyesters; the gramma-                    relaxation in polyethylene; subglass processes that are, by design,             at very low temperature by virtue of low internal rotational                    barriers; and, side-chain mesogen liquid crystalline polymers.                                                                                                  Unlike many other materials, such as metals and ceramics, the                   usefulness of all polymeric materials depends on the fact that                  they are very dynamic on the molecular scale.  That is, the                     constituent molecules are in a constant state of motion and the                 kinds of motion determine the properties.  Even in polymers that                are apparently rigid and glass-like, residual molecular motions                 determine such behavior as strength and toughness.  However there               is not yet a clear understanding of these motions.  The present                 work is directed toward attaining this understanding in order that              better materials can be developed.  Modern computer modelling                   techniques will be combined with sophisticated experimental tools               in accomplishing this goal.",
