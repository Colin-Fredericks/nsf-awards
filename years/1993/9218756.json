 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative research project will be undertaken by investiga-               tors at the University of Washington and the University of Alaska               as part of the Ocean-Atmosphere-Ice Interactions (OAII) component               of the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) global change research                     program.  The research objective is to measure the transport of                 water through the Bering Straits and to determine the influence of              this transport on the physical properties and variability of the                Arctic Ocean, and particularly the surface layer.  These physical               properties, such as ice cover and thickness, vertical mixing, and               thermo-haline structure affect the extent of the Arctic ice pack.               If changing climate conditions caused the ice pack to shrink or                 change significantly, the effect would be felt throughout the                   world's atmosphere and ocean.                                                                                                                                   The influx of water through the Bering Strait is one of the major               inputs to the Arctic Ocean, therefore its volume and physical                   properties must be known if one is to understand the processes that             control the Arctic Ocean's physical features.  Three coordinated                projects will each deal with one or more aspects of the system, and             together provide insight into the broader workings of the Arctic's              physical and geochemical processes.  Moorings will be deployed for              a three-year period at key locations.  They will provide concurrent             time series of water column properties including temperature, sal-              inity, currents and an upward looking sonar (ULS) will make a full              year of ice thickness observations.  A hydrographic program will                also examine water column variability in the northeastern Chukchi               Sea, where the low-salinity portion of the Pacific inflow drains                into the Arctic Ocean.  The work builds on earlier efforts funded               by ONR and NSF that were conducted in cooperation with the physical             and chemical oceanographic programs of NOAA/PMEL.",
