The program's                                    awards provide opportunities for joint                                          research, and the use of unique or                                              complementary facilities, expertise and                                         experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Susann G.                                    Remington of the University of Minnesota-Twin                                   Cities to work with Dr. Spyros D. Georgatos at                                  the European Molecular Biology Laboratory                                       (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany.                                                                                                                                  Dr. Remington has characterized a full length                                   chicken lens cDNA encoding filensin, a lens-                                    specific, membrane-associated, cytoskeletal                                     protein.  The deduced amino acid sequence of                                    filensin contains a 280 residue domain with                                     sequence similarity to the rod domain of                                        intermediate filament proteins.  She will                                       examine the molecular interactions of filensin                                  and its potential contribution to lens cell                                     organization by transfecting cultured chicken                                   lens cells with constructs that express                                         truncated forms of filensin, corresponding to                                   domains or conserved sequence motifs.                                           Truncated portions of filensin are expected to                                  competitively inhibit protein-protein                                           interactions of the analogous regions of                                        endogenous chicken filensin, resulting in                                       dominant negative phenotypes(s).  Dr. Remington                                 will monitor the morphology of the transfected                                  cells and the distribution of filensin, other                                   cytoskeletal proteins, and integral membrane                                    proteins in the transfected cultures.  She will                                 also assess the biochemical state of wild type                                  filensin under the experimental conditions.",
