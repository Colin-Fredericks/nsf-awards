 "awd_abstract_narration": "The lysosomal cysteine proteinases, cathepsins B, S, and L, have                been purified from a number of mammalian species and are known to               exist in multiple forms.  Quantitation of these enzymes is                      difficult due to their instability and inhibition by naturally                  occurring inhibitors.  The objectives of this proposal are to                   quantitate the relative concentrations of the different molecular               forms of cathepsins in cells and to determine which ones are                    involved in the degradation of endocytosed proteins such a albumin              and .2-macroglobulin.  Experimental procedures will employ a                    specific radio-labeled inhibitor in either a free membrane-permeant             form or conjugated to proteins in cell culture systems.  A pure                 form of Z-\u0131125iodine!Tyr-Ala-CHN2 will be used in conjunction with              specific antibodies and SDS/polyacrylamide gel                                  electrophoresis/autoradiography to quantitate different molecular               forms of each enzyme in living cells.  These procedures circumvent              the problems of inactivation or inhibition during isolation and                 have the added advantage of being able to quantitate different                  molecular forms of each of the enzymes.  The relative                           concentrations of each enzyme will indicate the relative importance             of these enzymes in protein turnover in a given cell.                           \u0131125iodine!Tyr-Ala-CHN2 conjugated to a range of proteins will be               used as a unique tool for the identification of the enzymes that                first meet endocytosed proteins.  the types of enzymes that first               react with such reagents in intact cells will indicate which are                involved in the degradation of endocytosed proteins.  It is known               that lysosomal proteinases are synthesized as precursors in the                 endoplasmic reticulum and processed to intermediate forms as they               enter the lysosome and finally are processed to lower M, mature                 forms in the mature lysosome.  the molecular forms of the enzymes               that react with \u0131125iodine!Tyr-Ala-CHN2 conjugated to proteins will             permit the differentiation between fusion of endosomes with early               lysosomes and fusion of endosomes with late (mature) lysosomes.                 Such a direct method of identifying the enzymes in endosomes is                 required to unequivocally determine which enzymes are involved in               endocytic proteolysis, and by which route the enzymes are packaged              into the endocytic compartment.                                                 %%%                                                                             This project is aimed at determining the quantities of a number of              important proteinases in cells using a novel technique with a                   membrane permeant radio-labeled inhibitor.  Results from this study             will identify which of the four lysosomal cysteine proteases                    predominate in which cells and enable us to determine the                       significance of these enzymes in cell function.  A second aim is to             determine the molecular forms of the enzymes that are involved in               the degradation of endocytosed proteins.  Results from this part of             the study will show which enzymes are involved in the degradation               of proteins taken up into the cell, and will also indicate the site             at which endocytosed proteins first meet with lysosomal enzymes                 during their biosynthesis.  The procedures to be developed provide              a series of new techniques to study the biological roles of                     lysosomal proteases.",
