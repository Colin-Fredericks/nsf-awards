 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental studies of the dependence of the InAlAs/InP band                    offset on strain will be conducted by measuring photoluminescence               from the Type II staggered InAlAs/InP interface as a function of                pressure using a diamond anvil cell.  The interplay between the                 deleterious effects of interface roughness introduced by atomic                 exchange of  arsenic and phosphorus, and the benefits produced by               strain will be explored; it is anticipated that the ability to                  tune the strain through the use of hydrostatic pressure will                    provide fundamental information on the nature of this unique                    material.                                                                       %%%                                                                             Research will be conducted on the factors that influence the                    electronic and optical properties of a particular compound                      semiconductor material combination with potential advantages in                 electronics and photonics applications.  This research is                       expected to give a fundamental understanding of the effect of                   strain on basic material properties and performance.  The                       semiconductor material combination under study has wide                         applicability in electronic and optoelectronic devices;                         understanding the effects of strain on electronic and optical                   properties is also expected to improve the performance of                       advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,                     information processing, and telecommunications.",
