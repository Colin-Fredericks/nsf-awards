 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral               Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of the debates  and               political  currents leading up to the ratification  of  the  16th               Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, mandating an income  tax,  in               1913.    The  project  will  primarily  make  use  of  historical               documents  to  comparatively analyze how the 16th  Amendment  was               ratified  in  three  states: New York, Wisconsin,  and  Virginia.               Results  will  be analyzed in order to shed light  on  how  ideas               about distributive justice evolve in the real world.                                                                                                                 This research will contribute to the growing effort to study               important values and social processes outside of the experimental               social  psychology  laboratory.  In this case the  central  ideas               involved are conceptions of distributive justice, and the debates               over  ideas of fairness that occurred during the several  decades               prior  to  the  ratification of the 16th Amendment in  1913  will               provide  the data to illuminate how such conceptions evolve.   In               addition  to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,               this  award will materially assist a highly promising student  in               completing  research  for  the  Ph.D.  dissertation.    Thus   it               contributes to the future scientific manpower of the  nation  and               the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.",
