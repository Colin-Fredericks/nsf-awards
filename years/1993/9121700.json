 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments show that quasi-brittle fracture in solids under               rapid (dynamic) loading is accompanied by temperature increases.                These increases are confined to very small regions near the crack               edge, yet are substantial enough to reduce the solid's resistance               to fracture.  The study of this phenomenon must deal with the                   mixed boundary/initial value problems and fracture criteria of                  fracture mechanics and transient thermoelastic and small-scale                  yielding theories that often couple otherwise hyperbolic and                    parabolic partial differential equations.  The research proposed                here will conduct just such a study by obtaining analytical                     solutions, asymptotic expressions and numerical results for these               problems.  Two important variations -- the principle of second                  sound, which allows thermal waves, and crystal defect                           (dislocation) motion near cracks -- are also considered.                                                                                                             The results obtained will shed new light on the critical                   problem of rapid fracture in solids by considering the oft-                     neglected temperature effect.  The development of the equations                 and numerical results necessary for this purpose will provide                   insights into combinations of equations that are usually examined               separately.  Finally, the difficulties encountered in the                       development process will lead to an enhanced capability to apply                a variety of analytical and computational solution techniques.",
