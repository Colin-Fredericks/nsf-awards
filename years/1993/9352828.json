 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352828  Wattenberg       Being continued is the development, dissemination, and assessment  of an integrated two-year sequence to replace five courses--  Calculus I, II, and III, Linear Algebra, and Ordinary Differential  Equations.  The motivating idea driving and project is that these  subjects should be taught in the context of real and engaging  problems.  By studying these subjects in context, students are  better able to understand them and to use them outside the  mathematics classroom.  Pedagogically, the most important feature  of this sequence is the participation of students at a higher level  than is typical of traditional courses.  Emphasized are very  substantial and realistic problems that require the application of  a combination of mathematical techniques and that are open-ended,  often without clean, simple solutions.  Computers and writing are  essential parts of the approach.  Computers make it possible to  deal with more realistic applications and facilitate the  experimental approach that is emphasized.  There is a synergy  between writing and meaningful problems that engages on a high  intellectual plane requiring them to understand and articulate the  mathematics, the applications, and the connections between them.",
