In recent years there has  been a resurgence of research in finite fields due to the  wide variety of applications of the theoretical aspects of  finite fields.  Many exciting new theoretical results have  been obtained by a growing number of mathematicians world  wide.  Many new applications and algorithms of finite fields  have been discovered.  Even though there have been special  conferences devoted exclusively to applications or  algorithms of finite fields, there are no conferences  devoted to the combination of the theory, algorithms and  applications.  It is clear that there is an increasing  interaction among the three different groups of people.  The  proposed conference encourages this interaction.  It is  anticipated that the conference will result in many more  fruitful applications of finite fields and at the same time  provide new problems and motivation for fintie field theory.",
