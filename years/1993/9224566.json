 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perceptions of justice are a critical factor in citizens' responses             to judicial decisions, legal institutions such as juries, and other             governmental activities.  Lay perceptions of justice judgments                  carry important implications for the legitimacy of institutions and             for citizen compliance.  Sociolegal researchers have found evidence             for two different but related theories of justice, both of which                emphasize that fair procedures and respectful treatment are more                important to citizens than particular outcomes.  The Procedural                 Justice Theory holds that fairness judgments are dependent on the               extent to which participants have control over the process and/or               the ultimate decision.  The Group Value Theory holds that fairness              judgments are influenced by the trustworthiness and neutrality of               authorities and whether authorities treat individuals with respect.             A recent study showed that group value concerns are considerably                more important for fairness judgments than control concerns.  The               present study will contribute to theoretical advance by testing the             relative validity of these hypotheses under different conditions.                                                                                               Four studies will be undertaken to investigate the conditions under             which individuals' fairness judgments will be influenced by control             versus group value concerns.  A contextual priming model is                     proposed to explain the conditions under which the two kinds of                 concerns will influence fairness perceptions.  Because the model                suggests that self-interest concerns are more important prior to                the resolution of conflict, two field studies examine procedural                fairness perceptions before settlement.  Similarly, because the                 model suggests that self-interest concerns are more important in                disputes, both field studies sample exclusively from populations                of individuals in disputes (divorce and workplace disputes).  In                addition, two laboratory experiments will test the propositions                 that (a) situational factors influence the importance of control                versus group value concerns, and (b) both accessibility and                     deservedness judgments are central to procedural fairness                       perceptions.",
