Heterotropic and homotropic interactions between                   various types of catalytic sites will be examined.  The sequence                and tertiary structure dependence of the active sites will be                   examined.  Isotope labeling studies will be employed to assess the              role of processive processing in protein degradation by the                     proteasome will be explored.                                                    %%%                                                                             The controlled degradation of proteins is just as important as                  their synthesis in the overall economy of the cell.  Large and                  complex structures, the proteasomes, exist to degrade proteins and              peptides.  Such degradation plays roles in the immune system as                 well as in metabolism.  The proposed research is designed to                    understand the mechanics of the protein degradation process and how             it is controlled.  The shear size of the proteasome and the                     complexity of its organization make this a problem of great                     difficulty, requiring the use of specific inhibitors to probe the               various degradation active sites and the use of carefully designed              protein and peptide substrates to examine the catalytic process.//",
