 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                   Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of Jewish                         Christianity, a religious movement that presents a challenge to                 conventional Jewish communities, and of how they respond to it.  As             a contribution to the sociology of religion, this will offer a rare             examination of the tension involving both sides after a schism.                 For sociology more generally, it will extend research on socio-                 cultural boundary maintenance and the responses of cohesive groups              to identity challenges.                                                                                                                                              Religion is a topic of renewed interest to sociologists, and               this study will be part of the fresh wave of research that is                   currently revitalizing this important field.  In addition to the                scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award will                materially assist a highly promising student in completing research             for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to future                      scientific manpower and the thorough training of the next                       generation of sociologists.",
