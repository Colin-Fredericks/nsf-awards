To test the  model, a longitudinal data set will be collected, using as a  baseline the 200 largest U.S. manufacturing corporations in 1955  and following these firms through 1992.  The study will seek to  predict several variables, including a firm's total use of external  financing, total debt and equity financing, and specific types of  debt, including short-term, long-term private, and long-term  public.  The independent variables will include a firm's available  capital (retained earnings), its board composition, the background  of its CEO, alternative forms of financing, participation in  acquisitions, and market context variables such as interest rates,  phase of the business cycle, and the aggregate demand for capital  in the economy.  The research will also examine the determinants of  strategies such as mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, and  long-term investments such as research and development and new  plant and equipment expenditures.  The study will provide an  empirical evaluation of the institutional and network embeddedness  of organizational behavior.  %%%  This project in economic sociology will contribute sociological  insights to a scientific understanding of corporate financing and  of the various strategies that corporations adopt.  The results may  identify inefficiencies and sources of poor decision making, thus  increasing the knowledge base that can strengthen American  competitiveness and promote economic growth.    ***",
