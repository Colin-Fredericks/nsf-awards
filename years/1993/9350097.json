 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study the application of data                    assimilation techniques to the problem of incorporating ocean color             measurements into physical-biological models.  This will be                     accomplished through the development and implementation of a series             of numerical models of marine systems and will be rely heavily on               the adjoint method.  This project is significant in that it will                provide a basis for incorporating vast amounts of data obtained                 from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner and data expected from SeaWiFS              into marine systems models.                                                                                                                                     This study is well-matched with Dr. Lawson's background which                   includes many years of modelling experience and is a natural                    extension of recent research in which she applied this optimization             technique to an ocean surface wave modelling project.  The research             aspect of this proposal includes a collaborative effort with Eileen             E. Hofmann, Old Dominion University, who has an on-going research               program in the assimilation of ocean color data into ecosystem                  models.                                                                                                                                                         Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching               a course in the mathematics department, and participating in                    seminars and lectures connected with the modelling effort,                      including data assimilation, adjoint methods and optimization                   techniques.  Dr. Lawson will interact with graduate students                    involved in similar modelling efforts.                                                                                                                          This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government and academic institutions.  By                 encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
