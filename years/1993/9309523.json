The objective of this research program is to elaborate on the  theoretical power of nonlinear control while at the same time  providing a more solid foundation for the use of nonlinear  control tools in engineering applications.  The former will be  accomplished by furthering results on inherently nonlinear  control systems and control solutions.  The latter will be  achieved by concurrently putting a premium on developing  algorithms that are robust and efficient.    This research will include further investigation employing time-  varying feedback, saturation, hysteresis, dead-zones and  sublinear feedback.  Previous work with saturation functions has  already proved very fruitful for globally stabilizing critically  unstable linear systems with inputs subject to magnitude  constraints, as well as for stabilizing challenging nonlinear  systems.  Important progress has also been made in the  development of time-varying feedback for the stabilization of  nonholonomic systems.  This time the emphasis will be placed in  robustness and practicality by focusing on output feedback  solutions and by allowing for uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics.   A premium will also be placed on performance, employing computer  simulation at this stage to evaluate the design algorithms.  ***",
