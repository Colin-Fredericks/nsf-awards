 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303007  Prasad    This project is a multidisciplinary, university-industry AMPP  collaborative research program to develop a molecular dynamics  (MD) simulation tool which can be used to create and develop new  thin film technologies, improve the old ones, and study the  effect of process parameters on film structure and its  mechanical and electrical properties.  Essential features of  this MD model are:  a suitable potential function(s); efficient  algorithms for force evaluation and sorting of neighbor atoms;  higher-order, adaptive time-interval integration schemes; an  appropriate temperature control algorithm and an improved method  for calculations of local and average film stresses.  It can  simulate three-dimensional thin film depositions on plane  substrates and in vias for metallization of passivation of  devices.  By allowing the periodic boundary conditions to vary,  this model can demonstrate the effect of substrate conditions,  e.g., external stresses and temperature.  The effect of gas  impurity and ion bombardment can be studied by varying the  descriptions of the deposited atoms.  A hybrid approach where a  via solution is built from the results for plane surfaces and  corners is also proposed.  Two different strategies, use of a  massive parallel computer, and distributed computing on a  cluster of workstations will be developed  for computations for  a large number of particles.  Predictions of the PI will be  compared with the experimental data obtained from the IBM and  AT&T research laboratories.    With the help of this simulation code, a deposition process can  be designed on a computer and a range of optimized conditions  for the growth of thin films of uniform structure and consistent  properties can be predicted.  A suitable visualization software  can display the evolution process on a monitor screen which can  be video recorded for further analysis.  This research will be  a major step in the direction of using molecular dynamics theory  for micro-and nano-technolo gy, an area of significant future  growth.  ***",
