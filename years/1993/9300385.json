 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to The Savannah River Ecology                       Laboratory's (SREL) to continue their Research Experiences                      for Undergraduates SITE for another two years.  The program                     will provide research experience, training, and career                          perspective for undergraduate students through the use of                       the unique field sites, laboratory facilities, and through                      the association and active involvement in research with full-                   time research ecologists. Project participants will examine                     the influence of by-products of nuclear and fossil fuel                         energy production on selected biological and chemical                           properties in southeastern ecosystems. SREL faculty members,                    all actively engaged in research and publication, will be                       paired with students having compatible research interests.                      Student projects, while distinct and independent, are                           portions of ongoing research programs at SREL. The student                      experience is enhanced by interaction with a programmatic                       team comprising individuals with a diversity of ecological                      backgrounds, interests, and ideas. Applicants from minority                     schools and regional institutions with limited research                         programs will continue to be actively encouraged, as in                         previous years. Participant selection is based upon the                         quality of an application, letters of recommendation and                        academic record.  Through the research training of more than                    450 undergraduate participants over the past 24 years, SREL                     has created a highly successful program of student/advisor                      interaction. Scientific publications and career development                     of former participants attest to the success of the program.",
