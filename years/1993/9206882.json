 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to understand how plant                  cells perceive and respond to extracellular signals.  The system                being studied is the induction of plant defense responses,                      phytoalexin accumulation in soybean (Glycine max) induced by                    oligosaccharides (elicitors) originating from the mycelial wall of              a phytopathogenic fungus, Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycinea.              Considerable information has been obtained about the structure of               an elicitor (a branched hepta-beta-glucoside) derived from mycelial             wall glucans and about the identity and regulation of elicitor-                 induced genes encoding enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the             phytoalexins.  However, little is known about the mechanisms by                 which plant cells perceive the elicitor, or how that signal is                  transmitted to the cell nucleus to initiate changes in gene                     expression.  The research described in this proposal focuses on the             first step in the elicitor-stimulated signal transduction pathway,              that is, the recognition of a hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor by a                plasma-membrane localized receptor.  The proposed research has                  three major goals.  The first goal is the identification,                       purification, and characterization of hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor             binding protein(s) (EBPs) from soybean root microsomal membranes.               Evidence has already been obtained that a single class of specific,             high-affinity (dissociation constant of 1 nM) EBPs exist in soybean             root microsomes originating from the plasma membrane.  These EBPs               have been successfully solubilized from the membranes using                     detergents, and the solubilized EBPs retain their high affinity and             specificity for the elicitor.  The number and identity of the                   proteins that have hepta-beta-glucoside elicitor binding activity               will be established by photo-affinity labeling.  The EBPs will be               purified by affinity chromatography and antibodies against the                  binding protein(s) will be prepared.  The second goal is the                    isolation and characterization of cDNA sequences that encode EBPs.              Clones carrying EPB sequences will be identified by screening cDNA              expression libraries with radiolabeled hepta-beta-glucoside                     elicitor.  Alternatively, partial protein sequences obtained from               the purified EBPs will be used to prepare synthetic nucleic acid                probes with which to screen cDNA libraries.  These clones and their             derived sequences will be used to identify possible structural and              functional domains in the EBPs that might relate to their role in               signal transduction.  The third goal, which will be undertaken if               time permits, is to demonstrate that the EBPs identified in these               studies are physiological receptor(s) for the elicitor.  Sequence               comparisons and expression of truncated EBP genes will be used to               identify and delineate functional domains of the EBPs.  Transgenic              expression of wild-type and mutant EBPs in plant cells that do not              contain endogenous EBPs, tissue-specific localization of EBPs in                relation to localization of plant defense responses, and                        determination of the effect of anti-sense EPB sequences on the                  expression of hepta-beta-glucoside-induced plant defense responses              will be undertaken to demonstrate the physiological significance of             the EBPs in elicitor-mediated signal transduction.                              %%%                                                                             The long term goal of this research is to understand how plant                  cells perceive and respond to extracellular signals.  The system                being studied is the induction of a defense response in soybean                 plants.  The defense response is triggered by exposure of the plant             to certain carbohydrates (elicitors) which originate from the                   filament wall of a pathogenic fungus which specifically infects the             soybean.  In response to the elicitors the soybean plant                        synthesizes and accumulates protective chemicals known as                       phytoalexins.  The more immediate goals of this project are to                  identify and characterize the plant receptors for the elicitors.                Detailed characterization of the elicitor receptor will be an                   important step toward understanding of the signal transduction                  pathway by which plants detect and respond to pathogens.",
