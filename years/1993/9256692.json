 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor David Allara is jointly funded by the Chemistry                       Division and the Graduate Education and Research Division of                    NSF for a Graduate Research Traineeship Program which will                      involve five graduate students in a core area of molecular                      surface chemistry.  This program will: 1) match the expertise                   of the core faculty in the areas of advanced surface                            characterization methods for polymer and biological interfaces,                 and computational approaches to surfaces; 2) fill a recognized                  educational need in an area of demonstrated national                            importance; and 3) provide a unique educational environment for                 graduate training in the core area. An important aspect of the                  program includes the creation of a central instrumentation                      facility which will enable students to gain familiarity with                    state-of-the-art research equipment.  Students will rotate                      between labs to gain experience in multiple experimental                        approaches to the core area.                                                    %%%                                                                             Molecular surface chemistry has emerged as a technical area of                  national importance which has a wide ranging impact on a                        variety of areas from biology to materials science.  It is of                   fundamental importance in establishing a molecular level                        understanding of catalysis essential to many industrial                         processes.  There is clearly a need for scientists who are                      trained in this field of science, and the support provided                      through this graduate traineeship grant coupled with the                        expertise found in the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania                     State University will help to fulfill that need.",
