 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenetic relationships among higher taxa of plants                     (subclasses, orders, families) often are widely disputed,                       particularly within a number of troublesome tropical-temperate                  sister-family pairs.  A classic example of the tropical-temperate               sister-family problem is exemplified by two families usually placed             within Apiales: the tropical, woody Araliaceae and the temperate,               herbaceous Apiaceae.  Further disputed is the relationship of                   Apiales to other order (Cornales, Pittosporales, Asterales), as                 well as the relationships within each family, especially Apiaceae,              in which there are three subfamilies (Apioideae, Saniculoideae, and             Hydrocotyloideae).  Phylogenetic relationships at the ordinal and               interfamilial levels will be examined using comparative gene                    sequencing of the chloroplast gene rbcL.  Comparative sequencing of             the much more rapidly-changing ORFK will be used to elucidate                   infrafamilial relationships.  Preliminary studies to date indicate              that a contracted Inverted Repeat characterizes some, but not all,              species of Apioideae.  The taxonomic distribution of this                       chloroplast genome rearrangement will therefore be examined in                  detail to help resolve relationships in Apiaceae.  The character                state changes of certain morphological traits will also be examined             in light of the molecular phylogeny.  Preliminary data indicate                 that many of the traditional concepts of relationships in Apiales               are inaccurate and that further sampling of representative taxa                 will greatly increase our understanding of this order.  This study              will, therefore, provide an important model for the examination of              other tropical-temperate sister families.",
