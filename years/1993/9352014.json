 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352014  McDonald      We propose the purchase of MacPacq data acquisition systems  for use in our Anatomy and Physiology courses. These systems  will enable students to make physiological recordings and to  produce lab guides using a cross-disciplinary approach. The lab  recordings will include standard measurements, such as  electrocardiograms and lung volumes, and demonstrations of  muscle and nerve responses to electrical stimulation.The  computers will be used not only to familiarize the students  with basic physiology concepts, but also to instruct them in  the manipulation, display and interpretation of scientific  data. We plan a collaborative effort between the Biology  students, Technical Illustration students and English  Department staff in the production of lab guides for the  equipment. These lab guides will be produced as Hypercard  stacks that will allow the students to step through the  processes of equipment set-up, data acquisition and reporting  of results. Producing these lab guides as an on-screen manual,  and utilizing the talents of students and faculty in several  different departments represents an exciting innovation in the  use of this type of equipment.The equipment and lab guides will  be demonstrated at the Women's Math and Science Network, at a  local Middle School and at the Missouri Community College  Association annual meeting.                ***",
