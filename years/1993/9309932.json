Signals are passed between individual nerve cells within the nervous system and to other cells, such as muscle cells, by the release of  chemicals called neurotransmitters.  More than 40 different neurotransmitters have been identified and each of these chemicals has very distinct effects within the body.  In order to form a functional nervous system it is essential that each nerve cell contain and release only the specific neurotransmitters that are appropriate for it's particular function.  The goal of this project is to understand some of the ways that the body controls what neurotransmitter substances are made by developing nerve cells.  Earlier studies examined one set of nerve cells that normally make a neurotransmitter substance called somatostatin.  When grown in culture, these nerve cells only produce somatostatin when grown together with a specific type of muscle cells.  These particular muscle cells produce a substance called activin.  Activin released by cultured muscle cells appears to govern the nerve cell's production of the neurotransmitter somatostatin.  The experiments proposed here will further investigate the role of activin in controlling neurotransmitter production during normal development of the nervous system.  Results of  these experiments will allow a greater understanding of how cell-to-cell interactions are used to control neurotransmitter production in the developing nervous system and by extension will contribute to an understanding of the basic mechanisms which control dev elopment.  ***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           !         !.        !.
