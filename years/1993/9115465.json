 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of the intermediate scale, time-dependent coupling of the               solar wind, magnetosphere and ionosphere is proposed.  Such a study             will allow for a detailed investigation of how energy, momentum and             mass is transferred from the solar wind across the magnetopause,                into the magnetosphere, and along auroral field lines into the                  ionosphere.  Both analytic and numerical techniques will be used to             describe the dynamics of localized reconnection at the                          magnetopause, and the relation of reconnection to the impulsive                 penetration of plasma and to the response of the magnetopause to                dynamic pressure perturbations in the solar wind.  A previously                 developed numerical model will be used to describe the global                   response of the magnetosphere to driving perturbations at the                   magnetopause.  On a more localized scale, a three-dimensional model             is being developed to describe the detailed interaction of auroral              currents with the ionosphere.  This model, along with accompanying              analytic theory, will be used to describe the trapping of Alfven                waves in the cavity formed by the sharp increase of the Alfven                  speed above the ionosphere.  The overall goal of this research                  program is the understanding and modeling of the plasma processes               which couple energy from the solar wind to the ionosphere.",
