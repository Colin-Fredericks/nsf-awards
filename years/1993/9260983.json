 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are multiple applications for compact particle                       accelerator, especially high energy \u0131Tens of MeV! and high                      current \u0131KA! output.  Gradients of 10 to 20 MV/m are possible                   only with RF accelerators, and existing Linear Induction                        Accelerators do not operate at over 1 MV/m.  Tetra Corporation                  has developed an insulator technology to suppress and enhance                   vacuum surface flashover.  The technology has been                              demonstrated to operate up to the gap's vacuum breakdown                        strength 40 MV/m at 100 ns long pulses, with the estimated                      theoretical limit in the 100's of MV/m range.  This technology                  will be developed for use in linear induction accelerators and                  dielectric wall induction linacs.  At the present, the                          technology has been demonstrated for use as a vacuum                            dielectric insulator for gradients of 40 MV/m at pulse length                   of 100 to 200 nsec.  There is evidence that at shorter pulses                   (10 to 50 nsec or shorter) the breakdown strength will                          increase.  The Phase II program will develop a compact                          accelerator for two basic commercial opportunities; waste                       treatment and reduction, and a source for compact electron                      microscopy.  Design is extended to include a better structural                  protection and the ability to be driven with a high current                     single pulse source or RF.",
