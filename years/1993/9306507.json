 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research planning grant for women.  To be able to                     understand functions in pathogens and plants so that plant diseases             can be controlled and cellular mechanisms for signal recognition                between organisms can be deciphered, we will investigate                        enhancement of bacterial virulence functions by oligosaccharides.               This enhancement will serve as a model system supporting further                pursuit of virulence functions in fungi.  Previous work has shown               that plant cell walls contain a polygalacturonase inhibitor protein             (PGIP) that recognizes and inhibits fungal polygalacturonases (PG)              and that the association of PG and PGIP results in reduced                      breakdown of pectin so that oligosaccharides three to twenty units              long are formed.  These oligosaccharides have been shown to be                  inducers of defense responses in the plant cells and in                         Agrobacteria similar oligosaccharides have been suggested to be                 potent enhancers of virulence induction by plant phenolics.  This               research assesses the inhibition of bacterial PGs by pear and                   tomato PGIPs and determines the susceptibility to Agrobacteria                  infection of transgenic tomato plants expressing elevated amounts               of PGIP.  Furthermore, oligosaccharides optional for the                        enhancement of bacterialvirulence gene expression will be                       identified.  The results from the studies outlined in this grant                will provide the basis for the search in fungi for homologues to                bacterial genes responsible for the regulation of virulence                     induction and enhancement.                                                                                                                                      To be able to understand the signals that are exchanged between a               microbial pathogen and a plant cell during infection, we will                   analyze the effect that sugar polymers have on the functions in a               bacteria that allow it to infect the plant cells.  These sugar                  polymers are known to be formed when a protein in the wall of the               plant cell, PGIP, encounters an enzyme, PG, that fungi deploy in                order to reach the interior of the plant cell being infected.  The              sugar polymers are known to trigger responses in plant cells that               can slow the infection process, but they also have been suggested               to enhance the infection functions in bacterial plant pathogens.                Since little is known about the control of functions that fungal                plant pathogenes need in order to infect plants, we will first                  describe the effects of the sugar polymers in the infection process             by bacterial pathogens and then look for similar functions in the               more complex fungal infections.  We need to understand functions in             both types of pathogens and in the plants in order to exercise                  control over plant diseases caused by these pathogens and in order              to decipher basic mechanisms of communication between organisms.",
