 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to take advantage of a suite of low                   probability and ephemeral physical environmental conditions that                should allow the significant extension of data sets having to do                with the effects of an urbanizing landscape on a lake ecosystem.                Historical data sets are available for comparison of lake behavior              attributable to this cold season's peculiar set of conditions. It               is expected that significant changes will be observed in the                    patterns of streamborne nutrient inputs to the lake.  Even more                 interesting, however, is the possibility of using the data for the              evaluation of \"bottom up\" versus \"top down\" assertions that                     currently abound in the aquatic ecology community.                                                                                                              Studies of the type represented by this project provide the                     foundation for better understanding and, therefore, the better                  management of aquatic resources.  It can be expected that the work              will be important not only within the sphere of fundamental                     aquatic science but also to water resource managers involved in                 decisions regarding water quality and fisheries.",
