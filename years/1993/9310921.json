The research will describe and  explain the reasons for similarities in outcomes which conform to  global models, the reasons for variation within these similarities  across the study region, and the sources of conflict over property  issues.  The project will focus on sites in Thailand (never  colonized), Malaysia (colonized by England), and Indonesia  (formerly under Dutch law), to provide comparisons across three  different legal traditions.  Major sources of variation in national  and local sociolegal processes include differences among pre-  colonial states, in center-periphery relations, in local property  relations, and in different colonial histories.  The research will  show how these historical differences at the state level produced  diverse ways of dealing with \"customary\" or local property  relations during the transition from the colonial period to nation  states and market economies.  The project will contribute to  empirical and theoretical understanding of the relationship between  local property law and practices and global legal and economic  processes, and particularly how this relationship affects the  allocation of forest and other land resources.    The project will employ the method of \"incorporated comparison\" to  assess how similarities and differences in local and national  sociolegal processes across the region were influenced by and  contributed to processes of global change.  The investigators will  collect data from several sources in various countries: cases from  both colonial legal archives and local legal systems, records of  changes in the natural environment, legal documents concerning land  administration and transactions, maps and land surveys across  historical periods, and interviews with local leaders and legal  practititioners.  The research will detail the different sequenc es  through which territorial states constructed private property  regimes and under what conditions these different sequences led to  conflicts between the state and local people and among local  people.  In this light, the project will describe and assess the  many implications of these sociolegal processes for understanding  global change.   ***",
