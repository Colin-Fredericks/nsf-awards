 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most significant advances in our understanding                       of development of the brain during the past two decades                         is the realization that nerve connections made during                           embryonic life undergo substantial rearrangement as the                         nervous system matures.  Some connections are eliminated,                       while others become strengthened and stabilized.                                Evidence suggests that this rearrangement results from a                        competitive interaction between adjacent nerve                                  connections in a manner that depends upon the pattern of                        nerve activity, which is in turn triggered by the sensory                       input from the environment.  This activity-dependent                            competition between adjacent connections has been                               observed in both central and peripheral nervous systems,                        but the mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is                            poorly understood.  In the previous granting period of                          this project, it was discovered that activity-dependent                         competition can be observed in isolated synaptic                                connections in a simple cell culture.  This finding opens                       the possibility of experimentally addressing the problem                        of synaptic competition effectively at cellular and                             molecular levels.  In the present project, a series of                          experiments will be carried out that will result in an                          insight into the mechanism responsible for modulating the                       strength of synaptic connections.  This should lead to an                       understanding of how adjacent synapses on a single                              postsynaptic cell compete for survival and of the                               physiological and morphological changes at the synapse                          during the process of synaptic competition.  The results                        from these studies will help us to understand how nerve                         connections are modified during development of the                              nervous system.",
