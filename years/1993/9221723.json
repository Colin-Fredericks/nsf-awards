 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1985 the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County                     (LACM) echinoderm holdings increased 1900%, from 2000% to over                  40000 lots, chiefly through the incorporation of the Allan                      Hancock Foundation Collection and other \"orphaned\" material.                    LACM now houses the largest echinoderm collection in the western                United States and the third largest in the country; its coverage                is cosmopolitan, with the unexcelled representation of the                      eastern Pacific and Caribbean faunas.  A previous NSF grant, now                nearing completion, supported the transfer of the collection to                 the permanent, environmentally controlled collection space                      furnished by the museum, and a curatorial upgrade, of part of the               collection.  Additional efforts are necessary to complete the                   upgrade and reorganize the collection.  This project will (1)                   purchase and install museum cases and shelves, and move specimens               from inadequate storage equipment to new units, and (2) complete                and urgently needed transfer of specimens to satisfactory                       containers and preservatives.  These improvements will ensure the               collections availability for scientific research.                               %%%                                                                             Collections such as those of the LACM are invaluable resources                  not only for the performance of primary research but also for                   other diverse activities.  Exhibit and educational activities                   based upon the collections underwrite the scientific literacy of                the general population.  As well the collections are important to               the documentation and assessment of the impacts of development                  projects.//",
