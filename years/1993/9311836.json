 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311836  Demarest    Under the direction of Dr. Arthur Demarest, Ms. Antonia Foias will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will analyze  ceramic materials collected from sites in the Petexbatun region of  the Peten, Guatemala and which span the period from ca. 650 - 950  A.D. It was during this time that the Mayan societies in this  region reached their highest point of development and then  collapsed. Through extensive previous work by Dr. Demarest and his  collaborators in this central Mayan region, the major sites are  known, a ceramic chronology established and a large amount of  material excavated. Over a 10 month field period Ms. Foias will  continue her ongoing analysis of the ceramic remains. She will  categorize pieces according to a type/variety system to establish  relative ages. She will then record a number of observations to  determine the degree of standardization within classes and learn  how this changes over both time and space. These data will give  insight into the context of production. Ms. Foias wishes to learn  whether commercialization and mass production - as measured by  degree of standardization - increased over time and whether this  process resulted in smaller competing centers. She will also  determine the frequency of non-local materials which may indicate  invasion. Ms. Foias will also conduct neutron activation analysis  of selected materials at the Smithsonian Institution. The resultant  trace element data will provide information relevant to questions  of both standardization and foreign influence.    Well before the arrival of Columbus in the New World the Mayan  civilization flourished in the inhospitable tropical environment of  lowland Middle America. Many of the areas in which Mayans  constructed large temples and ceremonial complexes support only low  population densities today. After reaching a peak in the first  millennium A.D. monumental construction ceased and people abandoned  urban centers to disperse into smaller groups. Archaeologist s wish  to understand the causes of this \"collapse\" and have proposed a  number of hypotheses to account for it. These range from  environmental depletion through foreign conquest. Ms. Foais will  employ ceramic data to evaluate a number of these options.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also shed light on  how complex societies arise, function and decline. Finally, it will  assist in the training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
