This partial support will help the                 project's mission of implementing and deploying freely available                leading-edge internet routing software for the general good of the              internetworking infrastructure.                                                      The Gatedaemon Project produces \"gated,\" a modular software                program which supports multiple routing protocols.  This software               was first used to interconnect the original NSFNET and the emerging             regional networks.  since gated's routing protocol implementations              are freely available, as they have improved they have become de                 facto reference implementations.  It is now distributed by several              system vendors and used by several router vendors in their                      products.  It is also considered to be a platform for routing                   protocol research.",
