 "awd_abstract_narration": "Math libraries are an important part of programming                             environments that support the development of application                        software.  While broadly available on sequential computers,                     math libraries are rare for parallel computers - especially in                  the case of distributed computing across networks of                            workstations.                                                                                                                                                   This project is to conduct research leading to a portable                       version of the LAPACK library for network distributed                           computers.  LAPACK was selected since it is probably the most                   important math library in use today.  The key research issues                   to resolve in this project are to find data decompositions and                  algorithms that support efficient execution with the coarse                     granularities found on networks of workstations.                                                                                                                These results will be analyzed as part of the feasibility                       study.  They will form the basis of the work plan for                           implementing the library for the Phase II proposal that would                   follow.",
