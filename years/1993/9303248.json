 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because recent studies in lakes and rivers indicate that                   trophic interactions strongly influence community structure, it                 might be expected that such interactions would similarly influence              wetland communities.  However while the primary producers examined              in most lake and river studies were live plants, most consumable                primary production in wetlands is detritus.  Thus food web dynamics             in wetlands probably differ from those in other aquatic systems.                Previous wetland researchers have manipulated the bottom-up force               of detritus biomass but detritivore populations often don't                     respond; wetland detritivores may not be resource limited.  Few                 investigations have examined how wetland detritivores are                       influenced by top-down forces of predation.  Experiments that                   examine how bottom-up interactions with detritus and top-down                   interactions with predators concurrently affect populations of                  detritivorous midges are planned.  Using enclosure/exclosure                    mesocosms (2 x 2 m) in a New York wetland, the following phenomena              will be examined: midge responses to plant litter biomass, first-               level predator densities (insects), and second-level predator                   densities (fish).  The relative influences on midges of food and                habitat heterogeneity from detritus will be determined.                         %%%                                                                             Wetland habitats are arguably the least understood of all aquatic               habitats and are the most endangered as well.  These days, policy               decisions regarding wetlands are being made with insufficient                   scientific information.  In addition to addressing theoretical                  questions about wetlands, this work has implications for applied                ecology because midges are important links between primary                      producers and higher level consumers (such as passerine birds and               waterfowl).",
