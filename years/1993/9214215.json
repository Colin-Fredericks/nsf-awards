 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Pittsburgh Supercomputer                       Center (PSC) to aid in the purchase of a massively parallel                     computer (Cray T3D).  The purchase is part of a project that                    includes operations and systems support of benefit to                           biological researchers around the country via network access                    to the PSC.                                                                                                                                                     In recent years, efforts to improve the speed of the largest                    and fastest general purpose computers has focused on the use                    of so-called \"massively parallel\" architectures.  In these                      computers, a very large number of processors are                                interconnected so that complex calculations can be broken                       into a number of component problems that are solved                             separately and simultaneously by the processors.  The                           earliest computers of this type employed very large numbers                     of the relatively slow processors typical of personal                           computers.  The  most recent designs,  such as the T3D, use                     a smaller (but still large) number of the very powerful                         processors typically found in advanced scientific                               workstations.  Although the use of parallel computers for                       analysis of computationally intensive problems in biology is                    still in its infancy,  many of these problems are well-                         suited to \"parallelization\"; the availability of this                           computer to all researchers through the auspices of the PSC                     is expected to have a significant impact on understanding of                    biological problems as diverse as the structures of                             individual proteins and the function of the nervous system.",
