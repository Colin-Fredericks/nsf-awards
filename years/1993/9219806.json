 "awd_abstract_narration": "To provide insight into the substrate specificity, catalytic                    mechanism and structure of a proteolytic enzyme, mutant trypsins                will be generated using current methods of protein engineering.                 Two general approaches are used to alter the enzyme: 1) targeted                substitutions followed by analysis of the variant enzyme 2) region              specific substitutions coupled with a genetic selection\\screen.  In             each case, mutants of trypsin are generated according to structural             and/or functional principles to 1) understand the specificity and               catalytic power of the enzyme and 2) use our understanding to alter             the activity of the enzyme in a predictable fashion.  Variant                   enzymes are designed, isolated and purified, and their kinetic                  parameters compared with the native enzyme.  Selected mutants are               then chosen for more detailed kinetic, theoretical and 3-D                      structure analysis.  Results from the initial modifications will                provide a basis for introducing future amino acid changes into the              enzyme.  Initial experiments have been successful in addressing the             role of specific amino acids in substrate recognition and catalytic             mechanism of the enzyme and in using that information to alter the              enzyme activity using designed metal binding sites.  Proposed                   experiments involve amino acid replacements of active site residues             for studies involving the catalytic mechanism and substrate                     recognition.  Variant trypsins are designed by computer modeling                based on our current understanding of trypsin and/or its structural             and functional relationship to related enzymes such.  Methods are               also being                                                                      developed to screen large libraries of variant trypsins using                   genetic selections and bacteriophage display technologies.                      %%%                                                                             These studies will contribute to our understanding of                           structure/function relationships in the enzyme trypsin and related              serine proteases.  In addition, these studies will help provide a               framework for the de novo design of enzymes. //",
