 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project involves the synthesis of linear and              dendrimeric polymers that contain covalently-bound chromophores                 will serve a dual purpose as fluorescent probes to characterize the             polymer system itself or to elucidate the effect of the polymer                 environment on photochemical processes.  The polymers to be studied             are amphiphilic, with a hydrophobic block or end and a hydrophilic              block or surface.  Because of the strong differences in the                     solubility of these blocks the materials can self-assemble into                 micelle structures or adsorb onto hydrophobic surfaces, including               liquid-liquid interfaces.  The nature of the self-assembly depends              on the molecular architecture and solvent/temperature conditions.               A combination of fluorescence methods such as energy transfer,                  time-dependent fluorescence depolarization, and fluorescence                    quenching will be used to characterize the environment and spatial              arrangement of polymer segments in the following systems:  1)                   polymer micelles from diblock polymers; 2) surface adsorbed diblock             or hydrophobically end-tagged polymers; 3) polymers covalently end-             grafted to surfaces; 4) dendrimeric polymers either in homogeneous              solution or covalently bonded to a surface.  In addition to these               synthetic and photophysical experiments, we have undertaken the                 application of computational methods to simulate polymers at                    interfaces.  These are expected to help in the design and                       interpretation of our experiments and provide a useful additions to             the numerical methods available to test predictions or analytical               theory of polymers at interfaces.                                                                                                                               This photophysical research aims to clarify how polymers can modify             or effect reactions at interfaces.  Potential applications include              photoreactive films, gels, micelles, and surfactants.",
