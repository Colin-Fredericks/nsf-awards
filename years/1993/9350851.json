 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to reform the chemistry curriculum and                        increase retention through hands-on student use of                              visualization computers in introductory chemistry courses. Wide                 variation in ability to comprehend concepts, poor college                       preparation and inadequate writing and language skills of many                  students, demand that concepts be presented in an engaging                      fashion so as to allow immediate grasp of principles regardless                 of the students' background. Customized applications will be                    quickly and easily developed by combining courseware already                    written by the author with the large amount of shareware                        available at public archive sites and commercial software such                  as Mathematica, Interface Builder, and Renderman. This                          interactive courseware will be used to illustrate abstract                      concepts and model complex phenomena. Students will explore the                 effect of changing parameters on a variety of complicated                       chemical systems. Pre-lab exercises using computer simulations                  will familiarize students with equipment and laboratory                         protocols before performing experiments.  Students will                         electronically mail data and lab reports, with graphics and                     sound annotations as well, and receive the instructor's voice-                  annotated and written comments in return.",
