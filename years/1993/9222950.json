 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological developments enable science to gather or produce                  massively complex data sets which cannot be analyzed or understood              via traditional methods.  Instead, new computationally intensive                methods of visualization and simulation have been developed for the             analysis of data and the testing of models and theories.  These                 developments call into question traditional concepts and                        dichotomies used by those researchers, including philosophers of                science,  to analyze science.  They also call into question                     standard accounts of testing and confirmation.                                                                                                                  Under this professional development fellowship, Dr. Frederick Suppe             is focusing on analyzing the sorts of interpretive arguments that               lie at the heart of manipulating and using scientific data via                  these new methods.  He is studying these methods as a participant-              observer on a research team in structural geology.                                                                                                              Scientists are taught to do empirical research largely through                  apprenticeship as graduate students.  In the training component of              this fellowship, Dr. Suppe is spending a year in an Earth and                   planetary structural lab undergoing such an apprenticeship as a                 participant-observer mentored by one of the world's leading                     structural geologists.  His lab uses the new computer data methods              as it regularly produces major developments in Earth and planetary              structural geology such as discovering the tectonic structure of                Venus.",
