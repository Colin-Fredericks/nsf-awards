Sanchez, both of the Instituto Tecnologico de                                   Monterrey (ITESM).  The proposed research focuses                               on the development of fuzzy logic based                                         intelligent control strategies for applications                                 in manufacturing automation and specifically in                                 the development of control strategies for                                       autonomous operation of unit manufacturing                                      processes.  The emphasis will be on application                                 areas where the complexity of the unit                                          manufacturing process, and the amount of                                        interaction among the subsystems involved,                                      preclude the application of conventional control                                engineering methods.                                                                                                                                            Integration of the activities of human operators                                in relation to the operation of unit                                            manufacturing processes requires the ability to                                 control rather complex large scale systems  These                               systems are generally nonlinear, from a dynamical                               subsystems standpoint, and are made up of                                       multiple interacting subsystems.  Current                                       techniques in control theory, primarily focused                                 on linear systems, are not optimally designed for                               this category of problems.  The researchers aim                                 to show that fuzzy logic, an alternative to                                     classical logic, provides a viable means for                                    dealing with the reality of manufacturing process                               control in that it enables one to deal more                                     effectively with the issue of complexity that                                   inevitably arises in this context.  This                                        collaboration should bring together well-                                       established research teams in both countries to                                 solve management and control problems of complex                                manufacturing systems.",
