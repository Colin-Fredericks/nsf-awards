In                       February 1992, a special alternative computer keyboard,                         IntelliKeys, was given the coveted first prize in The Johns                     Hopkins University National Search for Computing to Assist                      Persons with Disabilities.  Results of the Phase I Small Business               Innovation Research (SBIR) study by the creators of Intellikeys                 establish the technical basis for the development custom overlays               for IntelliKeys, a new set of educational tools that has as its                 purpose increasing the accessibility of computers and computer                  software for individuals with disabilities.  The research                       objectives of the Phase II study focus on (1) identifying the                   characteristics of effective custom overlays; and (2) developing                and testing materials based upon those characteristics, including               custom mathematics and science overlays; mathematics and science                Curriculum Activity Booklets; and a teachers' \"how-to\" manual so                that teachers will be able to create their own curriculum-based                 custom overlays that will be of maximum benefit to each                         particular student.  The project will make an important                         contribution to the mandate of Public Law 94-142 which stipulates               that to the greatest degree possible students with disabilities                 should have access to educational opportunities equal to those of               their able-bodied peers.",
