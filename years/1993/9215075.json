 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last two decades representation theory of affine                Lie algebras has led to many interesting and important                          applications in many areas of mathematics and physics.  One such                connection has been established with certain two dimensional                    solvable lattice models in statistical mechanics.  The                          interaction between quantum affine Lie algebras and solvable                    lattice models has recently led to many new discoveries both in                 representation theory of affine and quantum affine Lie algebras                 as well as solvable lattice models and integrable systems.                      Professor Miwa is a pioneer in this field and possesses a unique                overview.  He can give a well organized presentation of the major               ideas and recent research results, and prescribe future                         directions for research in this field, during the course of the                 ten lectures.                                                                        This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Application of the                   Representation Theory of Quantum Affine Lie Algebras to Solvable                Lattice Models, to be held June 1 - 5, 1993, on the main campus                 of North Carolina State University in Raleigh.  Professor Tetsuji               Miwa will be the principal lecturer/  To stimulate interest and                 activity in mathematical research, the National Science                         Foundation each year supports a number of NSF-CBMS Regional                     Research Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences.  Each five-day               conference features a distinguished lecturer who delivers ten                   lectures on a topic on important current research in one sharply                focused area of the mathematical sciences.  The lecturer                        subsequently prepares an expository monograph based upon these                  lectures, which is normally published by the American                           Mathematical Society or the Society for Industrial and Applied                  Mathematics, or jointly by the American Statistical Association                 and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.  Certain features                 differentiate these conferences from typical research                           conferences.  These are:  (1) Focus on a single important and                   timely area of research by a leading practitioner,  (2) Continued               effect and local stimulation through regional emphasis,  (3)                    Panel review for quality, breadth, and timeliness, and  (4)                     Published monographs for a wider audience.",
