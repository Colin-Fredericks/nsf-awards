Using the  wells, physical hydrogeology students are determining in the  field the hydrologic properties of the aquifer including  ground-water flow directions and velocities.  Slug and pumping  tests, ground-water sampling techniques, and downhole  geophysical methods are being used by these students.  Chemical  hydrogeology students are collecting and comparing the water  chemistry from lysimeters, ground-water wells, and surface  waters to determine the chemical differences between ground and  surface waters.  Students are collecting and utilizing  hydrogeological parameters for capture zone and wellhead  protection strategies.  Water resource students are utilizing  the ground-water wells to determine the hydrologic  relationships between surface and groundwater and their effect  on a local flood-control structure.  ***y",
