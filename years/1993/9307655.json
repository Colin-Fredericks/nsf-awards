 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307655  Gilbert       This project will develop adaptive tools for decomposing  function spaces that extend methods from Fourier analysis and  wavelet theory.  Specific functions are to be analyzed through  the selection of a particular wavelet well-adapted to the  function.  Criteria for choosing the matched wavelet come from  the specific application which creates the function.  Families of  analyzing wavelets will be designed having specific smoothness  and decay properties needed for establishing such optimization  criteria.  Frame decompositions will also be studied in  vector-valued settings in relation to extensions of the affine  group and corresponding representation theory.  This work will  draw on a theory, developed recently which relates the  generalized Cauchy- Riemann systems to unitarizable  representations of groups containing the affine group.  A  particularly relevant example, previously studied by Torresani,  is the semidirect product of the affine group with the Heisenberg  group.  Corresponding frame decompositions will incorporate  aspects of both the short-time Fourier transform and wavelet  expansions.        Mathematical research focusing on wavelets and  frame decompositions has its roots in classical harmonic analysis  but derives its recent impetus from studies in signal  processing. Here, the wavelet concept has proved remarkably  effective in analyzing signals composed of both stationary and  transient features.  Traditional Fourier methods have not been  effective tools in these studies.  Applications to research on  acoustics, data compression and partial differential equations  has already proven the worth of the newly developing ideas.  ***",
