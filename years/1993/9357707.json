 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building machines that learn from experience is an important  research goal of artificial intelligence.  Recently,  considerable research  attention has been devoted to the theoretical study of machine learning.    This project focuses on several new directions designed to enhance the  current  learning models to more accurately model real-life  learning situations.  Most  work in the area of concept  learning assumes there is a well-defined border  that divides  all objects into those that are instances of the concept and  those that are not.  In reality, though, categorization of  objects is often not  so clear cut:  an algorithm designed to  read handwritten cheques will likely  encounter many  handwritten characters that look somewhat like a `4,` and  somewhat like a `9.`  In these situations, one possible goal  for the learner is  to determine which objects are  unclassifiable (i.e., the classification is not  clear cut)  as well as determining the classifications of objects which  are  classifiable.  Another possibility is to require only  that the learner  determine a categorization so that no  object is incorrectly categorized.  Thus,  for this second  goal, the learner can arbitrarily categorize those objects  that can go either way. This project defines and studies learning models for  both possibilities.  Also this  project continues the PI's work  initiated on developing and studying formal models of teaching to  understand how a teacher with knowledge of the target concept and the learner  can reduce the training time needed by the learner.  As well as being of  theoretical interest,  there are potential applications of the research to  improving automated manufacturing environments.",
