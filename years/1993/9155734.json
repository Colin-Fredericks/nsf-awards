 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to conduct a longitudinal                        study that will investigate, over a period of two years, teh                    constructive paths that children generate when solving                          problematic situations that deal with fractional numbers,                       and the communication patterns that they develop in their                       efforts to explain their solutions.  Twelve children will                       participate in the study when they are in third grade and                       again when they are in fourth grade.  The researchers will                      develop models of the children's constructive processes in                      generating fractional numbers and will also develop models                      of the communication patterns of student-student and                            student-teacher social interaction.                                                                                                                             Several research questions form the basis of this                               longitudinal study: Is children's ability to construct and                      operate with different composite units essential in the                         construction of part-whole relations that children can                          quantify fractionally using the multiplicity of the parts in                    the whole?  Does conventional symbolization of fractions                        require a priori developmental constructive processes of the                    concept of fractions before it becomes meaningful to a                          child?  Do children generate their own algorithms to operate                    with fractions?  Are these algorithms similar to the                            conventional ones?  What do children gain cognitively from                      social interaction and under what circumstances?  What                          aspects of social interaction contribute to children's                          advances of their fraction concepts?  Are there differences                     in the role of social interaction depending on the child's                      age?                                                                                                                                                            The results of this project will contribute to the                              understanding of 1) children's conceptualizations of                            fractions over a long period of time (two years); 2) the                        influence of their knowledge of natural numbers on the                          constructive development of fractional numbers; 3) the role                     of social interaction (with peers and teacher) in the                           construction and evolution of children's concepts of                            fractions; 4) the cognitive demands required to symbolize                       concepts that had been developed mentally and verbalized                        using natural language.",
