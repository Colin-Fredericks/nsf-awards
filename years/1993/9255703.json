 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Self Help Elementary Level Science (SHELLS) Part II is                      the continuation of the video project SHELLS I.  It is                          intended primarily for administrators, teachers, school                         volunteers and parents to learn how to minimize, circumvent                     or even eliminate some of the obstacles of doing science in                     elementary schools.  Since physical science is the most                         problematic content for adults and children alike eighty                        percent of series content deals in physical science                             concepts.  Part I consists of a set of seven half hour                          shows:  five programs on force and motion topics; one on                        instruction using physical science concepts and one show on                     administration topics related to implementing and                               maintaining a strong elementary science program.  In                            addition there is a 10-minute overview tape for Part I to                       serve orientation and dissemination functions.  The design                      goal is to make the shows sufficiently appealing and                            instructive to motivate adult viewers to become advocates                       for elementary science and to feel some satisfaction and joy                    in doing so.  This proposal for SHELLS Part II will provide                     print materials for the videos completed in Part I and an                       in-depth evaluation of the project.",
