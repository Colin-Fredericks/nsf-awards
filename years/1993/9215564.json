 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on decentralized rules for coordinating              work in a manufacturing system.  For example, workers might move                from station to station, each following a simple rule that tells                what to do next.  For properly designed rule sets, global                       coordination of the workers can evolve spontaneously from their                 independent activities.  Thus the production line can be self-                  organizing:  without management intervention it constantly                      reallocates work to maximize throughput, even under perturbations               such as changes in the number of workers or in the time required                to perform a task.                                                                   This idea is in contradistinction to less flexible means of                production, such as the classical assembly line, in which a                     centralized authority allocates work by making a one-time                       assignment of tasks and workers to stations.  This assignment is                then rigidly followed by all workers.  Experiments and validation               of results will be carried out in collaboration with industrial                 laboratories and manufacturing facilities.",
