 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308953  Prabhu       The research will investigate a new approach to Linear   Programming (LP).  The approach exploits fundamental results from   Convex Polytope Theory and Polarity Theory that have not been   applied to LP computation previously.  Preliminary studies suggest   that the approach has prospects of yielding an efficient algorithm   that could be faster than the current LP algorithms.  The work   describes two methods for devising an efficient LP algorithm based   on the suggested approach:  Gale Transform Method and Simplicial   Refinement Method.  The methods apply classic results on the   combinatorial and  metric structure of polytopes to make   computation efficient.  Computational experiments on the methods   will be undertaken in parallel with theoretical investigations in   order to ensure that the resulting algorithm will be theoretically   efficient.         Enormous theoretical and computational research effort has   been expended in the past on attempts to convert the edge-following   Simplex method into a worst-case polynomial-time algorithm .  The   Generalized Simple scheme can be significant, in that it proffers   a fresh approach to the quest for worst-case polynomial-time   Simplex algorithms.  If these goals are achieved, the results will   have significant impact in solving real world problems.",
