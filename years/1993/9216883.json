 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-day workshop is planned to be convened in Minneapolis               during Spring, 1993,  which will bring together leading academic                scholars in organizational and work-industry research to discuss                issues involved in conducting employer-employee surveys.  The four              principal investigators of the 1991 National Organizations Study                (NOS),  which interviewed informants in the establishments                      employing the respondents and spouses sampled by the 1991 General               Social Survey,  will relate their experiences and assess                        alternative research designs for employer-employee surveys.  Other              participants will make individual presentations about the                       importance of the data sets for the user community,  the merits of              alternative sampling designs,  and the value of various scales and              measures of organizational properties.                                                                                                                                 The results of the workshop will clarify unresolved issues               in conducting and analyzing employer-employee surveys.  By securing             advice from a broad range of researchers,  this continuing data                 base endeavor will attain maximum utility for potential users.",
