 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral               Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of how  intra-elite               competition and alliances in the state of Pernambuco in the early               19th  century influenced the development of the Brazilian  state.               The  research involves documentary research in local and regional               archives  in  Brazil.   Results will  be  analyzed  in  terms  of               competing theories of state formation.                                                                                                                                This  research  will  contribute  to  a  rapidly-developing               literature on the emergence of the modern nation state, providing               data  on  how a centralized state emerges partly as a  result  of               political competition and pressure from below, rather that simply               through  vigorous  imposition from above.   In  addition  to  the               scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award  will               materially  assist  a  highly  promising  student  in  completing               research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to  the               future  scientific  manpower of the  national  and  the  thorough               training of the next generation of sociologists.",
