 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304662  Moroney  Unicellular algae, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have the  capacity to concentrate carbon dioxide internally, allowing these  organisms to grow photoautotrophically at carbon dioxide  concentrations lower than most higher plants can tolerate.  This  carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism is inducible; it is present  only in cells that have been grown with limiting carbon dioxide  conditions.  An important aspect of this Ci (Ci = CO2 + HCO3- +  CO3-2) accumulation system is located in the chloroplasts.  Intact  chloroplasts isolated from low carbon dioxide-grown C. reinhardtii  cells retain the ability to accumulate Ci to much higher levels  than intact chloroplasts isolated from high carbon dioxide-grown  cells.  During the last grant period, Dr. Moroney has identified at  least six polypeptides that are specifically induced by growth on  low carbon dioxide and are missing in the high carbon dioxide-  requiring strain cia-5.  One of these inducible proteins is a  carbonic anhydrase located in the periplasmic space and another is  a 36 kDa polypeptide localized to the chloroplast envelope.  The  locations of other inducible proteins and their functions are  unknown.  In the past year, a cDNA library to C. reinhardtii cells  adapting to low carbon dioxide conditions has been constructed.  By  differential hybridization, four classes of recombinant phages have  been identified that contain genes that are preferentially  expressed under four classes low carbon dioxide conditions.    It is proposed to study the carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism  in C. reinhardtii by characterizing the components of this  transport system and by delineating the role of the chloroplast in  carbon dioxide acquisition.  Dr. Moroney will first characterize  the low carbon dioxide-inducible genes recently identified and  connect these genes with the polypeptides known to be induced by  low carbon dioxide growth conditions.  Antibodies will be raised  against fusion proteins consisting of t he lacZ protein linked to  the product of the inducible gene.  These antibodies will then be  used to localize the proteins within the C. reinhardtii cell using  organelle preparations outlined within the proposal.  Dr. Moroney  will also generate mutants that require high carbon dioxide,  focussing on strains that are missing only one of the inducible  polypeptides.  It is hoped to eventually link a specific gene with  its gene product and with a strain deficient in that gene product.   The characterization of the proteins of this transport system will  increase our understanding of the low carbon dioxide adjustment in  algae and the role of the chloroplast in this photosynthetic  adaptation.  ***",
