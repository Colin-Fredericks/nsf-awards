 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interdisciplinary field of \"connectionism\", or \"neural                      networks,\" explores computer systems that are loosely modeled on                the human brain.  These systems, composed of large numbers of                   simple neuron-like computing elements, exhibit a variety of                     intelligent behaviors, including the ability to recognize visual                images (e.g., handwriting recognition), store and remember facts by             association, control complex mechanical systems (e.g., robot arms),             understand natural language, and learn from experience.  The field              has experienced rapid growth in recent years and is now enjoying an             explosion of popularity, due in large part to the rapid rate of                 advances and practical applications of recent theoretical                       developments.  Connectionism provides a possible approach to                    solving complex problems in artificial intelligence and pattern                 recognition for which no other approaches appear viable.                        Connectionist models are being used successfully in the real world              and have opened new possibilities for explaining aspects of human               cognition and perception.                                                                                                                                       Research in the field requires remarkably broad and deep training               in a number of areas--neurobiology, cognitive science, theoretical              foundations, computational methods, engineering applications, and               hardware implementation.  Some students are fortunate enough to                 receive training from leaders in one or two areas, but few if any               have access to the full breadth of high-quality training required.              For this reason, Summer Schools have been organized to train top                young researchers and to encourage interdisciplinary research                   collaboration.  These Summer Schools provide an intense and                     stimulating opportunity for graduate students to become immersed in             the latest research in this fast-changing field.  The success of                the previous Summer Schools has been widely acknowledged; they have             had an extremely important catalytic effect on the field.  Many of              the leading young researchers in the field today attended a                     previous Summer School, and their research directions and                       contributions were influenced by the experience.                                                                                                                The next Summer School will be held in Boulder, Colorado from June              21 through July 3, 1993.  The faculty of the 1993 Summer School                 will consist of approximately twenty leading researchers from the               US and Canada.  Sixty-five graduate students will be selected by a              competitive admissions process for the 12-day intensive program.                This funding will allow graduate students to be selected on the                 basis of merit and potential for contributing to the field.",
