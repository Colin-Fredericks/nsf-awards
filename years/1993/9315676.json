 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315676  Spontak    The resolution of a conventional optical microscope, limited by  diffraction in the \"far-field,\" is dictated by the wavelength of  the electromagnetic radiation employed.  Recent studies have  successfully demonstrated that a microscope based on a drawn  optical fiber and operated within very close proximity to a  specimen (in the \"near-field\") is limited by the size of the probe  (to ca. 20 nm) and not by considerations.  In this work, we will  carry out an exploratory program in which polarization near-field  scanning optical microscopy (PNSOM) is developed and applied as a  novel characterization technique to determine the spatial  distribution of local molecular organization (through  birefringence) in a variety of ordered polymeric materials.   Several systems will be targeted for initial studies in this  program.  Local birefringence in a liquid crystal/polymer emulsion  (for electro-optical applications) would provide information  regarding molecular organization at the crystal/polymer interface.   In-situ studies of thermotropic and lyotropic polymers will permit  determination of local supramolecular organization preceding  mesophase formation and reorganization accompanying thermal  treatment.    While these systems will be the focus of our initial studies, we  foresee PNSOM as a high-resolution imaging technique promising to  prove beneficial in studies involving crystallization, surface  orientation, localized stress, and phase compatibilization.  This  technique is non-destructive and does not require the capital,  maintenance, and high-vacuum needed by several high-resolution  imaging techniques.  ***",
