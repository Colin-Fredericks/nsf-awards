Peabody Museum which is a part of Phillips Academy.  Although the museum holds important scientific collections, these  are difficult to use because of cataloging and storage problems.  In this first phase of a long term project Dr. Bradley and his  colleagues will focus on materials recovered from archaeological  excavations in New England. They will check the physical  locations of individual collections and compare them against  handwritten catalog entries. After verification, information will  be entered into a computerized data base. Objects themselves  will, where necessary, be repacked both to enhance preservation  and permit easy access.    The R.S. Peabody Museum was established in 1901 and in addition  to serving as a repository, has played an extremely active role  in field research. Much of this was local and therefore the New  England collections are particularly strong and extensive. They  document thousands of years of prehistory in this region and  permit archaeologists not only to reconstruct culture history but  to look at issues such as environmental change and human-  environment interactions.    Archaeological collections in museums constitute an important  scientific data base and should play a central role in research.  However when they are improperly stored and catalogued they are  extremely difficult to use. Such is the case at the Phillips  Peabody Museum  and Dr. Bradley's project is important because it  will help to remedy this situation.",
