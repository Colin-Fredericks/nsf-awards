 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311216  Glen  Dr. Glen is completing his decade-long study of the history of the  current mass extinction debates.  These debates were opened in 1980  by the advent of the Alvarez-Berkeley group hypothesis that the  second greatest extinction in Earth's history which occurred 65  million years ago was caused by the impact of a meteorite.  This  hypothesis triggered a number of corollary and alternative ideas,  including that of periodic mass extinctions which prompted the  further surmise that meteoritic impacting was also periodic.   Within months, periodicity was addressed by three alternative  astronomical hypotheses that sought to regularly shower the earth  with comets.  Other hypotheses arose that speak to various aspects  of the biosphere, atmosphere and lithosphere bearing on mass  extinctions.  By 1984, the explosive-volcanism hypothesis emerged  to fuel the debates as the strongest alternative to the impact  hypothesis.  Over the past 13 years, the growing upheaval has  spawned more than 2500 professional publications representing  almost a dozen different disciplines and opened windows on  multiple, interconnected theoretical conflicts in science.  Closure  has not been reached on any of the many debated issues.    Dr. Glen's study is underpinned by a perhaps singularly  comprehensive, stage-specific data base with a full range of  primary historical materials including large oral and ethnographic  components collected as the debates progressed.  His study touches  on how perceptions form and changge in science as arguments evolve,  including the phenomenon of conversion to an opposing hypothesis;  the role of theory choice in the assessment of evidence; the  influence of disciplinary specialty in theory choice, and how  theory choice and discipline influence the selection, use, and  origin of standards of appraisal.    ***",
