 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the development of a diode-pumped                    solid state laser for material processing.  The laser is expected               to demonstrate 45% conversion efficiency from diode pump light to               fiber coupled light at 2 and 1 micron wavelengths.  The increased               efficiency results from the novel pumping geometry which traps the              light into an optical cavity containing the laser rod.  Also,                   diodes produce only light which is directly usable by the solid-                state material, reducing the thermal difficulties associated with               arc lamp sources which produce light throughout the spectrum.                        The research seeks to develop a small-scale laser to                       deliver at least 8 watts of power through the optical fiber at 2                micron and 1 micron wavelengths.  The geometry can potentially                  deliver 500 watts from a single industrial-sized laser. Multiple                rods of this size can be coupled to achieve multi-kilowatt power                delivery through a single optical fiber.  Thus, the research is                 focused on results that could lead to  next generation equipment                that could substantially raise production rates and reduce costs                in manufacturing processes such as welding and cutting.",
