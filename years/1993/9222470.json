 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coordination of complex integrated movements is one of the                  most challenging tasks that faces the nervous system.  An                       experimental approach that has proved very fruitful is the study                of simple model systems.  Crayfish have nervous systems where it                is possible to identify a limited number of neurons that control                swimming behavior.  Dr. Mulloney has been a pioneer in the study                of this nervous system.  With NSF support he has found that the                 movement of each separate limb is driven by a specialized local                 circuit of neurons specific for that limb.  Coordination of limb                movements is controlled by a separate circuit of interneurons.                  This is a major advance in our understanding of movement control.               With the renewal of this grant, Dr. Mulloney will be able to                    describe the synaptic organization of these local circuits and                  identify the properties necessary for normal coordination.  He                  will also describe the cellular mechanisms by which inputs                      descending from higher centers can change the state of these                    local circuits to modulate swimming rate and direction.  The                    results will have broad applications in the design of robot                     locomotion systems.  The type of distributed control identified                 in this system is emerging as a general principle for the                       guidance of locomotion in multi-appendage systems.***//",
