 "awd_abstract_narration": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology requests support from                NSF for connection of the Vermont State Colleges which includes:                Castleton State College, Johnson State College, Lyndon State                    College, Vermont Technical College, and the Community College of                Vermont; the University of New Haven; New Hampshire College and                 the Graduate School of Business; University of New England, and                 Salve Regina University to the New England Academic Research                    Network (Nearnet) which is the NSF mid-level network that serves                the New England area.  A primary goal of NEARnet is to facilitate               collaborative projects and sharing of resources between                         institution, including those outside the state.                                      NEARnet will provide operations management and information                 services and it will give the universities and colleges a                       connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per               second) National Backbone network.                                                   The each of the universities has written a description of                  its organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet                    access that it expects including: greater functionality and                     network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and               make file transfers along with being able to implement a more                   reliable mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit                from the links.  This is also a unique opportunity for the                      schools to explore innovative educational resources.  Their                     diversity will expose NEARnet to a broader range of user                        requirements.  Nearnet will use the information obtained by                     serving this diverse group for the benefit of New England's                     academic and research community.",
