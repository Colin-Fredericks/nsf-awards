 "awd_abstract_narration": "A coordinated and integrated management of the Manufacturing               Logistics function is essential for the success of any                          manufacturing enterprise.  Manufacturing Logistics (ML) is defined              as that part of a business enterprise engaged in the planning and               control of inventory and production.  The activities of                         manufacturing logistics range from aggregate production planning                to detailed shop floor scheduling and control and include the                   typical materials management functions of inventory planning,                   production planning and scheduling, purchasing, and material                    control.  These manufacturing management functions interact with                each other and hence proper coordination between them is critical.              The practice of Manufacturing Logistics management is in dire need              of improvement.  In spite of major advances in technology,                      inventory turns (a measure of ML performance) for US manufacturers              has seen no significant improvement over the last four decades.                 While the practice of ML continues, the research effort in ML is                conducted largely by the academic community.                                         This workshop will address three dichotomies among the ML                  researchers and practitioners.  These are:  (1) academic versus                 industry points of view, (2) engineering versus business point of               view, (3) operations research versus information systems point of               view.  If major advances in the practice of ML are to take place                then a long run and coherent point of view will be needed with an               eye toward focussing research talent/efforts to the best advantage.              ***",
