 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will integrate molecular modeling into six existing                 undergraduate chemistry courses in an innovative way which                      consists of combining modeling results with laboratory results,                 thus using an integrated approach to problem solving. The                       process of integrating modeling techniques will be progressive,                 starting with basic operations in lower level courses, adding                   more sophisticated applications in subsequent courses, until                    the student is capable of carrying out a mini-research project                  as part of a senior level course.  Fundamental applications of                  modeling will be introduced in Organic Chemistry and in                         Chemical Applications of Microcomputers.Progressively more                      sophisticated applications will be taught in Advanced                           Techniques of Organic Chemistry and Biochemical Techniques and                  Instrumentation Lab, ultimately allowing students to perform                    mini-research projects in the senior level Advanced Organic                     Chemistry and Medicinal Chemistry. The impact of these changes                  will be to allow students for the first time to visualize                       molecular structures in their minimum energy conformation,                      calculate the relative energies of conformers, measure                          distances and angles between atoms and bonds, predict the                       outcome of physical measurements made later in the laboratory,                  or even predict the product of a chemical reaction that they                    will confirm by synthesis and subsequent instrumental analysis.                 Students will learn how chemistry is really done today in the                   chemical and pharmaceutical industries, using a discovery based                 approach to learning that should stimulate and sustain                          students' interest in chemistry.",
