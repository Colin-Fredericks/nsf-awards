This, yet conjectural, theory is aimed  to unfold the hidden topological pattern of arithmetic geometry.   It helps to explain various phenomena in K-theory and the theory  of algebraic cycles and to provide information about the values  of the special functions of arithmetic origin.  Several results  in that direction have already been obtained, e.g., in a joint  paper with P. Deligne, a proof of part of D. Zagier's conjecture  on the values of the polylogarithm function.  At the moment, the  problem of the actual construction of the category of mixed  motives (at least modulo Grothendieck's Standard Conjectures)  seems to be quite tractable.  The second subject of the project  is the study of the geometry of conformal field theory.  This  theory has been developing rapidly during the last decade.  The  investigator's first modest aim was to write down (jointly with  B. Feigin and B. Mazur) an account of an algebro-geometric  setting.  The next thing to pursue (work in progress with V.  Drinfeld and V. Ginzburg) is a theory, as foreseen by Drinfeld,  relating the representations of Kac-Moody algebras at the  critical level with the geometric version of Langlands'  correspondence.  The ultimate aim of the project is to tie  together the two subjects above, which remains a tantalizing  hope.       The two subjects of this project, conformal field theory and  the theory of motives, have somewhat different origins.   Conformal field theory came first to physics approximately ten  years ago.  It was observed there that often objects at the  critical temperature (the melting ice cube in your glass)  suddenly acquire infinitely greater inner symmetry than before;  this symmetry governs the intricate pattern that singles out the  object.  The mathematical structures that described this soon  became - after the string theory upheaval - the most popular  structures of theoretical physics, a dev elopment that also helped  to connect previously unrelated but intensively studied  mathematical areas such as representation theory of  infinite-dimensional groups, geometry of moduli spaces, and the  Langlands' program.  The first part of this project dwells here.   The theory of motives, discovered by Grothendieck in the  mid-60's, has, in a sense, a similar flavor.  It starts with an  old insight that number theory suggests that one consider the  whole numbers as if they were functions on a certain complicated  space.  This space, with its inner symmetries, replaces the  ordinary geometric notion of a point; morally, the ordinary  geometry acquires an extra arithmetic dimension.  The theory of  motives studies such a geometry.  As an application, it may  provide a range of yet unpredictable results about the values of  the classical arithmetic functions.  ***",
