Ashe of the   Chemistry Department, University of Michigan, on organometallic   compounds of Groups 13, 14, and 15.  Emphasis would be placed   on the investigation of borepins and other compounds with   multiple bonds to carbon, synthesis of polyacetylenes with   heteroatoms on the backbone, and secondary bonding in   dibimuthines and related organobismuth compounds.  Compounds   would be characterized by X-ray crystallography,   electrochemical measurements, and NMR studies.  Delocalization   and aromaticity in borepins will be studied with the aid of   computational methods and some novel compounds of transition   metals with bismolyls will be prepared.  %%%  The general goal of this project is to investigate new   compounds in which elements such as boron, gallium, silicon,   tin, and bismuth have multiple bonds to carbon. The character   and reactivity of these bonds are not well known.  In addition,   many of these species will be associated with transition   metals, introducing the possibility that compounds with   interesting solid state properties wil be formed.  ***",
