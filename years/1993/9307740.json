 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. George Cowgill, Mr. Saburo Sugiyama will             collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Over the course of many             years of excavation by both Mexican and U.S. archaeologists at the              site of Teotihuacan in central Mexico, many sacrificial human                   burials have been uncovered. Recently Dr. Cowgill and his                       colleagues conducted excavations at the large Feathered Serpent                 Pyramid and discovered a number more. Although these materials have             the potential to provide insight into Teotihuacan political, social             and ritual organization they have been relatively little studied.               Mr. Sugiyama's project will help to remedy this. Evidence indicates             that the burials were carefully placed in relation to the pyramid.              Many contain rich grave offerings of carved stone and obsidian                  tools. As a first step, Mr. Sugiyama will plot the spatial                      distribution of the graves and then determine associations with                 burial objects. He will then search for patterns in the arrangement             of materials and place the graves in a chronological context. On                this basis he hopes to reconstruct the rituals involved. Since                  these sacrifices were state ceremonies and ritual was manipulated               directly or indirectly for political goals, understanding of these              ceremonies will also shed light on the organization and maintenance             of the Teotihuacan state.                                                                                                                                       Teotihuacan was one of the largest and most influential cities in               Mesoamerica in Pre-Columbian times. It flourished in central Mexico             between approximately the first century A.D. and the eighth,                    covering about 20 km2 with a population of at least 100,000 during              its peak. The ecological setting, the politics, the economy, the                trade system, the technology, religion and other aspects of                     ideology have been studied for an understanding of the society and              its history per se and for theories about the evolution of ancient              states in worldwide contexts. It is now known that the city was a               unique example of ancient urbanization in the New World. However,               still poorly understood are the specific form of the government and             the nature of the ideological programs in the development and                   functioning of this state. Mr. Sugiyama's research will investigate             these questions.                                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our                   understanding of how complex societies developed and it will assist             in the training of a promising young scientist.",
