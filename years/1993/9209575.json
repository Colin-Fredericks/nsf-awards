 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Age Discrimination in Employment Act was originally enacted in              1968.  It was strengthened in 1979 by transferring enforcement                  authority to the EEOC, and in 1986 by eliminating mandatory                     retirement (for most workers).  The Age Discrimination in                       Employment Act, in particular its abolition of mandatory                        retirement, has been criticized by some economists as impairing the             formation of long-term incentive contracts in labor markets.  In                the current accepted model, such contracts require the institution              of mandatory retirement.                                                                                                                                        This critique emphasizes the point that economists' understanding               of age discrimination and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act              hinges critically on the underlying reasons for the observed                    positive relationship between age and earnings, over much of the                life cycle.  The proposed research will conduct numerous empirical              tests of alternative explanations of this relationship, including:              the human capital model; the long-term incentive-contract model;                and the hypothesis that workers prefer rising wage profiles.  The               research explores theoretical restrictions implied by the                       alternative explanations, as well as data sets uniquely suited to               distinguishing between them.  The research draws on these empirical             tests, as well as other theoretical and empirical results, to                   provide an economic assessment of the Age Discrimination in                     Employment Act.",
