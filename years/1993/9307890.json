 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307890  Radke    The PI has pioneered a novel growing-drop technique for studying  rates of adsorption at fluid/fluid interfaces.  The proposed  growing-drop method relates the instantaneous pressure and size  of a radically expanding liquid drop to the dynamic interfacial  tension arising from sorption of surface-active solutes.   Preliminary measurements with surfactant-free surfaces obtain  accurate tension values over a wide range of tensions and times  and for both liquid/gas and liquid/liquid interfaces.  Initial  modeling establishes that transport of a prototype nonionic  surfactant, 1-decanol, to a radically growing aqueous/air  surfaces is diffusion limited.    This powerful growing-up technique is applied to study  interfacial sorption rates and mechanisms.  Ionic surfactants,  micellar solutions, and surfactant mixtures will be studied, and  theories describing their transport will be developed and tested  experimentally.   Adsorption rates of synthetic and natural  macromolecules will be measured.  Studies of nonionic ethylene  oxide surfactants ranging from two to thousands of ethylene  oxide groups will be undertaken with the goal of defining the  limit at which molecular reorientation at the interface causes  a change from diffusion to kinetic  controlled adsorption.   Likewise, adsorption kinetics of proteins will be investigated  in an attempt to determine the conditions and time scale over  which proteins retain their native configurations at  interfaces.. Finally, the growing-drop apparatus will be  modified to incorporate oscillating drops, this opening new  vistas for understanding desorption kinetics.  Transport of surface-active substances to and across liquid/gas  and liquid/liquid interfaces is a determining factor in foam and  emulsion stability, in bubble and droplet motion during two-  phase separation processes, and in multiphase and dispersed  phase flow in porous media.  In enzyme catalyzed bioreactors,  rates of enzyme adsorption at interfaces are a significant   factor limiting maximum reactor residence times.  In  biopharmaceutical packaging of proteins competitive rates of  adsorption between proteins and surfactants can determine the  chemical stability of the protein during shipping.  At a  fundamental level, kinetic rates of adsorption reflect molecular  configuration  and orientation at interfaces.  Dynamic  interfacial tension is a convenient probe for revealing  surfactant adsorption/desorption kinetics at deformable  interfaces.  Upon disturbing the interface, the interfacial  tension is monitored as a function of time to expose surfactant  accumulation.",
