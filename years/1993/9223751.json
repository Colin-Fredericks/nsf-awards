The U.S.  organizers are Dr. Frederick Purnell and Professor  Alberto Cordero, both of Queens College, City  University of New York (CUNY).  The Peruvian organizer  is Professor Francisco Miro-Quesada, Director of the  Institute for Philosophical Investigations, Lima  University (IDIF), in association with the National  Council for Science and Technology of Peru.  The  principal goal of the project is to improve scientific  thought and science education in Peru.    The first part of the program will provide advanced  college undergraduates and high school teachers with  an overview of recent foundational developments in  science, with emphasis on the growing integration of  separate disciplines and the methods and standards of  inquiry employed in today's natural sciences.  The workshops are designed to bring together Peruvian  scientists, faculty, and scholars, with scientists  from the international community, for discussions on  how to improve the teaching and content of general  courses in the natural sciences and mathematics at the  college level.  The program also aims to promote  research cooperation between Peruvian and other Latin  America countries and the international participants.",
