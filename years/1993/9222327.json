 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic patterns of rhythmic motor behavior are generated by                  central nervous system circuits called neural oscillators.  The                 oscillatory activity under investigation in this study, induced by              suppression of calcium currents, is unusual in that it depends on               sodium currents (rather than calcium currents as observed in other              animals) and because the oscillations occur synchronously in all                neurons of the same invertebrate nervous systems.  These novel                  features will allow several questions of broad significance to be               addressed.  First, what cellular mechanisms generate these                      sodium-dependent oscillations and why are sodium-dependent                      oscillators so rare compared to calcium-dependent oscillators?                  Second, what cellular mechanisms are used to synchronize                        oscillatory activity within neural networks?  To answer these                   questions, Dr. Angstadt will 1) develop an isolated neuron                      preparation that expresses oscillatory activity similar to that                 observed in intact ganglia, 2) identify and characterize the role               of persistent ionic currents in generating the oscillations, and 3)             determine the cellular mechanisms responsible for synchronizing the             oscillations in different neurons.  His approach will be to remove              identified neurons from invertebrate ganglia, isolate these neurons             in cell culture, and study their ionic currents using voltage clamp             techniques.  In other experiments, mechanisms underlying                        synchronization of oscillations will be investigated in experiments             on intact ganglia.  These studies are important because they will               further understanding of persistent sodium conductances in nerve                cells, including their functional role in the generation of                     oscillatory activity, and may provide a model system for studies of             cellular mechanisms underlying the synchronized neuronal activity               associated with epileptic and other seizures in more complex                    nervous systems.",
