 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics at Illinois Wesleyan is shifting from precalculus                  to calculus level courses. Last year, over 78% of the freshmen                  were advised to begin their mathematics in one of the calculus                  courses. In an attempt to make the calculus experience more                     meaningful to the general student population, they are offering                 several avenues through the freshman calculus experience. After                 a positive experiment involving software under development at                   the University of Illinois through the \"Calculus and                            Mathematica\" project, the Department added a three course                       sequence, Calculus/Mathematica, to its offerings in the spring                  of 1992. The department is modifying and adapting the                           University of Illinois software to accommodate the different                    audience and the course goals of this institution. Because in                   this new approach to the teaching and learning of calculus, the                 keyboard and screen is replacing pen and paper, they are now                    holding all class meetings in the lab, where lectures,                          homework, and tests are being done with the aide of the                         computer.  The new computers are allowing the mathematics                       department to continue to reduce the amount of time that the                    instructor spends lecturing instead of guiding the students to                  develop the necessary insight needed to master the material.",
