 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311213     Covert       The formation of sulfate compounds in the marine boundary  layer (MBL) from the oxidation of oceanic dimethyl sulfide (DMS) to  sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and the  subsequent nucleation and condensation of these compounds is a  major source of particulate matter in that part of the atmosphere.   The partitioning of these compounds between the competing processes  of nucleation and condensation determines (along with removal  processes) the resultant distribution of aerosol number and mass  with particle size.  There is strong interaction between these  formation processes and the preexisting or resulting aerosol.  The  characteristic times for particle formation, growth and removal  encompass minutes to days depending on atmospheric conditions.   Particulate phase sulfur in the MBL and its interaction with marine  stratus clouds are hypothesized to have a significant role in  global climate either by altering radiative properties, lifetime or  geographical extent of the clouds.       This research will focus on physics and chemistry of particles  in the MBL.  The overall project goal will be to determine the  extent to which sulfate compounds contribute to functional subsets  or modes of the aerosol number and mass size spectrum and the  processes by which these particles and particulate mass are formed.  The ultrafine mode, (10nm in diameter) is representative of those  particles most recently formed in the MBL by condensation from the  gas phase.  The accumulation mode (80 to 1000nm diameter) is  representative of the main mass of sulfate and optically effective  particles in the MBL. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), those  particles effective in cloud nucleation, are a subset of the total  particle population defined by size chemistry and water vapor  supersaturation.  For marine stratocumulus they generally encompass  the range greater than ca. 50nm diameter.  The seasalt mode  consists of seasalt or modified seasalt particles greater than   100nm generated at the surface by breaking films due to wind and  wave action.  Due to their alkaline chemistry these particles may  have a disproportionately large influence on oxidation of SO2 in the  MBL, both in and out of cloud.  The Atiken mode, which on a number  basis loosely covers the range 10 to 80nm, represents those  particles that are several days of age and have not been active in  cloud processes.           Several physical, optical and chemical methods will be used to  characterize the distribution of number concentration, chemical  composition, hygroscopic and thermal properties of the particles  between 0.003 and 10um diameter.  Direct measurements of integral  optical properties of the aerosol will be made with an integrating  nephelometer.  Direct measurements of the CCN concentration will be  made in a thermal diffusion cloud chamber.  There is considerable  redundancy in the measurement scheme to constrain the uncertainty  of the results.  Laboratory measurements will be done to calibrate  and intercompare the methods.       The field research will be carried out within the context of  larger multidisciplinary projects that will address the overall  sulfur cycle in which gas phase composition of the MBL will be  measured.  Field experiments will be done at several locations,  along the NW coast of Washington, in the mid-Pacific and in the  Southern Hemisphere in the vicinity of Tasmania and the Cape Grim  Background Monitoring Station.",
