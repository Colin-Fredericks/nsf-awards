 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310222  Hochheimer  This project employs unique high pressure and Brillouin light  scattering techniques to investigate lattice dynamics, elastic  behavior and phase transitions in materials exhibiting  incommensurate phases.  The materials being investigated include  selenates and halides and have been chosen as model systems which  should provide tests of recent theories of incommensurate phase  transitions.  The research will provide a better understanding of  the coupling of acoustic phonons to excitations in the  incommensurate phase, and will provide additional information about  the role of anharmonic lattice potentials in the phase behavior.   The research will provide fundamental information about solid state  phase transitions which are important in many practical materials  such as ferroelectric solids.  %%%  This is a fundamental study of the effect of pressure on the  arrangement of atoms in solids that can show an unusual long range  (larger that the crystal unit cell) modulation of the atomic  positions in the solids.  The reasons for phase transitions and  changes in the atomic positions of the atoms in the materials under  study are not well understood.  They are important and underlie  phase behavior in other solids, such as ferroelectric materials of  technological importance.  The changes in atomic positions will be  investigated with both x-ray and optical spectroscopy techniques.  ***",
