 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project innovative computational econometric approaches                 that employ simulation are adapted in order to handle parametric                estimation of joint discrete/continuous decisions with long                     panels.  The methods are then applied to a family of long-                      standing econometric estimation problems.  The underlying                       econometric models follow from dynamic optimization by economic                 units (such as individuals or firms) in the presence of liquidity               and other similar quantity constraints.  The proposed research                  makes these simulation estimation methods a flexible and powerful               tool for the estimation of dynamic optimization problems that                   involve discrete/continuous decisions with switching among                      several regimes.                                                                                                                                                Stringent parametric specification assumptions are relaxed by                   means of semiparametric estimation techniques.  Starting from                   recent developments in the field of parametric simulation                       estimation, estimation techniques are investigated that combine                 semiparametric methods with simulation.  Such methods are                       particularly important for the discrete/continuous econometric                  models naturally arising from the theoretical framework.                                                                                                        The methods developed are applied to several important dynamic                  constrained problems.  The firms application involves the problem               of consumption and labor supply decisions augmented with a study                of housing decision, using data from the Panel Study of Income                  Dynamics, and cross-checking the results with data from the                     Survey of Consumer Finances.  The second major application uses                 data from COMPUSTAT and studies firms' decisions, where modes of                investment finance define distinct qualitative regimes and where                attrition may be due to bankruptcy and other types of exit.",
