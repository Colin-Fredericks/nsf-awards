Quantitative analysis is  being introduced into the geology curriculum in a series of  courses, beginning with the high-enrollment Introductory  Geology course and culminating in upper-level courses and  independent research projects.  The Introductory Geology  students, predominantly non-majors, are devoting three weeks to  projects on water quality, in many cases working cooperatively  with City Water Department personnel on real problems in the  community.  All geology majors are learning principles of  instrumental analysis and rock-sample preparation in the  Petrology and Optical Mineralogy course.  They are applying  this to a group project; each year the class will work with a  different suite of rocks.  Students in Groundwater Geology are  having opportunities for more involved cooperation with the  City Water Department.  Students in Geochemistry and in Igneous  and Metamorphic Petrology are engaged in individual research  projects.  These experiences are encouraging students to  conduct independent research projects and submit theses dealing  with rock and water chemistry.   ***",
