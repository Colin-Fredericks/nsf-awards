 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351679 May This project will improve the chemistry curriculum by incorporating state of the art computer controlled analytical instruments into laboratory in struction directed to the first year chemistry student.  The three instru ments chosen that meet these criteria include; a computer controlled diode array, spectrophotometer, gas chromatographs, a liquid chromatograph, and personal com puters for the laboratory use with the chromatographs. The laboratory experiments in first year chemistry will be redesigned with 30% of the present exercises elim inated as being outdated, 40% of the present experiments will be augmented with the purchased instrumentation, and the remaining experiments will be new and based on applications of the instruments that illustrate the lecture material with procedures found in modern chemistry laboratories. The students will benefit from this project in several ways including; (a) the laboratory work will gen erate more enthusiasm for and interest in chemistry; (b) they will start their training early in laboratory techniques required of a competent chemist or graduate student; (c) the laboratory work will more effectively illustrate the lecture material; and (d) they will have the opportunity to become involved in the design of their own experiments. ***",
