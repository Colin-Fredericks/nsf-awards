 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project in                 the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry                    Division, Thomas A. Stephenson of Swarthmore College will study                 the photo-induced dynamics of the van der Waals cluster NeBr2                   and of the ion-pair states of I2.  Specifically, the                            vibrational predissociation dynamics of NeBr2 produced in a                     supersonic free jet expansion will be examined via fluorescence                 induced by a probe laser to test model predictions and to                       explore the effect of different electronic states.  In the I2                   studies the effect of electronic excitation on rotational and                   vibrational energy transfer probabilities and pathways will be                  studied in single-collision state-to-state collision dynamics                   experiments.                                                                    %%%                                                                             A crucial component in developing a comprehensive framework for                 understanding chemical reactions is to elucidate the forces                     involved as two atoms or molecules interact during collisions.                  The studies undertaken here on atom-diatom systems are simple                   enough that they can be understood and modeled theoretically,                   thus providing the groundwork for understanding more complex                    systems.  Such knowledge is crucial for understanding all sorts                 of gas-phase dynamical processes, such as atmospheric                           reactions, combustion, and even the synthesis of materials by                   chemical vapor deposition.",
