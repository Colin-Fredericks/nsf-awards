It has already been found that  Monodelphis exhibits a typical primary immune response but an  atypical secondary response.  Other recent results suggest that the  typical eutherian isotype switch from immunoglobulin M to  Immunoglobulin G is lacking in this species.  Further studies will  compare Monodelphis immune responses with the mouse, a typical  eutherian organism.  In collaboration with other laboratories,  molecular approaches will be used to study the major  histocompatibility system and the T cell receptor.  This research  will continue to involve bright, young undergraduate students.  %%%  The mammalian immune system is the subject of much research in the  context of human health, and much is known about immune function in  the mouse and man.  In contrast, very little is known about the  analogous mechanisms of self recognition and defense in other  animals.  The overall objective of this project is to characterize  the immune response of the marsupial, Monodelphis domestica, the  gray, short-tailed opossum.  This species is the only laboratory-  adapted marsupial in America.  Because marsupials separated from  eutherian mammals about 130 million years ago, knowledge of their  immune system may shed light on the origin of the mammalian immune  system.  Studies will be carried out at the cellular and  biochemical levels and molecular immunobiologic studies will be  initiated.  With prior NSF support it has been found that  Monodelphis exhibits a typical primary immune response.  Further  studies will compare Monodelphis immune responses with the mouse,  a typical eutherian mammal.  In collaboration with other  laboratories molecular approaches will be used to identify MHC  genes, and study the T cell receptor.  This research will continue  to involve bright, young undergraduate students.  ***",
