 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to model and analyze a class of                  physical problems arising in microwave processing of ceramics.                  These problems give rise to challenging nonlinear initial                       boundary value problems, the mathematical statements of which                   involve one or more nonlinear parabolic equations, governing the                diffusion of heat and the diffusion of a chemical concentration,                and the time-harmonic version of Maxwell's equations.  These                    equations are coupled in a nonlinear fashion and, in addition,                  nonlinear heat balances are required in certain applications                    where surface temperatures produce significant thermal radiation.               The investigator proposes to develop and use asymptotic methods,                dictated by certain physical limits, to simplify the mathematical               systems and to develop and use numerical methods to  solve the                  reduced problems.                                                                    The goals of the proposer are twofold.  The first is the                   mathematical understanding of the basic physical mechanisms which               make the processes work.  Such an understanding would give                      scientists and engineers involved in microwave processing of                    ceramics the basic scientific underpinnings by to judge and                     interpret their experimental findings.  The second is the                       development and application of asymptotic, numerical, and other                 approximate methods required to obtain an accurate description of               more realistic and complicated processes.  The successful                       completion of the proposed research would allow engineers and                   scientists to design more efficient sintering and joining                       processes for ceramics which would produce higher quality                       materials.  It would also help in the design and implementation                 of microwave assisted vapor deposition processes which are highly               promising in the construction of composite ceramic materials.",
