 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study attempts to develop a membrane for use in the high                   temperature separation of hydrogen from a gaseous mixture. For                  high temperature applications, inorganic membranes are                          necessary, and palladium and palladium silver alloy metal                       membranes exhibit the highest selectivity for hydrogen.  The                    problems with these metallic membranes are that temperature or                  pressure cycles can cause them to crack, and their surfaces                     can be poisoned by sulfur containing molecules in the gaseous                   mixture.  To avoid cracking, metallic membranes are usually                     fabricated to large thicknesses which imparts a structural                      rigidity.  However large membrane thicknesses lower the flux                    to the point where the use of thick membranes becomes                           economically unattractive.                                                                                                                                      In order to develop a membrane with high flux and selectivity,                  the study suggests forming membranes in which metallic Pd and                   Pd/Ag films have been placed inside the pores of a macroporous                  ceramic substrate.  Two types of porous ceramic membranes will                  be used.   The first is a one layer . alumina disk with a pore                  diameter in the range of .2 - .7 \u001am.  The second is a two                       layer disk consisting of a thin (5\u001am), small pore (5 nm) layer                  lanthana modified y Al2O3 layer atop a thick (1-2 mm), large                    pore (.2 - .7 \u001am) . alumina support.  The metal will be placed                  in the ceramic support by using a CVD counterdiffusion process                  in which PdCl2 or a mixture of PdCl2 and AgBr will diffuse                      through the pores from one face of the ceramic support and H2                   will diffuse from the opposite face.  When the gases meet                       somewhere inside the membrane, the reduction reactions:                                        PdCl2(g) + H2(g) --- Pd(s) + 2HCl(g)                                                                                                                            AgBr(g) + 1/2 H2(g) --- Ag(s) + HBr(g)                                                                                                           will produce the metal (or metal alloy) which will span the                     interstitial space of the pore and form a gas tight layer.                      The layers, supported by the ceramic membrane, should be more                   durable and less susceptible to chemical attack.",
