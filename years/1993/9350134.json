 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Rau's research addresses the question of how computer systems               can automatically construct and use representations of knowledge                about what they know.  This is important not only for extending our             understanding of human behavior, but for increasing the                         intelligence, functionality, usability and efficiency of current-               day computer systems.                                                                                                                                           The objectives are to develop methods of extracting, representing               and utilizing meta-knowledge automatically derived from text.                   Previous research has developed methods of extracting information               from text, and methods of calculating the conceptual salience and               breadth of knowledge from databases.  This research will leverage               these advances to develop novel methods of creating summary                     representations of the content of text, and demonstrate their                   applicability to the problem of increased accuracy and efficiency               of conceptual information retrieval.                                                                                                                            The research methodology employed is experimental computer science.             Working programs will implement algorithms that create meta-                    knowledge from text, and demonstrate advances by exhibiting new                 functionality with real problems in information access and                      retrieval.                                                                                                                                                      Interactive activities at the host institution include:  hosting a              two-day workshop on Diversity Awareness; teaching a graduate level              course; putting together a program to provide educational and                   career opportunities for women; and holding a series of special                 seminars on \"Industrial Research:  What's it Like?\"                                                                                                             This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
