 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311054  Jacobson         Cholecystokinin (CCK) is one of the most abundant peptides  found in the mammalian central nervous system.  It appears to  modulate many centrally controlled functions, including  respiration, thermoregulation, reproduction, nociception, anxiety,  and memory.  By far the best-known role of CCK, however, is its  action as a feeding satiety factor.  Recently, Dr. Jacobson found  CCK receptor binding in the facial motor nucleus, a substrate that  mediates facial movement or expression, including nursing.   Therefore, Dr. Jacobson speculates that CCK may also have a central  effect on motor systems involved in the control of feeding-related  behaviors.  Utilizing the methods of immunohistochemistry and  receptor autoradiography, she will determine if the  cholecystokininergic system is playing a role in nursing behavior.   Dr. Jacobson will compare the distribution of CCK receptors in  neurons located within the Vllm nucleus which innervates facial  muscles in neonates of different species.  She will then use a  metabolic marker to determine how manipulations in feeding, and the  exogenous administration of CCK or its antagonists, affect the  activity of neurons in developing motor systems.  The results from  these studies will further our knowledge on the central mediation  of feeding behavior, and the role of cholecystokininergic system in  this process.  Understanding this fundamental mechanism could in  turn have beneficial effects on management of obesity and eating  disorders.      ***",
