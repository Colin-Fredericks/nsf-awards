 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355489  Bad Wound    Oglala Lakota College has made the commitment to initiate a new  institution-wide effort to significantly increase the number of  American Indian students that earn bachelor's degrees in the  natural sciences, computer sciences, engineering, and mathematics  fields (SEM).     This planning proposal is unique because:    The application would benefit students of the only two-four-year  accredited Tribally Controlled Colleges in the Nation, in addition  to two-year Tribal Colleges.    South Dakota National Science Foundation Statewide Systemic  Initiative has committed comprehensive technical assistance to  enhance the planning process.  Resources provided by the SSI will  significantly increase the likelihood that Oglala Lakota College  will be able to develop a successful plan, and further to implement  new SEM programs for American Indian students.    Oglala Lakota College proposes to fully enhance telecommunication  systems through collaborative effort in the implementation stage of  this initiative in order to serve American Indians nationwide.    South Dakota is a small state where collaboration among  Institutions is extensive and permits maximizing of scare  resources.    Oglala Lakota College proposes a six month comprehensive planning  process to develop four-year cooperative degrees.  Cooperative  degrees could than be offered through other institutions including  two-year Tribal Colleges, in addition to Oglala Lakota Colleges'  offering and thus significantly increase the number of students  impacted.",
