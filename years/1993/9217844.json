 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is one of two separate awards being made for a                  collaborative project between Dr. Lorenzo Polvani of Columbia                   University and Dr. Alan Plumb of MIT (ATM-9218841).  Their research             involves the simulation and understanding of nonlinear aspects of               large-scale wave and eddy motions in the atmosphere, using the                  technique of contour dynamics with surgery (CD/S).  This is an                  efficient computational procedure for the investigation at high                 resolution of processes such as the spectral cascade of enstrophy               in highly nonlinear flows.  The PIs plan to apply this technique to             investigate further the dynamics of the stratospheric polar vortex,             the interaction of quasi-stationary long waves and the Rossby wave              dispersion relation in situations where the potential vorticity                 gradient is concentrated rather than continuous from pole to pole.              In addition, they have developed a technique of contour advection               with surgery (CA/S) in which the numerical procedures of the CD/S               approach have been used to develop a sophisticated trajectory code.             This is a diagnostic method which can reveal much about the                     distortion and buckling of material surfaces in observed flows, and             it will be applied to investigate such effects in the stratosphere              and in the upper troposphere.",
