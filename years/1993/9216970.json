An investigation is being conducted into the efficient processing  of spatial data as arising in problems involving scientific data.   Instead of using standard database methods which represent spatial  data as points in a higher dimensional space, and then storing the  coordinate values in a relation (equivalent to mapping the data  into points in a higher dimensional space), the data is organized  by sorting it in such a way that the space it occupies is taken  into account.  Particular attention is focused on the spatial  variant of the range query.  Algorithms for such queries are being  developed in the context of spatial data corresponding to road  networks and topography both above ground and underwater  (represented both as contour lines and surfaces).  Their  performance is being evaluated by examining factors such as buffer  utilization, page sizes, page faults, data distribution, etc. in  environments where the data is spatially sorted and where it is  not.  The evaluation is in terms of real data obtained by  cooperating with the US Bureau of the Census and the US Geological  Survey.  This information is being used to pinpoint where the  algorithms can be improved.  Appropriate models for generating the  queries rather than the underlying database (which consists of real  data) are also being investigated.   ***",
