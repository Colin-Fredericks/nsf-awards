This supplement addresses the  desire to provide improved educational and research opportunities to bridge the gap between the  capacities of current artificially  intelligent agents and human-like cognitive abilities, both issues  to be discussed from a point of view of classical undergraduate or first year graduate AI  education, indicating how a symbolic (linguistic) approach evolves from the interpretation of  arbitrary signals in terms of the human experiences.  The goals of the workshop consist of  providing information exchange relating to the nature of the introductory course, and addressing   new curricula issues and questions including the one related to the Stein award mentioned above,  but others as well such as the use and selection of instructional programming tools, and other  software repository issues related to Artificial Intelligence education.   A report or publication  is part of the results of the workshop.",
