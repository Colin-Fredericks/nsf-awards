 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will design an interdisciplinary laboratory science                 course for non-science majors that explores the earth's past                    and its place in the universe.  The course will be based on                     concepts common to all of science. It will include elements of                  and be taught by faculty from cosmology, physics, chemistry,                    geology and the life sciences.  The centrally significant ideas                 of these disciplines will provide the focus for presentations                   and laboratory experiences. Faculty members who will teach in                   this course will themselves become \"master learners\", attending                 classes in other disciplines. There will be a 4-week workshop                   to design the course in 1993, a two-week workshop to review,                    evaluate and revise it in 1994, and a two-day evaluation                        session in May, 1994.  Upon completion of the grant, there will                 be six to eight faculty prepared to teach this innovative                       interdisciplinary class.",
