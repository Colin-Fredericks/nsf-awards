Time-based multiplexing is a fundamental operation that must be  performed in large-scale wide- area networks.  The research will  examine architecture alternatives and demonstrate feasibility by  building and testing scalable prototype multiplexors.  A major  difficulty in the design of multiplexors is dealing with  contention.  The conceptual prototype of a time-based optical  multiplexor, in this study, is based on the detection of optical  packets at the packet rate, as opposed to the detection of the  optical data at the much higher data rate.   For example, the  optical packets can be detected by splitting off a small part of  the optical signal using an optical-fiber directional coupler, with  these signals detected by a high-sensitivity detector.  For a  two-to-one multiplexor, the packet detection will be used to  configure a 2 x 2 guided-wave directional coupler switch.  If only  one input has a packet, the packet is routed to the output.  If  both inputs have packets, then one packet is routed to the output  while the other packet is sent through an optical fiber delay line,  and subsequently fed back into another switch.  Several packet  detectors and switches can be used to implement various scheduling  algorithms, and to offer a higher degree of system reliability.   The multiplexors will be developed using commercially available  fiber optic and optoelectronic components.  We will iteraltively  examine architecture alternatives and refine our prototypes.  This will maximize the interaction between the device and network  researchers.  ***",
