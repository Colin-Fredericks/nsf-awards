 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to implement a professional workstation                         laboratory for the new, interdisciplinary, undergraduate course                 sequence in massively parallel computing which is being                         introduced this year with support from the NSF \u0131CDR/CISE!. The                  laboratory will be equipped with advanced software tools on a                   network of high performance graphics workstations from which                    the students will access the University's massively parallel                    computer. The workstations have been choosen for their                          computational speed and 3D graphics capabilities. In addition                   to the basic software package, which includes C, C++, Pascal,                   FORTRAN, X11 and Motif, the PIs plan to provide Mathematica,                    Linda and ID to ensure a full spectrum of tools for a                           professional high performance computing environment. The                        workstations will be used to gain access to the CM-5 complex,                   for the visualization of Connection Machine computations and                    results, for program development, for data preparation and                      analysis, and for studying networked distributed computing                      models.  The laboratory, which will be designed to serve as                     both a workspace and demonstration/teaching environment,is                      intended to reinforce the interdisciplinary nature of the                       curriculum by establishing a central location for the full                      range of interdepartmental undergraduate activity connected                     with the new curriculum.  The PIs believe that this project                     will demonstrate the viability of incorporating frontier                        technologies into undergraduate education and serve as a                        prototype from which other educators can borrow.",
