This guide will include carefully  developed and tested problems, sample programs, explanations of the  relevant physics and algorithms, typical results, extensive  reference lists, and suggestions for teachers. These materials also  will provide guidance to teachers with limited experience in using  computer simulations so that they can use the discovery method of  teaching and provide direction to students without undue time spent  on course preparation. Topics will be chosen that give students  opportunities to develop their conceptual understanding of the  principles of physics, motivate them to learn more physics, and  apply the principles of physics to other sciences and engineering.  Funds are requested for release time, computers, student stipends,  and travel. The principal investigators have extensive experience  in incorporating computers into the physics curriculum, and the  proposed work will have national and international impact.",
