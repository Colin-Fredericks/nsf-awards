 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focussed on the induction of superconductivity                 into organic conductors via the proximity effect through the use of             hybrid organic conductor/high temperature superconductor                        structures.  Using chemical and electrochemical techniques, a                   number of structures suitable for the study of superconducting                  proximity effect are fabricated.  One major goal of this work is to             study electron transfer phenomena which occur at or near                        superconductor/molecular phase interfaces.  Measurements are                    conducted above and below the superconducting transition                        temperature to search for superconducting quantum electron transfer             phenomena.  Cuprate superconductors are used for the majority of                the studies because measurements below transition temperature can               be completed readily.  The second goal of this research is to                   fabricate proximity devices based on high temperature                           superconductor thin films coated with molecular conductors.  The                modulation of the superconducting transition temperature of the                 underling cuprate material then is examined.  Also, the influence               of polymer layer on the transition temperature of the                           superconductor film is explored.                                                                                                                                In recent studies, we have demonstrated the first molecular switch              for controlling superconductivity.  The ultimate goal of the                    proposed research is to develop new types of organic conductor/                 superconductor circuits, devices and sensors.  Through the study of             a variety of molecular conductor/high temperature superconductor                structures, information will be acquired that may help to elucidate             the nature of superconductivity in the ceramic superconductors and              shed light on the conduction mechanism in the polymers.  The use of             conductive polymers also should provide alternative strategies for              making electrical contacts to high-temperature superconductors.  By             incorporating an organic conductor into such systems, some of the               degradation at these interfaces may be eliminated.",
