 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the decadal-scale interannual                   variability of the stratosphere, with the goal of increasing our                understanding of the effects of both internal and solar-driven                  interannual variability and how these signals propagate through the             atmosphere.                                                                          Several signals or forcings have been identified which may                 account for many of the year-to-year changes in the stratospheric               circulation.  These signals include the quasi-biennial oscillation              of the tropical stratosphere, the 11-year solar cycle, secular                  trends (possibly due to global climate change), El Nino/Southern                Oscillation and tropospheric signals, and low-frequency modulation              of higher-frequency signals.                                                         The approach will be to use a combination of observational                 data analysis and numerical modeling to explore the existence,                  causes, and propagation of decadal-scale signals in the                         stratosphere.  Observational work will exploit gridded atmospheric              data sets, rocketsonde observations, and satellite- and ground-                 based ozone measurements.  Techniques such as correlations,                     composites, and empirical orthogonal functions will be used to                  identify interannual signals in the data.                                            The effect of changes in solar output on the earth's recent                climate is not well known.  Likewise, decadal variations of the                 earth-atmosphere system apart from solar influence are poorly                   understood.  The understanding of the interannual variability of                the stratosphere is important not only because of its links to the              troposphere, but due to possible identification of secular global               climate trends and the role of solar variability in determining the             global climate.                                                                 #",
