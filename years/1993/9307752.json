 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Linda Schele, Mr. Matthew Looper will                collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study the                   stelae erected between ca. 720 to 810 AD at the Guatemalan Mayan                site of Quirigua. Stelae are large stone plaques with carved                    inscriptions and produced and erected by ruling kings  to proclaim              their victories and legitimize their power. They thus contain a                 wealth of political and historic information. The site of Quirigua              covers approximately 4 square kilometers and contains a large                   number of such remains. With National Science Foundation support,               Mr. Looper will study the Quirigua stelae and with a professional               photographer make a detailed and complete record of them. Copies of             all photographs will be given to the government of Guatemala and to             the University of Texas at Austin where they will serve as a                    permanent archive and record available to all researchers.                                                                                                      In recent years great strides have been made in decoding this                   previously unreadable language and the results have provided a                  wealth of information for archaeologists. Mr. Looper wishes to                  understand how the many Mayan states developed and Quirigua,                    because of its many stelae provides an excellent test case. Work                done to date indicates that this small polity grew rapidly between              ca. 720 and 810 AD and that a number of monumental buildings were               erected during this period. The stelae appear to record this                    process and the wars which the Quirigua people fought and                       apparently won. Through analysis of the writing Mr. Looper hopes to             gain insight into how this occurred.                                                                                                                            This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data in the form of high quality photographs which will be of value             to many researchers. Mayan artifacts are often stolen for illicit               sale and such a record is essential. The project will also serve to             increase our understanding of how Mayan peoples developed state                 level organization in a difficult lowland tropical environment.                 Finally, it will assist in the training of a promising young                    scientist.",
