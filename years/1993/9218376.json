 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate weather forecasting in the vicinity of major mountain             ranges is an extremely difficult meteorological problem.                        Interactions between large-scale weather systems and mountainous                regions often spawn complex mesoscale weather patterns.  Efforts to             forecast the development of these weather patterns are limited by               deficiencies in understanding of the physical processes governing               mesoscale circulations in complex terrain.  Additionally, mesoscale             orographic effects also influence the global circulation through                the action of gravity wave drag.  Errors in the parameterization of             gravity wave drag in global scale modes are believed to be a major              source of error in extended range forecasts.                                         Under previously supported research on this topic the                      Principal Investigator has found that vertically propagating                    mountain waves appear to be not as sensitive to the asymmetry of                the underlying terrain as previously thought.  Using free slip                  conditions, he has found that maximum lee slope winds also are not              sensitive to asymmetry of the terrain.  When surface friction is                included, however, sensitivity to terrain is enhanced, but the                  primary regulator of maximum winds appears to be the steepness of               the lee slope.                                                                       The Principal Investigator will continue this line of research             with the ultimate goal of improving weather forecasts for locations             in the vicinity of mountains and to improve extended range                      forecasts and climate models.  The major areas of concentration                 are: investigation of airflow in complex three-dimensional                      topography with emphasis on mountain barriers with and without                  mountain gaps, and isolated mountain peaks; study of momentum                   fluxes in orographically forced gravity waves and the interactions              of these waves with the larger scale flow through gravity wave                  drag.",
