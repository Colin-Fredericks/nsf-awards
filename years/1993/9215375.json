Dairy                                 Forage Research Center at the University of                                     Wisconsin to La Trobe University                                                in Victoria, Australia, where he will conduct                                   cooperative research with Professor Bruce A.                                    Stone, Chair of the Department of Biochemistry.                                 The research will focus on the chemical                                         composition of plant cell walls at various                                      stages of development.                                                                                                                                          Lignin-carbohydrate complexes from alfalfa                                      stems will be isolated and their fine                                           structure, in terms of cross-linking                                            mechanisms, identified. In addition, proteins                                   from the walls of young seedlings and cell                                      cultures of alfalfa will be isolated and                                        characterized in order to identify classes of                                   various structural proteins. Mature stems and                                   lignin-carbohydrate complexes will be assayed                                   for the presence of these classes of structural                                 proteins. This information is critical to                                       elucidating cell wall organization necessary in                                 determining digestibility by rumen                                              microbes in forage crops such as alfalfa. This                                  research is of economic importance to the                                       dairy, beef cattle, and sheep industries.",
