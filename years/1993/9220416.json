 "awd_abstract_narration": "In condensed matter systems there are a large number of degrees of              freedom which interact strongly with each other.  Many phemonena,               however, can be understood on the basis of a small number of                    degrees of freedom interacting on a single scale not significantly              larger than the atomic length scale.  A self-consistent one-                    particle theory can adequately describe these phenomena.  In                    contrast, there are many instances in which it is impossible to                 guess the qualitative behavior of the system from a theory based on             a few degrees of freedom.  The aim of the present proposal is to                examine correlation effects in these strongly interacting systems.              In particular, theoretical research will be conducted on novel                  correlations in quantum antiferromagnets, on magnetic correlations              in high temperature cuprate superconductors, and on electronic                  correlation effects in newly discovered superconductors made by                 doping fullerine molecular solids with alkali atoms.                            %%%                                                                             The theoretical research will focus on the physics of various                   materials which cannot be understood using conventional models and              techniques.  These materials include the copper-based high                      temperature superconductors, magnetic materials and the newly                   discovered superconducting materials based on the new form of                   carbon, Buckminsterfullerine.  New theoretical techniques will be               developed to understand these complex systems.",
