 "awd_abstract_narration": "The paradigm emerging from various studies of organisms and flow is             that the responses are widespread and morphology-specific.  The                 overall goal of this project is to determine the importance of flow             and sediment flux microenvironments to deposit and suspension                   feeder's responses. The major hypotheses of the project are that:               A. suspension feeding is a response to food particle flux, not flow             speed and seston concentration alone; and, B. deposit feeding is a              response to deposition of fine particles of high food value.  These             hypotheses will be tested by observing the feeding behavior and                 rate of several species of sandflat macrofauna in a factorial                   manipulation of fluid flow, particle flux and bed characteristics.              In the first year, the bulk flow and sediment flux experiments will             be conducted to further delineate the roles of flow and sediment                flux in mean population behavior of four target species of                      polychaete worms. In the second year, critical tests of the                     hypotheses will be undertaken through manipulation of flow, flux                and particle food value as operationally defined by labile protein              measurements. The results of this project will have important                   implications for the modeling of benthic feeding biology, for                   explanations of form and function as adaptations to flow, and for               the design of laboratory flow microcosm experiments.",
