 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted in two unrelated areas:                  turbulence and biophysics.                                                                                                                                      The statistics of a passive scalar advected by a turbulent velocity             field will be studied numerically in two dimensions to guide                    analytic theory which has formal analogies to the treatment of band             edge tails, and propagation in random gauge fields.  Among the                  experimental issues to be addressed are the distribution function               of the scalar and its derivative at point and the nonzero value of              the derivative skewness in high Reynold's number shear flows.                   Scalar transport also arises when the Euler equations are written               with Clebsch variables, a representation that may facilitate                    understanding why vortex structures form.                                                                                                                       In the area of cellular biophysics, the dynamics of voltage                     sensitive ion channels will be explored based on similarities with              solid state systems.  Specifically frequency dependent response and             fluctuations will be examined for nonequilibrium effects as well as             simultaneous passage of several ions - a sort of Coulomb blockade.              The possibility of a collapse transition in a long loop of                      negatively supercoiled DNA will be investigated taking proper                   account of the thermal fluctuations.                                            %%%                                                                             Theoretical research in condensed matter physics will be conducted              focussing on two different condensed matter systems.  One system                involves turbulence and related phenomena in the flow of fluids.                The other system is biophysical.  The elastic properties of                     proteins and conduction across biological membranes will be                     studied.",
