 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the establishment of a two-year cooperative                 research project between two groups of theoretical physicists led               by Benjamin Grinstein, Superconducting Super Collider Laboratory,               Dallas, and Anthony Sanda, Nagoya University.  In addition to Dr.               Grinstein, six other U.S. scientists will participate in the                    project by visiting Japanese research facilities in Nagoya,                     Osaka, Hiroshima, and Tsukuba.                                                                                                                                  The need for this project is underscored by worldwide interest in               building e+e- B-factories, and the recognition that B-physics may               also be competitively studied in hadron colliders.  In particular               there is need to determine which aspects of B-physics are best                  studied in electron-positron B-factories, and which in hadronic                 colliders.  Central to this collaborative effrot are studies of                 CP-violation (both in B-meson and b-flavored baryons decays),                   extraction of elements of the Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix,                  and the methods for computing the rates of rare decays of B-                    mesons.  In addition, the recently developed techniques of the                  heavy quark Effective Theory must be incorporated into these                    studies.  These difficult problems will be attacked by combining                the varied approaches and expertise that this collaboration                     brings together.",
