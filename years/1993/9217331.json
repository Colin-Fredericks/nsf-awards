 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on the 'void volume' incorporated into the                           infrastructure of pre-dense packed, dendritic macromolecules, a                 series of novel polymers will be constructed that possess internal,             specifically located, metal, metalloid, and/or heterocyclic                     moieties.  The proposed research will emphasize the synthesis and               characterization of water-soluble cascade polymers with easily                  functionalized lipophilic interiors.  These transformations will                focus on the potential to manipulate internal reactive sites, at                each generation, after cascade superstructure construction.                     Modification of the interior of these unimolecular micelles will                allow preparation of metallospheres which are specifically                      designed, water-soluble catalysts.  Characterization of these                   macromolecules will be accomplished via the standard techniques of              NMR spectroscopy, electron microscopy, light-scattering,                        fluorescent-probe methods, solubility, osmotic pressure                         conductivity, and mass spectroscopy.  The potential to perform                  chemistry within a micellar environment, inside a single molecule,              will be investigated in detail.  The use of these cascade polymers              as solubilizing agents, microencapsulating agents, and host-                    transport agents will be continued.                                                                                                                             This research deals with the synthesis and properties of a new                  class of large spherical molecules.  Because they are designed to               have voids in their structure, it will be possible to incorporate               various types of functional materials within these new structures.              Their potential in various applications will be investigated.",
