 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313523  Shaler  This award will provide funding for the renovation of the wood  science and processing research space at the University of Maine.  Research activities pursued in this facility include:  the  elucidation of biochemical mechanisms involved in wood  deterioration by fungi, nondestructive evaluation of wood-based  composite materials, mechanical properties of structural members,  biotechnology and bioprocessing of wood through the use of  microorganisms.  These investigations have implications not just  to the field of wood science, but to all environmental studies  related to carbon cycling and greenhouse gas production.  The  laboratories are used for research and research training by the  department  and are shared with others from the Departments of  Biochemistry, Microbiology, Plant Biology, and Engineering.    The research facility, constructed in 1968, is located in the  south wing of Nutting Hall.  Specific areas needing renovation  consist of a continuous suite containing processing, sample  preparation, and analytical areas, and a physically separate wood  biochemistry and biotechnology facility on the same wing.  The  space suffers from a lack of separation between processing,  sample preparation and analytical areas, poor ventilation, and  inefficient usage of available space.  Inadequate bench space and  the lack of basic utility services ranging from electrical  outlets to hoods and chemical storage currently limit the work  done in the biotechnology and biochemistry areas.  Once the  laboratories are renovated, the improved facilities will enhance  the interaction that currently exists with researchers from other  departments and will promote in the recruitment of quality  graduate students in this important area.  ***",
