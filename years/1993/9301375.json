 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301375  Chun       The purpose of this investigation is to determine the   process-structure relationships and the extent of structural    control that can be achieved in spray forming with uniform    droplets.  Unlike  gas-atomized spray forming in which structural  control is limited by the use of non-uniform droplet sprays and the  coupling among the spray process parameters, this research is based  on the ability to produce uniform metal droplet sprays with    precisely controlled droplet size, thermal state and mass flux.   A combination of controlled experiments and analysis may lead o an  understanding of how processing variables affect material    structure, and may provide knowledge that can be applied to design  and control the spray forming process.  The experiment include    spray forming with controlled droplet solidification, undercooling,  mass and enthalpy flux, and with reduced ambient pressure.             These experiments are designed to permit studies of the      limiting conditions for producing bulk materials with rapidly     solidified, novel microstructure directly from the melt.  The     targeted novel structures are those with fine, uniform, equiaxed  grains, controlled texturing and amorphous phases.  The uniform   droplet spray forming process, including the droplets generation,  fluid-thermal state at impact and mass flux as well as the        substrate condition, will be characterized and modeled.  These    results will be compared with the experimental observations on the  microstructure evolution to establish process-structure        relationships in the spray forming process.",
