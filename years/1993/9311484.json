CONCERT is connected directly  to the NSFNET Backbone Network.  It is the intention of CONCERT to  offer NSFNET connections to all higher education institutions in  North Carolina.       This proposal requests support to establish ten new  connections for 4 year colleges in the state including: Belmont  Abbey College, Bennett College, Brevard College, Gardner-Webb  College, Johnson C. Smith University, Louisburg College, Mars Hill  College, Pfeiffer College, St. Augustine's College, and St. Mary's  College.  Three additional colleges that have \"connection\" support  from other sources (Greensboro College, Salem College, and St.  Andrews College) request training and Network Information Support  (NIC Services) from the CONCERT organization.       A primary goal of CONCERT is to facilitate collaborative  projects and sharing of resources between institution, including  those outside the state.  CONCERT will provide operations  management and information services as well as provide appropriate  dedicated connections to the thirteen institutions.        The universities and colleges need greater functionality and  network speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and  make file transfers along with being able to implement a more  reliable mail system.  Students and faculty research will benefit  from the link.  This is also a unique opportunity for the schools  to explore innovative educational resources.  ***",
