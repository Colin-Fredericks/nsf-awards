 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carotenoid pigments are widely used as chemotaxonomic                           markers fordescribing the distributions and composition of                      primary producers in the sea.  Increasingly, carotenoids are                    being used as trophic dynamic and geochemical probes for                        studying processes such as zooplankton feeding activity,                        detritus formation, and vertical organic fluxes.  Most of                       these applications require the measurement of carotenoids in                    zooplankton guts or feces.  Quantification of these                             measurements requires a working knowledge of whether or not                     carotenoid pigments are conserved during passage through the                    gut.  At present, such information is scarce and existing                       data do not suggest a predictable pattern of carotenoid                         processing by copepods.  Part of the problem seems to be                        that studies to date have been neither extensive nor                            intensive.                                                                                                                                                      This project provides a systematic evaluation of the fate of                    commonly used carotenoid marker pigments, from major                            phytoplankton taxa, during passage through the copepod gut.                     The goal of the project is to ascertain the extent to which                     the fate of carotenoids uring gut passage is a function of                      the copepod species (e.g., Do some species destroy                              carotenoids while others do not?), or the copepod's                             physiology at the time of feeding.  Mass balance experiments                    will be used to estimate the quantities of ingested pigments                    that are conserved, derivatized and/or destroyed during                         passage through the gut.  At least four species of copepods,                    selected as representatives of a range of habitats,                             ecologies and physiologies, will be used in the experiments.                    The study will serve, first to screen copepods from a                           variety of environments (e.g.,, high and low latitudes,                         nearshore and open coastal waters) for carotenoid-processing                    characteristics.  Experiments will then clarify the                             influence of acclimation to food environment (i.e., recent                      feeding history), diel variability in digestive physiology                      and high frequency variability in food concentration                            (patchiness) on the processing of ingested algal                                carotenoids.  Ultimately, this intensive approach should                        provide a level of predictability about the fate of                             carotenoids in certain food webs, and lead to an                                understanding of how animals and environments affect the use                    of pigments as trophic dynamic or geochemical probes.",
