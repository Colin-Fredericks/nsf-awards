 "awd_abstract_narration": "At times powerful governments seem to be seized by economic forces              beyond their ability to control: during a twenty-four hour period,              for example, the British government raised interest rates to                    astronomical levels, swearing under no circumstances to devalue the             pound, only to do exactly that.  At other times, seemingly minor                tinkering with policy can unleash profound and unplanned change:                the enormous changes in the former Soviet Union, for example, seem              to have been triggered by relatively mild political reforms                     introduced by Gorbachev in the mid-eighties.                                                                                                                    Although it is not widely recognized, economic theory predicts that             under certain circumstances economic forces will be overpoweringly              strong, and at other times extremely weak and susceptible to                    manipulation.  Indeed, the theory can make quantitative predictions             about the strength of economic forces.  To the extent that such                 predictions are correct, they are of great value, directing our                 attention to those types of problems and situations where policy                can make a real difference.  There are two broad goals of this                  research: first to use data from experimental economics to validate             the theory, and second, to advance the theory to improve its                    predictive power in assessing situations where economic forces are              weak.                                                                                                                                                           Experimental data in economics is extremely mixed: sometimes the                theory predicts extremely well, and at other times strange                      anomalies occur, often changing with seemingly trivial                          modifications in experimental design.  What has not been examined               carefully is the extent to which the anomalies are correlated with              the strength of economic forces involved.  Our hypothesis is that               the theory predicts well when economic forces are strong, and that              it predicts poorly when economic forces are weak.  This research                plans to review a broad cross-section of economic experiments in an             effort to determine whether the anomalies are due to the weakness               of the economic forces.  To the extent that they are, this                      validates the idea that current theory can assess the strength of               economic forces in a useful way.                                                                                                                                Unfortunately, an implication of our hypothesis is that predictions             made by theory will be weakest exactly when the consequences of                 policy changes will be most profound.  Many economists feel that                under these circumstances, the ability of individuals to learn and              adapt plays an important role.  (This is clearly the case in the                changes unfolding in the former Soviet Union.)  The second major                component of this research is to examine the theoretical                        consequences of learning, and the types of predictions such a                   theory makes.  The goal is to develop useful mathematical                       approximations for making quantitative predictions.",
