 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304974     Timko  Chlorophylls, hemes, and their derivatives play an important role  in the energy absorption and transduction processes of all  photosynthetic organisms.  The laboratory has isolated and  characterized members of three nuclear gene families that encode  enzymes of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway.  There are three  objectives desired.  The first objective is to understand how cells  regulate the coordinate formation of the various tetrapyrrole  biosynthetic pathway enzymes in a developmental and cell specific  manner.  The second objective is to define the similarities and  differences in the regulatory mechanisms controlling the expression  genes encoding protochlorophyllide reductase in angiosperms (pea)  and gymnosperms (pine).  In order to meet these objectives, more  effort will continue on current studies examining how the formation  and intracellular distribution of these enzymes are regulated, the  nature of the transcriptional or post-transcriptional of processes  that control them change in response to alterations in cell  physiology or environment.  These studies will provide important  new information on the structure, function, and expression of  enzymes involved in one of the most fundamental processes in  plants.     %%%  Chlorophylls and similar molecules play an important role in the  ability of plants to absorb light energy and transduce the energy  into food and biomaterials.  The researchers have isolated and  characterized  three gene families that code for the enzymes that  produce chlorophyll and other similar molecules.  There are three  objectives desired.  The first objective is to understand how cells  produce the right amounts of the enzymes during the life of the  plant and in different parts of the plant.  The second objective is  to see what is similar and different in the genetic control of one  particular enzyme in peas and pine trees.   More work on current studies examining how the formation and  intracellular distribution of these enzyme s is regulated by  different processes will continue.  These studies will provide  important new information on the structure, function, and  expression of enzymes involved in one of the most fundamental  processes in plants.  ***",
