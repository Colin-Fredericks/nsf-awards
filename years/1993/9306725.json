 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research planning grant to study the interaction of human             central nervous system neurons with rat glia in defined medium in               culture.  The effects of cellular interaction in these co-cultures              will be studied by monitoring glial proliferation and                           differentiation when neurons are added to mixed glial cultures.                 This will be assayed by immunocytochemistry with cell-specific                  monoclonal antibodies.  Transmission electron microscopy will be                used to document the extent of the glial-neuronal interaction in                the co-cultures and to document the presence of myelin.  Antibodies             against a neuronal protein which acts as a glial mitogen will be                added to the co-cultures to document perturbations in the glial-                neuronal interactions.                                                                                                                                          This work is important because little is known about the                        development of myelin in the human brain.  Myelin is a fatty                    covering around axon; without myelin, animals have difficulty in                moving, in sensory perception, and ultimately in living.  It has                been hard to study the development of human brains because until                now there has not been available sufficient numbers of mature human             neurons for investigation.  These co-cultures use human neurons                 derived from a brain tumor along with other brain cells, called                 glia, from immature rats.  In this way, we can study how human                  neurons interact with glia to set up normal brain cellular                      interactions by examining at a molecular level the process of                   myelination.",
