 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimization problems that arise in computational    and other related areas are investigated in this  project.    Special emphasis  is placed on bi-criteria  optimization problems and geometric   problems.  In a  communication network, the two important   criteria that are of  great practical implications are the communication delay and    total cost.  In  path planning routing, the two important  criteria are the   total length and the  number of bends.   Optimization problems concerning two   criteria either  simultaneously or in lexicographical order are studied.     Among those to be  studied are weighted  farthest neighbor Voronoi diagram   construction for a  set of  point sites, a new class of geometric problems,   called the  capacitated  path problem, in which the obstacles have  capacities and the   cost of a path  avoiding these obstacles is  a function of the length of the   path and the  capacities of the  obstacles visited by the path, and routing   problems with  multiple source-destination pairs such that these paths do   not  cross and yet  their total length is to be minimized.  The  goals of this   research are to apply  geometric techniques to  tackle these new classes of   optimization problems, and  to  identify problems that can (or cannot) benefit from the    geometric properties.",
