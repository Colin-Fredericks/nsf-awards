 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomenon of habitat fragmentation, when remnants                          of native vegetation are reduced in size and separated                          from adjacent, continuous habitat, is extremely                                 widespread and poses one of the most serious threats to                         the earth's biological diversity.  Ecological                                   observations of habitat fragments have shown that in                            general, species diversity decreases as patch size                              decreases.  Vegetated connections between fragments are                         often used by animals, and are presumed to increase the                         probability of species' persistence in fragments.                               However, studies published to date have several major                           limitations: Patches are typically not measured prior                           to isolation; it has rarely been shown that animals                             preferentially use connections between patches; and                             organisms' basic life history characteristics are often                         not examined in relation to their numerical response to                         habitat fragmentation.  No studies are published which                          have experimentally manipulated both fragment size and                          connectivity under field conditions and compared                                species' responses in the manipulated plots to those in                         adjacent control plots.                                                                                                                                         The research proposed here, to be done in native mixed-                         grass prairie near Boulder, Colorado, USA, involves                             experimentally creating habitat patches of three sizes                          and manipulating presence or absence of connectivity to                         adjacent, continuous habitat.  The research will also                           simulate the spatial configurations in four basic                               sequences of land transformation and fragmentation:                             edge strip sequence, corridor sequence, dispersed patch                         sequence, dispersed patch sequence and four nuclei                              sequence.  The four sequences will simultaneously                               convert equal areas of grassland from intact to cleared                         habitat, but the spatial configuration of the intact                            habitat will vary among sequences.  By studying insect                          dynamics, he will be able to examine the extent to                              which animal populations are impeded or enhanced by                             fragmentation processes.  In addition to examining                              overall patterns of plant and insect species richness                           and diversity in experimental and control plots, he                             will compare the movement responses of three focal                              insect species which exhibit different degrees of                               vagility and modes of feeding.  The results will                                contribute to their understanding of the ecological                             implications of particular spatial configurations, and                          will potentially guide ecologists as well as designers                          and planners in their decisions regarding land use                              projects.",
