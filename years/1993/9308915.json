 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308915  Von Winterfeldt    Almost forty years of experience with theories about rational  decision making on the part of individuals confronting risk and  uncertainty -- technically, subjective expected utility theories  (SEU) -- has led to two firm conclusions.  One, stressed primarily  by psychologists, is that this class of models, while overall  fairly descriptive, fails to describe certain crucial aspects of  actual behavior in many experimental and real world situations.   The other, stressed primarily by economists and decision analysts,  is that the axioms of the SEU model are normatively very compelling  and the model has proved useful in numerous applied situations.    Recognizing both the descriptive failure and normative usefulness  of the classical model, the PIs have explored the common ground  held by both the experimentalists and the applied decision  analysts, attempted to discover exactly where the two part company,  and sought a prescriptive theory that satisfies both experimental  concerns and applied expectations.  Like SEU this new theory --  technically rank- and sign-dependent utility (RSDU) theory -- is  based (axiomatically) on fairly simple, quite compelling,  underlying behavioral principles, and also like SEU, it results in  a numerical representation as a weighted average, but unlike SEU  the weights are not probabilities and their values depend not only  on the underlying chance event but on whether the associated  outcome is a gain or a loss.  Fundamental to the theory is the  differential treatment of an event depending on whether it is  associated to a gain or a loss relative to a status quo and the  incorporation of the concept of joint receipt -- of getting two or  more things at the same time -- that allows an explicit, simple  characterization of the fundamental non-rationality of the theory.    This project examines several theoretical, experimental, and  applied issues that remain unresolved:  On the theoretical side,  while RSDU is a fairly good descript ive theory of choice behavior,  it needs modification to accommodate the violations of its axioms  which occur when judged certainty equivalents are used rather than  choice procedures.  On the empirical side, the project examines,  among other things, Thaler's rule for the utility of the joint  receipt of two or more things; the descriptive validity of the  quasi-rational assumptions underlying RSDU; the construction of a  reference level (local status quo) in terms of the choice set; and  alternative combination rules for the aggregation of gains and  losses around the status quo. Regarding applied issues, we are  convinced that the status quo plays an important role in decision  making and so it is highly desirable to develop prescriptive  theories that depend explicitly on it.  In addition, the project  will investigate the limitations and potential pitfalls of sign  dependent utility as a prescriptive theory.  ***",
