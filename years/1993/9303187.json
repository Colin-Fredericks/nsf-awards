 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303187  Bolt  This action is to continue a collaboration in the recording  of earthquake strong ground motion, between principal  investigators at the University of California at Berkeley  and at the Institute of Earth Sciences, Academica Sinica,  Taiwan.  This collaboration began with the NSF-funded  installation in Taiwan of SMART-1 (Strong Motion Array in  Taiwan-1) headed by the principal investigator.  Since that  time, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the  Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) have collaborated  with Taiwan Power in the complimentary recording of strong  ground motions through a smaller-scale array within SMART-1,  for soil-structure interaction studies motivated by needs in  nuclear power plant design.    This collaboration is being repeated with the installation  of the Taiwan-funded SMART-2 array at a stiffer soil site at  Hualien.  The Taiwan Weather Bureau is now installing 600  strong-motion recorders distributed around the island of  Taiwan.  NSF-funded investigators from the University of  Houston and the University of Southern California are  participating in this data-gathering program, and the  principal investigator is involved separately as chairman of  a technical review panel for the strong-motion recorders  being installed.    This action is to: (1)  support collaboration in  dissemination and processing of seismic ground motions being  recorded by the new digital accelerograph array (SMART-2);  (2) assist in the integration of SMART-2 data with that from  the smaller-scale 3-D array; and (3) continue research  using new SMART-1 and SMART-2 data, on measuring, comparing,  understanding and characterizing variations of strong ground  motion paralleling those at SMART-1 on \"soft\" soil.  ***",
