 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, H.L. Dai of the University of                        Pennsylvania will investigate intermolecular interactions such                  as electronic energy transfer and bimolecular reactions through                 van der Waals complexes.  The study consists of several                         parts,namely investigation of collision induced electronic                      relaxation processes in van der Waals complexes by means of                     laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy; molecular orbital                      dependence in the electronic relaxation of molecules like                       glyoxal and pyrimidene and the effect of different collision                    partners; and the chemistry of electronically excited molecules,                or molecules excited to selected vibrational levels in a van                    der Waals complex.  The structure and frequencies of the van                    der Waals vibrational modes will be determined by means of                      fluorescence excitation and stimulated emission spectroscopy.                   These results will be used to test theoreticel models  for                      calculating intermolecular potentials.                                          %%%                                                                             This research deals with the problem of how energy flows within                 and among vibrationally and electronically excited molecules.                   The molecules of study are incorporated in molecular clusters                   which are held together by weak intermolecular van der Waals                    forces.  Vibrational or electronic excitation of the component                  molecules will generally cause the complex to dissociate.  This                 dissociation process mimics the energy transfer that occurs                     between colliding molecules.  The experiments with molecules                    embedded in a van der Waals complex provide a measure of                        control over the reaction process that is not available with                    molecular gases in which the molecules have random orientation.                 The experiments will provide information useful for the                         understanding of the reactivity of different molecular                          orbitals, and for the determination of the potential energy                     surface which characterizes the reaction.  With this                            information it will be possible to devise novel photochemical                   reaction pathways.",
