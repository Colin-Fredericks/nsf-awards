 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted on two general areas of                  modern condensed matter physics: the electronic structure of                    correlated electron systems and the nature of the superconductor-               insulator transition in the cuprate superconductors.                                                                                                            In the first area, studies will be performed on the influence of                oxygen-hole copper-hole pairing on the d-wave superconductivity in              the cuprates.  As temperature is lowered below the transition                   temperature there is the possibility of a second phase transition               signaling the onset of copper-oxygen pairing.  Also to be studied               is the nature of the electron pairing in potassium fulleride and                the possibility of a special, Berry phase, electron-phonon                      interaction in the fullerenes.                                                                                                                                  In the second area, studies will be performed on the possibility                that the superconductor-insulator transition which occurs with zinc             doping in the cuprates represents a simultaneous localization of                Cooper pairs and partial de-pairing induced by disorder and/or                  magnetic fluctuations.  In a related but separate study, the                    effects of incipient boson localization on the quantum tunneling of             vortices when the system is close to a field-induced                            superconductor-insulator transition will be investigated.                       %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted on fundamental problems in               condensed matter physics which can have a major impact on                       understanding the behavior of the high temperature superconductors.             The research will primarily focus on the copper-oxide based                     superconductors.  Work will be done on the nature of the transition             as the material goes from a superconducting state to an insulating              state.",
