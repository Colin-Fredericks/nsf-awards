 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to Northern Arizona University to                     continue a successful Research Experiences for                                  Undergraduates Site.  The project will be sponsored by the                      three colleges at the University; Arts and Sciences, Social                     and Behavioral Sciences, and Engineering and Technology.                        Under the guidance of Faculty Mentors students will conduct                     research in the neural and behavioral sciences.  The total                      research internship integrates two major components.  During                    the year-long research internship, students receive training                    in research design, statistics, reading complex scientific                      literature, introduction to advanced technologies in                            research design and implementation, seminars in the history                     and philosophy of science, and an integrated lecture-                           discussion series that covers the range of research topics                      in neural and behavioral sciences. The program combines this                    training phase with research experiences during the academic                    year.  Scientists from the Department of Biology and the                        Department of Psychology will sponsor 10 research                               internships for undergraduates.  The Department of                              Vocational and Technological Education will provide training                    in advanced technologies, including basic computer training                     (wordprocessing, graphics, statistics, electronic                               communication) and training in the application of computer                      assisted design systems for production of research software                     and instrumentation.  The Science and Mathematics Learning                      Center will provide coordination and administrative                             assistance for the project, and also training in the basics                     of experimental design, statistics, reading scientific                          literature, scientific and technical writing, and                               collaborative learning.  Scientists from all participating                      departments will contribute lecture-discussion series on                        neural and behavioral research.",
