Straus of the                        Chemistry Department, San Jose State University to study                        zirconium-based alkylation of organic substrates.                               Alkylzirconocene compounds in the presence of strong bases                      promote either alkylation of aldehydes and ketones to form                      alcohols or abstraction of alpha-protons to yield enolates.                     Straus will expand the range of such reactions and investigate                  the mechanism by which they occur.  The reactions may involve                   the formation of an anionic zirconium complex or the production                 of a mixed alkoxide alkyl compound.                                             %%%                                                                             Alkyl zirconium compounds have been extensively studied under                   acidic conditions because of their utility in olefin                            polymerization and metathesis.  Here, the compounds will be                     studied under basic conditions, in which preliminary studies                    have shown they can be effective in some circumstances in                       forming carbon-carbon bonds.  There is potential for the                        research to identify some reactions that will be valuable for                   synthetic organic chemistry.  The project will be carried out                   primarily by undergraduate students and will provide an                         opportunity for them to learn a variety of advanced laboratory                  skills.",
