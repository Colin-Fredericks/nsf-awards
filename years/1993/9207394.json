This effort will                                      feature the theoretical aspects of collective                                   electrical properties in low dimensional systems.                               The researchers will explore two basic features                                 of the spin density wave excitation: a) Coulomb                                 effects in the low temperature nonlinear                                        conduction and b) the unusual low-frequency                                     response below the gap energy, including weak                                   relaxation processes.  Results leading to                                       separation of thermal effects and the influence                                 of thermally excited screening carriers should                                  contribute to our understanding of spin density                                 wave dynamics.                                                                                                                                                  This research in solid state physics fulfills the                               US-Hungary Joint Fund's program objective of                                    advancing science by enabling leading experts in                                the U.S. and Hungary to combine complementary                                   talents and pool research resources in areas of                                 strong mutual interest and competence.  Funds for                               the project are provided through the US-Hungary                                 Joint Fund, Budapest, in accordance with                                        established guidelines.",
