 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of atmospheric frontal boundaries to general                weather patterns has been known for some time and has been the                  subject of many studies.  Typically, frontal structures are several             hundreds of kilometers long and tens of kilometers wide.  Imbedded              within the larger frontal structures are features that range from               a few to approximately ten kilometers in scale.  Understanding of               these substructures is considered important to furthering our                   knowledge of the atmospheric factors that determine the exact                   location, timing and magnitude of mesoscale meteorological                      phenomena such as locally heavy precipitation events.                                Using numerical models the Principal Investigator will                     investigate two important mesoscale aspects of frontal structures.              The first is to explain the phenomenon of the collapse of a frontal             surface to a very small scale.  This process is not well                        understood, but is important to understanding frontal structures                and evolution.                                                                       A second avenue of research is the effects of topography on                fronts.  Again, this is an important area of research for                       understanding frontal evolutions.  The Principal Investigator will              continue his research as to how fronts are effected by mountains                under certain synoptic meteorological environments.",
