The study  consists of bargaining experiments where pairs of negotiators  bargain over the division of a sum of money for a fixed number of  periods.  The experiments vary the type of arbitration procedure  used if an agreement is not reached and the information available  to the negotiator about the arbitration process.  One experiment  compares negotiator behavior under final offer and two types of  conventional arbitration.  The conventional arbitration treatments  differ in the relative weight the arbitrator places on the offers  of the parties and the facts of the case.  The subjects'  uncertainty about the beliefs of the arbitrator is also  manipulated.  A second experiment focuses on the role of new  information and post-offer bargaining under final offer  arbitration.  The results of these studies will contribute to our  understanding of disputes across a variety of settings and the role  of dispute settlement procedures in the resolution of disputes.    ***",
