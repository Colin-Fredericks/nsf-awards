 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three specific objectives are proposed.  The first is to develop              an in-vivo plant cell import system for experimentally determining              necessary and sufficient C-terminal targeting signals on plant                  peroxisome proteins.  Preliminary data indicate that the GUS gene               with an appended S-K-L-COOH and delivered biolistically to cultured             tobacco cells, is directed to putative peroxisomes.  Histochemical              and double indirect immunofluorescent staining suggest this system              will be worth pursuing.  The second objective is to discover                    whether the C-terminal tripeptides on plant peroxisome proteins are             necessary and/or sufficient for import in vivo into peroxisomes of              cultured mammalian cells.  In preliminary studies, the C-terminal               tripeptide A-R-M of cottonseed isocitrate lyase was found necessary             for import into CV-1 monkey kidney and CHO cells.  The third                    objective is to discover the targeting signal(s) necessary and                  sufficient for import of catalases into peroxisomes of plant and                mammalian cells. There are essentially no data elucidating the                  specific putative targeting signal(s) for any eukaryotic catalase,              the basic constitutive enzyme of all peroxisomes.  Through                      unexpected preliminary results, a means was discovered whereby it               is possible to distinguish experimentally-imported, native catalase             from endogenous peroxisomal catalase.  This breakthrough will                   permit the determination of whether internal signal(s) within C- or             N-terminal domains direct catalase to eukaryotic peroxisomes.                   %%%                                                                             Compartmentation of enzyme reactions and/or entire metabolic                    pathways within organelles is essential to the overall coordination             of cellular processes and functions of all eukaryotic cells.                    Understanding biogenesis, differentiation, and function(s) of each              organelle is essential before we can comprehend the complex,                    integrated functions of cells.  One of the most active areas of                 cell biological research which pertains directly to cell regulation             and function is intracellular protein trafficking to organelles.                The overall goal of the proposed research is to discover and                    elucidate molecular targeting signals on enzymes which are directed             to, and translocated into, plant cell peroxisomes.  Peroxisomes                 occur in virtually all eukaryotic cells and conduct a variety of                essential metabolic function(s) related to the cell type in which               the peroxisome resides.  Recent experimental research on peroxisome             targeting signals revealed that a C-terminal tripeptide motif was               necessary and sufficient for import into mammalian and yeast                    peroxisomes.  Surveys of published DNA sequences and western blot               screens with antisera to a \"consensus\" tripeptide (S-K-L) indicated             that the motif was common for most, but clearly not all, peroxisome             enzymes among a variety of eukaryotic organisms.  Evidence also                 exists for some internal and N-terminal cleavable peroxisome                    signals.  A primary reason that experimental data do not exist for              targeting signals on any native plant peroxisome enzyme is that                 import systems, either in vitro or in vivo, have not been developed             for plant cells.  The aim of this project is to close that                      informational gap by developing and exploiting an experimentally                manipulable in vivo plant peroxisomal import assay system.",
