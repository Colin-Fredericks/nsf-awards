 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program for community college physics teachers is                          providing four workshops at several community college campuses                  around the nation.  Two of these workshops introduce the use of                 microcomputer-based laboratories in physics and another covers                  the development of conceptual exercises and overview case                       studies.  A fourth workshop provides and update and an                          opportunity for previous participants to work together to                       develop and exchange appropriate curriculum materials necessary                 to return to their campuses and start implementing the workshop                 ideas.  The impacts of the workshops are reinforced afterwards                  by a networking system and a newsletter.  These workshops                       facilitate the incorporation of new knowledge at community                      colleges which enhances their students' understanding of                        classical and contemporary physics.  The task of updating                       science education programs at community colleges is important                   for students (particularly women and minorities) who attend                     community colleges and who need to be exposed to, and gain                      experience with, current technology, and who need effective and                 sensible encounters with physics education.",
