 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research is to utilize the Cro protein-operator               system of bacteriophage Lambda to develop an 15N nuclear magnetic               resonance method for studying DNA-protein interactions.  15N                    labeled A, T, C, and G nucleotide derivatives which can be used                 in the normal phosphoramidite chemistry for synthesizing                        oligomers of DNA will be prepared.  Complementary double strand                 17-mers containing one AT or one GC base pair enriched with 15N                 (>90%) will be synthesized.  15N NMR resonances are very                        sensitive to hydrogen bonding.  Thus, when the protein binds to                 the DNA with formation of hydrogen bonds between the N-atoms of                 the bases and the amino acid side chains, the resonances from                   individual N atoms will undergo shifts.  In this way, the                       specific atoms of the bases in the DNA which are interacting with               the protein will be mapped.  The method will be generalized to                  predict the nature of DNA/protein interactions involving proteins               of unknown structure.                                                           %%%                                                                             DNA-protein interactions are central to control of all aspects of               the life of the cell.  Nevertheless, short of X-ray                             crystallography, contemporary biologists have few tools with                    which to study the details of these important interactions.  The                work proposed involves use of stable 15N isotope-substituted DNA                molecules and nuclear magnetic resonance to provide detailed                    information about the interactions between proteins and DNA.                    Such studies may lead a rapid means for obtaining unprecedentedly               detailed information about such interactions.",
