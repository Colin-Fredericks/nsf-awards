 "awd_abstract_narration": "This awards supports the research of Professor W. Fulton, M.               Nori and post-doctoral associate B. Totaro to work in algebraic                 geometry.  Topics to be studied include Toric varieties, algebraic              cycles, cohomology of arithmetic groups and K-Theory and relations              between algebraic geometry and combinatorics.                                        The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the             oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the              point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have             stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the              plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the              field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis                and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those                    fields.  Moreover it has proved itself useful in fields as diverse              as physics, theoretical computer science, cryptography, coding                  theory and robotics.",
