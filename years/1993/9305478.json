On particular interest are the properties of  frozen ferrofluids, which are interesting random magnet systems.  %%%  This is a Research Planning Grant that will allow the principal  investigator to attend meetings and participate in other activities  that will facilitate the preparation of a full proposal in the area  of ferrofluids.  Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of magnetic  particles which are of great interest both fundamentally and  technologically.  They are used in magnetic clutches and can also  serve as friction reduction and cooling media in loudspeaker coils.  ***",
