The  objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty  in science and engineering, to enhance the academic career of  recent PhD recipients by providing flexible support for research  and educational activities, and to foster contact and cooperation  between academia, industry, and institutions that support research  and education.  Dr. Mazuka has already made significant research  contributions to the field of psycholinguistics, and she has the  potential to become a leader in academic research and education.    Over the last few years, Dr. Mazuka's cross-linguistic  investigation of natural language processing has led to the  conclusion that there are significant differences between the ways  Japanese- and English-speaking children process language.  This  conclusion has critically challenged the hypothesis that mechanisms  of natural language processing are universal.  This award will  allow the investigator to pursue her research interests in cross-  linguistic comparisons of native Japanese and native English  speakers.  Dr. Mazuka will examine how Japanese speakers manage a  high degree of indeterminacy early in a sentence, through a series  of psycholinguistic experiments using methods of eye movement  monitoring, self-paced reading, and on-line grammaticality  judgments.  Since the analysis of temporal ambiguity has critically  shaped research in language processing, she will pay particular  attention to the fact that English is a Right-Branching, Head-  Initial language and Japanese is a Left-Branching, Head-Final  language.  The first year of the project will be conducted in Japan  at the University of Tokyo and NTT Basic Research Labs.    This research holds promise of forming a new interdisciplinary  research paradigm in the theory of language-cognition relations and  first language acquisition.  In addition, the results of t he  research will provide critical psycholinguistic data on Japanese  sentence processing.  ***",
