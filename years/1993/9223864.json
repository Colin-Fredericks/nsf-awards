Terjung, Department of Physiology, State                                        University of New York, Syracuse, is on                                         \"Mechanisms Controlling Intramuscular Lipid                                     Metabolism.\"  Skeletal muscles play an                                          important role in the whole lipid metabolism                                    since they remove a considerable amount of                                      circulating lipids that are partly oxidized and                                 partly stored, forming an intramuscular                                         triacylglycerol (TG) pool.  However,                                            contribution of intramuscular TG to energy                                      metabolism at rest and during exercise as well                                  as systemic and local mechanisms controlling TG                                 synthesis and utilization in muscle cells are                                   poorly recognized.  The purposes of the planned                                 study are: (1) to elaborate an adequate system                                  for quantitative estimation of intramuscular TG                                 metabolic turnover; (2) to determine an                                         influence of muscle contractions of different                                   intensity and duration on the rate of synthesis                                 and utilization of intramuscular TG, and to                                     estimate TG contribution to exercise energy                                     metabolism; (3) to investigate the effects of                                   physical training, nutritional status, dietary                                  modifications and some hormones on the                                          intramuscular TG metabolism; (4) to evaluate                                    interactions between the systems controlling                                    intramuscular TG metabolism, the mechanisms of                                  lipid removal from the plasma by skeletal                                       muscles and the whole body lipid metabolism.                                    The results are supposed to enlarge the                                         understanding of metabolic adaptation to                                        physical work, and dietary modifications and                                    the role of physiological factors in prevention                                 and therapy of some lipid metabolism                                            disturbances-- e.g., atherosclerosis, obesity.
