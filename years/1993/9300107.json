 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. John P. Fackler of the Chemistry Department, Texas A&M                      University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                    Organometallic Program for investigation of the chemistry of                    dinuclear and polynuclear complexes of Group 11 elements,                       particularly copper and gold.  Fackler will model metal-metal                   bond formation and rupture, as related to bimetallic oxidative                  addition reactions.  The emphasis is on the influence of                        neighboring metals and coordinated ligands in gold complexes,                   but the results will have relevance to catalytic reactions of                   other d-10 metals, such as copper(I), silver(I), nickel,                        platinum and palladium.  The luminescence properties of these                   compounds will be exploited for characterization.  Mixed metal                  cluster systems involving copper(I) and silver(I) will also be                  studied, along with species containing platinum and gold chains.                %%%                                                                             In this basic research project, Dr. John Fackler of Texas A&M                   University will synthesize new compounds which contain two or                   more metal atoms.  Gold will be used in most of these                           compounds, in combination with copper or silver.  One compound,                 for example, that will be prepared will contain a chain of six                  gold and platinum atoms.  The purpose of the study is to                        investigate the reactivity of the compounds in reactions in                     which small molecules, such as carbon monoxide and sulfur                       dioxide, are inserted into or across the metal-metal bond.                      These reactions serve as models for many types of catalytic                     reactions involving gold, platinum, palladium, silver, and                      nickel.",
