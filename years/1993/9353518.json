 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant is to bring together the elements needed                    for writing and submitting a district wide grant for teacher                    enhancement in the area of environmental studies and earth                      sciences.  Specifically, the planning grant will be used to                     build a consensus of support from among the local                               businesses, colleges, government agencies and secondary                         teachers; establish two high school teams of teachers to                        plan two curricula; plan the instructional components needed                    for the proposed institute.                                                                                                                                     The system is now planning to establish a school within a                       school in 1993-1994, devoted to the environmental and earth                     sciences which is closely tied to research projects at sites                    of various state  and federal agencies.  The plan is then to                    broaden the participation in these projects to all of the                       district schools in the coming years.  The project builds                       upon the district's strategic location where there are many                     locations of ongoing research including; 1) Loxahatchee                         River, a federally designated wild and scenic river, 2)                         Jonathan Dickinson State Park which includes a number of                        threatened ecosystems, 3) Jupiter Marine Science Center, 4)                     Marine Life Center of Juno Beach and 5) MacArthur State                         Park.  The Loxahatchee River Environmental Control District                     has already provided the annual rent and a full-time staff                      member to the Jupiter Marine Science Center for this                            project.",
