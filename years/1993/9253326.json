 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue training teachers at the University of               Illinois at Chicago and will begin the training of teachers at two              other sites -- the University of Wisconsin-Parkside and DePaul                  University.  Training will consist of intensive summer workshops on             student-centered methods for teaching, such as using cooperative                learning using innovative problem-solving/applications-oriented                 materials.  The teachers will gain experience using the materials               in the summer by teaching groups of high school students taking                 summer courses.                                                                                                                                                 Each teacher will implement the materials in a double-period class              of first-year integrated high school mathematics during the                     following school year for the same students that attended the                   summer course.  There will be support seminars during this school               year to support the teachers, as well as in-class observation by                project staff.  This support will continue for two more summers and             school years, with the teachers teaching second- and third-year                 high school mathematics those years to the same students.                                                                                                       In a total of five high schools spread among the three centers, the             Interactive Mathematics Project materials will be implemented by                the teachers supported by this project.                                                                                                                         A comprehensive evaluation plan will track student performance and              retention of teachers from this project.",
