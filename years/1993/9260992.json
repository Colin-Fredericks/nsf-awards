 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foraging behavior and its interactions with the environment are                 complex and multidimensional. Simulation holds the promise of                   helping laboratory biologists and field ecologists work with data               and theoretical models and gain insights into behavioral                        mechanisms. The increasing power of desktop computers has brought               computer simulation technology to  anew level of accessibility. The             use of simulation in foraging behavior research is in its infancy;              there is great potential for its use in representation and                      interpretation of actual and simulated experiments. It is clear                 that with appropriate behavior simulation models, biologists and                ecologists could make significant advances in understanding                     foraging processes. The goal of Phase I is to evaluate simulation               techniques for a prototype foraging behavior simulation model. The              approach will be to develop a shell program that will allow users               to specify foraging tactics, habitat structure, etc., and to set up             simulated factorial experiments. We will evaluate simulation                    techniques and algorithms for their specific application to                     behavioral processes. This project will require original research               on the question of how to simulate phenomena such as decisions and              spatial behavior.",
