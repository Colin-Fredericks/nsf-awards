 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year Master's degree program is designed to train                    two groups of 40 well-prepared high school mathematics                          teachers to provide leadership in modernizing mathematics                       teaching in the greater Los Angeles area.  The program                          includes the study of mathematical content, pedagogical                         issues, and leadership skill development.  It focuses                           especially on the importance of visualization in                                mathematics--emphasizing applications of computers and                          graphing calculators.  The program format consists of a 2-3                     week summer institute, a 3-semester hour course in the fall,                    a 2-day winter workshop, and a course meeting for three long                    weekends in the spring.  This basic format is repeated in                       each of the three years.  Year 1 focuses on mathematical                        content, alternative teaching styles, and familiarizing                         participants with technology and its applications in the                        classroom.  During Year 2, participants assemble and adapt                      suitable curricular materials, and implement them in their                      classrooms--while, at the same time, they observe, document,                    and reflect on the changes in themselves and their students.                    Year 3 focuses on developing, practicing, and exercising                        leadership skills: participants are expected to present at                      local conferences, give in-service workshops, and--in                           cooperation with project staff--plan and put on local                           teacher conferences.  A master's thesis is required for the                     degree.  Plans call for supporting the participants in their                    implementation, dissemination, and reform efforts by means                      of electronic networking, periodic meetings, and a                              newsletter.",
