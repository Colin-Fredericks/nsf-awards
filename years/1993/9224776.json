 "awd_abstract_narration": "When Hurricane Andrew slammed into Everglades National Park                with wind gust over 170 mph, it deciminated the local forest                    while leaving areas of open wetlands largely unharmed.  Trees                   were stripped of al their leaves, most branches were broken off,                and m any trees were toppled or shattered.  Only a few trees                    remained standing in some mangrove forests.  Evergreen woodlands                were transformed from lush forest to brown tangles of leafless                  debris.  Bald cypress and slash pine forest were also heavily                   damaged.  Although Andrew was a natural disaster of enormous                    scale, hurricanes in the region have been frequent in the past                  and must have been an important force shaping these forests.  As                the first major hurricane to directly strike the Park in over 25                years, Hurricane Andrew presents a rare opportunity to                          investigate the speed and patterns of forest recovery.  This                    information is important because forests make up critical fish                  and wildlife habitats and recreational areas with the Everglades,               even though the Everglades are commonly thought of as open                      wetlands.                                                                            Both the degree of damage and the speed with which trees can               regrow will determine which species make up a post-hurricane                    forest.  The native tree species within the Park appear to differ               greatly in their abilities both to withstand hurricane-force                    winds and to regrow after hurricane damage.  The recovering                     forest should be composed of those tree species that were damaged               the least, those that can resprout the fastest, as well as those                that can invade open areas.  Research will focus on the extent of               damage to the trees species within mangrove, tropical hardwood,                 pine, and cypress forests in Everglades National Park.  Data will               also be taken on which species recover from damage, how fast they               recover, and which species colonize open areas in the forests                   left by the hurricane.  This information will help to predict                   what the recovered forests should look like as well as understand               how hurricanes have affected these forests in the past.",
