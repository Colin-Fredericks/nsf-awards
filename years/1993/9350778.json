 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350778  Prusch  The Biology Department at Gonzaga University is attempting to  both increase and strengthen the laboratory component of a  newly-revised and expanded Cell Biology course and to increase  research opportunities for undergraduate majors. The former  upper division one semester Cell and Molecular Biology course  has been expanded to two semesters and is now directed at  sophomore level biology majors. The laboratory component of  this expanded Cell Biology course will introduce students to a  variety of techniques used in cell biology as well as reinforce  concepts introduced in the lecture portion of the course. One  of the most basic as well as important techniques used  routinely in cell biology is fluorescence microscopy.  Fluorescence microscopy can be used to follow a wide variety of  events in living cells in real time, as well as the  distribution of specific substances in fixed cells. For  example, students will be able to study endocytosis in living  cells from the initial interaction of a signal with receptors  on the cell surface to endosome or phagosome formation.  Cytoskeletal rearrangements in response to environmental  stimuli and localized biochemical events in living cells will  be studied. Acquisition of fluorescence microscopes will give  biology students new experiences in their laboratories and  greatly broaden the opportunities for the use of modern  technology in their own research projects.  ***",
