 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306938  Ando       One of the principal tools of algebraic topology is the use  of algebraic invariants called homology theories to analyze  topological spaces.  In the course of his work on conformal field  theory, Edward Witten made several surprising observations about  the relationship between three important homology theories,  singular homology, K-theory, and elliptic cohomology.  The  general principal is that to understand the K-theory of a space,  one should understand as much as possible about the singular  homology of its free loop space, and similarly for elliptic  cohomology and K-theory.  At about the same time, Mike Hopkins  and various collaborators were showing the fundamental importance  to algebraic topology of a sequence of homology theories E-sub-n.   Their work involves a very profitable interaction between  algebraic topology and number theory.  It turns out that  E-sub-zero is close to singular homology, E-sub-one is close to  K-theory, and E-sub-two is close to elliptic homology.  Ando  outlines how certain conjectures of Witten and of Hopkins, et  al., might be closely related.  He intends to investigate these  relationships and make them more precise, in the hopes that the  advances in these two areas of research can inform each other  more directly and fruitfully.       The theme of this project, drawing connections between  deep algebraic and number theoretic theories on the one hand and  deep geometric (topological) theories on the other, is repeated  again and again in modern topology.  As the theories grow  increasingly intricate, it is only through such overall  principles of organization that mathematicians keep the structure  manageable and within the grasp of human mental powers.  The  instant project bears on one of the most fruitful recent  developments of this nature.  ***",
