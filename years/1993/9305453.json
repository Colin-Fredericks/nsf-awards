 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305453  Southworth    In flowering plants, the process of fertilization underlies  production of seeds and fruits.  Although the structural events of  double fertilization have been described, little is known about the   molecular mechanisms of fertilization.  Plant sperm are embedded in  pollen grains and move down the growing pollen tubes.  Near the  egg, the pollen tube releases two sperm: one fuses with the egg to  form the embryo, the other fuses with the central cell adjacent to  the egg to form the endosperm that supports growth of the   developing embryo.  A major unanswered question in plant  reproduction is how the sperm recognizes the egg or central cell,  adheres to it, and fuses with it.  Recognition molecules may be in  or on gamete membranes.  Monoclonal antibodies to sperm cell  surfaces are the first step in identifying unique sperm molecules.   The goals of this project are (1) to identify unique sperm membrane  molecules by screening monoclonal antibodies to isolated plant  sperm cells and (2) to involve undergraduates in a pioneering  research project.  The antibodies will be obtained from fusions of  splenocyte of mice immunized with sperm cells from Brassica.  The  results will further our knowledge of basic developmental  mechanisms that function in plant reproduction and will lead to a  basic understanding of fertility and sterility in plants.  Such  information can be used to produce hybrids from incompatible  species and inhibit fertilization where male sterility is required  to prevent self-crossing.  Undergraduate students will gain  valuable insight into active research by solving problems and  assisting in attainment of goals.  The research experience will  facilitate their development as scientists.  ***",
