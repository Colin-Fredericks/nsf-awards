 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are creating a new and innovative undergraduate laboratory                   in high-energy physics, based on a study of catastrophic energy                 loss by muons which was done at Fermilab and published this                     year in Physical Review D.  In the Fermilab experiment, the                     energy deposition spectrum of cosmic rays was studied using an                  iron/scintillator calorimeter.  The undergraduate laboratory                    version is being constructed of lead and scintillator.                          Although typical cosmic-ray muons deposit very little energy,                   one in 10,000 muons undergo a catastrophic energy loss and                      create a high-energy electromagnetic shower within the                          detector.  Students not only study the electromagnetic showers                  themselves but also use the highest energy showers to estimate                  the cosmic ray spectrum.  The apparatus is small enough to fit                  on a lab bench, yet exposes the student to state-of-the-art                     techniques for calorimetry and data acquisition which are used                  in present-day particle-physics experiments.",
