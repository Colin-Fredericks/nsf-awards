 "awd_abstract_narration": "This theoretical research will concentrate on three areas: (i) the              dynamics of interfaces separating phases of matter; (ii) the                    kinetics of phase transitions; and, (iii) polymer statistical                   mechanics.  The work on interface dynamics and pattern formation                will involve examples from solidification as well as from fluid                 mechanics, and will contain aspects of both conceptual, e.g.,                   defect dynamics in Hele-Shaw flow, and practical, e.g., materials               fabrication, levels.  The kinetics of phase transitions work will               involve, for example, studies of the phase separation process under             a variety of conditions, e.g., external driving fields or shear                 flows.  Aspects of this work may have eventual application to the               fabrication of polymer blends.  The polymer statistical mechanics               research will involve fluctuations in inhomogeneous media and will              bear on stabilizing interfaces between different media.                         %%%                                                                             The study of interfacial regions between different phases of                    matter, water and ice, for instance, is one of the most fundamental             topics in condensed matter physics and one of the most practical in             materials science.  Analytical and numerical techniques will be                 used to study the evolution of interfaces and the kinetics of                   associated phase changes under a variety of conditions.  The                    research will have important consequences for materials growth and              fabrication, as well as basic physics.",
