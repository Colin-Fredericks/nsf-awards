Work will involve study                                   of some of the largest tin deposits in the                                      world, which are located in China.  Most great                                  tin-producing districts contain morphologically                                 different types of tin mineralization, and it                                   is important to distinguish among the types,                                    both geologically and in terms of genetic                                       process.   This study will improve the basic                                    understanding of the metallogeny of tin and of                                  the processes that lead to its enrichment to                                    commercially minable levels.  This in turn                                      could lead to improved exploration efficiency                                   by indicating new and different approaches in                                   exploration for tin deposits.                                                                                                                                   This study will involve continuing field study                                  in China, sample collection, and analytical                                     work.  The Chinese PI will visit Colorado to                                    continue analytical work, and several                                           publications are expected.",
