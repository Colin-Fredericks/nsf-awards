 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307723  Sangani    The proposed research is to study in detail flows of bubbly liquids  at large Reynolds number and of gas-solid suspensions at vanishing  small Reynolds number and finite Stokes number.  These flows are  known to exhibit a number of distinct flow patterns depending upon  flow rates and physical properties of the individual phases and the  flow configuration.  A combination of theoretical concepts of  statistical mechanics and numerical simulations of the appropriate  equations will be used to:  (i) obtain a reliable set of averaged  equations for describing these flows, including the closure and  constitutive relations to be used in such equations; (ii) study the  nonlinear growth of incipient instability of their uniform states  leading to transitions to slug flows and bubbly fluidized beds; and  (iii) search for mechanisms that stabilize the uniform state of  bubbly liquids and gas-solid fluidized beds.    The techniques to be developed for computing hydrodynamic  interactions between bubbles and liquid, or between solid and gas,  are expected toprovide the background for studying a variety of  engineering problems that arise in industrial processes for  dispersions and composites.",
