 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  This             research investigates task-level planning for autonomous agents,                such as mobile robots, that function in an uncertain environment.               These robots typically have very approximate, inaccurate, or                    minimal models of the environment.  For example, although the                   geometry of its environment is crucial to determining its                       performance, a mobile robot might only have a partial, or local                 \"map\" of the world.  The research will investigate an approach                  whereby the robot attempts to acquire the necessary information                 about the world by planning a series of experiments using the                   robot's sensors and actuators, and building data structures based               on the robot's observations of these experiments.  A key feature of             this approach is that the experiments the robot performs should be              driven by the information demands of the task.  This research                   develops (1) a theory of sensor interpretation and task-directed                planning using perceptual equivalence classes, intended to be                   applicable in highly uncertain or unmodelled environments, such as              for a mobile robot; (2) algorithmic techniques for modeling                     geometric constraints on recognizability, and the building of                   internal representations (such as maps) using these constraints;                (3) explicit encoding of the  information requirements of a task                using a lattice (information hierarchy) of recognizable sets, which             allows the robot to perform experiments to recognize a situation or             a landmark; and (4) synthesis of robust mobot programs using the                geometric constraints, constructive recognizability experiments,                and uncertainty models imposed by the task.  This research will                 also implement the theory and test it on mobile robots in                       the laboratory.",
