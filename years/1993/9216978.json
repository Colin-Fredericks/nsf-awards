 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Charles Adams, MS Laurie Webster will                collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will utilize                    archaeological and ethnographic materials as well as historical                 accounts to reconstruct the prehistoric and early historic Pueblo               Indian system of textile production and exchange. She will visit                a number of museums which house specimens and study the methods                 by which they were manufactured. Because of the dry Southwestern                U.S. environment many textiles preserve well in archaeological                  contexts and therefore it is possible to gain information on                    prehistoric textile use. Extensive ethnographic collections also                exist and therefore one can trace changes into historic times.                                                                                                  Textiles played a very important role in Pueblo society. In                     addition to their utilitarian function they were widely used for                religious and other symbolic purposes. They played a major                      economic role and social role. When the Spanish conquered the                   Pueblo peoples they reorganized textile production and in some                  areas established an industry. Textile manufacture was also                     affected in more indirect ways with the introduction of new                     materials, such as sheep wool, dyes and weaving implements. Ms.                 Webster's goal is to trace changes from the pre-Spanish through                 Spanish period. The ultimate purpose is not to understand                       textiles as textiles, but rather to use them to gain insight into               the Pueblo economic and social systems and to learn how this                    indigenous group adapted to culture change.                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of the relationship between material culture                  and social/economic organization. It will shed new light on the                 American past and assist in the training of a promising young                   scientist.",
