 "awd_abstract_narration": "The meeting on Regulation of Eukaryotic mRNA Transcription will be              an open international meeting.  This meeting follows on the success             of two previous meetings on the same topic in September, 1989 and               August, 1991.  The need for a meeting devoted to the topic of                   Regulation of Eukaryotic mRNA Transcription is evidenced by the                 rapid advances being made in this field during the last years.                  This meeting will ensure that the most recent results and                       methodologies are exchanged and discussed in an atmosphere of face              to face contact.  This will lead to enhanced progress in this                   rapidly moving field.  The meeting will be open and attendance will             only be limited by the facilities available to 425 participants.                Oral presentations by invited speakers will raise the general                   interest of the meeting by ensuring that the leaders in the field               present their latest results.  These invited presentations will be              complemented by oral presentations selected from submitted                      abstracts and three separate poster sessions.  The areas to be                  covered by the Regulation of Eukaryotic Transcription Meeting                   include studies on 1) general transcription factors and initiation              complexes including mammalian, yeast, and Drosophila systems; 2)                transcription elements and factors involved in tissue-specific                  expression; 3) inducible transcription factors and nuclear                      signalling events; 4) steroid receptors; 5) the structure and                   function of transcription factors; and 6)transcription of                       developmentally regulated genes.  In addition, there will be                    representative lectures on transcriptional control mechanisms in                prokaryotes so that fruitful comparisons can be made.                           %%%%                                                                            The meeting on Regulation of Eukaryotic mRNA Transcription is an                international meeting.  Rapid advances have been made in this field             during the last two years.  This meeting will ensure that the most              recent results and methodologies are exchanged, which will lead to              enhanced progress in this rapidly moving field.  The cost of the                meeting as requested in direct grants and fees paid by participants             is modest compared to the expense of operating even a single                    research laboratory, yet the benefits of free exchange of                       information will compensate for this expense many times over.                   Invited oral presentations will be complemented by other                        presentations selected from submitted abstracts for three separate              poster sessions.",
