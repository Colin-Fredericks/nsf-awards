Microcomputer-  Based Laboratories (MBLs), which typically consist of a computer,  sensors, graphing software, and instructional materials, were  developed to give students a hands-on learning method and have  been shown to improve student performance.  Results of the Phase  I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish the  technical basis for going beyond the conventional MBL by  integrating existing, state-of-the-art, low-cost, palm-sized,  portable data acquisition equipment into a new educational tool,  Earth Explorer, a Portable Microcomputer-Based Laboratory (PMBL),  which will allow students to collect data without being directly  connected to the computer yet permit them to download that data  after collection.  The objectives of the Phase II study focus on  (1) creating Earth Explorer courseware for additional sixth grade  science education units; (2) modifying and expanding the Earth  Explorer hardware; (3) improving and enhancing the Earth Explorer  software and related materials; (4) creating teacher education  materials for understanding and effectively using the Earth  Explorer system; (5) designing and implementing an effective  evaluation process; and (6) conducting a national field test  involving schools representing socioeconomic and racial diversity  in their student populations.    By providing an instructional system, the Earth Explorer, that is  compatible with and usable in a broad range of curriculum  frameworks, the project will aim to provide an opportunity for  students to benefit from instructional strategies which  capitalize on student interest through active hands-on  participation.  ***",
