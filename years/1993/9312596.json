 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312596  Chakrabarti  This proposal involves the analysis, by simulation methods, of  phase transitions within random porous media. In particular, the  phase separation of binary liquid mixtures and the isotropic to  nematic liquid crystal phase transition will be studied. Comparison  will be made to experimental results and to simple theoretical  models. The porous medium will be modelled so that it has an  interconnected and tortuous structure resembling Vycor glass (a  common experimental medium). The 3D simulation methods to be used  are a) Monte Carlo to study the equilibrium conditions and b)  Numerical solution of the time dependent field equations to study  the kinetics of the ordering processes. These are lattice models  and their solutions will be implemented on the parallel  architecture of the Connection Machine.  %%%  Porous media have a profound effect upon the phase transitions of  systems contained within them. In this proposal, the phase  separation of two component liquids and the isotropic (molecular  axes randomly oriented) to nematic (melecular axes aligned)  transition of liquid crystals will be studied by computer  simulation. Although significant experimental and pure-theory work  have been performed here, little simulational work has been done.  The present proposal seeks to ask (and answer) specific questions  which neither experiment nor theory can hope to answer alone. The  work will involve the numerical solution of model liquids and  liquid crystals trapped within a model porous medium designed to  represent the tortous and interconnected structure of Vycor glass-  the principal experimental medium. The simulations will be  performed on a parallel architecture computer. This work has  significant relevance to our undertsanding of processes occuring  within rocks or within catalysts.  ***",
