Mueller of the Institute of Zoology, Albert  Ludwigs University, Freiburg, Germany.  The objective of their  research is to test various hypotheses about the reproductive  strategies and parental behavior of male \"burying beetles\"  (Nicrophorus vespilloides).  They will carry out field experiments  manipulating various factors that influence reproductive behavior in  order to test the effect of male assistance on brood success.    Paternal care is rare in insects, and the factors favoring its  evolution remain unclear.  Burying beetles are one of only a few  arthropod taxa exhibiting biparental care, in which both parents  obtain food for the developing young.  There are several hypotheses  to explain the continued presence of the male; however, field  studies to examine the effects of the male's presence on the number  of surviving young have not been done.  This research will test two  competing hypotheses (paternal care and mating effort) and attempt  to improve understanding of this area of insect behavior.  ***",
