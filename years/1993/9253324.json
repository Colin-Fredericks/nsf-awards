 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 5-year SEA (Sea Education Association) project offers                      two intensive summer institutes each year - one for                             elementary school teachers and one for middle through high                      school science and mathematics teachers - in marine and                         nautical sciences, designed to provide participants with a                      general knowledge of marine sciences, ideas of field and lab                    work that can be implemented in the classroom and passed on                     to other teachers, and practical experience working at sea                      as part of a team conducting scientific research.  Twenty-                      three elementary school teachers and twenty-three middle and                    high school teachers will be selected nationally each year                      to participate in the summer institutes, for a total of 230                     teachers over the course of the project.                                                                                                                        The Sea Experience programs will begin with shore-based,                        three week components held in Woods Hole, MA at SEA's                           campus; here, teachers will participate in courses                              emphasizing basic concepts in physics, chemistry, geology                       and biology which can be conveyed to students through                           studies of the ocean.  The final ten days of each program                       will be spent on board one of SEA;s fully equipped                              oceanographic research sailing vessels, where teachers will                     participate in the practical hands-on experience of carrying                    out research projects and in the operation of the vessels.                      Follow-up activities will include annual workshops for Sea                      Experiences participants, and each teacher will be committed                    to presenting two in-service training workshops in their                        home states.  Teachers will be provided with a large variety                    of materials to use in their own teaching and will also be                      required to conduct two workshops for colleagues in their                       home schools.                                                                                                                                                   This proposal is appropriate for Teacher Enhancement because                    it is designed to enhance the science knowledge and teaching                    of participants, and because it provides practical                              experience working as part of a team conducting scientific                      research.                                                                                                                                                       Non-NSF Cost-sharing is approximately 34% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
