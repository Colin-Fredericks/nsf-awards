 "awd_abstract_narration": "Self-incompatible Petunia inflata and a self-compatible cultivar of             Petunia hybrida will be used as model systems in an ongoing study               of the molecular, biochemical, and genetic bases of gametophytic                self-incompatibility. The first objective is to provide direct                  evidence for the role of the S-gene (the gene encoding the pistil               S-protein) in the recognition and rejection of self pollen. Two                 approaches will be taken: a) transgenic P. inflata plants obtained              by introducing S1-gene into S3S3 genotype, and S3-gene into S1S1                genotype, will be tested to see whether the ability to reject                   pollen bearing S1-allele and S3-allele respectively has been                    conferred by the transgenes; b) antisense S1-gene will be                       introduced into P. inflata plants with S1S3 genotype to see whether             the ability to reject S1-bearing pollen is annulled in the                      transgenic plants. The second objective is to determine the                     regulatory sequences for the pistil-specific expression of the S-               gene and rnx2 gene (encoding RNase X2) by examining the expression              of a series of promoter-GUS constructs via transient assays and in              stable transformants. The third objective is to identify and                    characterize other components that participate in self-                         incompatibility interactions. PCR techniques will be used to                    investigate whether the S-gene is expressed in pollen during its                growth in situ. Chromosome walking experiments will be used to                  identify sequences linked to the S-gene that might encode other                 components of the self-incompatibility system. An approach based on             immunoprecipitation will be used to examine whether pollinated                  pistils contain any proteins that interact with S-proteins. These               experiments may lead to identification of the long sought pollen                component of the S-locus. The fourth and final objective is to                  determine the genetic basis for the breakdown of self-                          incompatibility in the self-compatible cultivar of P. hybrida.                  Genetic crosses have been designed to test a model implicating a                modifier locus in the modulation of S-alleles activity in self-                 incompatibility interactions.",
