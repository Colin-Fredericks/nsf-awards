 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive sampling designs are designs in which the procedure               for selecting the units to include in the sample may depend on                  observed values of the variable of interest.  In previous                       research supported by NSF grants DMS-8705812 and DMS-9016708, the               methodology of adaptive sampling was advanced to the point where                now there are a number of practical adaptive designs, giving                    remarkably high efficiencies for sampling rare, clumped, or                     aggregated populations compared to conventional designs of                      equivalent sample size.  Theoretical results suggest, however,                  that greater potential still exists.  It is proposed to further                 develop the basic theory of adaptive sampling and look for new                  classes of adaptive sampling designs.                                                Adaptive sampling designs are designs in which the procedure               for selecting the units or sites to include in the sample depends               on observations made during the survey.  For example, in a survey               to estimate the abundance of a rare animal species, additional                  observations may be made in the vicinity of sites with high                     observed abundance.  In a survey of an environmental pollutant,                 additional observations may be made in the vicinity of discovered               ``hot spots.''  For such surveys, adaptive sampling designs can                 provide estimates of far greater precision than can be obtained                 with conventional designs of equivalent sampling effort.                        Research is proposed to develop the theory and methods of                       adaptive sampling. The proposed research  has immediate,                        important applications to many fields, including environmental,                 ecological, and natural resource studies.",
