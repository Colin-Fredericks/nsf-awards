 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308421  Kahn    Political campaigns are crucial to a functioning democracy because,  at the very least,s they energize voters to participate in the  electoral process, they provide a specific time period for voters  to reflect on the state of the nation, they afford a forum for  politicians, elites, and experts to debate the important issues of  the day, and they supply a mechanism by which candidates can  communicate directly with voters.    In this study, the investigators focus on the process by which  candidates communicate with voters and how these messages affect  the behavior of voters.  Specifically, they examine the nature and  consequences of campaigns for the U.S. Senate.  Senate elections  present an optimal setting for the study of campaigns because these  elections provide impressive variation in candidates' political  experience, campaign strategy, campaign spending, and media  coverage.  Unlike campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives,  which are usually low-key affairs, and presidential races, which  are often highly competitive contests, campaigns for the U.S.  Senate vary considerably in their intensity.  Some races are  lopsided, where one candidate wins easily; others are competitive  where one candidate ekes out a narrow victory; and still others  fall somewhere in between.    This investigation involves three distinct data collection  activities focusing on the 1988-1992 elections for the U.S. Senate:   1) interviews with senate campaign managers; 2) an examination of  the candidates' political advertisements; and, 3) a study of the  newspaper coverage of the senate campaigns.  These new data allow  an examination of the process by which candidates and newspapers  communicate information to voters.    In addition to collecting these data, the investigators rely on  survey data already available from the National Election Studies.   The National Election Study conducted a state by state survey of  potential voters for each senate election in 1988, 1990, and 1992.    These surveys asked voters, among other things, what they knew  about the candidates, what they liked and disliked about the  candidates, and which candidates they supported at the polls.   These survey data, coupled with the three data sets being created,  will enable the investigators to gauge voters' reactions to the  messages emananting from the campaign, and provide insight into how  voters decide their vote.  ***",
