 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this fifteen-month project are to design and implement             a curriculum for the critical first year of calculus at                         comprehensive universities and two-year colleges. The program                   adapts and synthesizes methods from successful calculus reform                  efforts and is crafted to meet local needs.                                     The curriculum stresses and facilitates cooperative learning,                   develops visual thinking with the aid of interactive graphing                   technology, and uses writing to help students learn and communicate             mathematics. These methods are integrated in an environment that                focuses on the central ideas of calculus and provides a progression             of problems and projects to challenge students while improving                  their confidence and study skills.                                              The project establishes a collaborative partnership among Sam                   Houston State University, North Harris College, San Jacinto College             Central, and Tomball College.  Two faculty members from each of                 these four institutions will serve as site leaders.  All eight site             leaders will meet regularly to share ideas, experiences, and                    materials.  A volume of student assignments will be compiled to                 serve as a resource for college faculty across the nation.",
