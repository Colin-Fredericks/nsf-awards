The program includes a                                  series of lectures covering many topics in                                      particles physics instrumentation that will be                                  augmented by \"hands-on\" participation in six                                    laboratory experiments designed to demonstrate                                  the material presented.  The opportunity to                                     participate in the experiments sets this school                                 apart from others aimed at the same audience of                                 graduate students and young Post Docs from                                      developing countries.  The 1993 IFCA School is                                  the first held in Asia, and it is expected that                                 most of the 70-80 students will come from the                                   Pan-Asian region.  Its goal is to encourage                                     young physicists from developing countries in                                   elementary particle physics experiments and                                     provide them with the knowledge and skills that                                 will enable them to undertake detector                                          development for these experiments.                                                                                                                              Scope:  The purpose of the school is foster                                     initiatives in detector development at the                                      participants' home institutions and to initiate                                 collaborative efforts that involve physicists                                   from both technically advanced and developing                                   countries.  The goal of increased foreign                                       collaboration is timely considering two factor:                                 1) the ambitious program of detector develop-                                   ment in the US during the next decade that is                                   linked to the commissioning of the Super-                                       conducting Supercollider and 2) the shortage of                                 trained scientific manpower in the US in the                                    field of experimental elementary particle                                       physics.",
