This objective will be pursued through the development of an interdisciplinary effort in the area of intelligent material processing and manufacturing.  Two fundamental problems associated with U.S. process development today are:  (1) the majority of manufacturing processes are not completely understand, and (2) product quality is not monitored and optimally adjusted during  fabrication.  While initially emphasizing molded  or advanced composite products, the effort will address these  two basic problems by focusing on three coupled manufacturing science areas.  These are:  (1) improved process models for molding and advanced composites msnufacturing situations, (2) sensor subsystems for in situ product quality assessment during manufacturing, and (3) knowledge based tools for real time manufacturing processs adapation.  In the improved process model area, a software package for the simulation of molding processes that occur during the manufacture of monolithic and advanced composite materials will be improved through a sequence of developmental computational research phases.  A concurrent effort will focus on the development of a generic methodology for the utilization of process model information in an inverse manner.  This inverse process model utilization will be done in a real time feedback control environment to compensate for the fact that even the best models are rarely perfect.  The sensor subsystem component of the program will focus on the developme nt of hardware/software subsystems for monitoring product quality in real time during fabrication cycles.  A methodology for determining temporal flow progression and temporal spatial rheology during operations will be developed.  Several sensory transducer mechanisms will be investigated, but the  initial focus will be on the usage of electronic and  optical fiber sensors.  The knowledge based process adaptation phase of the program will focus  on the need  for generic computer based control tools fir implementating real time inverse process model  information.  The effort will include the use of artifical neural networks, with necessary training  information obtained from process simulation models rather than from actual manufacturing datqa.  Fundamental research advancement in the three coupled interdisciplinary manufacturing science areas described will help facilitate an improved capability for intelligemt adaptive manufacture of molded and composite products for U. S. military and commercial applications.              A parallel teaching effort will be undertaken and directd at educating engineers who are  well grounded  in scientific fundamentals, capable of crossing traditiiiional disciplinary boundaries, and comfortable in environmentals charqcterized by design oriented, open ended asignments.  Students will develop these traits as a result of being exposed to an academic environment that mimics professional situations throughout the education process.  The development and improvement of interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate courses in the arcas      h)          0*0*0*         of manufacturing science and intelligent material systems will continue.  In all cases, student driven learning rather than instructor dominated lecture presentation will be encouraged , as it has been found that such a format increases student enthusiasm and does not constrain the upper level to which subject are explored.  All educationL efforts will be carried out with the following simple goal in mind:   to identify knowledge that is of critcal importance to our American society and to guide individuals as they apply enjoyable and effiecient techniques   to thoroughy acquire this knowledge.",
