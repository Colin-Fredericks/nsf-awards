That collection was recently enhanced when Yale accepted two orphaned paleobotanical collections from the New York Botanical Garden and Princeton University.  This support will allow the preservation, housing and incorporation of the orphaned collections into the main collection, computerization in ARGUS  of the more than 42,000 fossil plant specimens, dissemination of the database over Internet, and identification and segregation of the more than 4000 type specimens that are critical to research in paleobotany. Yale will  produce a type catalogue both in published and electronic form, the dissemination of which will increase the access to and research and educational use of these collections.  %%%  This award will support the preservation of two important, historical collections of fossil plants at Yale Peabody Museum recently orphaned by the New York Botanical Garden and Princeton University.  These collections, along with main Yale collection will be computerized, with the resultant database made freely available electronically and in print.  This activity will not only preserve an essential research resource in paleobotany, but will make this resource much more broadly available for research and education in the history of plant diversity.  ***                 \"  @ !    pj  F     `z  QS  l  >t F 6 E U    Q       v .
