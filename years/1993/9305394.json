 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dramatic increase in tourism as an important dimension                 of the global economy has been manifest in many regions of the                  world.  Much of the research on tourism in geography and other                  social sciences has focused on the tourists and on their impact                 on local areas.  The analyses often have depicted local residents               as seemingly helpless victims of much wealthier visitors from                   other parts of the world.  Relatively little attention has been                 given to the attitudes of the local residents, however,                         especially in those locales where the residents have actively                   promoted tourism to boost the local economy.  This doctoral                     dissertation project will explore the role of local initiatives                 to advance tourism in the Guizhou region of southern China.                     Ethnographic methods, including archival research, interviews                   with local leaders, and participant observation will be used to                 gather information at a number of tourist sites in and near the                 city of Kaili in southeastern Guizhou.  Special emphasis will be                placed on the processes through which local leaders are                         attempting to maintain the region's distinctive ethnic character                and identity while facilitating economic development through more               active tourism.                                                                      This project will provide valuable new information and                     insights about the actions and attitudes of an ethnic minority                  group as it attempts to use tourism to boost its economy without                harming its culture.  Although specific information will focus on               a single region in southern China, the results of this project                  should provide more general understandings useful in the analysis               of other places.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement award,                 this award also will provide support to enable a promising                      student to establish a strong independent research career.",
