 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304953  Hepler    Pollen tube elongation delivers the male gametes to the egg  apparatus and is thus essential for sexual reproduction in plants.   Within this highly polarized cell, vesicles are produced throughout  and transported by cytoplasmic streaming to the apical region.  By  a process that is not well understood, these vesicles fuse  specifically at the tip, providing new wall material that supports  unidirectional elongation.  Recent work has shown that a growing  pollen tube of Llium has a sharply defined gradient in free calcium  focused at the extreme apex of the tube.  The further observation  that dissipation of this calcium gradient leads to cessation of  growth, and that reinitiation of growth is accompanied by its  reformation provide evidence that the gradient is essential for tip  growth.  The purpose of this research is to analyze the  relationship between the calcium gradient and tip extension in  detail.  Using indicator dyes that have been microinjected into  pollen tubes the spatial profile of the calcium gradient will be  examined in living cells and directly correlated with the rate of  tube elongation.  Cells will then be experimentally treated with a  variety of agents including calcium buffers, channel agonists,  antagonists, osmotic modulators, and growth inhibitors to allow a  careful exploration of the relationship between the position and  magnitude of the calcium gradient with the modulated growth  behavior, and with the underlying cell structure and patterns of  cytoplasmic streaming.  The position and activity of calmodulin  will also be studied in living cells using confocal laser scanning  microscopy and fluorescence anisotropy.  Finally, the relationship  between the calcium gradient and the actin cytoskeleton will be  examined in living pollen tubes using confocal microscopic analysis  of cells that have been microinjected with fluorescent actin  monomer.  By correlating the calcium gradient with these several  factors, a new and greater understanding of  the mechanism of pollen  tube elongation should result.  %%%  In higher plants, the male reproductive cells (gametes) are carried  in pollen grains.  For fertilization to take place, the pollen must  deliver the male gametes to the egg apparatus within a flower by  producing a tube, along which the male gametes move toward the egg.   The pollen tube is the fastest growing of all plant cells.  As it  grows, it becomes several thousand times longer than it is wide.   Because of its importance to plant reproduction and its dramatic  growth characteristics, the mechanisms regulating pollen tube are  important topics of research.  The goal of this project is to  understand the role of calcium ions in pollen tube growth.   Sophisticated biophysical and structural techniques will be used to  study the gradient of internal calcium along a growing pollen tube.   The results should determine whether the calcium gradient plays a  role in the organization and movement of the sub-cellular  structures involved in pollen tube growth.  ***",
