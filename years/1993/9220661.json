 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser feedback microscopy (LFM), a new type of scanning                         confocal optical microscopy, originated in this laboratory.                     Presently, we have produced a LFM which measures surface                        topography of low-reflectance samples with a z-resolution                       down to a nanometer (10-9 meter).  LFM, a far-field optical                     microscopic technique, allows the examination of biological                     samples under         physiological conditions; there is no                     requirement for transfer to a high-vacuum environment or the                    imposition of other special preparative conditions, e.g.,                       staining or shadowing. We are requesting funds to further                       develop and extend the construction of prototype instruments                    and their application to LFM imaging of biological and other                    materials. The major goal presented in this proposal is the                     attainment of LFM x,y-resolution in the 10-50nm range,                          rivaling that of         electron microscopy and approaching                    the resolution of surface-probe techniques such as scanning-                    tunneling and atomic-force microscopy. In addition, LFM has                     the capability of measuring microscopically the optical                         properties of materials; we will utilize this unique feature                    to provide new methods of \"optical contrast\" resulting in                       unconventional microscope images conveying important                            information about biological preparations. Finally, a fully-                    instrumented, computer-console controlled LFM with the                          highest possible resolution will be built for general use in                    the biological sciences.",
