 "awd_abstract_narration": "93-53227   Bishop  Nevada's Systemic Improvement Plan  The University and Community College System of Nevada (UCCSN) proposes systemic  improvement (SI) activities that will allow the university research institutions to be successful  in nationally competitive research grant programs.  These activities and plans focus around  several themes that are remaining barriers to research: space and facilities; equipment;  organizational structure; personnel (faculty, students, staff); and visibility.  Nevada's SI plan is  multi-level in terms of its organization.  SI activities will be and are taking place at the state  level, at the cluster level, and at the level of individual faculty.    At the statewide level, activities have been designed to provide permanent improvements in the  research structure and organization of the UCCSN.  The three research institutions, DRI, UNLV  and UNR, have created and filled positions for Vice President for Research (VPR).  The VPRs  are working together to reorganize the university system infrastructure in ways that foster and  encourage research activities.  The State EPSCoR Committee is being reorganized, moving from  governance to outreach.  Communication between state government, business and the university  is being facilitated and enhanced by the formation of a not-for-profit public-private partnership  called Nevada Industry, Science, Engineering and Technology, Inc.    At the research cluster level, SI activities will fund equipment for important research facilities,  and allow the hiring of new faculty, postdocs and graduate students for the cluster programs.   Three research clusters have been armed around several research themes: bridge engineering,  chemical physics and plant responses to rising CO2 and temperature (plant biology).  These  clusters have been chosen because they represent the three groups for which a relatively small  amount of SI will provide a very large benefit.  Two important research facilities are currently  near completion: the Brid ge Engineering Laboratory and the Great Basin Environmental  Research Laboratory (GBERL).  In both cases, equipment requested in this proposal will  essentially complete the laboratories.  When the GBERL is complete, it will be one of the best  plant growth facilities in the world, capable of doing, for the first time, full plant-canopy gas  exchange experiments under precisely controlled conditions.  The bridge engineering laboratory  will be one of the ten or twenty best large scale structure labs in the country.    At the level of individual faculty, SI activities will be aimed at three areas: departmental/  programmatic review, proposal development enhancement and individual research enhancement.   These activities will be coordinated and/or conducted by the new Director of the Nevada  EPSCoR program.  The review process will be directed towards the identification and  preparation of new research groups that are nearly ready for participation in EPSCoR.  Proposal  development enhancement activities will improve the ability of all faculty to write a successful  research proposal.  Because of isolation and a lack of mentoring by senior faculty, many faculty  who are creative and have good research ideas have not learned the skills that are necessary to  write a successful research proposal.  An expected benefit of this activity is that some faculty  should be able to leapfrog past the EPSCoR process, directly to being nationally competitive.  The third activity at the individual level will be to develop a systemwide individual research  enhancement program.  This program will be a competitive small grant program operated by the  new EPSCoR Director, aimed at providing funding for creative, new ideas that need maturing  before being ready for nationally competitive grant programs.    Human resource development is an important component to Nevada's SI plan.  We have  included a human resource development cluster: \"Women in Science and Engineering: Greater  Participation and Higher Productivity.\"  The purpose of this cluster is to improve the ability of  women scientists and engineers to acquire nationally competitive grants, and to encourage high  school and undergraduate women to choose careers in science and engineering.    By developing a systemic improvement plan that has activities at all levels, maximum  participation and benefit for all research-oriented faculty is assured.  Focused plans to enhance  certain research activities have been chosen to maximize EPSCoR resources and to assure  graduation of the three research clusters to national prominence.",
