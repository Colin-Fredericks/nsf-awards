 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in hormone levels and metabolism in pregnant females in a               number of species, including humans, can influence the                          development of the fetus.  These changes in fetal development can               result from adaptive responses to normal fluctuations in the                    environment as well as from the teratogenic effects of chemicals                injected by the mother.  Indeed the toxic effects of nicotine,                  cocaine and alcohol result from their interference with the                     normal biochemical pathways that regulate fetal development,                    pathways similar to those used in an organism's normal adaptive                 response.  Dr. Horton will examine the mechanisms by which the                  maternal system transmits information about changes in day                      length, a naturally occurring environmental cue, to the fetus                   during gestation.  It is known that prenatal photoperiodic                      information influences postnatal rate of growth, body weight and                reproductive development.  She proposes that melatonin, a hormone               produced and secreted by the pineal gland, is a likely candidate                for this transfer of information since it crosses the placenta                  from the maternal to the fetal circulation and is involved in                   regulation of circadian rhythmicity.  Using an innovative                       technical procedure to administer melatonin in a physiologically                meaningful manner, Dr. Horton will identify those factors in the                maternal system which communicate day length information to the                 fetus.  The results of these fundamental studies will lead to a                 better understanding of the mechanism by which the maternal                     system can alter the unfolding intrinsic genetic program                        regulating the development of the fetus.",
