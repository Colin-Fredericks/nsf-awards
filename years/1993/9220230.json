 "awd_abstract_narration": "9220230  Kempf  The purchase of a laser, scanning, confocal microscope is proposed with  a 50% cost-share by Auburn University. The microscope will be utilized  for research concerned with vitellogenesis and endocytosis,  neurodevelopment, receptor-ligand binding, the role of  compartmentalization of kinase and substrate during nervous system  differentiation, physiological function of Na/K ATPase and carbonic  anhydrace in water balance, neural network modeling, hypervelocity  micrometeoroid impacts, tissue cyst formation by parasites, high  temperature radiator technology, and the hormonal control of  reproductive organ differentiation. This research will use a variety of  techniques including 3-dimensional reconstruction, topographic imaging,  analysis of metabolic function via the use of vital fluorescent dyes,  and analysis of calcium distribution and flux. The microscope will  serve the needs of many faculty at Auburn University whose research  programs require the unique capabilities of this instrument. This  includes a number of investigators whose research efforts are hampered  by having to travel a considerable distance to University of Georgia,  Athens to gain the use of such a microscope. The proposed  instrumentation will be housed in the Auburn University Cell Science  Center where it will be readily available for use by the PIs submitting  this proposal, as well as by other faculty and students. Investigators  that have need of a confocal microscope are from a number of different  departments and represent diverse disciplines including Protozoology,  Developmental Biology, Cell Biology, Physiology, Molecular Biology,  Parasitology, and Electrical Engineering",
