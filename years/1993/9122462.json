 "awd_abstract_narration": "The General Social Survey (GSS) and its allied surveys in the                   International Social Survey Program (ISSP) gather data on                       contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain                   trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes and                examine the structure and functioning of society in general as well             as the role played by relevant sub-groups.  These data are also                 used to compare the United States to other societies in order to                place American society in comparative perspective and develop                   cross-national models of human society.  Since 1982 the GSS has                 conducted 19 independent cross-section surveys of the adult                     household population of the United States and in 1982 and 1987                  carried out oversamples of black Americans.  By collaborating with              distinguished social science institutions around the world, the GSS             obtains comparable cross-national data that greatly enhance its                 scientific value at virtually no additional cost.  ISSP currently               has 18 participating nations.  Each year 2,000 respondents from the             United States are interviewed and about 20,000 respondents from                 other countries.   The GSS has aptly been described as a \"national              resource\" because it makes high quality data easily accessible to               hundreds of social scientists who use the data annually for                     research papers and thousands who use the GSS in classrooms.  The               GSS is second only to the Census/CPS in its use among sociologists.                                                                                             This grant renews support for the GSS for five separate in-person               cross-sections each with 1,500 cases using a biennial, split sample             design in order to substantially reduce costs and still maintain                the same scope of the GSS.  In 1993 there will be a GSS with 1,500              cases, a core of 60 minutes, a 15 minute standard topical module on             culture, and a 15 minute ISSP module on the environment.  In 1994               two major innovations are introduced.  First, the traditional core              is substantially reduced to allow for the creation of mini-modules,             i.e., a block of about 15 minutes devoted to some combination of                small to medium size supplements.  Second, the 3,000 case sample                will consist of two parallel sub-samples of 1,500 cases each.  The              two-subsamples will both contain the identical core.  The A sample              will in addition contain a standard topical module, mini-modules,               and an ISSP module on women, work and the family.  The B sample                 will have a second topical module, mini-modules, and an ISSP module             on the environment.  The Board and PIs will extensively solicit                 proposals for the topical and mini-modules from the social science              community.  In 1996 the same design described in 1994 will be                   repeated.                                                                                                                                                       The GSS will play an extremely important role in providing data for             social scientists to study the human dimensions of global                       environmental change.  Information on the attitude of respondents               to the environment in the United States and at least the 19 other               countries now participating in ISSP will be collected in 1993 and               1994.  A group of additional environmental items of interest to the             European Community are to be developed by EC members of ISSP to                 supplement the ISSP environmental module.  Starting in 1994                     additional environmental items will be added to the core.  These                will be chosen from the ISSP module, the EC supplement and the                  extant literature.",
