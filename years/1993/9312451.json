This new technique involves the use of high power  tungsten-halogen lamps to raise the temperature of a  semiconductor wafer rapidly to the desired curing temperature.   By use of multivariable feedback control it is possible to  maintain the wafer temperature within an acceptable tolerance  band.  Until recently, the only accurate method of performing the  required temperature mearsurments was to imbed thermocouples in  the wafer.  This technique, however, is not practical for use in  production.  A potential breakthrough in performing the required  measurement is based on the use of a multi-wavelength infrared  imaging pyrometer recently developed by NJIT's Electronic Imaging  Laboratory in conjunction with the David Sarnoff Research Center.   This sensor, in principle, is capable of measuring the  temperature of the wafer through a sapphire window with the  required accuracy.    Extraction of temperature data will entail sophisticated data  processing, owing to the requirement of estimating both  emissivity and temperature at the different wavelengths.   Extended Kalman filtering (EKF) is the preferred algorithm.  Use  of the EKF algorithm, however, impacts on how the control problem  is formulated.  In particular, it is necessary to use a nonlinear  dynamic model of the process in order to capture the correct  temperature dependence for estimation of emissivity.  Hence,  designing a closed loop controller necessitates dealing with a  nonlinear control and estimation problem.  The proposed  investigation will address this problem and the theoretical  issues it raises.  ***",
