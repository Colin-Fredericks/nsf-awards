 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306971  McGrane  This research planning grant project uses transgenic mice to  investigate the molecular mechanism of growth hormone (GH) action  at the nuclear level.  The mice are transgenic for a chimeric  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)/bovine GH gene.  These  mice exhibit symptoms of altered glucose metabolism, manifest  primarily as insulin resistance.  We are seeking to explain this  observation by characterizing the key genes involved in  carbohydrate metabolism which are regulated by GH.  During the  research planning phase of this investigation we will measure the  GH-regulated expression of \"early\" response genes, c-fos and c-jun.   It is postulated that the altered expression of these transcription  factors will affect a second stage of expression, involving genes  important in carbohydrate metabolism.  In order to measure the  \"early\" response in transgenic mice with chronically elevated blood  GH, we will perform partial hepatectomies and measure c-fos and c-  jun expression in the regenerating liver.  Information from these  in vivo studies will be confirmed by experiments involving GH-  treatment of primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice.  It is  anticipated that these feasibility studies will allow us to measure  GH-induced early molecular responses in the whole animal.  This  will provide basic information of the mechanism of GH action, which  at the present time remains undefined.    We are using a unique animal model to study the way growth hormone  (GH) affects glucose metabolism in the whole animal.  In order to  do this, we have introduced a foreign GH gene into mice.  These  mice have significantly elevated levels of GH in the blood and we  can measure the effect of this overproduction.  In this project, we  are looking at GH regluation of gene expression.  The genes which  we are focusing uon are those which code for proteins important in  the processing of glucose in the liver.  For example, GH may have  biological effects in the nucleus of lever cell s and \"turn on\" or  \"turn off\" the transcription of given genes.  This may alter  metabolic pathways which are involved in utilizing glucose for  energy or storage in the liver.  At the present time, the mechanism  of GH action is poorly understood.  These studies should provide  basic information on the mechanism of GH action so that we can  begin to understand the way this hormone works.    ***",
