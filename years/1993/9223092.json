 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223092  Brown  During an earthquake, a structure must be provided with some  lateral restraint by the foundation because of the  horizontal accelerations involved.  For piles embedded in  liquefaction-susceptible soils, this lateral support  requirement can dominate the design of the foundation.    The objective of this project is to evaluate the lateral  soil resistance exerted on a deep foundation during a strong  earthquake which causes the cohesionless soil to liquefy.  The aim is to improve the understanding, and provide a  better estimate, of the lateral support provided by  liquefied soil: currently the lateral resistance of  liquefied soil is completely neglected in design, leading to  a conservative and therefore more expensive building  foundation.  Preliminary studies show that even small  amounts of soil resistance result in a more economic design.  Therefore the lateral soil resistance -- although it is  expected to be low -- should be quantified and included in  the design.    This research project includes a large-scale (nearly full  scale) experimental study under laboratory controlled  conditions.  It consists of a large sand-filled liquefaction  tank, in which the sand in liquefied, and an instrumented  shaft is accelerated horizontally to measure the lateral  resistance of the liquefied soil.  This experiment does not  attempt to model the complete pile behavior.  The complete  lateral behavior is modeled numerically once the correct  lateral soil resistance in the liquefied zone is measured  and understood.  ***",
