 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frank Quinn has shown that, for n >= 5, a connected                        generalized n-manifold (n-gm) X has an associated resolution                    obstruction, given by a \"local index\" i(X), which is an integer                 congruent to 1 mod 8.  X is resolvable if and only if i(X)=1.                   This result, combined with a theorem of R. D. Edwards, implies                  that an n-gm X, n >= 5, is a topological manifold iff X has the                 disjoint disks property (DDP) and i(X) = 1.  Left open in the                   results of Quinn was the question of whether nonresolvable                      generalized manifolds exist.  Recently, the investigators,                      together with Steve Ferry and Shmuel Weinberger, have shown that,               given any simply connected, closed n-manifold X, n >= 6, and any                integer m = 1(mod 8), there is an n-gm X, homotopy equivalent to                M, with i(X) = m.  The discovery of these examples raises several               questions about the topology of generalized manifolds and these                 questions form the basis of this project.  The ultimate purpose                 is to understand the general classification scheme of generalized               manifolds in high dimensions with the immediate goal of                         discovering to what extent these spaces behave like real                        manifolds.                                                                           A topological manifold of dimension n, or n-manifold, is a                 geometric object that looks locally like euclidean space of                     dimension n.  Thus, scientific phenomena modeled on these spaces                can be expressed and analyzed, using local coordinate systems.                  One of the central problems of geometric topology has been to                   prescribe a \"topological characterization\" of (locally) euclidean               spaces.  By this we mean a list of properties that a topologist                 could use to check whether or not a given space is a manifold.                  Characterizations of manifolds of dimension one or two have been                known for a long time, but higher dimensional characterization                  schemes have proved to be elusive to formulate and verify.  A                   characterization of manifolds of dimension greater than four was                conjectured by James Cannon in an address to the 1978                           International Congress of Mathematicians in Helsinki.  Frank                    Quinn discovered that Cannon's criteria would yield a solution to               the problem,                                                                    provided that an additional integer invariant is zero.  Recently,               the proposers, along with Steve Ferry and Shmuel Weinberger,                    found a large class of geometric objects of dimension greater                   than five that satisfy Cannon's criteria, but have non-zero Quinn               invariant.  There is evidence that these new spaces should be                   incorporated in the class of manifolds and a common theory                      developed.  The investigators intend to study the foundational                  aspects of the theory and its potential applications.  As an                    example, among other things, they plan to relate these                          \"generalized manifolds\" to the study of dynamics on manifolds by                showing that they may play the role of axis of symmetry of                      motions in space.",
