 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energy consumption usually increases at a faster rate than              does economic output in developing nations, because almost all                  major changes associated with economic development                              (industrialization, increases in the capital-to-labor ratio,                    substitution of commercial energy for traditional energy, the                   construction of modern infrastructure, mechanization, and                       urbanization) require more intensive use of energy.  Economic                   development in China in the 1980s did not follow this pattern,                  however, as energy intensity actually declined by almost 30                     percent from 1980 to 1988.  This project will explore this                      decline in China's energy intensity and will identify those                     factors that were responsible for the reduction.  Energy will be                examined as an intermediate input in the production of goods and                services, and changes in energy intensity will be examined within               the framework of both final demands and production technologies                 and functions.  Structural-decomposition analytic techniques will               be used to analyze data from a range of different sources that                  document Chinese economic activity over the study period, thereby               forming the basis for merging quantitative modelling approaches                 at macro and micro levels with qualitative assessments based on                 case studies, site visits, and personal interviews.                                     This project will enhance understandings about this                     important topic in a number of ways.  The database used for many                of the analyses will bring together relevant information from a                 diverse range of sources, thereby facilitating research by                      others.  Knowledge of the relationships between economic                        development and energy use in China will be improved, but these                 insights also will provide new perspectives for other nations.                  Of special utility will be new knowledge of ways that national                  and regional policymakers might be able to foster energy                        conservation while simultaneously spurring economic development.",
