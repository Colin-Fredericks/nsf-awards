 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the role of clay mineral surfaces                 in the synthesis of oligomeric molecules relevant to the origin                 of life. Specific goals include the development of                              regiospecific syntheses of oligoribonucleotides in aqueous                      solution without using blocking groups to help understand how                   the olignucleotides required for the \"RNA World\" first formed.                  Template directed syntheses of oligomers of A and G will be                     studied using U and C oligomers respectively, formed by                         montmorillonite catalysis, and will be carried out in the                       solution phase and on mineral surfaces. An investigation of the                 effect of different phosphorus activating groups on oligomer                    formation will utilize 2-aminobenzimidazole and 4-aminopyridine                 groups. The elongation of oligomers, 10 mers to 50 mers, will                   be studied in which the incorporated pyrophosphate groupings                    will be utilized as sites of ligation. The role of mineral                      catalysis of the ligation reaction will be investigated.                        %%%                                                                             With this Renewal Award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                       supporting the research of Dr. James P. Ferris of the                           Department of Chemistry at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.                    Professor Ferris will focus his work on the study of the role                   of clay minerals in the synthesis of oligomeric molecules                       relevant to the origin of life. In doing so, he will develop                    new synthetic approaches to the preparation of olignucleotides                  and gain understanding how the oligonucleotides required for                    the \"RNA World\" first formed. These studies in prebiotic                        chemistry are of intrinsic general interest to all segments of                  society.",
