Ellen                    Jamison of the Center for International Research of the                         Bureau of the Census will derive the numbers from the                           population census of each country:  France, 1982 and from                       the annual labor force surveys for 1985 through 1992; United                    Kingdom, 1981 census and from the annual labor force surveys                    for 1986 through 1990; Japan, census samples for 1980, 1985                     and 1990; and, Canada, 1986 and 1991 censuses.
