There is                                              a critical need for such sensors at                                             present since the temperature of                                                the water influences the results of                                             the etching process; etch rate,                                                 undercutting, and surface quality.                                              In addition, the photoresist used                                               for masking begins to char at                                                   elevated temperatures.  Hence, it                                               is important to measure and monitor                                             the wafer temperature at all times.                                             The proposed effort would result in                                             a novel temperature sensor to                                                   measure and monitor wafer                                                       temperature in dry etching                                                      environment.  The innovation here                                               is that the proposed technique                                                  would enable a non-invasive,                                                    contactless and non-destructive                                                 method of performing surface                                                    temperature measurement in a                                                    plasma etching chamber.  In                                                     contrast, existing techniques are                                               invasive and cumbersome and the                                                 need for contacting precludes                                                   measuring the process-wafer                                                     temperature; instead only the                                                   temperature of the cathode or a                                                 dummy wafer is measured at present.                                                                                                                             The proposed research is to                                                     investigate photoreflectance as a                                               temperature sensor for the above                                                purpose.  The energy gap of the                                                 semiconductor material would be                                                 measured using modulation                                                       spectroscopy and correlated to the                                              surface temperature.  The Phase I                                               effort demonstrate the feasibility                                              and accuracy of this technique.                                                 The Phase II effort would result in                                             a prototype instrument and                                                      demonstrate its use in improving                                                practical etching in an industrial                                              environment.",
