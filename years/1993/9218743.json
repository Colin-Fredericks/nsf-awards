 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of 12 U.S. scientists in a                U.S.-Japan Seminar on Site Response and Ground Failure during                   Earthquakes, to be held June 7-9, 1993 in Northern California.                  The co-organizers are Professor I.M. Idriss, University of                      California, Davis, and Professor Kenji Ishihara, University of                  Tokyo.  The objective of the seminar is to exchange information                 on geotechnical earthquake engineering in such areas as                         liquefaction in sandy soils and the consequences of liquefaction                and the response of soil sites underlain by layers of soft soils                that can amplify the seismic motions (particularly in the long                  period range) and thus pose additional hazards to structures and                other facilities constructed at such sites.                                                                                                                     Seminar sessions will focus on the latest advances in ground                    response and amplification effects, site characterization, ground               failure (case histories such as the Loma Prieta Earthquake), and                analysis of liquefaction-induced flow failures and deformations.                The participants include some young researchers and some                        scientists who have already formed close collaborative ties with                Japanese scientists.  This seminar is a valuable step in the                    continuing efforts to understand and to incorporate into design                 and practice, measures to mitigate the effects of earthquake                    strong ground shaking as manifest through site response and                     ground failure.",
