 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bisch will construct and analysis irreducible subfactors of                the hyperfinite II_1 factor using the combinatorial aspects of                  subfactors and commuting squares.  He will also study connections               between subfactors, quantum physics, and low dimensional topology.              Finally, he will study subfactors of free group factors.  The key               technique here will be Voiculescu's free probability theory.                         The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                 being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
