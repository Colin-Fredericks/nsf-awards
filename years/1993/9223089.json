 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223089  Rumschitzki    This biotechnology project deals with biomedical processes in  the artery from an engineering point of view.  It sets forth a  new hypothesis that the initiation and growth of  subendothelial extracellular lipid packets known as lipsomes  depend on the localized endothelial leakage sites in artery  walls.  Subendothelial transport parallel to the surface  associates an effective radius to each leak.  The project  explores the hypothesis that a new spot that overlaps a recent  one greatly increases the probability of liposome formation.   This approach incorporates artery wall architecture, and in  particular, intimal ultrastructural details, to derive  transport coefficients and a convective-transport theory to  predict spot sizes and to quantitatively link leakages to  liposomes.  Together with the support of a complementary NIH  grant to biological collaborators at Columbia University,  the  project includes the design experiments to determine  parameters needed for these models (e.g., internal elastic  laminar fenestral sizes and spacing, leakage frequency and  duration) and to prove this colocalization.  Finally,  preliminary models are expanded that track liposome initiation  and growth, design experiments to test them and to determine  their parameters and tie these models to the lipoprotein  leakage processes just mentioned.    The novelty of the this project lies in the model's serious  consideration of actual artery wall architecture to formulate  a transport theory that appears much more able to account for  observation than previous models and in its unique co-  development with animal experiments.  It ties together a group  of phenomena, each of which is under study and is of interest  in its own right, in a new and unique way into comprehensive  view of foam cell lesion initiation .    (In particular, it combines work on transendothelial lipid  transport and work on water transport through normal junctions  by the PI's group, Truskey's group and others togeth er with  work by the Simionescus and by Frank and Fogelman on liposome  formation and with work by Wight's group on intimal and medial  proteoglycan structure.  Success of the project would firmly link the chain of events  leading to the early formation of foam cell lesions which can  progress to arteriolsclerosis.  It would firmly establish the  type of transport processes that carry elevated lumen levels  of cholesterol into the artery wall and connect them to  reaction-like liposome-forming processes that can trigger  endothelial  cells to recruit monocytes from the lumen to  enter the arterial intima.  This is one of the important  pieces still missing from the understanding of the early  disease process.    The project is jointly supported by two Engineering programs:   Interfacial, Transport, and Separation; Biomedical Engineering  and Aiding Persons with Disabilities.  ***",
