 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304465 Gott RNA editing, the process by which genetic information is altered at the RNA leave, is a fundamental aspect of gene expression and regulation in a variety of systems.  Some editing phenomena occur globally within an organelle, while others are tissue specific or developmentally regulated.  Despite the almost unlimited potential for the control of gene expression provided by this process, little is known about the mechanisms by which RNA editing is accomplished.  In addition, the specific nature of the changes involved makes editing a potential target for therapeutic agents.  Thus an understanding, at the molecular level, of the mechanisms of editing may have practical applications as well providing insights into another level of the control of gene expression.  Two distinct forms of RNA editing have been described: base substitution and base insertion/deletion.  Preliminary results suggest that both types of editing coexist in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum.  This unique feature, along with biochemical and developmental tractability of the organism, make Physarum an excellent model system in which to study editing mechanisms.  The goals of this research are to identify the intermediates and products of RNA editing in Physarum and to characterize the occurrence and extent of editing relative to the stages of the life cycle.  Based on observed differences between mitochondrial DNA and RNA  sequences from Physarum, two genes have been identified whose expression is likely to depend upon RNA editing.  The proteins encoded by the \"edited\" versions of these mRNAs are highly homologous to subunits 1 and 2 of other mitochondrial cytochrome oxidases, suggesting that th is process is required for the generation of functional mRNAs.  These genes and their RNA and protein products will be characterized further using a combination of techniques, including RNA finger printing, thin layer chromatography, primer extension, nuclease protection, Northern and Southern hybridization, PCR amplification, gel electrophoresis, and in vivo and in vitro isotopic labeling experiments.  Although the biochemical experiments described above are essential to an understanding of the editing process, the identification and characterization of the editing apparatus will be facilitated by the development of a genetic framework in which to study editing.  A necessary prelude to such experiments is an accurate description of the nature and extent of editing events during the complex life cycle of Physarum.  This information will also be useful in the design of future biochemical fractionation experiments and may provide clues regarding potential roles of editing in gene regulation and development in Physarum. %%% This research will help us understand an unusual step in the processing of genetic information. ***",
