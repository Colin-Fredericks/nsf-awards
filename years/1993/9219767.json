 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes an approach to exploring novel                     mechanisms of gene regulation in Leishmania, a Trypanosomatid                   protozoan and one of the most ancient of eukaryotic lineages.  A                number of lines of evidence suggest that transcription initiation               may not be the major regulatory point for gene expression in                    Leishmania.  An attractive alternative model might be that gene                 expression is modulated by regulation of trans-splicing.  The                   maturation of Leishmania nuclear mRNA proceeds via an obligatory                trans-splicing event in which a trimethyl-G capped miniexon is                  ligated to splice acceptor sites located close to the 5' end of                 each coding sequence in a polycistronic precursor RNA.  Therefore,              splice acceptor sites rather than promoters determine the 5' end of             mature mRNAs.  Trans-splicing would be an ideal point for the                   regulation of genes whose expression is restricted to one stage of              the Leishmania lifecycle.  Genes encoding promastigote-specific                 components of Leishmania flagella will be isolated.  Promastigote               specific genes will be characterized by sequence analysis and                   genomic clones will be isolated.  Cis elements responsible for                  promastigote specific expression of flagellar genes will be                     identified and their mode of action determined.  Sequences                      responsible for the stage-specific pattern of expression will be                identified by transfecting chimeric constructs in which potential               regulatory sequences flanking isolated stage-specific genes are                 appended to a reporter gene into both amastigote-like and                       promastigote forms.  Mutant parasite lines lacking individual                   flagellar will be constructed to test for the functional importance             of cloned genes.   Analysis of mutant parasite lines will be                    coupled with ultrastructural and fluorescence microscopic                       examination to develop an understanding of the function of deleted              genes.                                                                          %%%                                                                             Leishmania has two distinct stages in its life cycle with different             hosts and has evolved a morphologically distinct form specialized               for survival in each.  The amastigote form is optimized for growth              in the lysosomal compartment of mammalian macrophage and the                    promastigote form multiplies extracellularly in the gut of the                  sandfly vector.  The unique properties of each stage must reflect               the expression of stage-specific genes but as yet, little is known              about how expression of such genes might be regulated.  The results             of this study should give greater insight into such stage-specific              regulation of gene expression.",
