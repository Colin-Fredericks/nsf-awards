 "awd_abstract_narration": "John R. LaGraff has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                        Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. LaGraff's doctoral degree was in                  Materials Science from the University of Illinois under the                     supervision of Professor David Payne. Dr. LaGraff will continue                 research at the University of Illinois under the sponsorship of                 Professor Andrew Gewirth. Dr. LaGraff's postdoctoral training                   will provide him with skills in advanced surface science                        techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning                   tunneling microscopy (STM). Longer term, he plans to apply AFM                  and STM to study the interfaces and surfaces of oxides such as                  barium titanate in order to determine the role of local defect                  chemistry in controlling nanoscale and bulk property responses.                 %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                   viewed as an important infrastuctural program designed to                       broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                  and teaching.",
