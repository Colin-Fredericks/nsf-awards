An ensemble of telescopes and accessories enhance and  extend the direct experience undergraduates have with the sky.  Students have the opportunity to observe and measure celestial  bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, stars, bright clusters,  nebulae and galaxies directly as well as photograph, measure,  and analyze starlight for its composition, intensity, and time  variations. Six new 8\" telescopes, each equipped with a filar  micrometer, a simple spectroscope, and a photometer, are used  to augment observational work in the laboratory to a greater  degree than was previously possible. Two large-aperture  Dobsonian instruments complement the smaller aperture suite to  allow students to observe deep-sky objects in a hands-on, cost-  effective manner. The new telescopes not only greatly enhance  existing and planned curricular offerings at Saint Mary's  College, but also serve as a community resource for primary and  secondary school training as well as a vehicle for public  viewing nights and programs offered through local community  centers.  ***",
