 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three independent mechanisms of cell-cell adhesion function during              development of Dictyostelium discoideum. The early adhesion system              is mediated by a small protein, gp24, that first appears on the                 surface of cells several hours after initiation of development and              preferentially accumulates in prestalk cells. There are three                   closely linked genes, csbA, csbB, and csbC, encoding gp24 that                  appear to be functionally redundant. Transformed cell lines in                  which one or two of these genes are deleted show alterations in                 early adhesion. Moreover, cells lacking csbC culminate only after               a considerable delay and form gnarled fruiting bodies. Dr. Loomis               will use homologous recombination to replace all three csb loci                 with a transformation vector carrying the pyr5-6 gene. The                      phenotype of the resulting strains will be analyzed in detail to                determine the consequences to cell-cell adhesion and subsequent                 development. He will genetically rescue these triple deletion                   strains by transformation with a wild-type copy of one or more of               the csb genes and then explore the molecular mechanism of adhesion              by determining the functionality of variants generated by site                  specific mutagenesis. Using Restriction Enzyme Mediated Integration             (REMI) to tag developmentally important genes, he will isolate and              characterize other genes essential for cell-cell adhesion during                early development.",
