 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Multicultural Mathematics Project (McMath) will develop an                  introductory, general education course in geometry.  The course                 will use architecture--particularly the architectural                           constructions of the dwelling places of various cultural and                    social groups--as a vehicle to link the discipline of                           mathematics with the disciplines of physics, engineering, urban                 geography, and anthropology.  The course will foster                            multicultural understanding in its exploration of the cultural                  embeddedness of mathematics as reflected in the dwelling places                 of diverse groups of people.  Instructors will employ multiple                  teaching strategies as a response to diverse ways of knowing,                   in order to encourage the academic achievement of all students,                 both those who have had prior success in mathematics and those                  who have not.  Course materials will be piloted and will be                     evaluated both by the development team and by an outside                        evaluator.",
