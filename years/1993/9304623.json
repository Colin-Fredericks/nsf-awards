 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304623  Hemley       This award provides one-half the funding required for the  acquisition of a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer system  (FTIR) that will be installed at the infrared beamline at the  National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National  Laboratory. The Principal Investigator's institution, the Carnegie  Institution of Washington, is committed to providing the remaining  funds necessary for the acquisition of this system.       The FTIR system will be used in a wide variety of ultra-high  pressure studies done in diamond-anvil cells at the NSLS IR  beamline. The high brilliance and broad spectral distribution (from  the visible to the far infrared), and the pulsed-time structure of  the radiation will make possible a new class of spectroscopic  measurements on materials at the ultra-high pressures attainable  in the diamond-anvil cell. Studies made possible by this system  will include infrared measurements of the electronic and  vibrational excitations associated with the metallization of  hydrogen above 150 GPa. Similar measurements will also be performed  on the other planetary gases and ices, including binary and more  complex mixtures. These investigations will provide key constraints  on models of the interiors of the large planets. Electronic  spectra, including band-gap closure phenomena, in iron-bearing  silicates and oxides will be studied over the entire pressure range  of the Earth's lower mantle (to 135 GPa).  ***",
