 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drosophila that have evolved enhanced longevity usually have                    reduced early reproduction.  There are also negative correlations               between reproduction and survival characters (e.g. starvation                   resistance) in D. melanogaster.  Similarly, Drosophila and other                organisms that have enhanced survival as a result of dietary                    restriction have reduced fertility.  What is not clear is how                   nutrition and selection might interact with each other in the                   enhancement of survival, given that both are affected by this type              of trade-off.  The central questions for this project revolve                   around this interaction: (i) Can genetic trade-offs between                     survival and reproduction be surmounted by nutritional                          manipulation? (ii) Can selection change the effects of dietary                  restriction upon survival and reproduction?  Two main experiments               are planned. (1) Estimation of genetic correlations between early               fecundity and starvation resistance (a factor that controls                     longevity) over four nutritional environments.  This experiment                 would test the environmental dependence of genetic correlation.                 (2) Selection for increased starvation resistance under varying                 nutritional regimes:  high or low nutrition before starvation and               high or low nutrition after starvation but before egglaying.  One               of these selection regimes would favor the erosion of the normal                dietary restriction (high then low nutrition), while one would                  favor it (low then high nutrition).  The experiment would test the              degree to which the dietary restriction response can be genetically             changed by selection.  Experiments (1) and (2) might reveal                     conditions under which trade-off between fecundity and starvation               resistance is circumvented.",
