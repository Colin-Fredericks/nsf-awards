 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302201 Cheng A joint research project between the University of Missouri Rolla (UMR) and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) is proposed to experimentally and analytically study a hybrid system for seismic resistant structures.  The innovative system will be developed by integrating tuned viscous dampers with active tendon controllers.  The viscous damper will be designed with low sensitivity to surrounding temperature and self heating as well as the ability to damp out a structure's critical or offending mode.  Active control will provide the forces necessary to bring structural response within prescribed constraints.  The hybrid system is effective in controlling structural response over a wide range of earthquake intensity, wind force and other types of dynamic excitations.  Its adaptability allows application to low and high rise buildings.  The USA component of this project involves an interdisciplinary team consisting of researchers in civil, mechanical, and electrical engineering at UMR.  This team will emphasize a control algorithm and its robustness, manufacturing hybrid devices, experimental verification of control parameters, and a shaking table test of model structural response.  Korea's interdisciplinary research team will focus on numerical analysis of a large number of structures, wind tunnel testing, feasibility studies for the hybrid system's application, and preparation for full scale experiments. ***",
