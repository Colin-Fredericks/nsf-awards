 "awd_abstract_narration": "9220906  Dudash       Inbreeding depression has been the subject of considerable  attention for over 100 years.  Although many researchers have  quantified how progeny generated by self-matings perform poorly  relative to progeny generated from matings between two different  individuals, few empirical studies have focused on the differences  in inbreeding depression in populations that differ in their  natural outcrossing rates.  The main goal of the proposed research  is to determine the underlying genetic basis of the expression of  inbreeding depression in two closely related native species from  northern California, the self-pollinating Mimulas micranthus and  the insect dependent (thus outcrossing) M. guttatus. The objectives  are three-fold.  First, to quantify the degree of inbreeding  depression in terms of both male and female function in two  populations of both the selfing and outcrossing species.  The  effects of inbreeding on female reproductive function are well  documented, but he effects on male function, such as pollen  production are largely unknown.  Second, the genetic basis of  inbreeding depression will be quantified by two greenhouse breeding  experiments.  Third, among-family level variation in inbreeding  depression will be quantified in the outcrossing M. guttatus as a  function of the observed floral variation.  This two-species  comparison will examine the relationship between the mating system  and the genetic basis of the observed inbreeding depression, thus  providing baseline information on the genetics driving changes in  mating systems in natural plant populations.  The results generated  from the research on these two related species will provide  insights into preserving both crop gene pool diversity and rare  species genetic diversity.***",
