First, the                    contractor shall perform all functions related to the conduct and               data processing of the annual \"Survey of Scientific and                         Engineering R&D Expenditures at Universities and Colleges.\"  The                contractor shall provide support for all activities related to                  survey and sample design, survey conduct, data tabulation, and                  production of diskettes and data tapes for general dissemination.               The contractor shall also provide technical support for                         analytical, descriptive, and comparative purposes for data                      maintained in the system.  Second, the contractor shall provide                 maintenance and support of the academic Integrated Data Base                    (IDB).  The IDB includes the survey mentioned above as well as                  two additional academic surveys conducted under separate                        contracts within the Division of Science Resources Studies.                     Under the IDB task, the contractor will produce summaries of                    institutional data, as well as perform systematic edit checks                   across surveys to assess the relationship of financial and                      personnel resources and the validity of the data as reported.                                                                                                   As part of its statutory charge to provide a central                            clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of               data on the current and projected availability of scientific and                technical resources in the United States, NSF collects and                      disseminates statistical data on detailed characteristics of                    science and engineering resources in colleges and universities.                 The annual survey that is the subject of this study as well as                  other academic surveys in the IDB provide statistical data and                  analytical reports for dissemination to users including internal                NSF management and the National Science Board, other science and                technology policy makers, institutional researchers, and private                organizations interested in higher education.",
