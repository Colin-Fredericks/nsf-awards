 "awd_abstract_narration": "The feasibility of diamond ceramics has been demonstrated at                    Crystallume by consolidating diamond powder with CVD diamond to                 near full density producing disks of several millimeter thickness.              In this study, we will develop a high toughness diamond matrix                  composite in collaboration with the University of California,                   Berkeley.  Samples will be fabricated at Crystallume in which cubic             boron nitride powder is incorporated in a CVD diamond matrix for                enhancing toughness.  Mechanical testing will be performed at the               Materials Science and Mineral Engineering Department, University of             California, Berkeley, to examine fatigue and fracture properties.               The results of this study will provide the basis for optimizing                 diamond composite microstructures in Phase II for wear and cutting              applications.  This new material can be processed in useful shapes              and will exhibit superior hardness, exceptional toughness, and high             thermal conductivity.                                                                                                                                           A high toughness diamond composite will be of considerable interest             in abrasive wear and cutting tool applications.  The proposed work              will provide a new material which can be produced in useful shapes              and will not require a wear-resistant coating.  Products may                    include tool inserts, bearing elements, and structural components.",
