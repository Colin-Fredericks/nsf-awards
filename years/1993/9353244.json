 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9353244  Rensselaer Polytech Inst.  Troy, NY  Smith, Mark    Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute proposes to design and implement  a five-week residential Summer Science Enrichment Program for fifty  entering 7th, 8th and 9th grade minority students per year, July 1,   1993 - June 30, 1996.  The principal objective is to design the  summer experience to use Cognitive Apprenticeship and project team  approaches to facilitate learning and problem solving skills.  The  summer program will model science and engineering processes using  a project-oriented, problem solving instructional format.   Participants will be selected from target schools in Albany,  Schenectady and Troy City School Districts, New york State.   Participants will form ten 5-member teams, each team working on a  project to be completed at the conclusion of the summer.   Coursework will consist of a technology lab, chemistry lab and  research shills.  Supplemental activities will consist of career  exploration in the sciences, engineering and health professions,  field trips to local industry and science museums, recreational  activities, team competitions, and a mentoring component using  Rensselaer faculty and professional scientists and engineers.   Instructional staff will be selected from local schools and  residential teaching assistants will be selected from Rensselaer  undergraduate/graduate students.  Participants will enroll in  Rensselaer's academic year precollege programs to continue the  efforts begun during the summer.  The planned outcome from  participation in the Summer Science Enrichment Program is to  prepare participants to pursue high school coursework that will  equip them with the kinds of skills and knowledge leading to  postsecondary education and careers in the sciences, engineering  and health professions.",
