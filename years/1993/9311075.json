 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311075  Orme       The award is for a high-speed x-y positioning system that will  be incorporated in an existing facility which is used in ongoing  work supported by NSF to demonstrate the ability to enhance the  microstructure of net-formed materials by using the new materials  synthesis technique.  The technique involves the generation of  streams of molten metal droplets that are directed onto a  temperature controlled substrate where they undergo rapid  solidification.  Control of the solidification phenomena leads to  control and manipulation of the materials's microstructure.  With  the incorporation of the proposed high speed positioning system  the microstructure can be refined to exhibit grain sizes on a  nanoscale (with grains < 100nm in at least one dimension).       Significant scientific interest is recently directed towards  nanophase materials synthesis.  Properties which are associated  with nanophase materials such as increased thermal expansion,  reduced density, increased strength and specific heat as well as  a supermodulus effect, have given these materials numerous new  engineering applications.  The proposed high-speed positioning  system will allow the demonstration of the fabrication of nanophase  materials with the new materials synthesis technique.",
