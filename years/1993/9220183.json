 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tropomyosin is a protein which plays a critical role in regulating              muscle contraction.  Like all proteins, tropomyosin is composed of              a linear sequence of amino acid sub-units.  Although we know that               the function of a protein depends on the chemical properties of its             amino acids, very little is known about how the specific amino                  acids in tropomyosin help to regulate muscle contraction.  The                  long-term goal of this research program is a more detailed                      understanding of the relationship between the amino acid                        composition of tropomyosin and the role of the protein in muscle                cells.                                                                                                                                                          Animals have several kinds of muscle, with unique properties.  What             imparts this uniqueness?  The intriguing observation has been made              that different muscles contain different versions of the                        contractile proteins, where each version, known as an isoform, has              a unique amino acid sequence.  Tropomyosin is one of the                        contractile proteins with a muscle-specific distribution of                     isoforms.  The short-term objective of this project is to determine             whether different tropomyosin isoforms endow muscles with                       distinctive contractile properties.                                                                                                                             We are focusing on an isoform of tropomyosin found in the indirect              flight muscle of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  Indirect              flight muscle has special properties that allow it to move the                  wings rapidly during flight.  The project will employ a mutant                  strain of Drosophila that is unable to fly because it does not                  produce enough of the flight muscle tropomyosin isoform.  To                    determine whether the flight muscle isoform is essential for flight             muscle function, flight muscle of the mutant strain will be                     supplemented with two non-flight muscle tropomyosins.  Muscle                   structure and function will be analyzed.  If tropomyosin isoforms               are functionally interchangeable, the mutants will regain the                   ability to fly; if the flight muscle isoforms provides unique and               essential contractile properties, the flies will remain flightless.             Should we obtain the latter results, those segments of the flight               muscle protein critical for flight muscle function will be                      identified.                                                                                                                                                     Before we can understand completely how the muscle cell works at                the molecular level, the part played by each of the component                   proteins must be elucidated in as much detail as possible.  The                 present study will expand our knowledge of tropomyosin's role.",
