 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xu  9302721       This project concerns applications of the theory of special  functions to problems of quadrature.  Quadrature is a term given  to methods of integration, especially numerical.  It has been  highly developed in one dimension with tools such as the Gaussian  quadrature formula.  The present work seeks to carry out  numerical integration through methods of cubature in several  dimensions.  The generalization is far from straightforward.  The  quadratures and cubatures require knowledge of orthogonal  polynomials, particularly with common roots.  In  the multidimensional case, orthogonal polynomials with common  roots were thought to be rare.  However recent work now  establishes that there are many Gaussian cubatures.  The purpose  of this work is to use the newly developed tools to investigate  this topic further.  Several goals are established.  First, to  obtain applicable characterization of Gaussian cubatures, then  to construct new efficient numerical integration formulae.   Work will also be done applying the cubature formulae to the  theory of interpolation in several variables.       The use of orthogonal polynomials in numerical  integration provides formulas which are optimal in the sense of  being exact for polynomials of the highest possible degree.  As  such they provide good approximations to integrals of smooth  functions.  The recent breakthroughs in carrying these ideas over  to several variables holds out the possibility of a robust  multivariate cubature and approximation theory in several  variables, a subject still in its infancy.   ***",
