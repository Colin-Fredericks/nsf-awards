Specifically,                    the requested equipment, consisting of a high speed centrifuge                  and rotors, thermocycler, electroporator, nucleotide sequencing                 and agarose gel electrophoresis equipment and related                           accessories, will support a new research-intensive advanced                     investigative molecular biology course in which students will                   characterize algal mitochondrial and chloroplast genome                         architecture and gene structure. The proposed equipment will be                 used to increase the sophistication of strategies used for                      nucleic acid analysis including the isolation of purified                       organellar DNA, DNA library construction, genome mapping, and                   nucleotide sequence analysis of selected genes. Fundamental                     principles of DNA structure and function and basic techniques                   are presented in existing intorductory courses. Investigative                   Molecular Biology will offer opportunities that (1) provide for                 advanced study of DNA organization and function; (2) serve as                   an avenue for student participation in investigative research;                  and (3) for biology majors, function to train and focus those                   students who anticipate entering into molecular biology related                 honors research projects.",
