 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308566  Frisch    One goal of research in decision making is to evaluate the quality  of people's decisions.  Decision quality is typically evaluated by  comparing people's choices to a normative model such as utility  theory.  However, it is not clear that conformity to a normative  model is associated with favorable outcomes in the real world.  The  purpose of the proposed research is to empirically derive a  standard of good decision making.  In particular, by comparing  decisions with positive and negative outcomes, expect to identify  those aspects of the decision making process that are most  important in achieving positive outcomes.    We have found that positive outcomes are associated with more  rational deliberation than negative outcomes, and that that the  amount of deliberation was related to two aspects of the decisions.   First, people report engaging in more deliberation for professional  decisions than for personal ones.  Second, more deliberation is  reported for decisions that were framed as choices (e.g., should I  buy a product or should I save my money) than those that were  framed as opportunities (e.g., should I buy the product or not).   The basic goal of this research is to examine these effects in more  detail.  The proposal includes several retrospective self-report  studies in which people describe either positive or negative  outcomes that occurred in their lives and the thought processes  that led to them.  Included is a prospective study of a decision in  progress.  Finally, the proposal includes a controlled experiment  examining the effect of decision context or framing on  deliberation.    The ultimate goal of the research is to discover the aspects of the  decision-making process that distinguish positive and negative  outcomes.  This research has theoretical implications for how  researchers should conceptualize a good decision-making process.   It also has the potential to lead to practical advice about how to  improve the quality of real-life decision maki ng.  ***",
