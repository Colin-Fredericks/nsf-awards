 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314197  Sozen  Research is proposed to develop an alternative earthquake-hazard  evaluation technology for regions with infrequent earthquake  occurrence.  The proposed work includes (a) development of  procedures specifically designed to identify buildings that will  threaten life, (b) calibration of the new as well as current  state-of-the-art procedures with data from buildings subjected to  a strong earthquake and (c) analysis of the strengths and  weaknesses of current and proposed technologies in formulation of  risk-reduction strategies for regions of low to moderate  seismicity.    The research is designed to focus on field experience.  The  information from 31 partially damaged buildings, with lateral-  force resisting systems ranging from effectively none to barely  acceptable, will be used.  The important attributes of the  buildings for the project are that they all survived a strong  ground motion (Amax = 0.5G) without leading to life-threatening  damage and they all would have been evaluated to be hazardous by  state-of-the art evaluation procedures.    The project will include six tasks: Task !-Selection and  determination of parameters to be used to define the structures  and the ground motion.  These will include standard quantitative  and qualitative indices such as framing descriptors, calculated  translation periods, and base shear strength coefficients as well  as those reflecting the combined effect of structural and  nonstructural elements.  Task II-Studies to select a set of five  to nine structures for analysis.  The selection will be made so  that the set includes examples covering suitable ranges of the  parameters established in phase I.  Task III-Detailed studies of  the selected set of structures.  Each selected structure will be  evaluated in each direction using standard analysis and  evaluation methods use in Turkiye, the U.S. and Japan.  Analyses  will range from two-dimensional linear to three-dimensional  nonlinear, depending on the quality of the information , type of  framing and perception of return.  Task IV-Identification of  incompatibilities between evaluation results and observations.  In this critical phase, incompatibilities between results of  evaluation and observation will be studied to identify which  differences can be reconciled by credible modifications of the  input or modeling and which cannot be so reconciled.  Task V-  Synthesis.  This phase will involve work either to modify the  standard techniques to suite (by far the preferable option) or to  develop totally new approaches.  Task VI-Recalibration.  The  sanctioned procedures will be calibrated using (a) the entire set  of 31 buildings, (b) the six buildings in Erzincan that collapsed  in the March 1992 event, and (c) typical nonmetallic buildings in  central and eastern U.S.    Two reports will be prepared for dissemination.  The first will  document tasks 1 to IV.  The second will present results of tasks  V and VI.  ***",
