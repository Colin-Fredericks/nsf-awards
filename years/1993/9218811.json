 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important events that have impact on plant growth,              development, and productivity is the distribution of photosynthetic             products, usually sugar molecules, throughout the organs of the                 plant.  The distribution depends on regulating sugar transport                  across the plasma membrane of plant cells.  It has been speculated              that this process involves carrier molecules, however, very little              is known about the carrier molecules themselves.  Recently, Drs.                Grimes and Hitz and their collaborators have identified and cloned              a plasma membrane protein that appears to possess all the right                 characteristics to be a sucrose transporter.  In this project, Drs.             Grimes and Hitz will further characterize the nature and role of                this protein, called 62 SBP, using various approaches including                 membrane physiology, protein analysis, genetic engineering and                  immunology.  They will also collaborate with a group in Germany who             has identified another membrane protein that appears to play a role             in sucrose transport.  It is generally believed that sucrose                    transport system is complex, consisting of several components.                  Therefore, this collaboration is likely to enhance the opportunity              to advance our understanding of  the sucrose transport process in               higher plants.  The primary experimental system for this project is             soybean cotyledon as virtually all of the cells in the soybean                  cotyledon are actively transporting sucrose.                                                                                                                    Successful completion of this project will provide a tool to                    further studies of the mechanisms by which plants distribute their              photosynthetic products,  which will ultimately contribute to our               understanding of the mechanisms of growth and development in                    plants.",
