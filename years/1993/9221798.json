 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymers undergo a                       self-assembly process in aqueous solutions whereby the                          hydrophobic side chains cluster together into micelle-like                      aggregates, or microdomains, of characteristic size and                         hydrophobicity.  The resulting network, which are called two-                   phase hydrogels, have physical properties which are completely                                                                                                  different from those of  the initial solution and which may be                                                                                                  exploited to good effect in numerous applications.  In this                     AMPP investigation, two-phase hydrogels from alkyl-substituted                                                                                                  polyacrylamides are synthesized and the relationships between                   polymer structure and hydrogel properties are explored.  The                    focus is on three structural properties of the polymer,                         namely, the total hydrophobe content, the backbone                              conformation, and the length of the hydrophobic side chains.                    The effects of these properties on the structure and                            composition of the microdomains and on the rheological                          properties of the bulk material are investigated.                                                                                                               One of the most interesting features of these unique materials                                                                                                  is the demonstrated ability of the dispersed hydrophobic phase                                                                                                  to absorb and retain organic solutes within an aqueous gel,                     and to release the solutes to the surroundings at a constant                    rate (so-called \"zero-order release\").  This type of release                    profile is much sought after in controlled drug delivery, an                    emerging technology of great interest in the pharmaceutical                     field.  A controlled release dosage form is one which delivers                                                                                                  therapeutic levels of a drug at a steady rate over long times,                                                                                                  eliminating the need for repeated doses of a medication and                     avoiding the associated problems of oscillating blood levels                    of the drug.  The basic investigations on these novel                           materials will be used as the design basis for two-phase                        hydrogels for use in controlled drug release.                                                                                                                   This work will be conducted in collaboration with colleagues                    at Exxon Research and Engineering Company, who will also                        furnish the polymers to be used in the study.",
