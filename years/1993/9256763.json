This need is created by the increasing                difficulty of analyzing, processing, and modeling biological data               that are accumulating exponentially and by the difficulty of                    modeling increasingly complex, biological systems.  This need is                manifested by the extreme difficulty of hiring faculty with the                 requisite hybrid training.  Fortunately, this need can be met                   because appropriate mathematical and engineering techniques have                been and are being developed to cope with both the increasing                   data and the increasingly complex, biological systems.  For                     thirty years, Johns Hopkins has provided in-depth, hybrid                       training in biology and engineering/mathematics in its Biomedical               Engineering Doctoral Program.  Three new Program initiatives, in                Molecular and Cellular Systems Physiology, Systems                              Neurophysiology and Biological Imaging continue, and expand this                tradition.  All three of these initiatives create a fusion                      between the methods of modern biology and the methods of modern                 engineering and mathematics.  Equally important (and, perhaps,                  unusual), each of these programs has a strongly integrative                     quality because each examines biological processes at multiple                  levels of organization.  We request support for a total of seven                additional students in these three areas.",
