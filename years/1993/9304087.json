 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Anatol M. Zhabotinsky is supported by a grant from                    the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to study                    spatial pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion                        systems (RDS).  A major goal of this research is to study new                   types of chemical wave patterns and ultimately to compile a                     comprehensive set of experimental examples of the basic types                   of wave patterns in chemical RDS which are supported by a                       kinetic analysis of the corresponding reaction mechanisms.  The                 research has two immediate objectives: 1) a search for wave                     patterns emerging in uniform stable RDS via the wave                            (Turing-type 2) bifurcation; and 2) a study of chemical wave                    propagation and interaction resulting in new types of pattern                   formation in chemical RDS with parametric gradients or                          anisotropy.  The latter line of work originates from new wave                   patterns discovered by the Principal Investigator and                           collaborators in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky RDS with an oxygen                    concentration gradient.                                                         %%%                                                                             Spatial pattern formation in chemical reaction-diffusion                        systems (RDS) is an important problem in modern macroscopic                     chemical kinetics.  Chemical reaction-diffusion patterns                        constitute the most convenient analog models for pattern                        formation in neurobiology, morphogenesis, chemotaxis, and                       ecology.  A number of oscillating chemical reactions are                        important in the functioning of living organisms, and pattern                   formation is essential to such fundamental biological functions                 as cardiac stimulation.  Zhabotinsky's research in this area                    will provide many important mechanistic insights into these                     processes.",
