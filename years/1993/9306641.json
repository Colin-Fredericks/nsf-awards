 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306641  Wolff    Results from a 13-year study conducted at the Mountain Lake  Biological Station in the southern Appalachian Mountains suggests  a dynamic interaction between mast production and primary and  secondary consumers.  Episodic mast production has resulted in  population fluctuations of mice, chipmunks, and other mast  consumers.  Carnivores, primarily barred owls, exhibit a numerical  response to rodent densities.  Seed survival and germination  occurs only during peak mast production years and seedling  mortality is associated with deer browsing activity.  Chipmunks  appear to be the major predators on ground nesting birds, and  their densities are inversely correlated with junco fledgling  success.  This project will continue the monitoring of the major  players in these trophic levels for two years to determine the  direct and indirect effects of episodic mast production on  selected primary and secondary consumers, seed survival and forest  regeneration, and community stability in a southern Appalachian  deciduous forest community.  Specifically the project will (1)  determine the role of mast production in regulating population  densities of three seed-eating rodent species, white-footed mice,  deer mice, and chipmunks, (2) determine if and how fluctuating  rodent densities affect seed survival and germination rates, and  fledgling success of ground nesting birds, primarily juncos, (3)  test the predator-satiation hypothesis for seed masting in  deciduous oaks, (4) determine the role of deer browsing on  survival and growth of understory vegetation, and (5) provide  baseline data on these aspects of the community structure and  dynamics prior to the anticipated invasion of gypsy moths.  %%%  Research projects of this type are especially important to the  understanding of the complex interactions of populations comprised  by the forest ecosystem.  Results from the work should yield  fundamental insights on species interactions as well s provided  information applicable to the be tter management of forest  resources.  ***",
