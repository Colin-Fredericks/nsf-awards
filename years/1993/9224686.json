Pyridazine based bridging ligands  offer the opportunity to complex two metals such that substrate  molecules in the coordination sphere of the metal can interact  with one another and provide structural access to the  photoredox catalyzed generation of oxygen from water. Simple  and very accessible host molecules, which have been shown to be  excellent urea binders, will be used to immobilize carbonic and  carbamic acids to render them useful as synthetic  intermediates. Carefully tailored hosts will be prepared as a  urease mimic to catalyze the hydrolysis of urea and for the  formation of ureaphanes. Finally, the ferrocene nucleus will be  employed as a \"variable hinge\" in which the relative  orientation of substituents on the two cyclopentadienyl rings  can be controlled.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research of Dr. Randolph P. Thummel of the Department of  Chemistry at the University of Houston. Professor Thummel will  focus his work on demonstrating that carefully designed  receptor systems can be employed to accomplish useful  chemistry. Azabiaryl ligands and their transition metal  complexes will be used to catalyze the photoredox generation of  oxygen from water, to immobilize carbonic and carbamic acids to  render them useful as synthetic intermediates, and to be a  urease mimic to hydrolyze urea.  ***",
