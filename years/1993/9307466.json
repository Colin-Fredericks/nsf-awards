While considerable research on this topic has been accomplished on African-American and white women little has been done on Chicana women.  The researchers predict that such women find themselves required, but unable, to fill multiple role expectations as students, workers, family women, and community women.  It is further hypothesized that they attempt to reconcile those contradictions by reconfiguring their ideal priorities for Chicana women and their views of the roles of Chicana women should play.  The researchers will compare Chicanas with radically different lifestyles and their experiences with constructing, interpreting, and reconstituting womanhood.  This project will illustrate the behavioral and conceptual processes by which Chicana confront the often conflicting demands of the dominant society and the Chicano family, and the cultural alternatives they develop in response.  This research will take place in Denver, Colorado in working class, Chicano barrios of North Denver, Auraria, and the West Side: neighborhoods of steadfast Chicano families who now face unprecedented economic change.  ***     s( t(  ext. 357 7564  U$U U U U U U U U U UCV WT        _W`i` `5a a a b b\"b b b b b b bRc c{c c c;d d dte e e e e engtg~gihyh~h h h h h hEj jXm mvn n p q3rUr~r r r r s sGsVsasts s s s s\u0131s s s t tMttt t$uKuRuWu u vWx=z {          # 6 F         U \\ o     Z 8 i    !!\"x\" #1%X)37 7 7 7)8 8 8?9P9 : @ @ A F K K KoL2M M M>N O O PKP\"Q{Q Q Q Q  QcS S S S T TzUsW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           f     ?
