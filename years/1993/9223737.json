 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project pursues research on several distinct questions in                  public economics.  The first part considers the impact of fiscal                institutions on the dynamics of state tax and expenditure policy.               This research uses states as \"laboratories of democracy\" to shed                light on how different institutional arrangements affect the way                governments respond to fiscal shocks.  It focuses on the                        experience of the 1980s, and explores how balanced budget rules                 and anti-deficit laws affected the way states respond to                        unexpected budget deficits.  The second is a more traditional                   study on the incentive effects of tax policy.  It focuses on the                effects of 401(k) tax-deferred saving plans on household saving                 decisions.  These plans were the fastest growing tax-favored                    saving vehicle in the 1980s, yet there is little evidence on how                the availability of these plans and the federal and program-                    specific limits on individual contributions, affect saving                      behavior.  This project helps fill this gap.  The third part is                 also concerned with tax policy, but focuses on the increasingly                 important question of how tax incentives affect the demand for                  health insurance.  The research develops new estimates of the                   elasticity of demand for both coverage and the amount of                        coverage.                                                                                                                                                       The first part of this project addresses one of the central                     issues in political economy - the effect of fiscal institutions,                such as balanced-budget amendments or supermajority requirements                for tax increases, on tax and expenditure policies.  Because                    federal budgetary institutions exhibit relatively little                        variation, empirical research on budgetary institutions has                     focused on interstate or international comparisons.  The                        difficulty with past studies is that they do not take into                      account the possibility that states with anti-spending voters are               more likely to adopt certain fiscal institutions.  For example,                 the apparent effectiveness of state constitutional balanced                     budget requirements in restraining government expenditures could                simply reflect the preferences of the voters in states with these               requirements.  This project takes a novel and ingenious approach                to this problem.  It explores how different fiscal institutions                 affect the dynamics of state taxes and spending following an                    unexpected shock to the state deficit.  The last half-decade,                   when many states have experienced substantial fiscal stress,                    provides a natural opportunity for exploring this link between                  fiscal institutions and fiscal outcomes.  A systematic study of                 recent state experience with unexpected deficits is also a timely               important topic by itself.",
