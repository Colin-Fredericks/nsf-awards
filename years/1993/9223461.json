 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do self-interested traders with private information arrive at               equilibrium prices for market exchange?  This question of price                 formation has always been central to economic theory.  The                      question is also crucial in practical applications because many                 policy interventions (ranging from job retraining programs to SEC               reporting requirements in securities markets) are intended to                   influence the adjustment to equilibrium and therefore their                     effectiveness depends entirely on the price formation process.                  Unfortunately, the underlying price formation process is still                  not well understood, despite centuries of theoretical debate and                crucial practical implications.  This project conducts four sets                of laboratory experiments designed to shed new light on the price               formation process.  One set employs the Continuous Double Auction               (CDA) market institution, which is known to promote exceptionally               rapid and reliable price formation in the laboratory.  A second                 set of experiments employs the Single Call Market (SCM), less                   commonly seen in the field and less efficient in the laboratory                 but better understood theoretically than the CDA.  The other sets               of experiments examine intermediate trading institutions called                 the Multiple Call Market (MCM) and the Uniform Price Double                     Auction (UPDA).                                                                                                                                                 This project provides new empirical evidence on price formation                 process by addressing two major shortcomings in existing                        laboratory data.  First, almost all market experiments are                      repetitively stationary (or use fixed additive shifts), so                      equilibrium price remains constant (or shifts in lockstep) across               trading periods.  Such an experiment provides only a single                     observation of price formation, spread across several trading                   periods.  The proposed experiments incorporates random values -                 private cost and value parameters drawn independently each period               from announced uniform distributions.  Second, although it is                   clear that the price formation process depends crucially on the                 market institutions, the institutional variations in most                       experiments are insufficient to identify why and how market                     institutions matter.  The proposed experiments incorporate wide                 institutional variations.  Data analysis will be used to test the               three promising theoretical approaches found in recent literature               to understanding price formation.",
