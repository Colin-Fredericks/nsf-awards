 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will explore the applicability of genetic                    algorithms and classifier systems to the analysis of social                     interaction, seeking to provide a formally-based understanding.                 The forms of stable interaction range from highly-scripted,                     instrumentalized social action to informal group processes                      sustained by the rationality of individual participants.  The                   techniques will be applied to three domains: social exchange,                   collective action, and action organization.  A key advantage of                 this research is the power of the computer techniques to represent              all forms of interaction in terms of an evolving population of                  genotypical action plans and thus to provide the basis for an                   integrated theory of social interaction systems that covers the                 full range of commonly recognized system types.                                                                                                                      Sociology has been slow to make use of several new approaches              in computer technology, and this research will be the first                     substantial sociological application of the related techniques of               genetic algorithms and classifier systems.  Genetic algorithms are              a way of arriving at a solution to a problem through successive                 approximation, with the great advantage that it develops many                   potential solutions simultaneously, successively combining features             of different solutions and selecting the best solutions for further             development.  In the context of this research, classifer systems                read computerized strings of symbols, such as the units produced by             genetic algorithms, and interpret them as rules for human action                under specified circumstances.",
