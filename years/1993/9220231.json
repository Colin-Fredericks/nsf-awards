 "awd_abstract_narration": "For highly charged nucleic acid polymers, the extent and                        distribution of associated counterions can have a profound                      influence on the conformation of the macromolecule, and can play a              principal role in directing the binding of proteins and small                   ligands.  However, except for linear nucleic acids, very little is              known regarding the nature of counterion accumulation.  In order to             address this issue, the current proposal outlines a combined                    computational/experimental approach to determine the extent of                  counterion association in the vicinity of various nucleic acid                  structures, including branched DNA and RNA helices.  The                        computational approach (aim 1) will utilize a grand canonical                   ensemble Monte Carlo approach for the determination of ion                      accumulation.  The principal experimental approach (aim 2),                     equilibrium dialysis, will measure the same quality.  Finally, the              technique of steady-state electrophoresis (SSE) will be employed                (aim 3) to examine the relationship between thermodynamic ion                   binding and the effective charge of a nucleic acid undergoing                   electrophoresis.                                                                %%%                                                                             Small ions in the vicinity of DNA or RNA molecules have a profound              influence on the structures of those highly-charged macromolecules.             Moreover, it is clear that such ions can participate in directing               the binding of a wide variety of gene regulatory proteins to both               DNA and RNA.  Thus, the characterization of the interactions of                 small ions with higher-order nucleic acid structures is of great                importance in understanding the broader issue of the regulation of              gene expression.  To this end, the goal of the proposed research is             to characterize the net accumulation of small ions in the vicinity              of simple branched nucleic acid structures, the latter being used               as a paradigm for higher-order nucleic acid structure.  The                     proposed work couples a theoretical analysis of small ion-                      macromolecule interactions with an experimental determination of                the net accumulation of the small ions around the branch.  The                  experimental work will employ a combination of dialysis and                     electrophoretic methods, which, when combined with the                          computational work, should provide the first quantitative view of               the association of small ions around a higher-order nucleic acid                structure -- a necessary antecedent for detailed studies of the                 salt-dependence of protein-nucleic acid interaction.",
