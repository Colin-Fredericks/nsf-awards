 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues investigations into the                        connections between circle packing and the theory of analytic                   functions of a complex variable.  Circle packings have long been                an intriguing concept in mathematical research.  In 1985 William                Thurston proposed that circle packings - packings of plane                      domains by circles of various sizes - could lead to a completely                new point of view in conformal mapping.  This turned out to be                  the case and this project is one of several by-products of that                 now famous lecture.  The idea has grown and prospered.  Circle                  packings are exhibiting faithful discrete analogues to the                      classical results of geometric function theory such as the                      Schwarz-Pick lemma, Dirichlet problem, uniformization theorem,                  Brownian motion, etc.  The current project concentrates on the                  discrete version of the length-area method, a powerful, but                     unwieldy method exercised by a few experts and not easily                       understood by consumers of function theory.  The second part                    concerns infinite packings, possibly the most speculative part of               the project.  Most research to date considers only finite                       packings.  The final component of the research involves packings                using circle with overlap.  There are fundamental results which                 allow for overlap, but little work has been done on this                        generalization.  Past research led to the development of software               for manipulating, displaying and animating circle packings.  This               is both a research tool for performing experiments and a                        practical method for creating the pictures needed for                           presentation.  The software is freely available.                                     Complex function theory is the mathematical basis for                      computing with and visualizing the behavior of complex functions                of a complex variable.  The subject has an extensive history                    and is normally studied concurrently as analysis and geometry.                  This project adds a new dimension: computation.  Circle packing                 leads naturally to computer simulation.  This in turn has led to                new insights and proofs in the classical theory. To prove its                   worth, the new point of view will have to lead to new ,                         unexpected discoveries.",
