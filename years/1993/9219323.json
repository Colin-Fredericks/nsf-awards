 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthesis and degradation of triacylglycerols (TAG) in seeds during             maturation and germination involve active metabolic pathways.                   Understanding the detailed mechanism of TAG metabolism will enable              the control of food reserve deposition and utilization during                   active stages of the plant life cycle.  It will also provide an                 indispensable information of how to breed or genetically engineer               better seed oils for human utilization.  The long  term                         objective of the laboratory is to elucidate the mechanism of TAG                metabolism in seeds.  The focus is on a crucial TAG synthesizing                enzyme, lysophosphatidate (LPA) acyltransferase, in maturing seed.              This enzyme catalyzes the incorporation of acyl moiety from acyl                CoA to the sn-2 position of 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate, and the                product phosphatidate will be further metabolized to either TAG or              phospholipids.  The enzyme has a very stringent acyl preference on              both substrates, and thus controls the incorporation of preferred               fatty acids into the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of TAG.  The fatty                 acid composition, and thus the properties of seed TAG, rely heavily             on the acyl preference of LPA acyltransferase.  In this research                proposal, the following two objectives will be pursued.  The first              objective is to examine whether seed LPA acyltransferase of a                   special acyl preference from one plant species will be active in                another plant species after genetic transformation.  Experiments                will be performed to characterized seed LPA acyltransferases from               palm, Brassica, and meadowfoam, to obtain their genes for                       transformation of appropriate plants, and to detect activities of               the foreign enzymes in the transformed plants.  Several different               approaches will be used to obtain the gene; these approaches                    include: screening cDNA libraries for the genes by oligonucleotides             deduced from the purified enzyme and by a bacterial gene, and                   functional complementation with a bacterial mutant.  Putative E.                coli mutant lines functionally complemented with plant cDNA                     encoding the enzyme have been obtained; these lines will be studied             most intensively.  If time permits, we will use the palm and                    meadowfoam LPA acyltransferase genes to transform Brassica, and                 analyze the transformed plants for activities of the foreign                    enzyme.  The information will be crucial to our understanding of                the control mechanism of fatty acid assembly into TAG in seeds as               well as glycerolipids in non seed organs. The second objective is               to test if a membrane-associated, lipid-metabolizing enzyme of                  bacterial origin can be active, in higher plants.  by transforming              Brassica with an E. coli gene encoding LPA acyltransferase and                  studying the expression of the bacterial gene in the transformed                Brassica.                                                                       %%%                                                                             This project aims to take a gene which makes an enzyme that                     Produces a certain plant oil found in palms, and introduce the gene             into other plants to see if they also would produce the palm oil.               If this is successful the investigators have found a way for oil                produced in plants not common to the US to be available in other                species of plants common in this country.  Furthermore, these                   enzymes could be used to make novel lipid biomaterials.",
