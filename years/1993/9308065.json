An archipelago of patches, representing different levels of fragmentation, was arrayed within a period 6 years. During the first six years of the study, fragmentation influenced consumer population dynamics, and the local persistence of herbaceous plant species with clonal life cycles, but did not affect measures of local species richness or the overall rates of succession.  It is expected that during the next five, substantial effects of fragmentation upon successional dynamics should begin to appear, because:  1) there is a transition underway from species present in the original seed pool to species colonizing form external source pools, particularly trees and shrubs, and 2) the stature of the dominant plants is increasing, thereby enhancing microenvironmental differences between patch interiors and the surrounding interstitial habitats and hence edge effects.  It is also expected that small mammal may be dominant driving factors in woody species establishment, and so fragmentation effects observed in plant succession may be indirect manifestations of fragmentation effects on the small mammal community.  This project will document dynamics in plant community composition, local persistence, and plant architecture as a function of the degree of fragmentation, using both ground surveys, canopy analysis technology, aerial photography, and remote sensing.  It will also monitor the spatial distributions of small mammals that are potentially important in slowing the invasion of woody species, and to use exclosures to directly measure effects on seedling survivorship.  This study is one of the very few experimental studies of habitat fragmentation, and provides a system for exploring more general issue of scale in ecological dynamics.\r\n\r\nResearch projects such as this are fundamental to the better understanding of the associative processes that occur within communities.  This understanding will provide a knowledge base on what to expect as landscapes are more finely fragmented.  It may also suggest ameliorative measures for maintaining system integrity.\r\n",
