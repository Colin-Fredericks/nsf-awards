The aim of the plan is to empower any capable and  willing undergraduate student to succeed in calculus and  differential equations, and to encourage advanced study in applied  mathematics. A team-based approach to curriculum and assessment  development, involving faculty from client disciplines, is focusing  on applications of mathematics and the use of technology to  illustrate the central importance of calculus in engineering and  science. The project demonstrates innovative adaptations of small-  scale models previously developed by others, in addition to a new  set of curriculum enhancements emphasizing applications in other  disciplines, which may be adopted or further adapted at  institutions of any size.",
