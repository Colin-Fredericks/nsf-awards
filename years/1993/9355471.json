Both  investigators will benefit from the exchange which will increase  the scientific infrastructure through expertise developed during  the two week visits.  Dr. Kaleta's visit will be timed to coincide  with the course taught on Air Quality Management.  He will be  providing several guest lectures on air quality in Poland.  This  interaction with students will provide an international theme to an  important topic in the U.S. and the world.  Dr. Kaleta will  participate in research activities in the Environmental Modeling  and GIS Laboratory which is under the PI's supervision.  These  activities will include air quality modeling and Geographic  Information System analyses.  The two week visit to Poland by Dr.  Vieux will foster collaboration with Polish colleagues at the  Institute of Environmental Engineering.  During this period Dr.  Vieux will help install air quality models and a Geographic  Information System on existing workstations at the Institute.  ***",
