 "awd_abstract_narration": "9221210  Swanson    Fundamental aspects of point defects and self-compensation  phenomena in II-VI semiconductors will be studied using  perturbed angular correlation(PAC) measurements, and  relating the data to optical, electrical and magnetic  properties.  The atomic configurations, stabilities, defect  mobilities and ionization energies of various charge-  compensated donor-defect complexes will be determined.  By  studying these defects as a function of temperature and  annealing treatments it is sought 1)to understand in detail  their structure and behavior, 2)to determine the influence  of such complexes on bulk properties, and 3)to determine the  optimum conditions for minimizing the formation of  undesirable charge-compensated defects, and maximizing the  activation of donor impurities.  Both bulk and thin film  materials will be studied.  %%%  By correlating microscopic PAC observations with bulk  electrical and optical properties, it is anticipated that  the specific information gained on the nature and  significance of defects and defect interactions in wide- and  narrow-gap II-VI semiconductors will provide broad insight  into the behavior of defects systems in general.  This  deeper understanding will enable scientists and  technologists greater facility in the design and synthesis  of devices using these materials, such as infrared sensors,  lightemitting diodes, and semiconductor lasers, which, in  turn, may yield improvements in integrated circuits used in  computing, information processing, and telecommunications.  ***",
