The goal of the project is to characterize the changing demands on academic engineering research (changes coming both from outside academia and from within) and to identify potentially effective responses to such changes on policymakers.  The symposim and workshop will be held in conjunction with the National Meeting of the National Academy of Engineering at the Academies' Beckman Center in Irvine, California in February 1994.  The symposium will be designed to allow the various involved parties to put forth their views.  The papers presented at the symposium and discussions a the workshop and the smaller, follow on workshop will be the primary basis for an assessmsnt by a committee of NAE members of the changing demands and possible responses.",
