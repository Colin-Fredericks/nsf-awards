 "awd_abstract_narration": "9215993  King    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Lucy Siu-Bik King,  Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering,  GMI Engineering and Management Institute, and Dr. Kingman E. Yee,  Department of Mechanical Engineering, Lawrence Technological  University, to pursue with Dr. Beng Siong Lim, GINTIC Institute  of Computer Integrated Manufacturing, Nanyang Technological  Institute, Singapore, for a period of 24 months, a program of  research on automatic fixturing.  Their research will be directed  toward two major goals, namely, (1) the theoretical formulation  of an optimization model for finding the positions of fixturing  elements for a given workpart geometry and (2) comparing the  fixturing element with fixture components using the MOFDEX expert  support system, the Block Jig System, and Modular Fixturing  System.  In the PI's previous research, an optimization model has  been developed to generate a fixturing configuration design for  prismatic objects.  This research will be extended to non-  prismatic workparts such as the sphere, cylinder, tetrahedron and  parallelpiped taking into account assembly operations and  fixturing element types.  Dr. Lim has developed expert systems  for the practical portion of the second goal.    Manual methods of fixturing, still prevalent in the manufacturing  environment, may result in delays of three to six weeks in an  automotive plant.  Concurrent engineering and flexible  manufacturing requires faster turn around time for fixturing  design.  Automatic fixturing configuration offers a partial  solution to such a demand.  The expert support system generated  from this collaboration will be especially useful for computer-  aided fixturing in industries that use CAD (Computer Assisted  Design) systems.  The collaborators have complementary expertise  which will be mutually beneficial in this research.  This project  is relevant to the objectives of the Division of International  Programs which seeks to increase the level of coopera tion between  U.S. scientists and engineers and their counterparts in  developing countries through the exchange of scientific  information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  This project adds  an international cooperative dimension to the Dr. King's research  under NSF Grants No. DDM-9196231 and DDM-9215362.  ***",
