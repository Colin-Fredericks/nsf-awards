 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program addresses the problem of anomaly detection                and identification in solid mechanics.  There are two objectives in this        proposal.  The first is to develop robust operational procedure for             detecting mechanical anomalies in solids based on a continuous                  monitoring of surface strain measurements.  The second is to                    develop a method of identifying the characteristics of the anomaly              for the special case of a single growing crack or a system of                   microcracks.  These objectives can be achieved by developing and                using a new concept of signatures and testing the procedures using              numerical experiments.  The concept of signatures is related to the             idea of path-independent integrals but are based on a discrete                  number of measurement points and hence are a-priori aimed at                    experimental implementations.  The numerical experiments will use               the Boundary Element Method (BEM).  A technology of                             anomaly detection and identification would have various                         applications.  For example, critical structures approaching their               design service life may adopt this technology in order to have an               early precursor of possible failure.  This technology would also                be an important ingredient in the development of intelligent                    structures where an efficient self-monitoring system is                         valuable.",
