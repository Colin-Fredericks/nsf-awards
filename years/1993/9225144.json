The five days meeting will mark the birth centenary of J.B.S.                   Haldane with the aims of:  reviewing Haldane's contribution to                  the various areas of human population genetics, focusing                        especially on their impacts on current quantitative thinking;                   deliberating on recent advances in quantitative human genetics,                 evolution, population structure and genetic epidemiology;                       presenting applications of recent advances in theoretical aspects               of human genetics; and, deliberating on some current issues                     concerning the interaction of genes and environment with a view                 to delineate some thrust areas that deserve immediate scientific                attention of human geneticists.  The meeting, which will be held                at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Calcutta, is                       expected to be attended by scientists from the U.K., Japan, the                 Netherland, Germany, Australia, Brazil and Canada in addition to                the U.S. and India.                                                                                                                                             Scope:  This activity commemorates Haldane, a pioneer in the                    field of human genetics who established his reputation in                       England, before moving to India in the later part of his life,                  where he continued his work at the ISI in Calcutta.  The ISI is                 considered one of the foremost centers in the world for training                and research in statistics, both theoretical and applied,                       including biostatistics.  The conference will have the effect of                promoting biostatistic research in India especially in devising                 statistical methods for analyzing molecular genetic data on human               populations and families.  It should increase the awarness of the               visiting scientists to the social structure of the endogamous                   populations of India, the environment they live in and the                      resulting spread of genes within the populations.  Initiation of                collaborative research proposals between Indian and scientists                  from outside India, especially in the quantitative aspects of                   human genetics, is likely to result.",
