The amount taken up in many plants is directly proportional to the  amount of calcium in the soil solution.  The water evaporates from  the surfaces of the plant and, over time, large amounts of calcium  can accumulate in various organs, which necessitates high capacity  calcium sequestration systems in the organs of such plants.  It is  hypothesized that calcium oxalate formation has evolved as a  mechanism in plants for removing calcium when it is present at  levels that can no longer be controlled by the lower-capacity  mechanisms common to all cells.  The observations that most plant  families produce calcium oxalate, that this product can account for  up to 85% of the dry weight of some plant species, and that 90% of  the calcium in plants can be in this form, support this hypothesis.   Calcium binding proteins have been identified that are specific to  those cells (crystal idioblasts) that produce calcium oxalate.  One  protein is cytosolic and shows antigenic similarity to animal  calsequestrin.  It is hypothesized that this protein is responsible  for buffering the activity of the large fluxes of calcium which  must be passing through the cytoplasmic compartment during the  rapid process of crystal formation.  Three other proteins have been  found to be associated with the calcium oxalate crystal matrix, and  antibodies have been raised to these proteins.  These matrix  proteins are thought to be responsible for regulating nucleation  and/or growth of the crystals.  The next general goal of this  research is to characterize the structure and function of these  unique proteins to further understand how they function in calcium  regulation in plants.  Specific objectives are to: (1) Characterize  of the molecular properties of the matrix proteins by obtaining and  analyzing cDNAs for these proteins. (2) Determine the chemical  properties of the matrix proteins.  The effects of purified matrix  proteins  on crystal nucleation and growth will be studied in vitro.  (3) Resolve the molecular relationship of matrix proteins and  crystal matrix.  Immunocytochemical techniques will be used to  determine the pattern of protein intercalation in the crystal  matrix. (4) Characterize the calsequestrin-like protein.  Using  antibody and cDNA probes to animal calsequestrin, a cDNA will be  isolated from a library constructed from Pistia stratiotes.  The  cDNA will be sequenced and characterized. (5) Determine the  subcellular location of the calsequestrin-like protein by  immunocytochemistry.  %%%  Calcium is involved in the control of many physiological processes  in plants, but excess calcium can be harmful.  Thus, regulation of  calcium is critical to normal plant growth, development and  productivity.  Previous results from this laboratory suggest that  formation of calcium oxalate crystals is a mechanism used by plants  to sequester excess calcium.  This research will examine the  mechanisms by which plants form calcium oxalate crystals.  The  results will contribute to our understanding of how plants regulate  their internal calcium levels.  ***",
