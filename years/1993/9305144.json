 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Michael Dietler will              conduct chemical analyses on a series of ceramic samples of                     Etruscan amphoras collected from well dated sites in Southern                   France. Using techniques only recently applied to ceramics he will              conduct combined scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electron                microprobe examination. On this basis he will determine the                     chemical composition of the constituent clays and hopefully                     separate the amphorae into distinct groups. He will then compare                these groupings to those derived from stylistic analysis of such                attributes as vessel shape and size. In this first step of a longer             term project Dr. Dietler hopes to either confirm or revise the                  topology developed by archaeologists over many years. In the next               stage he will attempt to use similar chemical analysis to tie these             classes to places of origin in Etruscan Italy. Surprisingly,                    although archaeologists know that these amphorae were made by                   Etruscan peoples in Italy, most recovered examples come either from             shipwrecks or sites in southern France. Very little information is              available from their points of origin. These vessels were used to               carry wine to France and were ultimately discarded there.                                                                                                       The underlying issue which Dr. Dietler wishes to examine concerns               neither wine nor amphorae per se, but rather cultural, political                and economic relations between political entities at different                  stages of development. During Etruscan times, from approximately                the 7th to 3rd millennia BC state level societies developed in                  Italy while in northern and western Europe people still lived at a              less complex tribal stage of organization. Dr. Dieter wants to                  understand the strategies employed by the Etruscans in the                      interactions with their less developed neighbors and how groups in              southern France reacted and underwent partial, selective                        acculturation.                                                                                                                                                  In addition to the knowledge this research will provide about                   European prehistory, it is important because of the methodological              contribution it will make. Although the combined SEM electron                   microprobe technique is currently used in geological studies it has             not been applied in archaeological contexts. If it is successful,               it may greatly simplify ceramic analysts' work. Dr. Dieter's                    research constitutes a first practical test and the methodological              implications are considerable.",
