Such a study is warranted by observations of the                     presence of By in the quiescent as well as the active magnetotail.              Recently, we have shown that in the presence of By, the electron                tearing mode can be destabilized \u0131X. Wang, A. Bhattacharjee and                 A.T.Y. Lui, J. Geophys. Res., 95, 15,047, 1990; attached as                     Appendix.!.  We propose to extend our present work by means of                  analytical theory as well as particle simulation in the three-                  dimensional tail, and compare the predictions of theory with the                AMPTE/CCE database.  The specific tasks proposed are: (i) Unified               analytical theory of electron and ion tearing in the presence of                By, (ii) Particle simulation in a three-dimensional plasma sheet,               (iii) Analytical nonlinear mode-coupling theory and predictions of              particle acceleration, and (iv) comparison of theory with                       observations from AMPTE/CCE.",
