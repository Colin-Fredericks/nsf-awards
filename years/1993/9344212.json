 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will produce a four-dimensional internally consistent                   gridded data set for the global atmosphere for the period May 1982              to November 1983.  They will do so by assembling the most complete              set of atmospheric and oceanic observations made during that period             and by using a state-of-the-art multivariate optimal interpolation              scheme for atmospheric data assimilation.                                            The primary motivation or this work is to demonstrate the                  feasibility of reanalyzing past atmospheric observations using a                state-of-the-art global model and a global data assimilation                    system.  Such a feasibility study is needed before making plans for             reanalysis of long term (> 10 years) historical data sets for                   climate research.                                                                    The data assimilation system to be used will include the COLA              general circulation model, the forecast of which will provide the               first guess, and most accurate optimum interpolation gorithm                    available.  The observational data se will be a combination for                 level II-data archived in real time during the period and delayed               mode data, including the comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set                (COADS), which have been assembled at NCAR.  The critical                       evaluations of the analyses will include general circulation                    statistics; global and local energy spectra; global energetic                   diagnoses including generation and dissipation of energy; a                     detailed examination of the global hydrologic cycle including                   regional budgets for the tropical Pacific, North America, the                   Amazon basin, and sub-Saharan Africa; and computations of surface               wind stress and total heat flux to force a global ocean model.  The             PIs will archive the various measures of analysis error obtained                during the assimilation cycle to study the quality of the analyses              and to provide confidence estimates and error bars.                                  This study will be extremely useful to support the scientific              objectives of national and international research programs such as              the Tropical Oceans Global Atmospheric (TOGA), World Ocean                      Circulation Experiment (WOCE), Global Energy and Water Cycle                    Experiment (GEWEX) and International Geosphere Biosphere Program                (IGBP).  The PIs have chosen the 1982--83 period for this study                 because it witnessed the most outstanding example of ocean-                     atmosphere interactions as manifested by the El  Nino-Southern                  Oscillation phenomenon and its related world-wide effects.",
