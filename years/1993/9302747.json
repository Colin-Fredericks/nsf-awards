 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Joseph B. Lambert at Northwestern                  University, who will study stereoelectronic aspects of reactive                 intermediates. One focal point is to determine how electronic                   effects are propagated through sigma bonds. Targets are to evaluate             the zeta effect of stannylenium ions, the mechanism of the beta-                silicon effect, and a search for the beta-phosphonate effect in                 carbocation formation. The second focal point is to obtain new                  formulations of solvents and anions to produce free silyl, germyl,              and stannyl cations. The third topic concerns conformations of                  flexible molecules in the solid state, which is footed on five-                 membered rings and the use of a cultivated solid state NMR                      spectroscopic technique.                                                        %%%                                                                             The results from Professor Joseph B. Lambert's studies on reactive              intermediates will contribute to our understanding on how                       electronic effects are propagated through bonds. His research is                focussed largely on silyl and stannyl cations. Their isolation is               also sought to verify their existence as intermediates. These                   mechanistic studies have the potential to translate in a broad                  spectrum of synthetic applications. Novel conformational studies on             cyclopentanes will be conducted that will provide information that              is relevant in the area of molecular dynamics.//",
