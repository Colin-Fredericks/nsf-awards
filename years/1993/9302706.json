 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several different frameworks for the mathematical theory of                linear control systems have been developed over the last three                  decades. This project combines two important and well-developed                 approaches: the function-theoretic methodology and the techniques               of commutative algebra and module theory. The specific technical                research issues which will be adressed include the geometric                    study of poles and transmission zeros of singular systems;                      construction and application of a local algebraic version of the                fundamental pole-zero exact sequence of a singular linear system;               characterization and construction of globally minimal generalized               inverses of linear systems; algebraic and analytic studies of                   Wiener-Hopf factorization; studies of singular values and                       spectral factorization; and interpolation of matrix functions.                       The theory of feedback control systems, originally motivated               by problems in engineering, occupies a central place in applied                 mathematics and is fundamental to control engineering                           applications. The present project examines mathematical questions               for the generalized or \"singular\" linear systems which arise                    naturally when complicated networks are constructed from smaller                components. The poles of these systems govern stability and long-               term behavior, while the transmission zeros govern adaptability                 and transient responses. Techniques both from functional analysis               and the modern theory of abstract algebraic structures will be                  combined in these studies to provide the conceptual foundations                 and new technical results for these systems.",
