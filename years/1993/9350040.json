 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. MacCluer's research lies at the interface of operator theory                and function theory.  These problems involve aspects of the study               of composition operators on analytic function spaces, and include               a continuation of joint work with Carl Cowen (Purdue University) on             the question of identifying the spectrum of a composition operator              acting on a Hilbert space of analytic functions on the unit ball BN             of CN, N > 1.  A study of the phenomena of auotmorphism invariance              of such a Hilbert space, and its connection with composition                    operator questions will be pursued.  Additionally, there is                     continuing joint work with Thomas Kriete (University of Virginia)               on a study of composition operators on large weighted Bergman                   spaces on the disc, and a continuation of recent work of MacCluer               and others on basic properties of composition operators on spaces               of analytic functions on BN, N > 1.                                                                                                                             Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching               a one semester graduate level course based on a book being written              by Dr. MacCluer and Carl Cowen at Purdue-the host institution-on                composition operators.  Additionally, guest lectures in seminars at             Purdue and at the Wabash Modern Analysis Seminar will be given.                 Dr. MacCluer will also seek out opportunities for interaction with              both undergraduate and graduate students in a variety of ways, both             informal and structured.                                                                                                                                        This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
