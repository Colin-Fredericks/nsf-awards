 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224717  Weber  This is an award the objective of which is to  understand the mechanisms for methylation of  inorganic tin and dimethylation of methyltin  compounds in estuarine salt marshes.  This  knowledge has potential applicability  in determination of the potential hazards that  aquatic sediments contained with these  compounds pose to aquatic organisms and to  their ecosystem.  Specifically, the research  addresses the seasonal variations of inorganic  tin and methyltin compounds in marsh grass,  the methylation of these tin compounds in  marsh sediments, in sediment slurries and in  mixed and pure cultures of microorganisms  isolated from the estuarine marsh habitat.    Methyl and butyltin compounds are ubiquitous  in marine coastal environments, thought  generally to have originated from use of tin  compounds as ingredients of marine antifouling  paints.  These compounds wear off or flake  from the surfaces to which they are applied  and become associated with benthic deposits.   Methylated tin compounds are considerably  more toxic to life-forms than tin itself, and  are more mobile and easily bioaccumulated.   Results of this research are expected to  provide insights into appropriate management  of contaminated aquatic sediments to reduce  their potential biocidal effects on the  ecosystem into which they are introduced or to  which they may be transported.",
