The National  Science Foundation (NSF) Proposal and Award Manual states in  section  122 .2.(B) that peer review is not applicable for \"  services provided by another Federal agency in support of  Polar  Programs\"   9314735  Petty  The Fish and Wildlife Sevice will further develop and test lipid  dosimeters or semipermeable membrane devices for use in  Antarctica.  The dosimeter is essentially a semipermeable plastic  tube containing triolein (a lipid).  The device is designed to be  placed insitu in water and simulate the uptake of contaminants by  aquatic biota. The contaminants in the lipid are extracted and  analyzed by conventional analytical methods. The advantages of  the technique are 1) deployment of the dosimeter is much simpler  than collecting aquatic biota; 2)data between sampling locations  are comparable whereas data from different species are not;  3).  divers are not needed; 4) aquatic biota are not harvested; and  5). sample holding time are probably extend.  ***",
