All five are abstract properties               of the verbal lexicon, realized in verbal derivations, verbal                   inflection, and text frequencies of valence patterns and                        derivational types. This project will trace the five features                   through 120 or more languages (using a pre-existent worldwide                   sample, genetically based at a controlled time depth) and survey                a dozen language families and three high-diversity language areas               in much more depth. This data base will suffice to establish the                degree of variation of these features within language families,                 the extent of borrowing between families in contact situations,                 and any statistically significantly correlations between these                  features and standard typologically relevant features (already                  surveyed in previous work). The anticipated result will be a                    demonstration that these features are useful genetic markers,                   demonstration of their structural independence from other                       features and of their usefulness in typology, and concrete                      hypotheses of deeper genetic relatedness between certain language               families, chiefly of northern Eurasia.",
