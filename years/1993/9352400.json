 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to instrument our Cessna 172 aircraft with                           scientific equipment so that we may implement a cohesive flight                 test program. The engineering instructional capability of the                   instrumented aircraft will strengthen and unify our                             undergraduate Aerospace Engineering program, our minority                       student community college outreach program, and our K-12                        engineering outreach programs. We envisage a scenario similar                   to that existing in a corporate aircraft company whereby a                      problem is defined by top administrators, a flight test program                 to solve that problem is designed by the engineering staff, and                 support for the flight test program is provided by the various                  branches. In the university analogy, the faculty will pick a                    flight test problem such as an aircraft stability problem. The                  senior level Stability and Control class will develop a flight                  test and become program managers. Other classes will support                    that effort: Low Speed Aerodynamics students will calibrate the                 instrumentation, the Design class will design and construct                     wing mounts for the instrumentation, the Instrumentation class                  will be responsible for integration of the instruments,                         community college students will perform data analysis, and                      middle school students will assist at the airport with aircraft                 preparation. All students will participate in the actual flight                 tests. To carry out this project, we require a data analysis                    and display system, a flow visualization system, a pressure                     measurement system, a flight dynamics system, and a global                      positioning system.",
