 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313404  Moon       One of the objectives of the project is to transfer knowledge  discovered in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and fractals to  applications in material removal processes.  In particular, the  activity will focus on the physics of material cutting dynamics and  the relation between observed chaotic vibrations in machine tools  and fractal properties of workpiece surfaces.  Modern experimental,  computational, and analytical methods in dynamical systems and  fractals will be employed on particular machine tool systems such  as lathe cutting and milling.  The principal aim of the experiments  will be to establish a correlation between cutting tool dynamics  and surface quality, especially between chaotic vibrations in the  tool motions and fractal or random like properties in the surface  finish.  Nonlinear models for cutting tool dynamics will be  investigated both analytically and computationally.  These models  will incorporate both time delay or regenerative effects as well as  material nonlinearity forces in the cutting process.  Of particular  interest will be the search for coexisting multiple dynamical  attractors and their basins of attraction.  Experimentally, the  goal is to measure the surface roughness both as the material is  being removed and in the post dynamics state.          Chatter of  machine tools is a critical phenomenon that severely limits their  productivity.  If the chatter process can be better understood, the  suppression of unwanted vibration will allow machine tools to take  heavier cuts with good surface finish.",
