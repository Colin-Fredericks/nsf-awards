 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most distinguishing features of the American national                government is the way separated institutions, especially Congress               and president, share the power to make public policy.  For example,             the executive branch implements the laws the legislative branch                 creates; the Senate approves or rejects the president's                         appointments to the Supreme Court.  Most striking, the president                can block a bill passed by Congress by exercising the veto power                and Congress may then attempt to override the veto.                                                                                                             Although the separated powers system is a critical element of                   public policy making in the United States, many parts of it are                 only poorly understood by political scientists.  For example,                   consider the presidential veto:  what happens to a bill after it is             vetoed?  Under what circumstances does it die?  When Congress                   repasses a vetoed bill, does Congress make concessions to the                   president?  Under what circumstances are the concessions large, and             when are they small?  More broadly, what causes a bill to be                    vetoed?  Although vetoes are rare events, many involve the great                legislative issues of the day.  So, answers to these questions                  would help us understand an important aspect of the American system             of separated powers.                                                                                                                                            Unfortunately, although political scientists know quite a lot about             the frequency of vetoes, they do not know the answers to the above              questions.  Thre are two reasons for this.  First, these questions              approach vetoes from an unusual perspective.  They assume a single              veto is not an isolated event but just one stage in a bargaining                process between Congress and president.  They assume a sequential               bargaining approach to the veto.  Most political scientists have                tended to approach each veto as a separate event, obscuring the                 bargaining dynamic between the two branches of government.  Second,             answering these questions requires data on individual vetoed bills,             or even a random sample of all bills, rather than simply the                    aggregate number of vetoes per time period.  These types of data                have never been collected, and the process of collecting them is                tedious and time consuming.                                                                                                                                     This research project targets both of these problems.  First, the               investigators examine vetoes from a sequential bargaining                       perspective.  Second, they collect data on individual bills.  The               researchers will collect data on about one hundred fifty bills in               veto \"chains\" (bills vetoed and repassed), a random sample of four              hundred vetoed bills (about fifty five per cent of all vetoes since             1946), and a random sample of about four hundred general bills; a               total of about nine hundred bills (allowing for some overlap among              the samples).  By combining theory and data, the investigators will             substantially enhance our understanding of the veto process and the             role it plays in policy formulation.",
