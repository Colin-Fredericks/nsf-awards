The school will teach                       the data parallel language NESL, as well as give tutorials                      in the languages C* and High Performance Fortran(HPF).                          Attendees for the school are expected from both industry and                    academia and will consist of graduate students, junior                          faculty, a select number of undergraduates, theoreticians                       interested in parallel programming, and scientists from                         application areas.                                                                                                                                              The school follows the DAGS summer symposium on parallel I/O                    and databases, two often-neglected, but critically                              important, topics. The school on parallel programming will                      treat, within a practical context, issues raised during the                     symposium.  Students will program and produce homework                          solutions with supervision from school faculty.  Students                       will also have the benefit of interacting with various                          experts during the symposium.",
