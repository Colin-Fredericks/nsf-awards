 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of this award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic,                  and Organometallic Program, Dr. Russell P. Hughes of the                        Chemistry Department, Dartmouth College, would continue                         investigations on the cleavage and formation of carbon-carbon                   bonds promoted by transition metals.  Three projects would be                   pursued:  ring-opening in vinylcyclopropene rearrangements;                     characterization of eta-3-cyclopropenyl complexes, including                    their CO substitution reactions and rotation barriers; and bond                 cleavage of sterically destabilized cyclopentadienyl ligands.                   The latter reactions do not proceed by simple metal insertion                   into the carbon-carbon bond.  In order to study the skeletal                    rearrangments that occur during the ring opening reactions of                   the cyclopentadienyl ligands, selectively isotopically labelled                 precursors will be prepared.  A 1,2,3,-tri-t-butylcyclopenta-                   dienyl ligand has been prepared; advantage will be made of the                  incipient strain associated with the compound in order to make                  novel compounds.                                                                %%%                                                                             By investigating in detail the mechanism of carbon-carbon bond                  making and breaking by transition metals, Dr. Russell P. Hughes                 of Dartmouth College hopes to achieve increased understanding                   of this reaction which is important to the petroleum catalyst                   industry.  The results could be particularly relevant to the                    formation and control of carbon ring compounds.",
