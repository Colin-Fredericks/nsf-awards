 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of ocean-atmosphere interactions on climate                       variability in extratropical latitudes, both within the season and              during transitions between seasons, will be examined.  The focus of             the proposed research will be on assessing the two-way interactive              relationship between temperature anomalies produced in the ocean                and synoptic scale transient activity (e.g. locations and paths of              high and low pressure systems) and related low frequency flow                   patterns produced in the atmosphere.  The results will aid in                   understanding the causes of climate variability and the potential               for predictability on seasonal time scales.  This research builds               upon (1) past studies which investigated the one-way forced effects             of SST anomalies (prescribed) on atmospheric transient eddy                     processes and (2) past work which investigated the two-way                      interaction between mid-latitude SST and atmospheric circulation                anomalies as deduced in long multi-year seasonal integrations of a              low resolution atmospheric model coupled to a constant depth mixed              layer ocean.                                                                         For these studies a higher resolution atmospheric model (NCAR              CCM1) will be used so that the climatic behavior of transient eddy              processes can be simulated more realistically.  The simple mixed                layer ocean model has been chosen to permit examination of the ways             that the important ocean-atmosphere energy exchange influences the              evolution of middle latitude SST anomalies.  Three experiments are              planned: (1) a 100-year seasonal integration of the atmospheric                 model (CCM1) using prescribed climatological SSTs, (2) a 100-year               seasonal integration of CCM1 coupled to a constant 50 m depth mixed             layer ocean (CCM1CO) and (3) a 40-50 year seasonal integration of               CCM1 coupled to a constant 50 m depth mixed layer ocean but with                prescribed forcing of observed tropical SST variability                         (CCM1CO/TROPSET).  The variability of transient eddy activity                   (storm tracks) and abrupt seasonal shifts in circulation in the                 absence of SST variability wil be investigated in Experiment 1.                 The two-way influence between model produced extratropical                      anomalies and storm tracks (and the associated time mean                        atmospheric circulation) will be examined in Experiment 2.  The                 modifying influence of tropical SST variability (which includes El              Nino cycles) on middle latitude SST anomalies and variability of                extratropical atmospheric transient eddy activity will be assessed              by comparing the results of Experiments 2 and 3.  The behavior of               synoptic scale storm tracks will be characterized by examination of             model variation in RMS time-filtered 1000 mb and 500 mb heights and             in the processes of baroclinic eddy momentum and heat fluxes; the               determination of abrupt seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation             will include an analysis of model energetics.  Dominant SST anomaly             patterns and their relationship to atmospheric processes will be                examined using various statistical and composite analyses including             EOF, lag correlation, singular value decomposition and canonical                correlation methods.",
