 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Drs. Rosemary Joyce and Julia Hendon, Mr                 Christopher Fung will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.               He will conduct excavations at sites which  are located in the Yoro             region of Honduras and which date to late Classic and Terminal                  Classic times. It was during this period that Mayan and related                 societies reached their height of cultural development. Mr. Fung                will select a series of mounds which probably represent domestic                compounds. He will strip large lateral areas to uncover artifacts               in spatial context and use these to reconstruct the organization of             activities within each. On this basis he will attempt to determine              the role of food preparation activities and the relative importance             of this in contexts which, on the basis of other evidence, appear               to represent elites and non-elites. He will then attempt to                     determine the role which food preparation played in the development             and maintenance of status differentiation and also determine the                degree to which these Honduran societies were internally                        differentiated. He will use ethnographic models as the basis for                such analysis and will compare the results to those obtained from               nearby Mayan sites.                                                                                                                                             Honduras is of great interest to archaeologists who study Middle                America because it marks a frontier between Mayan and non-Mayan                 societies. While the outline of Mayan prehistory in Honduras is                 well known, the nature of their non-Mayan neighbors is less well                understood. If in fact the non-Mayan counterparts do not exhibit                such a strong degree of social complexity, it provides a situation              in which archaeologists can examine interaction along a frontier                zone. The sites Mr. Fung will study are non-Mayan and his work                  should yield new insight both into their level of complexity and                the nature of their interaction with the Maya.                                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. By its focus on food                   preparation and examination of the broader context within which                 this takes place, it will help to develop an approach which                     archaeologists may employ in many situations in many parts of the               world. The project will also assist in the training of a promising              young archaeologist.",
