 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311659  Roytburd       The PI will continue research in applied analysis and  scientific computing related to nonlinear wave propagation.  The  work will include:  i) The nonlinear evolution of low-frequency  instabilities of detonation waves and an asymptotic theory for  the phenomenon of detonation waves propagating along a  cylindrical tube;  ii)  The study of a class of free boundary  (free interface) problems which arise naturally as simplified   conceptual models of gasless combustion and fast solidification.  These free boundary problems demonstrate a variety of dynamical  patterns that are essentially low-dimensional.  The qualitative  behavior of these model problems and their connections with the  front motion description will be investigated both analytically  and numerically.  %%%       The proposed theoretical investigation will contribute to a  better understanding of a number of engineering problems that  include: the design and safe use of highly energetic propellants;  safe handling of explosives; the process of synthesizing of  certain ceramic and metallic alloys via solid combustion;  explosive solidification of thin films and others.  On the other  hand, the mathematical models that the PI proposes to investigate  appear to be generic and are encountered as simple building  blocks also in other contexts.  Their investigation will lead to  progress in dynamical systems theory.  ***",
