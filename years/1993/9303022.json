The central focus is on disorder and  magnetic-field-induced superconductor-insulator transitions.  The  physics underlying these transitions will be identified by mapping  out the phase diagram in the space of the magnetic field,  temperature, and disorder, bu determining critical exponents, and  by investigating the transport and magnetotransport properties of  the materials.  The structures of the films will be investigated in  situ via reflection high energy electron diffraction, and scanning  tunneling microscopy.  These studies will provide information about  the nucleation and growth of the films.  %%%  This research studies the deposition, growth and physical  properties of thin films of superconducting materials.   Interestingly, the films lose their superconducting properties when  a magnetic field is applied to them, and become isulators.  The  underlying physics of this dramatic change in electrical  conductivity is not well understood, and a number of measurements  are proposed to reveal important characteristics of the phenomena.   The results will be of fundamental interest in the science of  superconductivity.  Additionally, the workers will investigate the  structure and nucleation of the films, to see how the materials  morphology relates to the observed properties.  ***",
