The partnership will be working very closely with the school                    district as it attempts to put into place a project which                       will result in improved student achievement in science and                      mathematics for all students.                                                                                                                                   In particular the planning will include the identification                      of special needs of urban students and the programmatic                         features which will address these special needs; benchmarks                     and five-year project outcomes that will demonstrate                            measurable impact on all schools, students, and teachers;                       and a process whereby the Urban Systemic Initiatives (USI)                      will become institutionalized by the school district,                           individual schools, and educational partners in Philadelphia.                   In addition, the governance structure and management plan for                   such a project will be developed as will ongoing networking of                  key stakeholders to the project.",
