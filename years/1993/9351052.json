 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351052  Bland       The mathematics faculty at Eastern Kentucky University is using  the software package Mathematica for teaching calculus, linear  algebra, and differential equations. This is being accomplished  through non-traditional instruction which is taking place in a  technology classroom. The emphasis of the program is on having  students explore problems of such computational complexity that  they will have to use Mathematica to analyze and solve the  problems. This is leading to good problem solving skills and to  a deeper understanding of important principles in mathematics.  In the technology classroom students are being placed in an  environment where they are required to use approximation  procedures, graphical analysis, and data analysis in order to  solve problems. Computing is being used as a tool for  experimental problem solving as opposed to the usual deductive  and theoretical approach most often found in the traditional  classroom setting. Students are required to submit written  reports on their technology classroom projects. Student  understanding is being enhanced since they are required to  write a clear and concise explanation of their  results.Mathematica materials are being developed for use in  teaching these courses. The faculty is building on Mathematica  materials developed at other institutions under NSF grants as  well as developing new materials. New Mathematica materials  developed are being made available to the mathematical  community upon request.  ***",
