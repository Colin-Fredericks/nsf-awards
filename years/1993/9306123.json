 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306123  Wallace    Fundulus heteroclitus females ovulate and spawn in their natural  habitat with a semilunar periodicity coincident with spring tides  for up to eight months of the year; they also spawn with a  semilunar periodicity under constant, controlled laboratory  conditions at any time during the year.  Highly elevated levels  of circulating estradiol-17 Beta (E2)are associated with each  spawning episode.  A biological clock for reproductive activity,  and involving cyclic E2-release by the ovary, thus appears to  exist in this abundant and experimentally convenient teleost.    In order to appreciate the operant factors in the reproductive  cycling of F. heteroclitus, various aspects of reproductive  activity will be monitored by Dr. Wallace over several spawning  episodes.  These include vitellogenin and gonadotropin levels in  the bloodstream and biogenic amine levels in the hypothalamus.  If vitellogenin and gonadotropin levels are found to fluctuate,  corresponding mRNA levels will be measured in the liver and  pituitary, respectively.  The manner by which gonadotropins  regulate aromatase activity in prematurational follicles (the  source of elevated E2 levels) will also be addressed together  with the competence of follicles to respond to relevant hormones  at various times during the cycle.    The effect of E2 on cyclic spawning will be experimentally  investigated by administering E2 at various times during the  spawning cycle.  Other drugs will also be provided in order to  explore cause and effect relationships in the hypothalamic-  pituitary-gonadal axis.    Finally, a series of observations will be made on egg hatching  patterns and locomotor activity.  Semilunar patterns in such  processes, if convincingly demonstrated, would indicate that F.  heteroclitus has a genetically determined, biological clock that  regulates its overall physiology.  ***",
