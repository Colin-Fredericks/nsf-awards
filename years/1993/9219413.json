 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall purpose of the investigation is to identify                         features of the glyoxysomal membrane electron transport (GMET)                  system which regulates oxidation of NADH generated by fat                       metabolism within glyoxysomes during germination of oil seeds.                  This metabolic process is regulated by the oxidation of the NADH                generated within the glyoxysomes.  NADH is oxidized by the GMET                 system comprised of a 32 KDa protein (gm32) and secondary transfer              protein(s) in the membrane.  During the germination of an oil seed,             glyoxysomes acquire membrane electron transport activities at the               same time that fat metabolism becomes active.  The first objective              of this project is to identify the cytoplasmic electron acceptors               for GMET.  The physical exposure of the proteins will be examined.              We will determine if GMET activity is regulated by the appearance               of different proteins in the glyoxysomal membrane or by                         modifications (e.g., phosphorylation) of proteins.  The amino acid              sequence of gm32 will then be determined, to allow comparison with              other electron transport proteins.  This work is being done with                glyoxysomes obtained from the endosperm of germinating castor                   beans.                                                                          %%%                                                                             This project concerns fat metabolism, which is directly                         related to agriculture and to human health.  Many agriculturally                important seeds (corn, sunflower, soybean, peanut, cotton, castor               bean) contain fat and depend on fat metabolism for germination.                 Specific subcellular organelles, peroxisomes and glyoxysomes, are               involved in the metabolism of fats.  Peroxisomes and glyoxysomes                consist of a concentrated solution of enzymes (proteins) enclosed               by a membrane and fat is metabolized by the enclosed enzymes.  As               fat is metabolized within a peroxisome or glyoxysome, molecules and             energy (as electrons) must pass in and out, through the membrane.               Thus the membrane must contain enzymes which regulate fat                       metabolism inside the organelle.  The specific purpose of this                  investigation is to identify these membrane enzymes and to                      determine how they might be regulated.  The basic information of                membrane transport can then be applied to understanding fat                     metabolism in humans, as well.",
