 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just as humans generally have to live within a monetary budget, it              is reasonable to assume that other organisms must live within an                energy budget.  Particularly when resources are limiting, it must               be important to utilize resources as efficiently as possible.                   Those organisms that do so will presumably be at a competitive and              evolutionary advantage compared to others who may be less                       efficient.  These ideas seem sensible, but have been difficult to               test.  It is often not possible to classify behavioral activities.              For example, an animal may be simultaneously involved in several                activities including thermoregulating, guarding territory                       boundaries, and seeking a mate as well as food.  In addition, it                has been difficult to identify the appropriate resources to                     measure.  It is also not clear how investing energy in searching                for food affects growth rate, and size and age at maturity.                     Variation in development rates and pathways can have tremendous                 impact on the evolution of a species, but few studies have                      addressed the nutritional causes that contribute to this variation.                                                                                             Orb-weaving spiders provide an excellent model system for the study             of resource partitioning and the developmental consequences of                  shifts in partitioning.  Spiders synthesize their web from                      physiologically important compounds such as proteins.  The activity             of spinning the orb web and the nutritional investment into the orb             can serve no other purpose than prey capture, the resources                     allocated to the orb web are unavailable for growth or reproduction             during that foraging bout, and all prey capture occurs on the orb               web; thus, the web must be maintained through periods of reduced                prey capture.  We will examine the nutritional ecology of foraging              in the large, widely distributed, orb-weaving spider Nephila                    clavipes.  Our experiments will involve NMR and gas chromatographic             analysis of orb chemistry using spiders from 3 separate                         populations.  The biology of this orb-weaving spider will allow us              to clearly distinguish foraging from other activities and to track              how different types or resources partitioned between foraging and               other activities.  We will also be able to identify resources that,             when limiting, necessitate trade-offs between foraging and other                activities.  In addition, we can quantify how the investment of                 resources into foraging affects growth and development under a                  variety of environmental conditions, and we can distinguish                     patterns that are due to genetic differences from those due to                  environmental differences.  This study will address the long-held               assumptions of most classical foraging models (that shifts in                   foraging investment reflect shifts in resource partitioning and                 that increased foraging efficiency increases relative fitness) and              it will finally allow quantification of resource partitioning                   between foraging and growth, permitting investigation of the                    precise relationships between variation in foraging investment and              variation in developmental programs.",
