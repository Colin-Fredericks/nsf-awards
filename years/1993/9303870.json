Magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) of intact spiders and solid state nuclear magnetic  resonance (NMR) of oriented fibers, will be used as the primary  tools.  Parallel mechanical measurements will be performed.  The  experiments proposed here will provide considerable new,  molecular-level information about the structure, processing, and  dynamics of this model biomaterial.  It is likely that these  results will contribute greatly to our ability to genetically  engineer robust materials with designed properties.  The MRI  experiments, which will be performed as silk is being spooled  from the intact spider, will test hypotheses concerning silk  processing.  Of special interest is the dehydration mechanism by  which the silk biopolymer goes from an isotropic liquid in the  silk gland to a highly oriented fiber as it exists the  spinnerete.  Direct NMR observation of dissected silk glands will  also be performed.  The solid state deuterium NMR experiments, to  be performed on oriented, deuterium-labelled silk fibers, will  specify the angles that specific amino acid sidechains make with  respect to the fiber axis.  The deuterium experiments will test  hypotheses concerning (i) the role of water in the  supercontraction phenomenon, (ii) the role of alanine residues in  the elasticity of silk and (iii) the dynamic environment of  glycine in the crystalline and amorphous regions.  %%%  In several instances Nature has conspired to produce biopolymers  with superior materials properties.  One example is spider  dragline silk, which is stronger per cross-sectional area than  steel.  The goal is to understand the origins of these superior  properties, so that someday it might be possible to produce  \"designer\"  materials based on insights gleaned from Nature.  ***",
