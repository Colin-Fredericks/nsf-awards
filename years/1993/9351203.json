 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351203  Cohen  The Department of Biological Sciences at Hunter College is  seeking to retain more majors and attract them into research-  oriented careers. In addition to enhancing students' laboratory  experiences during their first year of required major courses,  a two-semester Cell Biology sequence, we will facilitate  earlier and more productive entry into undergraduate research  by providing a Practical Research Techniques Facility in which  undergraduates gain working knowledge of laboratory equipment  and procedures. Undergraduates will have their first experience  with research techniques under non-intimidating conditions,  prior to entry into a research laboratory. The Cell Biology  equipment will provide hands-on experience with some of the  most powerful modern research techniques, including  fluorescence and video microscopy, gel electrophoresis, and  immunoblotting.  Of the present 21 laboratory exercises, 14  will be directly improved by the equipment, and three new ones  added. A state-of-the-art microscope video camera and image  processor will demonstrate modern methods for data capture and  analysis, and, coupled with image recording and display  equipment, will markedly improve laboratory teaching throughout  the year and will enhance undergraduate research. The  Techniques Facility will allow students to overcome the start-  up barrier to undergraduate research: lack of practical  experience. By means of computer simulations, video tapes, and  tutorials with real instruments, it will provide students with  experience using basic lab equipment (centrifuge, pH meter,  spectrophotometer, balance), and with the state-of-the-art  techniques required for the research lab. Students and their  faculty mentors can then spend their time together on the real  science to be done.  ***",
