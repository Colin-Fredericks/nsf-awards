 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310890  Grace   The ability to predict changes over time and in response to altered   environmental conditions has become a priority in ecology. By strengthening the   link between basic and applied research, ecologists can use information to   predict future impacts of habitat alterations on biodiversity and community   structure. The research in this Dissertation Improvement grant has two main   objectives: (1) to elucidate causal processes in coastal marsh communities, and   (2) test a structural equation model that will predict several attributes of   community structure from biotic and abiotic variables. The research involves   experimental manipulations of salinity, water level, soil fertility, and herbivory in   a Louisiana coastal marsh system. Examining the responses of communities to   experimental alterations over three growing seasons will provide evidence of the   effects of different variables on community structure and provide estimates on   potential rates of change in these systems.   %%%  In order to protect marshes from erosion and damage due to salt water intrusion   and sea level rise, resource managers must first know how these variables affect   marsh communities. The development and testing of a model to predict marsh   community structure will not only help preserve these threatened systems, but   will move the field of ecology closer to being a more predictive science.  ***",
