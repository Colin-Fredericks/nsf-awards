Collete Station, TX  Sturdivant, Karon, Giardino, John, Valdes, Juan and Paris, Rodney     The goal of the Texas A&M University Camp Planet Earth:  Summer  Environmental Science Camp is to increase the number of African  American, hispanic, and Native American students from  educationally, disadvantaged backgrounds who succeed in college  preparatory courses in mathematics and science during their high  school years and then to enter these disciplines of study at the  college level. Participants will work in a stimulating, non-  threatening educational environment with professors as mentors and  Texas A&M University graduate students and selected former Camp  Planet Earth Students serving as mentors and peer role modes.   Through a variety of instructional activities at Texas A&M  University and the actual field experience, participants will  obtain knowledge and skills related to the scientific investigation  of the environment of Planet Earth; develop a strong interest in  pursuing careers in science and increase their knowledge of the  educational preparation required for such careers; develop academic  skills for their high school studies through sessions which focus  on strengthening their skills in reading, writing, and  communications with particular emphasis on helping students develop  good study skills for mathematics and science courses; and develop  an increased level of pride and appreciation in their ethnicities  and cultural sensitivity to other ethnic groups.    Environmental science has been selected as the focus for the Camp  because it integrates a number of scientific disciplines: geology,  meteorology, biology, chemistry, geography, physics, engineering,  and mathematics.  This interdisciplinary approach is based on the  strong belief that the environment can best be understood by the  application of general systems theory to planetary processes.  The  approach requires that Camp participants consider the planet from  a holistic point o f view and emphasizes the idea of linkages  between the subsystems of the earth as well as the various  components and elements of the subsystems.    The four week-long Camp Planet Earth will convene on the Texas A&M  campus in College Station.  After two weeks of classroom  instruction, the participants, camp faculty and staff will travel  to the program's field camp in Alamosa, Colorado.  The camp will be  a combination of an academic experience and an \"outward-bound\"  adventure.",
