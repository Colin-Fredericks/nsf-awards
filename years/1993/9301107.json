 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301107  Hanson       High performance computing is essential for managing massive  computational and memory demands in optimal control of large  scale applications, such as aerospace, structures, resources,  economics and robotics.  Implementation of advanced computational  techniques, such as parellelization, matrization (including  vectorization), graphical visualization and problem mapping make  possible the solution of larger dimensional problems.  Our  research objective is to develop fast algorithms for the optimal  feedback control of general continuous time nonlinear stochastic  dynamical systems.  These systems include perturbations by both  Gaussian and distributed Poisson white noise.  Advanced  computational treatment of these systems, especially with Poisson  noise, is a particularly unique feature of this proposal.  The  algorithms are being testing on multi-state resource models, but  are applicable to a wide variety of applications.  The numerical  approach directly treats the partial differential equation of  stochastic programming.  New algorithms, such as finite element,  will be developed to alleviate both memory and computationally  intensive demands from the \"curse of dimensionality\".  Purely  parallel methods are being developed for scalable, massively  parallel and massive memory supercomputers, including new  generation \"ultracomputers\".  The development of graphical  visualization tools is also essential for analyzing massive  amounts of output in many dimensions.  There are also several  related problems as well.  ***",
