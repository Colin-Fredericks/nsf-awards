An Agreement              establishing the Institute was signed 13 May 1992 by the U.S. and               ten additional countries.  IAI will become operational once six                 countries have ratified and signed the Agreement.  The IAI                      initiative was launched by the U.S. and there is a high level of                interest in supporting coordinated science activities with                      developing countries in the Western Hemisphere.  A project office               is essential to the successful coordination of science planning,                education, and training activities, especially in light of the                  broad, interdisciplinary research agenda envisioned for the                     Institute.  This funding action will establish a cooperative                    agreement between NSF/GEO and NOAA/Office of Global Programs (OGP)              for the joint management of the project office that will be located             at NOAA.",
