 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study undertakes a rigorous analysis of unemployment dynamics              in the transition from central planning to a market economy.  As                unemployment rises rapidly in all the transforming economies, the               issues of the determinants of unemployment and the optimal policies             to cope with the explosive situation have come to the forefront of              the public policy debate.  The project makes two major                          contributions toward these issues.                                                                                                                              First, it uses unique Czechoslovak data and combines traditional                with frontier statistical analysis to examine three sets of                     important research questions.  The first set relates to the origins             and incidence of unemployment.  What are the characteristics of the             unemployed?  Are certain types of workers (e.g., older, female or               poorly educated workers) at greater risk of being laid off than                 others?  The second set of questions focuses on identifying the                 determinants of the duration of unemployment spells.  In this                   context, the study examines how unemployment duration varies with               enterprise characteristics, individuals' demographic and regional               characteristics, changing demand conditions, and changes in                     important elements of the unemployment insurance system.  The third             set is concerned with estimating and explaining variations in the               transition rates out of unemployment to other states (in or out of              the labor market).  For example, what is the probability that a                 worker with certain characteristics and who was previously employed             in a given sector will leave unemployment for the small scale                   private sector or for training, etc.?  Unlike many previous studies             of unemployment, this project relates the incidence and duration of             unemployment to firm specific characteristics.                                                                                                                  The second contribution of the study consists of developing, in                 conjunction with the Czech and Slovak Ministries of Labor and                   Social Affairs and the Federal Statistical Office, sampling schemes             and estimation methods for further analysis of the inflow to                    unemployment.  The main question to be addressed is how the large               public and newly privatized firms make their layoff decisions.                  Moreover, the new data set would allow for the estimation of the                transition rates from employment to unemployment.                                                                                                               The major scientific value of the proposal stems from its ability               to collect and analyze informative data sets related to one of the              most important economic phenomena in this century.  The dramatic                changes in the Central and East European economies in this period               provide us with much greater variation in the explanatory variables             than has been witnessed in any middle income or advanced economy.               The study will hence be able to capture major behavioral patterns               and contribute significantly to our understanding of the dynamics               of labor markets moving towards an equilibrium during the                       transition.",
