The symposium is organized to               celebrate the life-long achievements of Dr. Joseph E. Varner.                   The program is designed to encompass major past and present                     achievements in broad areas of plant sciences as well as future                 research directions in plant biology.  Three major sessions                     include; (1) from structure and function to molecule, (2) from                  molecules back to structure and function, and (3) on the horizon.               Speakers are encouraged to speculate and discuss the implications               of their research findings for future directions in plant biology               research, which the organizers hope will promote discussions                    among the  participants.  The NSF award will specifically support               graduate students and postdocs attend this symposium and be                     exposed to a slightly different kind of discussion from that                    of traditional research conferences.",
