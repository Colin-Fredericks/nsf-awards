 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Cheryl Claassen will              conduct a third and final season of archaeological excavation at                the site of Dogan point which is located in the Hudson River Valley             of New York State. She and her collaborators will then analyze the              cultural, faunal and floral materials collected, set these in a                 geomorphological context, and prepare the results for publication.              The Dogan Point site was extensively excavated by an amateur                    archaeologist in the late 1960s. It produced, from its lowest                   levels, giant oyster shell which was dated to the 7th millennium                BC. This was of great interest to archaeologists because it                     represented the oldest date in eastern North America for human                  utilization of shellfish resources. However because of the amateur              nature of the excavation and unsatisfactory data recording,                     archaeologists have been reluctant to accept the results. Dr.                   Claassen's research has indicated that these early dates are in                 fact correct and the goals of this additional work are to provide               further evidence and prepare it for publication.                                                                                                                While evidence for human use of specialized resources such as                   shellfish extend back to a much earlier time period in the Old                  World, in North America a similar pattern appears strangely late in             time and archaeologists have wondered why this might be so. Some                have argued that such specialized resource utilization in fact does             extend further back but relevant sites currently lie below sea                  level. Others argue that because sea levels had not stabilized,                 human groups did not recognize the food potential of such areas.                The original early dates from Dogan Point were important because                they lent strong support to the former contention. However, because             of the nature of the early excavations, they were widely questioned             and Dr. Claassen's work is significant because it confirms the                  original conclusion.                                                                                                                                            This work is important for several reasons. It will provide data of             interest to many North Americanist archaeologists. It will increase             our understanding of prehistoric subsistence adaptations and will               assist in researcher and student training in an undergraduate                   institution.",
