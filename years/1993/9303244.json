 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first endocrinological regulating mechanism for plasticity             in division of labor identified in a eusocial insect, the honey bee             (Apis mellifera), is juvenile hormone (JH).  The evolution of JH as             a regulator of division of labor by age-based task performance (age             polyethism) in advanced eusocial insects will be examined in this               research.  What will be sought are correlative and causal                       relationships between JH titer and age polyethisms in workers of                two species exhibiting independently- evolved advanced eusocial                 behavior: the stingless bee Melipona favosa and the swarm-founding              wasp Polybia occidentalis.  Field studies in Panama are to                      encompass three topics: (a) association of JH titer with behavioral             differences, by examination of correlations between endogenous JH               titer (assessed by radio-immunoassay) and rate of age polyethisms               in workers from unmanipulated colonies, (b) effects of increased JH             on behavior, by application of JH topically to M. favosa workers                and then testing for dose-dependency effects on age polyethism, (c)             correlation of JH titer with plasticity of behavioral role, to be               studied by removal of workers from foraging and nest working tasks,             then gauging the JH titers of behaviorally altered individuals                  compared with non-responsive ones.  Results will elucidate patterns             of the evolution of division of labor, a central component of                   insect colony integration of advanced eusocial insects.                         %%%                                                                             Insect societies are complex, self-organizing entities that are                 useful as models for other systems such as nervous systems and                  organismal development.  This study will augment our knowledge of               rules governing colony function by enhancing understanding of how               the behavior of individual components of the system are regulated               physiologically.  Comprehending mechanisms by which individual                  behavior is translated into colony function is a central focus of               insect sociobiology.  Such information is critical to discovering               the elements responsible for evolutionary success and ecological                impact of eusocial insect in contemporary terrestrial ecosystems,               especially tropical ones such as these Hymenopterans inhabit.",
