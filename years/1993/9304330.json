 "awd_abstract_narration": "The changing character of economies not only affects the                   geographic distribution of economic activities, it also affects                 the form and nature of participation by different groups of                     people in different types of activities.  In western Africa, the                production and marketing of produce grown in gardens                            traditionally was conducted by women, but changes in economic and               social structures during the 20th Century have altered the roles                of men and women in these processes.  This doctoral dissertation                research project will examine the social history of market                      gardening in the Bobo-Dioulasso region of southwestern Burkina                  Faso through three critical eras of change:  (1) the 1920s and                  1930s, when missionaries introduced European vegetables,                        cultivation techniques, and dietary habits; (2) the drought years               of the 1970s, when foreign donors funded agricultural                           diversification and irrigation projects; and (3) the current                    period of World Bank-mandated structural adjustment and austerity               programs.  Ethnographic data-collection techniques will be used                 in three gardening villages and in central marketplaces of the                  study area in order to obtain information about land, labor, and                technology employed in commercial vegetable production.  These                  data will be complemented by information from gardeners and                     traders, village elders, and government and non-governmental                    officials.                                                                           In addition to advancing empirical knowledge about changing                African food-production economies, this project will contribute                 to theoretical understandings of the dynamic interaction among                  macroeconomic conditions, social ideologies, and local practices                and gender relations.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement                   award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising               student to establish a strong independent research career.",
