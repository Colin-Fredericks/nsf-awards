 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Olmsted's research will primarily involve investigating the                 role of structural microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in                    microtubule organization and function.  Approaches that combine                 immunological and high resolution light and electron microscopy                 will be used to determine the distribution of MAP 4 in male gametic             cells and differentiating myoblasts.  Genetically engineered                    constructs transfected into cells will be examined for their                    effects on the organization of endogenous microtubule arrays and                other cellular structures.  Phenotypes generated by antisense                   experiments will be studied to see how absence of MAP 4 affects                 miotic structures.  Electron microscopic analyses of microinjected              MAP 2 interactions with the Golgi will also be carried out.  Pilot              experiments to identify a MAP 4 homolog in Schizosaccharomyces                  pombe will also be undertaken.                                                                                                                                  Interactive activities at the host institution include:  presenting             a seminar on the choice of science as a career and the attraction               and retention of women into science; a graduate seminar on                      cytoskeletal-organelle interactions; guest lectures in introductory             and cell biology courses; and participation in weekly laboratory                meetings and seminars.                                                                                                                                          This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
