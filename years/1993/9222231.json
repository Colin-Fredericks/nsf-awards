 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fishes live in an aquatic medium that is rich in potential                      chemical cues.  Soluble chemical products from various parts of a               fish's body are known to trigger many forms of social and                       symbiotic behavior.  Fish anesthetics that are commonly used for                laboratory procedures and to capture fish in the field have long                been rumored to have a negative effect on fishes' sense of smell.               Limited research on one common anesthetic produced conflicting                  results.  There have been no studies of the effects of other                    commonly used anesthetics or of any chemical at concentrations                  commonly used for field collections.  Many fish behaviorists                    could be using test subjects that are deprived of a significant                 portion of their normal stimulus input.                                                                                                                         This study will provide an initial indication of the effects of                 the four most common anesthetics at the strongest concentrations                normally used.  The fright reaction of the goby, Asterropteryx                  semipunctatus, will be used as a test system.  This reaction can                be released, with about equal probability and intensity, by a                   chemical cue and a visual cue.  Thus, fish that show impaired                   responsiveness to chemical cues can be tested for responsiveness                to visual cues to distinguish any general effect on                             responsiveness from specific impairment of the chemical senses.",
