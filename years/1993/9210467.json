 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical and asymptotic techniques will be used to                        investigate transonic flow about aircraft wings and flows with                  distributed vorticity.  Specific transonic problems to be                       analyzed are design of optimum critical axisymmetric bodies,                    flows about lifting, not-so-slender transonic wings and the                     transonic area rule, and wind tunnel flows.  Some use will be                   made of the transonic small disturbance formulation.  The                       investigations of the vortical flow problem will involve                        development and clarification of theories integrating nonlinear                 and viscous effects.  Both the transonic and vortical flow                      problems require interaction between numerical and asymptotic                   treatments in order to deal with complex nonlinearities.                             Present day commercial aircraft cruise in the transonic                    regime.  In this regime drag (the force opposing forward motion)                rises rapidly hence there is interest in understanding transonic                flows and in the design of reduced drag wings.  The study of                    flows with distributed vorticity (a certain distribution of                     whirl-like motion in the environment of interest) is both of a                  fundamental nature in fluid mechanics, but also of considerable                 interest in specific applications.  One example of such an                      application is the prediction of aerodynamic losses and heat                    loads in turbo-machinery.  The investigators will use modern                    methods of applied mathematics to deal with the complexities of                 the problems in the areas of research proposed.",
