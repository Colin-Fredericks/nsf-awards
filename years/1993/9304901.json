 "awd_abstract_narration": "An international symposium on the Geochemistry of the Earth                Surface will be held at University Park, Pennsylvania on August 1-              6, 1993.  The symposium is the third meeting of the Working Group               on Geochemistry of Weathering and Diagenesis of Sediments, (GWDS-3)             which is affiliated with the International Association of                       Geochemistry and Cosmochemistry. Past meetings have been held in                Granada, Spain (1986) and Aix-en-Provence, France (1990).                            The scientific sessions will cover a wide range of topics in               surficial geochemistry:  paleoclimates and paleosols, chemical                  weathering and denudation at scales from the watershed to global,               early diagenesis and organic geochemistry of sediments, geochemical             kinetics at low temperatures, global cycles, and environmental                  geochemistry.  A prominent theme of the symposium will be the role              of surficial geochemical studies (of both modern and                            paleoenvironments) in the international global change effort.                        Past meetings have been truly international, and we will                   continue the tradition.  In addition, the GWDS-3 encourages the                 participation of students, and of scientists from developing                    nations.  To achieve these goals we are requesting support                      (primarily for travel and meeting expenses of students and foreign              participants) from the National Science Foundation.  We will defray             part of the costs of the distinguished foreign invitees, as well as             to establish a NSF-sponsored, travel assistance award for students              and foreign participants.",
