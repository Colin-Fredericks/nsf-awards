 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major thrust of this research is to explore the argument               and generic concept of applying concurrent engineering concepts to              the design of advanced manufacturing systems.  The central theme                is threefold:  (1) to identify the framework and develop                        implementation guidelines necessary for robust manufacturing system             design by concurrently considering critical issues including                    maintainability, reliability, decomposability, operation, and                   management; (2) to substantiate the \"design for operation and                   management\" concept through development and extensive                           experimentations of two realistic operation and planning models for             flexible manufacturing systems (FMS), namely, the Part-Selection                Model and the Tool Assignment Model; and (3) to lay solid                       groundwork for further research into the tools and modules to                   realize design for maintainability, reliability and                             decomposability.                                                                     Advanced manufacturing technology, such as flexible                        manufacturing, is still a very expensive and high risk solution                 which demands an extremely customized approach to system design and             configuration.  It is not what an FMS user has purchased but how                the FMS user will operate it in an overall and totally integrated               way that makes the effective use of the new technology.  The PI's               industrial experience has provided a vivid testimony for the above              statement.  The plausible remedy is to revolutionize the typical                process of acquiring a manufacturing system where the system                    designer (FMS supplier) passes down whatever is done to the                     operation personnel and wishing that the FMS will live up to the                performance level as required by the management.",
