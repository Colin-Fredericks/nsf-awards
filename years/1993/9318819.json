 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318819   Welker     The Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections at the University of  Wisconsin and at Michigan State University represent an  incomparable unique set on brain anatomy representing existing  mammals from all over the world.  It is the largest collection of  its kind, containing over a half million anatomical sections from  over 150 species including members of 50 Families from 17 different  Orders of Mammalia.  It has been assembled over decades, and  includes specimens from many animals that represent important  groups but now are rare, and even endangered, prohibiting any  collection of more material.  This project will make basic catalog  data avaliable over the Internet network for worldwide use.  These  data will include a complete list of over 375 sectioned and stained  mammalian brains, photographic images of each brain from standard  views, and textual data about each brain with scanned color images  of selected sections stained for either cell bodies or myelin  sheaths.  A catalog also will be published together with examples  of brain photographs and photomicrographs to illustrate the high  quality of the stained sections.  This work will provide a new kind  of worldwide access to the main features of this unique collection,  to allow comparative neuroanatomists to see whether data they seek  for their work may already be available and useable through this  collection.  The impact will be not only on neuroscience and  comparative anatomy, but on production of electronic catalogs for  other biological collections in museums or universities, and on  ecological and evolutionary studies of worldwide mammalian  biodiversity.   ***",
