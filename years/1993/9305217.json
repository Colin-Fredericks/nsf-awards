 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of the proposed research is to understand the              mechanisms that regulate the dynein ATPases and generate                        microtubule-based motility.  The dynein motors provide the driving              force for ciliary and flagellar motility and contribute to                      microtubule-directed transport inside cells.  Although much is                  known about dynein polypeptide composition, little is understood                about the mechanisms that target the dyneins to their appropriate               cargoes or regulate their activity.  This proposal will capitalize              on the well-characterized structural organization of the flagellar              axoneme and the numerous motility mutants available in                          Chlamydomonas to ask how a single cell controls the assembly and                activity of its multiple dynein motors.  Preliminary studies have               identified a family of genes that are thought to encode several                 inner arm dynein isoforms.  The size and expression of the                      corresponding transcripts will be analyzed to determine if these                clones encode flagellar proteins or cytoplasmic variants.  Gene                 specific probes will be used to identify dynein heavy chain                     mutations by RFLP mapping procedures.  The biochemical and                      structural phenotypes o the dynein mutants will be examined to                  analyze the physical relationship between various dynein isoforms               and toe determine their distributions within the axoneme.  Specific             antibody probes based on domains of unique sequence will be used to             address similar questions.  These studies will establish the                    organization of the dynein motors within the flagellar axoneme.                 %%%                                                                             Chlamydomonas is a unicellular green alga which swims in its                    natural habitat by waving and rotating its flagella, which are long             slender cellular extensions containing a highly organized system of             microtubules and other proteins which are specialized for this                  purpose.  Flagella (and their homologous shorter structures, cilia)             are the cellular organelles responsible for swimming motility (and              the movement of a cell's aqueous environment around the cell) in a              broad variety of eukaryotic cell types, ranging from the  Protists              (unicellular organisms) to human cells (e.g., spermatozoa and                   pulmonary airway epithelia).  As such, a detailed understanding of              how flagella function at the molecular level is of fundamental                  importance to biology.  In addition, these remarkable inventions of             nature are of great interest in terms of potential commercial                   applications, either as biomolecular materials whose properties can             be harnessed through biofabrication, or as model systems for                    biomimetic reverse engineering and nanofabrication.  This project               will advance our understanding of the motor molecules of flagella,              through a combined approach using genetics, biochemistry, and                   morphological analysis in a well-defined and highly tractable model             system.",
