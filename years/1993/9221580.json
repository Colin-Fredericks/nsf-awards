 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ilan Benjamin is supported by a grant from the Theoretical                  and Computational Chemistry Program to perform theoretical                      studies of transport, adsorption, and chemical reactions which                  occur at liquid-vapor interfaces.  He is using molecular                        dynamics simulations to gain insight into the solvation free                    energy and adsorption which takes place at the water                            liquid-vapor interface, and the effect which this interface has                 on the equilibrium constant and free energy of activation for                   various chemical processes such as isomerization equilibrium,                   unimolecular decomposition and electron transfer.  He is                        developing new methodologies for performing such simulations                    which include treating the long range coulombic forces by a                     combination of Ewald summation and reaction field techniques.                   %%%                                                                             One of the most challenging and important problems in chemistry                 is to understand at the molecular level the effect of the                       medium on chemical reactions which occur at the interfacial                     region bewtween different phases.  Recent advances in very fast                 time-resolved spectroscopic techniques are yielding new data on                 solvent effects on dynamical processes in bulk solution and at                  interfaces.  The theoretical research being performed by Dr.                    Benjamin employs computer simulations based on molecular models                 to gain a deeper molecular level understanding of the physical                  and chemical processes which take place at the liquid-vapor                     interface.",
