 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307812  Schultz    This grant supports U.S.-Bulgaria joint cooperative research on \"Microfibrillar-Reinforce  Polycondensate Blends\" between Dr. Jerold M. Schultz of the University of Delaware and  Dr. Stoyko Fakirov of the Laboratory on Structure and Properties of Polymers, Sofia  University, Bulgaria.  Previously, the researchers showed that incompatible polycondensate  blends of unusually high uniaxial mechanical properties can be produced through a three-  stage process: (1) uniaxial cold-drawing; (2) heat-treatment above the melting or softening  temperature of the discontinuous phase; and (3) continued heat-treatment in a temperature  range consistent with solid-state exchange reaction.  Indications are that fibrillar crystals or  glass are formed in the first stage, and the \"matrix\" is relaxed in the second.  The most  unusual stage is the third, where the fibril/matrix interface appears to be compatibilized  through an exchange reaction.  With this grant, the preceding process will be further studied,  to characterize and test all phases of the suggested structure development.  Kinetic studies of  interfacial exchange reactions in model incompatible systems will be followed by  spectroscopic and other means.  The researchers will examine the microfibrillar  microstructural hypothesis using transmission electron microscope methods developed  recently in their laboratory and also by small-angle x-ray scattering.  They will follow  changes in chain orientations with processing time and temperature, using infrared  dichronism.  They will measure mechanical properties of selected materials and fit them to  models they developed using microstructural characterizations.    This research in materials science fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by  enabling leading experts in the U.S. and Bulgaria to combine complementary talents and pool  research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
