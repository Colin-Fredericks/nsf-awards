 "awd_abstract_narration": "Government and commercial organizations that design and                         manufacture state-of-the-art electronic systems are well                        acquainted with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)                             difficulties. Circuits and systems are requiring wider                          bandwidths, must operate at lower power levels, and are more                    compact. These trends render them susceptible to interference                   from numerous sources. Designing and implementing electronic                    systems that function correctly in a complex electrical                         environment, as well as meeting government emissions                            regulations, requires engineers that have a sound knowledge of                  electromagnetic field concepts. This project  introduces                        laboratory exercises based on industrial EMC applications into                  three undergraduate electromagnetics courses. Experiments                       illustrate such common problems as crosstalk, electrostatic                     discharge., circuit radiation, and RF susceptibility. These                     experiments reinforce fundamental principles and topics covered                 in the undergraduate electromagnetics courses, including                        electric and magnetic fields, inductance, capacitance, wave                     propagation, transmission lines, and radiation. The laboratory                  exercises are designed to: 1) stimulate creativity and motivate                 students at the introductory level to learn electromagnetic                     field fundamentals, while providing them with invaluable                        practical experience in EMC applications; 2) allow students in                  a junior/senior level EMC elective course to pursue in-depth                    lecture and laboratory EMC studies; and 3) provide facilities                   for students to pursue independent senior design and honors                     student projects in electromagnetic compatibility. The                          experience gained in applying electromagnetic field concepts to                 EMC are essential to the practicing engineer for meeting the                    design challenges associated with faster electronic                             technologies and strict government regulations on emission of                   electromagnetic energy.",
