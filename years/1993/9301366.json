 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large number of univariate distributions that have been thoroughly studied  sometimes have been developed for use in statistical analyses of data; other  distribution arise from natural probabilistic or physical considerations, from  statistical properties or as limiting distributions.  Most of the well-known  distributions arise in more than one way.  Although univariate distributions provide information about individual  measurements, they cannot facilitate studies of relationships between  measurements.  In many situations in the physical, biological, economic sciences  it is just these relationships that are of interest, for which multivariate  distributions are required.  The goal of this proposal is to contribute to the understanding of multivariate  versions of the well-known univariate theory.  This subject is particularly  timely because recent increases in computational and computer graphics  capabilities have made the use of multivariate distributions much more broadly  practical.  Multivariate models are now particularly understood in terms of  underlying structures that unite many multivariate families into cohesive units.   Meaningful derivations of multivariate distributions can shed light on which  models to use in different applications.  A consequence of this research is that  flexible models useful in describing multivariate data will become available.",
