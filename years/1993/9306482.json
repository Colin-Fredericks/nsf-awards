 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the mechanism of bacterial infection of                      susceptible plants.  Integration of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens               T-DNA into the plant genome results in characteristic pathology.                Bacterial infection involves transfer of T-DNA and some proteins                from the bacterium to the plant.  T-DNA and virE2 protein transfer              is mediated by proteins which are products of the bacterium virB                operon.  Studies planned are aimed at:  (1) characterizing the                  behavior of the virB proteins, particularly the possible formation              of membrane-associated aggregates.  Cross-linking approaches will               be employed.  The expression stoichiometries of the virB proteins               will be examined.  The roles of individual virB proteins in the                 transport process will be evaluated via mutations of individual                 virB genes.  (2) The transport mechanism itself will be examined                through use of chemically modified or mutagenically modified virE2              protein, which may interfere with the transport mechanism.                      %%%                                                                             Plant pathogens play an important role in the dynamics of the                   planetary biomass.  More specifically, these pathogens affect                   ornamental as well as agriculturally important species.  Therefore,             beyond the intrinsic interest in the assembly of a complex system               to transfer genetic information from the bacterium to the plant,                the characterization of the infection process may lead to                       development of selective intervention strategies with economic and              environmentally positive consequences.  The studies planned utilize             biochemical and genetic approaches to characterize the mechanisms               by which bacteria infect susceptible plants.",
