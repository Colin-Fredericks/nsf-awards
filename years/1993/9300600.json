 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Biology Department of                          Furman University to continue a successful Research                             Experiences for Undergraduates Site.                                                                                                                            The program will provide a stimulating biological research                      experience for 12 students this coming summer.  Talented                        students will be recruited from Furman University and                           smaller, less research-oriented colleges in South Carolina.                     The program is especially aimed at women, minority students,                    and persons with disabilities, and such individuals will                        make up the majority of the participants.  Half the students                    will be rising seniors and half will be rising sophomores.                      Six research groups will be formed, each consisting of a                        senior, a sophomore, and a faculty research director.                           Students many choose to work on research projects in areas                      ranging from ecology to molecular biology.  The goal of this                    program is to support productive, publishable research                          involving undergraduates, with a special focus on promising                     younger students.  The program builds on a strong tradition                     of undergraduate research in a liberal arts environment at                      Furman, and a successful NSF-REU program over the past two                      summers.",
