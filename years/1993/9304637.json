The structural study proposed is fundamental to  achieve a detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which the  multienzyme complex catalyzes cleavage of the acetyl-CoA acetate  carbon-carbon bond.  The specific objectives of this study follow.   1) Establish the molecular mass, subunit structure, and overall  symmetry of the protein complex by physical methods of dynamic  light scattering, electron microscopy, rate zonal  ultracentrifugation and gel filtration.  2) Identify the subunit  that specifically binds the corrinoid (vitamin B12-like) cofactor  used for methyl-group transfer during acetyl-CoA cleavage.   Minimally disruptive methods will be used, followed by  chromatography, to obtain the single subunit, or protein component,  that binds the corrinoid cofactor. 3) Identify the component that  binds tetrahydro-sarcinapterin.  This component will be purified  from chromatographic fractions of the disrupted protein complex and  identified as the enzyme that catalyzes methyl group transfer  between methyl-corrinoid and tetrahydro-sarcinapterin. 4) Obtain  additional information about nearest-neighbor relationships among  subunit types from chemical cross-linking experiments on the intact  complex.  A major outcome of the research will be to develop a  three-dimensional model of the complex.  The overall structure will  display the corrinoid and the tetrahydro-sarcinapterin-binding  subunits placed in approximate relative position to one another and  to all other subunits of the complex.  %%%  Microbial conversion processes involving both the production and  the consumption of acetic acid in nature are biological reactions  of major importance.  It is estimated that in nature 1010 metric  tons of acetic acid are produced per year.  Subsequent conversion  of acetic acid to gase ous products as carbon dioxide and methane  occurs in both natural ecosystems and in systems created by man for  waste treatment and biomass conversion.  In conversion of acetic  acid to methane and carbon dioxide, the methanogenic bacterium,  Methanosarcina barkeri is very important.  This research is  designed to learn how a multienzyme structure responsible for  acetic acid metabolism in M. barkeri works at the molecular level.   Physical, biochemical, and immunological methods are used to  determine the arrangement of protein subunits and certain organic  cofactor binding sites within the architecture of the protein  complex.  The structural details provided from this research will  provide fundamental information needed for a complete understanding  of the molecular mechanism of acetate cleavage.  ***",
