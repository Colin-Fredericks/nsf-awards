 "awd_abstract_narration": "Characterizing the particle size distribution, concentration,                   and temperature within an aerosol reactor is essential to the                   proper understanding and control of the process.  Phase I                       research has demonstrated a novel Fourier transform infrared                    (FT-IR) emission/transmission (E/T) techniques to address the                   above problems for the synthesis of TiO  particles.  TiO                        particles strongly absorb at wavenumbers less than 1000/cm,                     and thus the measured extinction is directly proportional to                    the particle mass.  In contrast, extinction above 1000/cm is                    due to scattering and is a strong function of the particle                      size distribution.  Using Mie theory, one can deconvolute                       extinction spectra to estimate the geometric mean diameter                      within 10% of its actual value.  In addition to particle mass                   and size, E/T FT-IR can also simultaneously measure particle                    temperature as well as gas concentrations and temperature.                                                                                                      This Phase II project will develop an instrument for on-line                    in- situ analysis of submicron sized particles.  This research                  will (1) develop improvements to the FT-IR and procedures to                    optimize the acquisition of transmission and emission data,                     (2) improve and extend the theory relating measured                             transmission spectra to particle size, (3) evaluate the                         instrument and analysis software by comparing the IR                            deconvolution to other particle sizing techniques, and (4)                      field test the instrument and software on a commercial TiO2                     production facility.  This proposal combines the expertise of                   three key organizations:  (1) Advanced Fuel Research provides                   its extensive knowledge of FT-IR technology; (2) Prof. Hemant                   Pendse (University of Maine) is an expert in the deconvolution                  of particle size distributions from attenuation spectra; and                    (3) Prof. Sotiris Pratsinis (University of Cincinnati) will                     evaluate the FT-IR results and compare them to conventional                     particle sizing techniques.                                                                                                                                     The above instrument will perform size measurements of                          aerosols as well as measuring particle mass, particle                           temperature, gas composition, and gas temperature.  The                         instrument will be rugged, user friendly, portable, and                         relatively inexpensive.  The applications for such an                           instrument include the synthesis of catalyst supports,                          sinterable ceramics, metal particles, optical materials, and                    electronic materials.",
