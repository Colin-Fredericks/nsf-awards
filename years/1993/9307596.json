 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is concerned with the study of index reduction                   formulas for central simple algebras on passage to the function                 field of a projective variety.  The type of variety under                       consideration is a twisted form of G/P where G is a split                       reductive algebraic group and P is a parabolic subgroup of G.                   The index reduction formula will follow from a knowledge of the                 Grothendieck group of the variety of interest, which has been                   computed in general only when G is connected.  The principal                    investigator will investigate the Grothendieck group of the                     twisted forms of G/P when G is not connected, where it is clear                 from examples that some new phenomena not seen in the connected                 case will arise. The principal investigator will also study                     central simple algebras with involution, and the associated                     generalized even Clifford algebras.                                                  This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring               is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                            multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                  satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                  not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                          multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                      matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                  has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing               significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.",
