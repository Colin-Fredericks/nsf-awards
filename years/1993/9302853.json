 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Geoffrey Clark, Ms. Jane Peterson will               collect data for her doctoral dissertation. The goal of her project             is to determine how social organization changed in the Near East                over the period from ca. 15,000 to 6,000 years ago. During this                 time plants and animals were first domesticated and thus Ms.                    Peterson is attempting to relate changing social systems to a                   changing subsistence base. To accomplish this goal she will study               three classes of data. First she will examine materials and site                plans from a series of archaeological excavations. She will look at             the patterning of activities as revealed by structures and                      artifacts on the ground and relate these to gender specific work.               Secondly, she will take advantage of cultural data associated with              human burials. With this information, she can attempt to relate the             type and number of material remains to age and sex as revealed in               skeletal materials. Finally she will analyze skeletons themselves.              Bone responds to repeated stress and therefore those muscles which              receive heavy use can be determined by examining them for increased             thickness and growth at attachment regions. With this approach it               is possible to reconstruct specific activities and relate them to               gender and age.                                                                                                                                                 A central goal of archaeology is to understand how complex social               systems develop. A major shift in both human subsistence and social             organization occurred with the domestication of plants and animals              and their incorporation into the human diet. Closely related to                 this are gross changes in patterns of social organization for with              domestication sites become larger and many new traits such as                   pottery appear. While archaeologists know a great deal about the                subsistence part of the equation, they do not understand on a                   detailed level how social organization was altered. The work by Ms.             Peterson will provide new insight into this question.                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons. It will synthesize              a large and diverse body of data. It will shed new light on the                 origins of complex society and will assist in the training of a                 promising young scientist.",
