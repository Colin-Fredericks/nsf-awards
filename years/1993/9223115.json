Trainor of                                the University of Connecticut and Dr. Frantisek                                 Hindak of the Institute of Botany, Bratislava.                                  The reseachers' work will focus on the phenotypic                               variability and plasticity of this well-known                                   group of freshwater planktonic algae.  Numerous                                 recent laboratory studies of several species of                                 SCENEDESMUS confirm that phenotypic plasticity is                               common within the genus; some species are far                                   more plastic than others.  In their efforts Drs.                                Trainor and Hindak will work with both light                                    microscope (LM) and ultrastructural features                                    (EM).  First, they will complete analysis of the                                full range of plasticity in S. ARMATUS.  They                                   then intend to propose an amended species                                       description with which one could identify the                                   species in the field relying on an ecomorph or                                  two.  Studies with additional species (e.g., S.                                 COMMUNIS, S. MAXIMUS. S. ABUNDANS, and S.                                       OBLIQUUS) would follow.  Simultaneously, they                                   hope to confirm plasticity in EM features and                                   hypothesize that they can place the individual                                  wall ultrastructural features in an ordered                                     sequence of development.  Results will contribute                               to our knowledge of fundamental aspects of                                      morphological plasticity in phytoplankton and are                               expected to advance the fields of algal                                         systematics and freshwater ecology.
