 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is in the area of ``machine learning,`  with  an emphasis on the development of efficient algorithms of both  practical  and theoretical interest.  The problems investigated include:  (a) learning in the presence of noise  (searching for   learning linear-threshold and parity functions in    the presence of classification noise, and `hypothesis  boosting` is possible in the presence of classification noise);   (b) exploration with obstacles   (developing efficient algorithms for  exploring planar regions  with obstacles and/or planar graphs, with a view towards integrating these  algorithms in larger  navigation systems);   (c) coordinating experts/feature  selection  (developing effective methods of combining the advice of a  variety  of experts/features for a given problem);   (d) autonomous learning of causal  structures (exploring how active learning can  effectively learn a complex  environment, such as a Macintosh  window system);   (e) new models of active learning  (refining the  understanding of the power and limitations of `membership  queries` for learning); (f) learning and biology (looking at a    variety of inference problems motivated by problems in   molecular biology); and (g) teaching in different  learning models (focusing on  algorithms for `effective teaching`).",
