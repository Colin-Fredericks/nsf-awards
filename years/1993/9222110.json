 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental study at University of California, Berkeley                     (UCB), spanning three years, has led to the development of a                    Slotted Bolted Connection (SBC), which under cyclic                             rectilinear loading exhibits almost ideal elastic-perfectly-                    plastic behavior.  This arrangement has provided a cost                         effective, predictable and reliable energy dissipator with                      possible applications beyond the originally intended area of                    seismic design and retrofit.  Analytical studies have shown                     that structures equipped with SBCs perform very well under                      violent earthquake excitations.  Preparations for shake                         table tests of a three story frame at Richmond facility are                     currently in progress.  It is expected that the results of                      these tests will further affirm the significant utility of                      SBCs in earthquake hazard mitigation.  However, it is felt                      that in order to bring this project to full fruition, that                      is to attain confident acceptance and application by                            industry of SBCs, a number of additional tests of SBCs with                     bolt sizes other than the 1/2 inch diameter for which                           results already exist, and variations in other design                           parameters must be conducted.                                                                                                                                   In this project, additional connections with different bolt                     sized, bolt spacing and connection plate sized will be                          tested on the existing test facility to obtain more                             information of practical importance for utilization of these                    connections in steel structures.",
