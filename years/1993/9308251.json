This class of device represents the enabling technology for the realization of interconnects, neural networks, image processing and other forms of parallel optical computing.  This proposal discusses the use of a         ?       Si:H/a Si   x   C   1 x   :H multilayers as optical modulators which are compatible with Si VLSI and can therefore be integrated with sophisticated processing electronics to yield smart SLMs offering visible wavelength operation, high speed, broad functionality and simple, inexpensive fabrication requirements.  Initial efforts have produced evidence that bound state quantization will occur in amorphous semiconductor material system will be investigated.  High quality constituent materials and interfaces will be produced.  Through sample deposition and characterization fabrication parameters will be optimized.  Second, multilayer structures will be fabricated to optimize modulator characteristics.  This component involves characterization of MQW samples so that quantization effects and in particular the effects of band tail states, may be analyzed.  Third, techniques will be developed to integrate these modulators with CMOS VLSI.  This last component will focus on experim ental techniques necessary to fabricate amorphous semiconductor modulators on existing CMOS electronic circuits and will make use of the MOSIS facility to provide VLSI addressing circuits.",
