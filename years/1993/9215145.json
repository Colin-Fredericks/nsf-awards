Visualization approaches for analysis and display of these datasets are currently inadequate, in particular when dealing with tensor data.  The project addresses the need for better understanding of these datasets by investigating an integrated approach based on the triad of enabling technologies of feature extraction, data compression, and immersive environments.      Three-dimensional datasets of increased complexity: tensor data and time-dependent fields will be displayed and analyzed.  Most of the research effort is aimed at understanding the dynamical properties of physical systems that give rise to these large multivariate datasets.  Therefore, techniques used for visualizing steady fields must be extended in order to visualize time-dependent data.  Time-dependent data may be handled by animation of the individual time steps.  Processing time for animations, however, are notoriously long.  Therefore, data compression is being investigated at several stages of the integrated visualization process.  In the analysis component, data compression of tensor fields is based on extracting and displaying hyperparticle paths using tensor field topology.  In the display component, time-dependent fields may be analyzed and displayed using advanced data compression techniques such as vector clustering and 4-D transforms.  Finally, the results of these analysis are displayed with tools from immersive environments, data compression  techniques applied to rendering approaches, and other new technologies.  ***   v       s  t             @ j <  l  WINMINE HLP           @ j J  1  WINTUTORDAT           @ j j     WRITE   HLP           @ j   k   CALC    EXE           @ j   @   CALC    HLP           @ j    F  CALENDARHLP           @ j    P  CANYON  MID           @ j       CHITZ   BMP           @ j \u0131  M  DING    WAV           @ j   N-  9215145  Hesselink  Both experimental and numerical techniques are becoming more sophisticated leading towards very large multiv    <   K                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           7   <                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              $         $         $                                (                  F                    /                                                                                                          <                         K         <     /  1 Courier    Symbol  & Arial  5 Courier New                       Z             \"             h     lc  lc        r   (             S   R:\\WW20USER\\ABSTRACT.DOT abstract    Alicia E.
