 "awd_abstract_narration": "Midwestern streams are dominated by complex algal                               growth during much of the year.  Interactions among                             predators, grazing minnows and crayfish could strongly                          affect this algal structure.  Interactions between                              grazers and their shared predator may influence algal                           habitat structure and furthermore have cascading                                effects on other stream-fish interactions with                                  important consequences for community structure.  This                           study will focus on such effects and possible                                   behavioral mechanisms.  Surveys throughout Oklahoma                             will test the generality and strength of relationships                          among the algivorous minnow Campostoma anomalum,                                crayfish, their shared predators, algal standing crop,                          abiotic habitat variables and various aspects of                                stream-fish community structure.  Manipulative                                  experiments will isolate abiotic and biotic variables                           that affect interactions among two grazers (C.                                  anomalum and crayfish), their shared predator (bass)                            and algal structure.  Further experiments will study                            the affects of algal structure on interactions among                            two invertivorous fishes and their shared predator                              (bass).",
