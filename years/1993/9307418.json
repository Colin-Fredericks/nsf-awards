The researchers seek to   establish a link between the structure and properties of more general,  asymmetrical boundaries, and the relationships between structures of different   boundaries.  Establishing a link between the structure and properties of rather  special, short period boundaries and boundaries of general nature is of   principal importance for extension of the present atomistic studies of   boundary properties.  The researchers will also study the nucleation  of new three-dimensional phases at grain boundaries and dynamic processes  taking place at grain boundaries.  In the process, they will assess the stability  of the corresponding structures using the concept of atomic level elastic  moduli, advanced earlier in Prof. Vitek's research supported by NSF.    Results are expected to contribute to our knowledge of non-symmetric grain  boundary structures, which can effect the structure and properties of metallic  and ceramic materials.  This project in materials research fulfills the program  objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents and pool   resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
