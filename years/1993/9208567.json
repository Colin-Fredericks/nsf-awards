 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high level of process automation is a key to the safe,                        efficient, and competitive manufacture of high quality                          materials.  A common focus of control research is the                           development of new technologies to build highly autonomous                      chemical processes; autonomous in the sense that they can                       function with a reduced level of operator intervention.                                                                                                         The main issues to be dealt with in this research project are                   the integration of control and fault diagnosis to realize                       fault tolerant control systems, making effective use of                         process information, and developing a coherent theoretical                      approach to discrete process operations.  The work will                         consist of three specific studies on new, fundamental                           approaches to process monitoring: (1) the integration of                        multivariable control and fault detection in L1/l  using a                      four parameter controller; (2) a study of the application of                    multiresolution techniques for signal processing (wavelets) to                  process monitoring and control; and (3) the development of a                    novel hybrid continuous/discrete-event model for process fault                  detection and diagnosis.  The study goals include the                           development of new theoretical approaches to these problems.                    Significant effort will be devoted to the development of                        effective computational procedures.  Cooperation with active                    industrial research groups will foster the transfer of the                      technology to industrial practice.",
