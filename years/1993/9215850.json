The research activity is focused on                                       Antarctic climatic history and will involve                                     close interaction with a team of Australian                                     investigators under the direction of                                            Dr. Patrick Quilty, the Assistant Director of                                   Science of the Australian Antarctic Division.                                   The Australian team includes Dr. Robert Hill                                    and Dr. Andrew McMinn from the University of                                    Tasmania and Dr. Barrie McKelvey from the                                       University of New England located in Armidale,                                  New South Wales.                                                                                                                                                New evidence from studies of geological                                         deposits on the Antarctic continent points to a                                 major collapse of the East Antarctic Ice                                        Sheet during the middle Miocene and                                             significantly warmer marine and terrestrial                                     temperatures during the early to mid-Pliocene                                   (~4.5 to 2.5 million years ago). The survival                                   of terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica during                                  this period suggests that earlier glaciations                                   were not as cold as today. The research will                                    continue the U.S.-Australia cooperative study                                   of these significant terrestrial and marine                                     deposits and will address various features of                                   the environment and life in Antarctica during                                   this period of deglacial warmth. The research                                   will contribute critical southern high-latitude                                 data to an international research effort toward                                 a better understanding and modeling of Earth                                    under a warmer climate regime. Specifically the                                 proposed research will produce and apply                                        paleobiological information to paleoclimatic                                    interpretations, will document the last                                         survivors of Antarctic marine and terrestrial                                   biotas, and will continue to develop                                            microfossils, particularly marine diatoms, as                                   tools for geologic age dating and                                               paleoenvironmental reconstructions in the                                       Antarctic.",
