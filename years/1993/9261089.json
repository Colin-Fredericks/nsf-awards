 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computational design tool will be developed which will                   allow for optimal tolerance allocation for mechanical and                       electrical components.  The basic approach is to couple a                       nontraditional optimization method with a Monte Carlo based                     tolerance analysis code.  The ability to allocate tolerances in an              optimal fashion will allow an installed capital base to be utilized             in the most productive fashion.  A successful application of the                technique will have a dramatic impact on reducing manufacturing                 cost and product cycle times as well as increasing productivity,                quality and customer satisfaction.                                                   Current tolerance analysis used in industry does not provide               the ability to allocate tolerances in an optimal fashion.                       Traditional nonlinear programming methods are not robust enough to              solve the complex problem resulting from the consideration of a                 \"real\" component or assembly.  The combination of the genetic                   algorithm with a tolerance analysis package offers an attractive                alternative which will run efficiently on a parallel or distributed             computing network.  Initial consideration will be placed on                     discrete tolerance limit optimization. The applicability to                     modifying nominal dimensions and assembly sequence will also be                 investigated.",
