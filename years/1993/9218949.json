 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the continuation of an observational and numerical              study of the surface wind field of the Siple Coast, Antarctica.                 the antarctic surface wind field is highly irregular, is strongly               affected by the surface slope, and has marked areas of convergence              and divergence inland from the coastal margins.  the interior                   provides large reservoirs of cold, negatively buoyant air which                 produce a persistent katabatic wind system.  These convergent                   features appear to dominate the antarctic surface climate regime.                                                                                               This current phase of the project is based on observations made in              the confluence zone upslope from the Siple Coast, which offers a                different dynamical setting from earlier experiments in the Terra               Nova Bay region of East Antarctica.  In addition, the lower average             elevation of West Antarctica allows synoptic disturbances to                    penetrate more deeply into the interior and to affect the surface               outflow.  Specific tasks to be undertaken are to complete the                   analysis as the comprehensive data set collected under the previous             grant, and to analyze the behavior of the katabatic winds over West             Antarctica, as well as identifying how the observed changes are                 forced by the synoptic circulation.  Numerical simulations using                several mesoscale models will provide the integrating picture of                the governing dynamics.",
