 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305554  Sheridan    Recent studies have indicated the existence of multiple forms of  somatostatin, a peptide originally isolated from the brain and  found to contain 14-amino acid (from gene I) and to inhibit  growth hormone secretion, but subsequently found to be located in  the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract and elsewhere of many  vertebrates. The special significance of multiple forms (14-amino  acid forms and N-terminally extended forms) of somatostatins, and  the roles of these factors in regulation of lipid metabolism,  have yet to be determined. With the proposed work, Dr. Sheridan  seeks to evaluate the role of somatostatins in the coordination  of lipid metabolism in fish. Fish offer a unique system for the  study of  these questions because of their evolutionary position,  diversified lipid storage strategy (partitioning of lipid  reserves among several depots: mesenteric fat, liver and dark  muscle), and segregated endocrine pancreas (Brockman body)  possessing abundant amounts of N-terminally extended somatostatin  (somatostatin-25; from gene II). He will demonstrate for the  first time the differential effects of gene I and gene II  somatostatins on lipid metabolism. This analysis will demonstrate  important interactions among the various pancreatic hormones  (e.g., somatostatins, insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide)  and evaluate the direct effects, including cellular mode of  action, of somatostatins on hepatic lipolysis. He also will  evaluate for the first time the binding of somatostatin to liver,  a major lipid depot of fish, and examine alterations in  somatostatin binding characteristic (affinity, capacity) in  response to nutrient (glucose) and hormonal (INS, GLU) treatment.  While pertaining specifically to fish, this research will provide  novel information concerning somatostatin phsyiology generally.  These results will contribute significantly to the basic  understanding of  hormonal control of hepatic lipid metabolism  and provide important insight into the  evolution of lipid  metabolism control schemes.  ***",
