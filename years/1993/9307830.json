 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partitioning of large designs into smaller and more manageable                  parts is a very important design task.  In high-level synthesis of              register-transfer level designs, partitioning the specification is              done prior to synthesizing the designs.  If the input specification             is control-dominated, the specification is partitioned into a set               of states, or if the specification is data-dominated then it is                 partitioned into a set of graphs.  In either case, the sets of the              partition are synthesized independently and the complete design                 assembled together.  This research re-examines the partitioning                 problem, outlines some concerns with existing techniques and                    presents a fresh approach to formulating and solving the                        partitioning problem.                                                                                                                                           Specifically, the effort focuses on a data-path model which can be              used for rapid-prototyping at the register-transfer level design                and for partitioning of the input specification.  The solution to               these problems is achieved by scheduling the input specificiation               onto the data-path model.  The scheduling result can then be                    interpreted from a rapid-prototyping perspective or from a                      partitioning perspective as desired by the designer.  This method               will handle several new constraints such as communication and                   memory/register bank constraints, integrate floor planning with                 high-level design tools, and will accept a more complete input                  specification including loops and conditional branches.  Our method             will allow the designer to make tradeoffs which were hitherto not               possible.  An example is tradeoffs between communication overheads              and performance of the design.",
