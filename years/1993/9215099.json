 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Peter Phillips of the Cowles                      Foundation for Research in Economics, Yale University, to                       collaborate with Professor Werner Ploberger of the                              Institute of Econometrics and Operations Research of the                        Technical University of Vienna in Austria.  They plan to                        work jointly on several lines of research in econometrics.                      First, they will carry out asymptotic analysis of Bayesian                      methods for possibly non-stationary time series.  Also,                         they will develop generalized Bayes model selection                             criteria with specific reference to problems of order                           selection in parametric methods.  In addition, they intend                      to write computer software to implement the methods they                        develop and to apply them to macroeconomic data sets for                        the USA, Austria, and several other countries.                                                                                                                  Scientific interest in Bayesian methods has grown sharply                       over recent years and has affected many different fields of                     statistics and econometrics.  Many econometricians find the                     Bayesian approach particularly well-suited to problems of                       time series analysis and inference in econometrics, two                         areas being explored in the collaboration of Drs. Phillips                      and Ploberger.  Some of their research will contribute to                       improved modelling of economic time series.  The other                          project they are engaged has an important application in                        the development of hypothesis tests under data-based model                      selection principles.  Some hypotheses of considerable                          interest in economics, like that of the presence of an                          autoregressive unit root, remain invariant across different                     models.  These investigators plan to exploit this                               invariance so that their \"Bayes model\" criteria can be used                     to select a system to conduct an explicit test of the unit                      root hypothesis.",
