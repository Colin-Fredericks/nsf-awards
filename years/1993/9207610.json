The contiunous flow nutrient analyzer                        would rapidly and automatically determine the concentrations                    of at least five compounds. The high-resolution data set                        which can be produced is essential for examining questions                      about the controls of marine biological production, the                         exchange between land and estuarine ecosystems, and the                         utilization of nutrients in controlled laboratory                               experiments. The requested instrumentation would be used by                     a majority of the faculty at the Lewes Campus of the College                    of Marine Studies (CMS).  The Lewes Campus, which houses the                    only marine biological laboratories in Delaware, has 22                         faculty and 56 graduate students, and is a NSF supported                        Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site. The Lewes                    Campus has grown in size and prominence (onc: member was                        elected to the National Academy of  Science) over the last                      five years. In recognition of this growth, the University of                    Delaware is constructing a new building for Biogeochemistry                     that will house the requested instrumentation.",
