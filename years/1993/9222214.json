 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is the U.S. side of a U.S.-Russia Cooperative                     proposal simultaneously submitted together with Dr. Pavel Balaban               of the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology                 in Moscow.  The proposal is directed at several questions about                 the organization of a serotonergic neuromodulatory system in the                gastropod mollusc, Helix aspersa.  These questions have recently                become approachable with the advent of voltage-sensitive dye                    recording methods that can simultaneously monitor the action                    potential activity of several hundred neurons in these ganglia.                 In this first grant period we hope to answer the following:  How                uniform is the group of serotonergic neurons in their response to               touch and to noxious stimuli?  How much synaptic interconnection                is there among these serotonergic cells?  Is the response of                    these cells sensitive to the satiation state of the animal?  Are                there fundamental differences from animal-to-animal in the                      functioning of the modulatory neurons?  How does the function of                this group change during habitualtion and sensitization?  The                   answers to these questions would provide specific information                   about neuromodulation  in the Helix nervous system but will also                be more general significance.  These experiments will be the                    first attempt to obtain physiological data on the functional                    cohesiveness of a group of apparently similar neruons.  Further,                some of the results from Helix will test the generality of                      conclusions about consistency in nervous systems obtained from                  experiments on the Aplysia abdominal ganglion.***//",
