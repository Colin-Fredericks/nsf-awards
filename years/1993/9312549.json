 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312549  Abbott    This three-year continuing award is under the \"Self-Sufficient  Partnership for Research\" Program. It supports basic research to  augment the research agenda of North Carolina State University's  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Communications  and Signal Processing.  The Center continues to meet the renewal  criteria requirements of the I/UCRC Program.    Funding for a three-year continuing award for an evaluator to study  the industry/university interaction occurring in the Center is also  provided.    The U.S. Army (AMSEL) is providing funding to augment ongoing  research projects and to obtain a membership in the Center.    Additional funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy's  Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Office to obtain a  non-voting membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends North Carolina State University be:  awarded $58,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award  (includes $8,000 for an evaluator); $50,000 for one year with funds  provided by the U.S. Army (AMSEL); and $10,000 for one year with  funds provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent  to which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which  a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
