 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                   between Professor Eugene C. Loh of the University of Utah and                   Professor Motohiko Nagano of the University of Tokyo.  Together                 the investigators will attempt to develop a very high resolution                camera that can be used as the light signal detector in a high                  energy cosmic ray detector and perform a number of studies                      related to the design of a very large cosmic ray detector.                                                                                                      The Japanese group under the direction of Professor Nagano                      operates the world's largest surface detectors, called AGASA,                   designed to detect electrons, muons, and gamma rays.  The U.S.                  group operates the world's only nitrogen scintillation detector                 called the Fly's Eye Detector.  Topics of mutual interest to the                two groups include measurements of the cosmic ray energy                        spectrum, chemical composition, and anisotropy.  The common goal                is to discover where and how these extremely energetic particles                are accelerated.  The search for point sources of neutral                       particles is a high priority for both groups.  In addition to the               principal investigator, five other scientists and technicians                   specializing in electronics, calibration, analysis, and computer                modelling will participate in the project.",
