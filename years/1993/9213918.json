 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the full incorporation of a larger                  class of swept surfaces for machining, robot motion, and other                  applications.  The full incorporation of swept surfaces into                    solid models requires concentration on surface intersection                     and Boolean operations on solids involving swept surfaces.                      The development of a powerful tool for the analysis of swept                    surfaces for machining and other applications demands related                   work on interference detection, volume, representational                        issues, and sweep generation.                                                                                                                                   One of the fundamental primitives in solid modeling is the                      swept surface.  A swept surface is characterized by the type                    of sweep (i.e., the way the position and orientation of the                     cross-section changes), the cross-section that is being swept,                  and the ability of this cross-section to change shape.  The                     literature and solid modeling systems are dominated by the                      consideration of sweep surfaces generated by translational or                   revolute sweeps, and rigid sweeps (the cross-section does not                   change shape).  This project will investigate arbitrary                         sweeping of nonrigid objects, about which there is less                         literature and little algorithmic development.  In order to                     make the problem tractable, the study will be restricted to                     simple cross-sections.  Thus, the project will concentrate on                   the sweeping of lines and circles, although much of the theory                  applies to other simple cross-sections as well.  The                            superellipse cross-section will also be studied.",
