This discovery was an  important scientific breakthrough, because of its potential technological implications. It also raises the  fundamental question of light emitting mechanism. Despite the still obscure understanding of porous Si,     another Si related compound, siloxene, was found to be porous Si like with visible light emission  characteristics.    This proposed project is based on the current research activity on porous Si, siloxene and  siloxene thin films in our laboratory.    We propose to develop new thin film deposition schemes for  siloxene thin films and the related light emitting device (LED) structures.    The advantage of developing  such thin films is to    avoid the limitation from the current electrochemical anodization method with porous     Si. Ultimately, the LED structure based on the siloxene thin film could be implemented to the large scale  flat panel display. ***",
