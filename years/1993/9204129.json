 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop and test methods by which existing               domain knowledge can be combined with large amounts of training                 data to yield high-performance classification systems.  The                     successful development of such methods would address fundamental                questions in machine learning and solve critical applications                   problems in science and engineering.  In particular, the methods                will be developed and tested in the domain of ecosystem modelling,              where they may be able to provide more reliable estimates of the                effect of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) on the                     geographical distribution of plant ecosystems (biomes).  Two                    approaches will be investigated:  (a) a theory-centered approach,               in which a partial theory of plant physiology is refined so that it             can predict biome distribution, and (b) a rule-centered approach in             a standard machine learning algorithm is applied to discover biome              distribution rules.  The rule-centered approach will use the                    partial theory of plant physiology to suggest relevant features and             to rationalize the discovered rules.  Both approaches will entail               the development of new learning methods including (a) constraint                reasoning techniques for the interpretation of data and the                     refinement of the domain theory, (b) constructive induction                     techniques for defining candidate features, and (c) rationalization             techniques for ensuring the consistency of discovered rules with                the domain theory.//",
