The problems to be studied arise in  concrete settings and have the common feature of being extremely  intractable from a computational viewpoint; the focus will be on  building experimentally practical and theoretically sound  algorithms.       The first area of interest concerns capacity expansion  problems in local access networks.  The resulting optimization  problems turn out to be rather intractable from the point of view  of integer programming.  However,  we have recently developed a  fast and accurate heuristic for a variant of this problem used by  Bellcore in its planning;  we plan to extend the analysis and the  heuristic to handle more complex and detailed models.       The second problem area is that of SONET rings.  This is an  emerging field which will be for increasing importance in the near  future, and there are many important optimization problems that  arise in this context (for example, the assignment of capacity to  a given ring sa as to handle traffic requests between the nodes in  the ring).       The last problem area concerns lightwave networks.  A problem  that has received some attention is that of assigning frequencies  to the transmitters and receivers in a network, and then to route  traffic requests in the resulting logical network, sa as to achieve  minimum congestion over all possible frequency assignments and  routings.  This is an extremely intractable optimization problem;   nevertheless, preliminary experience with a special-purpose  algorithm has been encouraging.       The approach for studying these problems will encompass both  the theoretical analysis needed to develop new tools, and ,  building upon successful recent work, the implementation  of  resulting algorithms, with added emphasis on speed and practicality  of the resulting code.  ***",
