 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303980  Bajcsy   This is the first year of a three-year continuing award to support  collaboration of researchers in four U.S. institutions (University  of Pennsylvania, University of Rochester, University of Maryland,  and University of Massachusetts) with their European colleagues  engaged in the ESPRIT-funded research project entitled \"Vision-As-  Process \".  The collaborative objective is to develop a practical  theory of perception control in active vision, while pooling  expertise and avoiding unnecessary duplication of effort.  The  broad areas of concentration are development of novel physical and  computer hardware, conceptual frameworks, and software tools for  integrated vision/robotic systems, which include an actively  controlled binocular camera head and various actuators for  affecting the external world.  The collaboration covers four  subareas: Control of perception in active vision, Interpretation of  dynamic scenes, Robust image and scene measures, and Dynamic gaze  control and image formation.  For each subarea a mailing list for  information exchange will be created, scientific meetings held, and  techniques and associated experiments organized.  Two to three week  partner-to-partner visits will facilitate intense collaboration on  the specific topics.  US Ph.D. students will spend time in EEC  laboratories as part of an exchange agreement.  Both sides will  benefit from a demonstrated real-time active vision system, and  development of a common framework for integration and control  experiments.  Such a system will enlarge the variety of experiments  within the same class of problems and the range of applications in  different domains.  The results will be made widely accessible,  through planned publication of a book on the theoretical and  experimental results, journal papers, and presentations at  conferences.  ***",
