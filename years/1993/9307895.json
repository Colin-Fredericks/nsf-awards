This project develops techniques for compressing concordances of  large, full-text databases.  The practical significance is obvious,  since concordances are huge, consuming as much resources as the  data themselves; yet they are necessary to access the database  efficiently.  But the theoretical implications are also important,  since the highly structured organization of concordances makes them  suitable for modeling.  In this project clustering in concordances  is modeled.  Sequential clustering is important in Information  Retrieval generally: substantive terms tend to occur together in a  document, and documents containing a given term often cluster in a  typical database.  This project develops and evaluates statistical  tests that indicate when clustering is important; identifies  measures of sequential clustering strength; and creates models of  concordance generation recognizing clustering, improving  compression effectiveness.  The models studied include Markov  models and Bayesian learning models.  Sequential clustering is  widespread and the results of this research should have  implications well beyond data compression, for example analyzing  term occurrence to identify content bearing terms for retrieval  purposes.  Thus this project promises direct benefits in improving  our ability to store very large textual databases and, indirectly,  in developing methodology of wider interest.   ***",
