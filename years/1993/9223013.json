 "awd_abstract_narration": "An extremely important set of uncertainties in climate change              theories are those associated with cloud/radiative/thermodynamic/               dynamic interactions.  Among the most troublesome of these                      uncertainties are those associated with the nature of the large-                scale thermodynamics processes leading to the observed complex                  structure of clouds at any given location and time.  Currently,                 climate models generally relate cloud fractions and liquid water                contents to local relative humidity or convection precipitation                 rates.  The formulas used are based on the results of theory and a              few short-term detailed field experiments.  Analyses of global,                 long-term observations are needed to verify these parameterizations             and to test their applicability to regions, seasons or climatic                 eras, which were not directly sampled in the field experiments                       This project will carry out such analyses with the best                    available regularly observed data.  These data will consist of                  satellite derived estimates of fractional cover of seven cloud                  'types' derived from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology              Project, thermodynamics and dynamics variables from the operational             analyses of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather                        Forecasting and standard observations of precipitation form surface             measurements.  In addition to using the previously derived cloud                types, the PI will derive and utilize a new specification of cloud              fraction at standard pressure level. Variations of these parameters             for much of the globe over seasonal and interannual time scales                 will be used to derive new and assess current interrelationships                used in the cloud parameterizations of climate and long-range                   forecast models.",
