 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goals of this proposal are:  1) to determine the                    formation conditions of a Carlin-type gold deposit, and 2)                      to either link or separate in time the Getchell gold system                     and an adjacent 90 Ma granodiorite intrusion and related                        mineralization.  These goals will be accomplished by 1) a                       detailed petrographic and fluid inclusion study of the gold                     system to constrain formation pressures and temperature and                     aqueous fluid chemistry, and 2) a detailed petrographic and                     fluid inclusion study of quartz veins and tungsten skarn                        mineralization related to the granodiorite intrusion, to                        obtain similar constraints.  Fluid inclusions will be                           evaluated by microthermometry and microanalyses including                       Raman spectroscopy, quadrupole mass spectrometry, and ion                       chromatography.  The Getchell system provides a unique                          opportunity to examine, in detail, the physical/chemical                        evolution of a Carlin-type deposit.  Preliminary results                        demonstrate that fluid inclusions present are suitable for                      microthermometry, Raman spectroscopy, and quadrupole mass                       spectrometry.  This study will document the                                     physical/chemical conditions conducive to gold precipitation                    and the relationship between gold mineralization and igneous                    activity in Carlin-type systems.  Results will link or                          separate in time the gold- and intrusion-related                                mineralization and may place important constraints on the                       age of gold mineralization in a Carlin-type deposit.",
