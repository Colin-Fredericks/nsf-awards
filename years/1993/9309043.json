 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309043  Carver  Specification-based development provides a rigorous and  definitive basis for comparing the intended and actual  behavior of a concurrent program.    Nondeterministic behavior of concurrent programs creates the  following problem during testing: when testing P with input X,  a single execution is insufficient to determine the  correctness of P with input X.  Even if P with input X has  been executed successfully many times, it is possible that a  future execution of P with input X will produce an incorrect  result.  To deal with this problem, we force deterministic  executions of P according to given synchronization sequences.   Test sequences can be selected from P or from its  specification.  We will investigate how to derive constraints  from specifications.  Constraints derived from a specification  can be compared with the actual constraints derived from  source code in order to detect errors.    Concurrent programs will be formally specified using process  algebras and temporal logic.  New techniques and tools will be  incorporated into an existing validation environment to  support both specification and program-based testing and  analysis.  ***",
