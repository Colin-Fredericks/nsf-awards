Most recently, with the emergence of global  circulation models (GCMs) there has been a growing realization of  the important role these radionuclides can play in developing and  validating these models, which are a key element in current  attempts to understand and model climatic change.  However while  several current GCMs have incorporated radionuclide such as 222Rn,  210Pb, 7Be and 85Kr, comparing model predictions with observations  to evaluate model performance, the application of this approach is  severely limited by the absence of a free tropospheric radionuclide  data base.  This research program is designed to obtain a  statistically significant series of summer and winter vertical  profiles of 222Rn, and ozone in the mid-latitude northern  hemisphere.  These profiles, which will extend from the boundary  layer to the tropopause will be of considerable value in refining  and testing global circulation and climate models.  Approximately  16 profiles will be obtained piggybacking aboard the NASA Kuiper  Airborne Observatory (KAO), a  C-141 aircraft which carries a large  infrared telescope.   The KAO makes about 100 flights a year,  climbing to 41,000 ft to get above the dust and water vapor which  would interfere with its astronomical observations.  This  researcher has been flying measurement-based experiments on the KAO  since 1983, and has recently completed construction of a fast  sampling system, which is ideal for collecting samples for 222Rn  analysis during the normal ascent and descent of this aircraft.",
