 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300047  Kirk    Volvox carteri is a potentially powerful model system for analysis  of the genetics of differentiation and development. It is a  eukaryotic multicellular organism but it contains only two cell  types, mortal somatic cells and immortal germ cells, which are  arranged in a predictable pattern within a simple spheroid. The  organism is normally haploid, reproduction is usually asexual and  mutations are phenotypically obvious but because sexual  reproduction is readily induced, formal genetic analysis is  possible. Mutations which cause organizational abnormalities are  viable because cell development is autonomous. Because there are  close relatives of Volvox that lack cellular differentiation, the  potential for evolutionary studies exists. One limitation of this  organism as a model system has been the lack of a genetic map and  an inability to transform it. The latter procedure has been  recently developed in our laboratory and we are embarking upon the  former. The genetic map has been expanded by the incorporation of  many restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) and drug  resistance markers. Methods for tagging and recovering genes of  interest via transposon mutagenesis have been developed. The goals  for the next five years are to tag, identify and map genes that  regulate development and differentiation of germ and somatic cells  as well as morphogenetic movements and cellular senescence and  programmed cell death.  %%%  The achievement of the goals of this project will provide a bridge  organism between simpler single cell organisms and much more  complex multicellular organisms for the study and understanding of  development and differentiation as well as evolution.",
