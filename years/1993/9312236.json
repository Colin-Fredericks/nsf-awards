This Board provides a  focal point for studies related to  environmental engineering aspects of water  management.  The Board's objective is to  improve the scientific and technological  basis for resolving important questions and  issues relating to  management of water  resources.  This award is jointly supported  by the Environmental Engineering segment of  the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program  in the Engineering Directorate and by the  Hydrologic Sciences Program in the  Directorate for Geosciences.    An important function of the Water Science  Technology Board is to conduct studies and to  sponsor workshops and conferences that can be  utilized for program planning purposes.  The  Board also functions as an appropriate means  for coordination of research plans with other  Federal agencies including FEMA, USGS, EPA,  DOE, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",
