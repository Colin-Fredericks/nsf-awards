 "awd_abstract_narration": "9255836  Eubanks    Typically students are assessed in chemistry on their  ability to provide answers to short questions.  These tests  measure neither the materials instructors feel students  should learn nor the level of student understanding of  concepts or student mastery of a particular concept.  Only  in the laboratory have assessments been made on the basis of  integrated activities, but laboratories come under attack  for other reasons.  This project develops, validates and  tests eight computer-based scenarios, based on Chem Com, in  which parameters can be carried to provide different  outcomes.  The scenarios assess student knowledge of  chemistry content, level of student understanding, and  ability to make science-based decisions on societal issues.   Resources are available to students to address the chemical  issues raised in the scenario.  Help can be given  electronically.  The student outcome can be electronically  scored in relation to the reasoning described and the help  given.  The assessments can be used to inform instruction  and also to provide objective, bias-free measures useful in  high stakes testing.  The computer-based objective  assessment tasks (Com-BOATS) are designed by project  personnel with experience in developing examinations at the  American Chemical Society (ACS) Examinations Institute using  Authorware Pro shells.  The tasks are pilot and field tested  nationally in classrooms.  The results are interpreted by  third party evaluators.  Dissemination is through the ACS.   ***",
