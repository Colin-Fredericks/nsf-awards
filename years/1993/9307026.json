 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research planning grant for women.  Hygienic behavior is              considered the primary mechanism of resistance to at least two                  disease deleterious to larval honey bees, American foulbrood caused             by the bacterium Bacillus larvae and chalkbrood caused by the                   fungus Ascosphaera apis.  Resistance is conferred by hygienic bees              detecting, uncapping, and removing diseased brood from the nest                 before the causative organism reaches the infectious stage.  The                objectives of the research planning activities are to 1) continue               selection and maintenance of hygienic and non-hygienic lines of                 honey bees; 2) continue development of a more precise and realistic             behavioral assay of hygienic behavior; 3) analyze the behavioral                response of individual hygienic and non-hygienic bees to sealed                 cells containing freeze-killed brood and to cells containing larvae             infected with A. apis; and 4) explore whether the behaviors                     exhibited by hygienic and non-hygienic bees are associated with a               differential distribution of biogenic amines in the bee brain.                  Biogenic amines may control the behavioral states and therefore,                the response to diseased brood, of the genetically distinct lines               of bees.                                                                                                                                                        The goals of this research are to explore the ethological and                   neurobiological bases for the expression of hygienic and non-                   hygienic behavior and to assess the role of these behaviors in                  disease resistance in honey bees.  Hygienic behavior can control                economically important diseases of honey bees, however its                      expression appears to be facultative.  It is crucial to study the               relation between the genetic, environmental, behavioral, and neural             factors that regulate the expressions of both hygienic and non-                 hygienic behaviors to understand how the balanced expressions of                these factors may confer resistance to diseases.  An analysis of                the neuroethological mechanisms underlying the behaviors will                   provide an opportunity to examine how behavioral states may affect              the expression of genetically determined behaviors.",
