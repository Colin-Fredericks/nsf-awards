 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for the implementation of                     minirhizotron imaging to study the dynamics of fine root growth                 and turnover in relation to resource availability and herbivory                 along a successional forest gradient in Alaska. Virtually nothing               is known concerning the rates of, or control over allocation to                 roots in taiga ecosystems, or the contribution of root turnover to              soil carbon and nutrient pools. Such information is significant,                however, given the fact that taiga contains approximately 20% of                the Earth's stored carbon. Preliminary results show that fluxes                 through roots may constitute a significant percentage of the                    total carbon budget of these ecosystems, thus this research project             has implications beyond the immediate questions of forest                       successional dynamics, pertinent to the broader topic of dynamic                ecosystem modelling and global land-atmosphere carbon exchanges.                %%%                                                                             This belowground research instrumentation to be used at the                     Bonanza Creek Long-term Ecological Research site will provide new               insights into the structure and function of taiga ecosystems and                serve to couple many of the research disciplines on the LTER                    project. In addition, this new instrumentation will significantly               enhance instructional and research opportunities for undergraduate,             raduate and postdoctoral training.",
