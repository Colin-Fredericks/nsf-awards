 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ongoing research by geographers and scientists from many                other disciplines has highlighted the complexity of the processes               through which demographics, economics, and other dynamic aspects                of human activity induce changes in natural systems as well as in               the ways that humans respond to changes in the natural                          environment.  Mountainous regions have been locales where human-                environment interactions have been especially significant.  The                 the Himalayas have been the site of some of the most pronounced                 interactions, because population levels and physical relief both                are at relatively high levels.  This collaborative research                     project will be conducted by P.P. Karan of the University of                    Kentucky and David Zurick of Eastern Kentucky University, both of               whom are geographers with considerable experience in the analysis               of human-environment interactions in the Himalayas.  They will                  conduct an historical study that focuses on land use and                        vegetative cover at different geographic scales.  In the first                  part of the study, they will analyze data on population, economic               activities, land use, and land cover gathered over the last                     century at the district level in Pakistan, India, Nepal, and                    Bhutan.  These analyses will identify general trends and permit                 identification of areas where relationships between key factors,                especially population growth and forest cover, indicate that                    local case studies are likely to yield greater insights into                    crucial processes.  During the second part of the study, rigorous               local analyses will be undertaken in the case-study areas using                 intensive field observation techniques, surveys and interviews,                 and  air-photo interpretation.  Special emphasis in this part of                the inquiry will be placed on analysis of land-use, socio-                      economic, and population trends.                                                        Through these regional and local studies, the investigators             will provide valuable new insights about the processes through                  which humans impact on natural systems and respond to changes in                natural conditions in regions where stresses on both human and                  natural systems are great.  They will assemble a useful century-                long database, and they will provide external assessments of the                viability of a number of different types of economic development                regimes.",
