 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytochrome is a regulatory master switch that controls gene                    expression in response to light.  The long term goal of the                     proposed research is to define the molecular mechanism underlying               this regulation.  The rapid transcriptional repression that                     phytochrome imposes on its own phyA genes provides an excellent                 model system for this purpose.  The specific objectives of this                 proposal are: (a) to identify and isolate recombinant clones                    encoding DNA-binding proteins that recognize functionally defined               cis-acting elements in phyA promoters; (b) to delineate the                     functional domains of such cloned factors; (c) to determine the                 molecular mechanism by which a recently identified repressor                    factor, RF1, disrupts phyA transcription in response to phytochrome             activation.  Experimental approaches will include: (a) screening                expression libraries with oligonucleotide probes representing                   functionally defined regulatory elements for isolation of cDNA                  clones encoding the cognate factors; (b) in vitro binding assays to             define the DNA-recognition domains of these factors; (c) gene                   transfer assays to delineate nuclear localization sequences; (d)                yeast transfection and in vitro transcription assays with chimeric              fusion proteins to define transcriptional activation or repression              domains in these factors.  The significance of this research is                 that it will help define the mechanism by which a central                       regulatory molecule controls gene expression.  Because phytochrome              appears to have no molecular counterpart in other eukaryotes,                   elucidation of this mechanism will broaden our understanding of how             eukaryotic cells regulate gene expression in response to                        environmental stimuli.                                                          %%%%                                                                            Plant respond to light by turning on genes that are involved with               growth, photosynthesis, and other functions.  A key regulatory                  molecule in plant cells that is responsible for this effect is                  phytochrome.  This molecule interacts with proteins and genes to                activate genetic messages for growth, etc.  To understand the                   molecular mechanism it is necessary to identify the regions of the              gene which are affected, and the proteins which are involved in the             activation process.  These studies will lead to greater                         understanding of how to regulate plant growth.",
