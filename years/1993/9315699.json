 "awd_abstract_narration": "To assist developing countries and countries with economies                in transition formulate their climate-change policies, the United               States Government has committed $25 million over two years for                  the development of Country Studies to Address Climate Change.                   These studies will help establish an analytical and institutional               foundation upon which recipient countries may construct their                   national climate action plans and help those countries fulfill                  their obligations under the Climate Change Convention.  Following               review of proposals submitted by eligible countries, financial                  and technical support will be provided to selected counties to                  enable them to conduct inventories of their greenhouse-gas                      emissions, to assess their vulnerability to climate change, and                 to evaluate response strategies for mitigating and adapting to                  climate change.                                                                      Agencies participating in the U.S. Global Change Research                  Program have been directed by the Office of Management and Budget               to transfer funds to one of the three agencies cooperatively                    managing the Country Studies initiative to be used for support of               the initiative.  This interagency agreement transfers $1,366,000                from NSF to the Environmental Protection Agency as directed by                  OMB for this purpose.",
