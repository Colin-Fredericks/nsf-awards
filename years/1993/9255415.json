Using the theme of Stressed Stream Analysis             participating faculty will study NEPA-based environmental analysis              concepts and techniques and work in teams to prepare an                         Environmental Impact Statement for a proposed pollution source in               a disturbed stream ecosystem. Concepts and skills participants will             explore include: habitat evaluation procedures, using biotic                    indices, electrophoretic and microscope techniques to evaluate                  pollutant effects on organisms, and water quality analysis of                   nutrients and metals in a stressed stream ecosystem.",
