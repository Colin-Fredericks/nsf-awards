 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the relationship between changes in the               rules of legislative procedure of the U.S. House of Representatives             and the electoral environment.  The genesis of rules changes in the             Congress is of significant theoretical interest.  Many studies of               Congress have chronicled the occurrence of historic rules changes               in the House while others have created theoretical models of why                institutional rules have an independent effect on the determination             of policy outcomes within the chamber.  In addition, students of                American political parties, at the congressional level, have argued             that party change was responsive to changes in the American agenda.                                                                                             This project explores and tests the degree to which the changes in              the electorate also caused changes in the rules of the House as a               response to changing electoral demands.  Specifically, the project              tests the following relationship between electoral influences and               institutional change:  major rules changes will not occur directly              after rapid and major alterations take place in the coalitions that             make up the two major political parties and in the issues that                  divide them and dominate politics.                                                                                                                              Testing this hypothesis requires the creation of a database on                  proposed rules changes in the U.S. House.  A major product of the               project will be the creation of a database concerning proposed                  changes of the rules in the House from the First through the One                Hundredth Congress.  Data will not be collected on the size and                 cohesion of the political parties in the House since that is                    available elsewhere.  The primary data source is the Journal of the             House of Representatives for each session of Congress.  The                     Journals for the Sixteenth through the Hundredth Congress are                   available at the host institution of the Principal Investigator.                                                                                                The data collected will be archived with the Inter-University                   Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of               Michigan.  This database should enable further research which will              enhance substantially our understanding of the topic.",
