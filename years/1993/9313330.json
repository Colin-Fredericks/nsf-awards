 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313330  Kota       This project introduces a novel class of mechanical systems  called compliant mechanisms for micro applications.  Compliant  mechanisms are single-piece flexible structures that deliver the  desired motion by undergoing elastic deformation as opposed to the  rigid body motions of conventional mechanisms.  Thus, the principal  objective of the project is to explore the possibility of using  compliant mechanisms in the micro realm to meet the atypical design  challenges posed by Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).       The study of MEMS is a fast growing area of research that has  an immense potential to help accomplish useful tasks in numerous  applications that involve mechanical manipulation at the micro  level.  This project addresses the design aspects of such systems.   Many researchers have demonstrated the feasibility of their  microfabrication technologies by building a variety of  micromechanical elements. They include rotary motors, linear  actuators and resonators, springs, grippers and gears all of which  are in the size range of few tens of microns to few hundreds of  microns.  The limited capabilities of the micromachining techniques  give way to new exigencies in fabrication and design at micro level  that are nonexistent in the macro machinery.",
