Two of the courses, Statistics and  Experimental Psychology Laboratory (EP Lab), are taken  consecutively by all psychology majors. The former introduces the  students to basic statistical concepts and continues through  factorial ANOVA. In EP Lab, students learn to read and analyze  research, develop hypotheses, design and conduct studies, apply  their statistical knowledge to data they've collected, and write up  their research. The final project in EP Lab involves an original  study which students are then encouraged to carry out in  Independent Research, the third of this integrated set of courses.  The laboratory is expected to increase the continuity among these  courses, and to introduce students to statistical software and  computer technology , and to encourage more students to pursue  independent research.",
