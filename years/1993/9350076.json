Accordingly, this research project addresses the use of crumb                   modifier in asphalt concrete.  Specifically, Dr. Leahy will carry               out a comprehensive laboratory investigation utilizing the SHRP                 accelerated performance tests to evaluate the potential benefits                crumb rubber modification may impart to asphalt concrete in terms               of permanent deformation.                                                                                                                                       Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching               an undergraduate and a graduate course; participating at monthly                research colloquia; serving as research advisor to one                          undergraduate and graduate student; hosting a seminar with                      presentations from three women, all professional engineers; hosting             a seminar for University of Oregon women enrolled in math and                   sciences; and coordinating participation of women graduate students             in the undergraduate mentoring program.                                                                                                                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
