 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304072  Hodges       Rigorous inversion of petrologic and geochronologic  data to estimate parameters such as unroofing rate in  ancient orogenic belts requires precise estimates of  pressure-temperature and time-temperature paths for a  variety of structural levels.  Uncertainties in Tt paths  largely stem from uncertainties in the temperatures at which  isotopic themochronometers become closed with respect to  loss of radiogenic daughter nuclides.  Factors that can  result in variable closure temperatures for a given mineral-  isotopic system include: 1) compositional differences; 2)  the extent of interaction with infiltrating fluids; and 3)  differences in the effective diffusion dimension for the  radiogenic daughter due to reaction or deformational  history.  The relative importance of these factors or  deformational history.  The relative importance of these  factors in governing closure behavior is not well understood  for most commonly used thermochronometers.       This project is intended to improve this situation  through a systematic empirical study of thermochronometers  based on the U-Pb and K-Ar (40Ar/39Ar) decay schemes in the  Connemara region or Ireland.  Connemara was chosen for this  study because it provides an unparalleled opportunity to  race a variety of lithologies, containing many  thermochronometrically important minerals, continuously from  garnet grade to second sillimanite grade.  We intend to  explore variations in mineral ages as a function  of  composition, microstructure, grain size, and metamorphic  grade.  An important component of this work will be the  coupling of thermochronology with detailed stable isotopic  work in an effort to evaluate the significance of  fluids in  the radiogenic isotopic evolution of thermochronologic  systems.  The research will improve our understanding of the  geochemical behavior of these systems, as well as provide  important insights into the reliability of assumptions  commonly used in the construction and interpretation of  time-  temperature paths in orogenic settings.",
