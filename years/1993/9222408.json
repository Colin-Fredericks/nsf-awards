 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liu         The research is on algorithms for high level synthesis and  layout of VLSI CAD designs.  Algorithms for complex, large  industrial type design problems are being developed.  Research  topics include:  1.     high level synthesis with testability as an important  goodness measure,  2.     timing driven placement algorithms for EPGAs, and  3.     channel and switchbox routing in which the effect of cross  talk is to be taken into consideration.         For the first problem, the effect of register allocation and  functional unit binding on the testability of the circuit is  being examined.  Then the scheduling step is being examined.   Research on the second problem is based on the notion of a  \"neighborhood graph\" which is used in guiding an iterative  improvement algorithm that produces placements which satisfy  given timing constraints.  An integer programming approach is  being used for the third problem, because this avoids parallel  long wires that are close together in the routing solution.",
