The                      investigation will now address two theoretical issues that                      surfaced in this work, both involving the proper lexical                        representation of verbs. They are: (1) meaning shifts, a                        phenomenon in which verbs regularly show several meanings, and                  (2) the identification of the basic number of arguments of a                    verb--its \"acidity\". Intransitive verbs are again the research                  domain. The results of these explorations will further deepen our               understanding of unaccusativity. The focus will be on one                       manifestation of the important question of the \"non-uniformity\"                 of unaccusativity: if unaccusativity is syntactically                           represented, why is there a split among the uncontroversially                   unaccusative verbs, a syntactically-defined class? Since the                    split is reflected in behavior with respect to meaning shifts and               adicity, the investigation of these issues will be brought to                   bear on explaining the non-uniformity of unaccusativity.",
