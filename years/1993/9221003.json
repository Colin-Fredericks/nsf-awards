 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than half of all carbon fixed in the leaves of forest                 trees during photosynthesis is allocated to the production of fine              roots, but the effects of pollution and climate change on the                   production and longevity of these roots is unknown.  We will study              the relationship between soil temperature and soil nitrate (a                   common pollutant in the Great Lakes region) and the production and              death of fine roots in sugar maple forests in order to better                   predict what might happen in pollution increases and/or the climate             warms.  Our study sites are separated by several hundred kilometers             from north to south, and there is a built-in temperature gradient               that spans the possible range of temperature increases that may                 occur due to global warming.  In addition, we are going to apply                large amounts of nitrate to see what effect this particular                     pollutant has on the roots.                                                          Using small cameras first developed for use during                         arthroscopic surgery, we will observe the birth, growth and death               of roots from small observation tubes permanently installed in the              soil.  Using this approach, we can compare root activity between                colder and warmer forests, and between forests subject to high and              low inputs of nitrate.  We will also measure rates of root                      respiration.  Because metabolic activity in living cells speeds up              as temperatures increase, root respiration rates should be higher               in warmer soils.  This means that the trees growing on warmer soils             must expend more energy to maintain enough living roots to take up              water and nutrients.  we think that nitrate will also increase root             respiration rates, because the nitrate must be converted to                     ammonium (requiring more energy) before plants can use it as a                  source of nitrogen for growth.  The results form this change and                increased pollutant deposition on forest ecosystems.",
