 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together Dr. William K. Smith of the                        Department of Botany, the University of Wyoming , with his                      Australian colleague, Dr. David T. Bell of the Department of                    Botany, Western Australian University.  The U.S. PI will spend                  approximately six months in 1993 visiting Western Australia.  The               proposed research will utilize the flora of southwestern                        Australia to test hypotheses regarding the functional                           significance of leaf structure to photosynthetic performance.                   The cooperative research will test several of the hypotheses                    developed by the Dr. Smith under former and continuing NSF                      grants, as well as a more comprehensive and synthetic hypothesis                that has recently been formulated regarding the existence of                    photosynthetic symmetry in plant leaves.  The hypothesis                        regarding photosynthetic symmetry may be of fundamental                         significance in understanding how leaf structure relates                        functionally to photosynthetic performance.                                                                                                                     The Australian investigator is an authority on leaf morphological               and anatomical properties.  The U.S. PI brings to the project an                approach that involves some novel and innovative instrumentation                for the measurement of functional influences of leaf structure on               photosynthesis.",
