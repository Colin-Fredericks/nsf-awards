 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309057  Si  In system control, a mathematical  description of a process is often a  prerequisite to the controller  design.  The system identification  techniques for linear systems are  new well understood nonlinear  systems due to the inherent  complexity of nonlinear systems and  the difficulty of deriving  identification algorithms.  These  difficulties are severed in  building empirically based models  because of unavoidable noise in  real-world applications.  This  project will use recurrent neural  networks to perform nonlinear  system identification.  The  parameters defining the network are  determined through input-output  data training.  The methodology for  training is essentially gradient-  based.  Stability methods will also  be examined for two reasons.   It  provides a qualitative measure of  identification performance and  provides some insight as t improve  the efficiency of gradient methods.   These approaches themselves are not  unique until real-world application  criteria (lower error rates, immune  to noise etc.) are taken into  consideration.  To account for  noise effect from empirical data,  robust norm will be considered as a  measure of parameter prediction  error.  Theoretical analysis based  on adaptive systems theory and  statistical analysis will be  employed to gain qualitative  understanding of the proposed  problem.  Numerical simulation will  be carried out to test proposed  identification procedures.  The  goal of both theoretical and  empirical approaches are the same:  reveal unexplored aspects of neural  networks for real world problems.  The proposed research is inspired  and will be tested by an industrial  scale process identification  problem.  In particular the  experiments will be conducted at a  Honeywell TDC-3000 real time plant  information and control system  interfaced to a methanol-  isopropanil distillation column.  ***",
