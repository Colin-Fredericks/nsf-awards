 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reproductive cooperation and conflict lie at the heart of the              evolution of sociality.  Communal breeding in which adults share a              nest or mate and may provide care for unrelated young, has been                 identified as one path leading to complex social systems in both                insects and vertebrates.  But even in social insects and birds,                 facultative reproductive cooperation among non-relatives is rare.               To understand the origins of alternative reproductive strategies,               where individuals can breed either independently or communally, it              is essential to identify the options open to each individual and                assess the relative success of each alternative.                                %%%                                                                                  Both male and female Nicrophorus tomentosus (Coleoptera:                   Silphidae) demonstrate facultative communal brood care.  More than              one male and/or female may help to rear young that may not be                   related.  The aims of this research are to examine the frequency of             communal breeding in a natural population and to identify the                   parentage of these offspring using a DNA fingerprinting technique.              %%%                                                                                  This study will examine why the reproductively dominant                    individuals allow communal breeding and how this might be achieved.             Several hypotheses for the evolution of sociality and of communal               breeding in particular, have been constructed with considerable                 general application.  These have been tested in communally-breeding             vertebrates and in social insects with joint nest foundation.  They             can and should be tested in other groups.                                       %%%                                                                                  The study is of practical value because the survival of the                many species committed to a Social way of life is dependent on                  survival of individuals and the well-being of their social                      organizations.***",
