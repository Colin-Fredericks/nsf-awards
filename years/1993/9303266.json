 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite intensive study of morphological, anatomical and                   molecular data sets, phylogenetic relationships within the Palmae               and the family position within the monocots remain unresolved, a                situation common in taxa with deep phylogenetic branches.                       Solutions to such problems include generation of additional data                sets, greater taxon sampling density, comprehensive review of the               fossil record,and critical analysis of the various data sets                    individually and in combination.  For this purpose, regions of DNA              exhibiting levels of divergence appropriate for phylogenetic                    resolution at the familial, subfamilial and sectional levels will               be sought.   Sequences from both nuclear and chloroplast genomes                will be produced for representative members of the family and                   proposed outgroup taxa.  Analysis of data is to be conducted                    independently but also coupled with different data sets.                        Phylogenetic reconstruction will use parsimony analysis, and employ             consensus and combinational approaches.  Specific evolutionary                  issues to be addressed include resolution of phylogenetic position              both within the family and with respect to the monocots, study of               character evolution within a phylogenetic framework, comparative                molecular evolution within and across genomes, and examination of               broad biogeographic patterns exhibited by the family.                           %%%                                                                             Because an extensive fossil record exists, and the family is                    generally well characterized, restricted to the tropics/subtropics,             and has low dispersal abilities, the palms provide an excellent                 group for conducting the work described above.  This study will                 address controversial problems involving data analysis in                       systematics.  The issue is \"What is the most appropriate method of              analysis.\"  Difficulties relate to: (a) relative importance of one              data set compared to another and (b) questions of gene versus                   genome versus organismal phylogenies.  Debate over analytical                   strategies revolves around methods of consensus or combination. The             dynamic nature of this field indicating that additional comparisons             and applications of potential solutions are needed.",
