 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flexibility for product customization, low variable production             cost, short lead times, and high quality of manufacture have become             essential for maintaining competitiveness in discrete parts                     manufacturing.  Cellular Manufacturing (CM), the assignment of                  dissimilar machines and workers to a team to produce one or more                families of similar parts, has been shown to be effective at                    achieving all four performance measures.  This project will be                  devoted to enhancing the ability to optimally design and operate                CM systems.  The specific objectives include:  (1) interacting with             industry interested in CM to determine the real-world objectives                and key constraints of cell formation; (2) development of optimal               cell formation algorithms based on the realistic cell formation                 problem formulation using discrete and stochastic optimization                  techniques; (3) inclusion of human and organizational factors into              the cell design problem including issues such as group recognition              systems, employee cross-training, multi-functional operation,                   decentralized organizational structure, performance measurement and             activity-based costing; (4) determination of optimal cell operation             strategies for various environments including the use of  pull type             systems, mixed and multiproduct model scheduling, and determination             of optimal work scope for cross-trained operators; and (5) transfer             of developed techniques to industry.                                                 Relative to existing results for CM, the research will                     significantly broaden the scope of the CM design problem to include             all relevant factors including flexibility to temporal changes and              training/allocation of employees.  In addition, the application of              new production strategies to cells will be examined analytically.               The anticipated outcome of this project is a clear understanding                of how to optimally design and operate cells from both a technical              and human perspective, and an estimation of the improvements from               CM relative to process layouts as a function of the manufacturing               environment.",
