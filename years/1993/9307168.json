The goal is to further understand  sedimentary microbial processes and how they affect preservation of  carbon and sulfur in organic and inorganic phases.  The  relationship between those microbial processes and depositional  environments will be elucidated.  Effects of specific microbial  processes and the environments in which they are prevalent will be  identified.  Results of analyses of organic-sulfur compounds in  these rocks should provide new information on the role of these  compounds in the carbon-sulfur-iron system.       Samples of the initial phase of this study were collected from  active quarries and a core taken in central England.  The quarry  exposures allowed acquisition of large, fresh samples of this  immature, organic-carbon-rich mudrock.  The samples, representing  all stratigraphic horizons and biofacies, were obtained in  collaboration with experts on the vertebrate and invertebrate  paleoecology of the Lower Oxford Clay.  Preliminary measurements  include (i) carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the  extensive and well preserved biominerals in this unit; (ii) carbon  isotopic compositions of bulk organic materials; (iii) relative  abundances and carbon-isotopic compositions of organic sulfur  compounds and pyrite.  These results have  provided unique  geochemical information which we will build upon in our continued  study.        Further goals in the continuation of this project include (i)  confirming a phytoplanktonic origin for pristane and phytane;  (ii)reconstructing the structure of the community of consumer  organisms using compound-specific isotopic analyses; (iii)  expanding the scope of the study stratigraphically to include the  Middle and Upper Oxford Clay; (iv) elucidating the timing of  organic sulfur formation in the widely varying paleoenvironments of  the Oxford Clay.  The work proposed will test hypotheses developed  during our prel iminary study and should provide new insights on the  coupling of the carbon and sulfur biogeochemical cycles in organic-  rich marine sediments.  ***",
