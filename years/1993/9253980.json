 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate scientific education may fail the novice in                       several ways.  One may regard all introductory students as                      recruits to be readied for the more advanced work of a major;                   others view the education of the non-major as an obligation and                 offer material that does not attend to the needs of advanced                    instruction.  We propose ultimately to develop an alternative--                 a two-year introductory program in the analysis of human nature                 from the biological to the social.  This curriculum would                       parallel Columbia University's reknowned program in Humanities                  that has been emulated by many colleges and universities.  The                  course work in this new program would consist of transportable                  but interdependent modules that require careful reading and                     analysis of primary research papers.  The readings would open                   opportunities for a variety of complementary projects.  The                     current request is to fund a pilot program to develop and test                  a module in psychophysics and expand the quantitative adjuncts                  of a second module, molecular biology. The modules integrate                    lectures, peer discussion, demonstrations, field work, and                      experimentation to forge a real grasp of the methods and                        results of science.  Students who complete the complete range                   of modules will be able to continue as science majors in                        biology, psychology or the social sciences.  The portability of                 the modules will permit their use, individually or                              collectively, by other institutions, and we will plan such                      export to other colleges and universities.",
