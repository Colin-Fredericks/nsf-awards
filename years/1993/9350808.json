 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to obtain an x-ray set complete                 with Laue camera and a Straumanis camera for the Debye-Scherrer                 powder method. The x-ray set will be used in the undergraduate                  Materials Laboratory at the Thayer School of Engineering. This                  laboratory is utilized primarily for an undergraduate course in                 Materials Science, which is a required course for both the A.B.                 and B.E. degrees in Engineering Science. The Materials Science                  course is offered twice per year.                                               The acquisition of an x-ray set, with radiation enclosure, will                 provide the students with a hands-on experience for performing                  measurements which are some of the most accurate in Materials                   Science. Whilst an x-ray set may not be considered to be a                      state-of-the-art piece of equipment, the undergraduate projects                 for which it will be used are. These include: high temperature                  superconductivity; optical properties of point defects phase                    diagram determination; mechanical properties of polymers;                       production and properties of metallic glasses; recovery,                        recrystallization and grain growth; processing and properties                   of nanocrystalline metals; and thin film processing of                          materials. The equipment chosen is a \"no frills\" set-up that                    can be used for orientation determination, phase                                identification, crystallization studies, and grain or subgrain                  size determination.",
