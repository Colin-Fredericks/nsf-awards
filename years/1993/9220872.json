 "awd_abstract_narration": "Closely related species often resemble each other for many                 characteristics.  Statistical analyses of cross-species                         (comparative) data sets cannot assume that species data points are              statistically independent or drawn from a common underlying                     distribution.  The former leads to uncertainties about degrees of               freedom for hypothesis testing; the latter may lead to problems of              estimation.  Several authors have proposed analytical methods that              attempt to solve these problems by mapping characters of ecological             or physiological interest on a \"known\" phylogeny, estimated from                independent information (e.g., DNA sequences).  Computer simulation             techniques will be used to investigate the statistical properties               of several such methods.  First, the Type I error rates, power, and             estimation abilities of two new methods for analyzing correlated                evolution of continuous traits, one based on autocorrelation models             (Cheverud et al., 1985;  Gittleman and Kot, 1990) and the other on              pedigree models from quantitative genetics (Lynch, 1991), will be               compared to those previously studied (non-phylogenetic, independent             contrasts, minimum evolution).  Second, a simulation approach to                phylogenetic analysis of covariance will be developed.  Third,                  computer programs will be developed that (1) simulate data                      phylogenetically under alternative models of evolutionary change,               (2) perform analysis of covariance on the simulated data to obtain              null distributions of F-statistics, and (3) allow graphically-based             data entry and transformation of tree structure and character data.             %%%                                                                             Comparative analyses of phylogentic relationships is an important               interdisciplinary approach linking studies in phylogency with                   ecology, behavior and physiology.  This proposal focuses on                     statistical techniques of comparative analysis and will validate                and further develop comparative methods essential to this approach.",
