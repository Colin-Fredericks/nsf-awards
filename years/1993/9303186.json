 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the vibrational, electronic, and                  magnetic excitations in tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors.               Both bulk and submicron heterostructures fabricated by molecular                beam epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition will be investigated.                II-VI and III-V semiconductors (bulk, epilayers, and quantum well               structures) will be examined using Raman, Brillouin, modulated                  reflectivity, and photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy.                Magnetic ions introduced into II-VI compounds have resulted in a                new class of materials called diluted magnetic semiconductors which             possess striking magneto-optic effects. Further exploration of                  these systems will be undertaken with special emphasis on materials             of low dimensionality. The vibrational spectra and electronic                   levels of donors and acceptors intentionally introduced into                    diamond and silicon carbide will also be studied. The thrust of the             program is to provide a fundamental understanding  of the physical              properties of tetahedrally coordinated semiconductors whose optical             characteristics form the basis of many optoelectronic applications.             %%%                                                                                  The family of tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors                     encompasses the well known group IV semiconductors such as C, Si,               and Ge as well as the II-Vs (e.g., GaAs, InSb, etc.) and the II-VIs             (e.g., CdTe, ZnTe, etc.) The electronic, vibrational, and magnetic              excitations in these materials will be examined through                         spectroscopic investigations using a variety of techniques. The                 results of such spectral studies will yield important fundamental               quantities related to their optical properties and are expected to              form the basis of many optoelectronic devices. In particular,                   magnetic ions introduced into the II-VIs generate striking magneto-             optic effects which have potential applications as magnetic                     isolators and optical sensors.                                                       These novel advanced material systems are accessible to both               experimental and theoretical studies, thanks to the ingenious                   techniques increasingly exploited in the growth of new                          semiconductors in the bulk as well as with submicron dimensions.                The work will be done in collaboration with scientists and                      technologists at several industrial research laboratories who will              supply many of the materials. In addition, the program benefits                 from an active collaboration with the Argonne National Laboratory.",
