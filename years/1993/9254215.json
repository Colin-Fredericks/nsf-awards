 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to address the needs of                                African-American women who do poorly in science upon entering                   the academic world.  Students in the Program, which targets                     disadvantaged minority women in Pittsburgh, often find science                  courses a roadblock in their academic path and a place for                      failure. Despite a high level of motivation and eagerness to                    succeed in science, many students struggle with the combined                    effects of inadequate science study skills, years of separation                 from secondary math and science courses, and a lack of                          confidence.  Yet these students have ability and the potential                  to pursue careers in science.  A specific objective of the                      project includes designing a \"Science and Language\" course that                 1) examines science in a non-traditional way by integrating a                   4-credit science class with a 3-credit writing class so that                    students use writing as a tool to learn science and use science                 as the content in developing writing skills; 2) facilitate                      students' transition between previous course work and their                     study of science; 3) maximize connections among science                         principles, real-life situations, and issues familiar to                        African-American women; 4) engage students in designing their                   own experiments; 5) engage students in collaborative teaching                   and peer tutoring experiences in which they learn as teachers                   of the content; and 6) creates a partnership between students                   and instructors that provides flexibility in designing                          approaches to learning.  The project's objectives are: 1) to                    design Biology Study Groups modeled after those of Uri Treisman                 in math to further integrate the course's content and foster an                 experience of an academic science community; 2) to design a                     \"safety net\" of tutorial support involving Carlow's Learning                    Center and Hill College's new Peer Tutoring Program, and 3) to                  collect data for evaluation.                                                    The planned Science and Language course begins by helping                       students eliminate barriers such as anxiety as they become                      conversant with science through reviewing a science-fiction                     film, analyzing a report on the state of Science Education in                   the U.S. and examining essays and texts related to science.  In                 the writing class, students explore the investigative nature of                 science, the human element of science, and science as language                  through reading and discussions, written summaries, outlines,                   abstracts, essays and lab reports.  On-going science classes                    and laboratories parallel the ongoing writing class.  The                       science half of the class requires student participation and                    student-designed experiments with de-emphasis on canned labs                    and instructor-dominated lectures.  Students study major themes                 in Natural Science such as DNA and Heredity, Inter-dependence                   and Ecology, Diversity and Evolution.                                           Assessment and evaluation are given the highest priority in the                 project. Activities include 1) monitoring the program as it is                  implemented with data collected regarding student attendance,                   participation, success of study groups, etc., and 2) assessment                 of included taped interviews, student's before and after                        completion of the course to determine impact in the ares of                     self-esteem, reasoning ability, and academic performance.                       Additional data will be collected regarding demographic                         characteristics of the students (age, race, number of children,                 etc. and academic background.                                                   Planned dissemination of results include local, regional, and                   national presentations and conferences; publications; and                       informal hosting of teachers of science at the College to                       observe the courses.  The Science and Language course is a                      proposed solution to reverse the failure of African-American                    adult women in introductory science.  It pulls together what is                 known about how to teach science, how students best learn                       science and our own experiences in teaching it, with the goal                   of offering a multifaceted approach for success.  If this                       course \"works\" it opens the door to science for majors and non-                 majors and can serve as a model for students failing in                         science.  The model itself can be easily adapted to other                       institutions and implemented without excessive cost or                          dependence on Federal funding.",
