 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Arkansas, Little Rock is requesting three                     years of support to build a self sustaining program to place                    secondary math/science teachers in research positions in                        university or industrial laboratories.  Arkansas/STRIVE has                     developed from a three year pilot program which was                             supported both by NSF funds through Oak Ridge Associated                        Universities (ORAU) and six Arkansas businesses and                             institutions.  the program will ultimately provide research                     experiences for at least 50 secondary math/science teachers                     per year.  The teachers will engage in research for 7 weeks.                    They will afterwards spend one week at a central site on                        curriculum development leading to a plan for improvement in                     the teacher's personal pedagogical activities and to                            contributions to the preparation of a Recommendation for                        Curriculum Change report in their respective area of Life                       Science, physical Science or Mathematics/Computer.  A                           minimum of five more meetings are scheduled during the                          academic year with each participant being responsible for                       mentoring 5 other teachers in their school/school district.                     One result of the program will be to infuse the research                        workshops, to create video, computer and other materials                        which will be made available to teachers throughout Arkansas                    and nationally.  Cost sharing is 94% of the funds requested.",
