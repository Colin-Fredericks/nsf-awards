 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to evaluate the potential of a                 Russian instrument for determining the density of the sea water by              measuring the index of refraction.  The former Soviet Union has                 invested in this research (the insitu measurement of the index of               refraction of the ocean and the use of this data) for more than 35              years.  One direct application is to determine the density of the               sea water as an alternative method to conductivity.  Results in                 shallow waters are very encouraging.  A cooperative US/Russian                  effort will take place during which the appropriate Russian                     scientists will visit the US to describe and demonstrate their                  instrument and method.  Laboratory facilities will be provided at               the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute to prove their equipment and             test it jointly with US scientists.  It is expected than an                     accurate evaluation of the interferometer as well as the algorithm              used, will be done.  If satisfactory, the techniques will be                    improved and further developed in the US.",
