 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three groups of open questions concerning sorting,  searching,  and related problems in computational geometry  and database management are  considered from both a  pragmatic and theoretical perspective.      (1) The first group of questions concerns the recently    introduced fusion tree data structure.  Fusion trees can  perform dynamic tree search-and-update operations in  O( logN / log logN ) worst-case time, and they support a worst-  case time  O(NxlogN/loglogN) for sorting. These results  circumvent the Information  Theoretic Lower Bound by  utilizing the power of a digital computer for  performing  arithmetic and bitwise logical operations in constant time.  Numerous open questions arise about upper and lower bounds  for sorting,  searching, balance tree operations, and hashing  in this mathematical model.  The second goal is to examine algorithms in order to improve    the performance of relational calculus, LDL  and SETL  queries.    Its goal is to study both theoretical and  pragmatic issues related   to data base performance.  This study  examines both the methods for decomposing a general query into component  parts, and the underlying  search algorithms to process these individual parts.  The  research also includes an examination of the  implications of  statistical sampling to improve algorithmic  performance.      (3) The third research area  is in the domain of  computational geometry.    The implications of this subject  for relational databases are considered.  Also investigated are the implications that fusion trees have for    geometric search algorithms.  This study of computational  geometry   includes a continuation of  a prior investigation into range query algorithms, and special  attention is given to the problem of lower bounding    the number of addition-subtraction operations for an    aggregate range query.",
