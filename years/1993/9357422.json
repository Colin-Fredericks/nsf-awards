 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two areas of research will be pursued: (1) Host-guest                           chemistry in the gas-phase and (2) Laser                                        desorption/selective ion-molecule reactions of antibiotics.                     In the first topic, a variety of aspects of solvent-free                        host-guest chemistry of model systems will be investigated                      by application of mass spectrometric techniques. The model                      systems include an array of size-selective hosts (i.e.,                         crown ethers and related macrocycles and acyclic analogs)                       and guests (i.e., various metal ions, halide ions, or                           ammonium ions). The macrocyclic host-guest complexes will be                    formed via bimolecular reactions in the gas-phase, then                         their structures and binding energies will be evaluated by                      collision-induced dissociation techniques. In the second                        topic, laser desorption/selective ion-molecule reaction                         methodology in a quadrapole ion trap will be developed for                      antibiotics, especially those whose activities are                              controlled by metal ion binding. Through the use of                             selective bimolecular reactions that chemically modify the                      biological molecules of interest, structural details will be                    obtained based on how the modified molecules dissociate and                     if the molecules undergo structurally-specific reactions.                       %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       research of Professor Jennifer S. Brodbelt at the University                    of Texas, Austin. Complexation between a host molecule and a                    guest molecule or ion, which is important to understanding                      many biological processes, will be studied in the gas-phase.                    This will allow for an evaluation of the binding forces                         between the host and guest without solvent contributions. By                    this means, the primary forces in this molecular recognition                    will be deduced. In another project, techniques will be                         developed to characterized antibiotic molecules, especially                     those whose activities are determined by binding of metal                       ions. The characterization will be done in the gas-phase                        with the use of a mass spectrometer and special techniques.",
