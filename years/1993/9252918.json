Four                         major organizations serving print-disabled persons in North                     America are adding their bibliographic information to both                      the APH-CARL and UNION national databases major databases                       serving Library of Congress users and institutions serving                      the blind and print-disabled.  The collaborative also                           invites more than 400 small publishers and colleges with                        Disabled Student Services (DSS) Offices on their campuses to                    contribute other titles not presently included on the                           database.  Materials are available in several languages to                      accommodate users' needs.  As a part of this project,                           Recording for the Blind (RFB) provides training to DSS                          offices on RFB standards for recording science and                              mathematics materials to ensure uniform quality.  They also                     train users, educators, and librarians on the new systems to                    increase use and minimize problems associated with the                          transition to college by print-disabled students.",
