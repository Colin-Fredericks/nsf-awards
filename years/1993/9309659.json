 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of chemical processing systems may be affected by                        varying degrees of error.  In many substances reasonable                        bounds on the extent of the errors can be determined                            quantitatively.  In particular, ellipsoidal confidence                          regions-- certainty models-- can be generated as a by product                   of efforts to model process plants.  This project addresses                     the design of robust controllers capable of satisfying                          performance and stability specifications for a normal plant as                  well as for all plants belonging to a neighboring ellipsoidal                   uncertainty region.                                                                                                                                             The objectives of this research are to (1) develop a                            comprehensive methodology for analyzing the robustness of                       systems with ellipsoidally uncertain plants, (2) produce tools                  for synthesizing robust controllers for such plants, and test                   and evaluate the resulting control strategies via simulation                    studies.  The analysis of robustness will be carried out by                     extending the results of a frequency-domain technique which                     leads to a simple necessary and sufficient condition for                        robust stability.  New synthesis methods are planned using                      generic control structures as well as specialized designs such                  as pole-placement.  Computer simulation studies of chemical                     engineering systems will be used to critically evaluate the                     new control strategies using systems of relevance to the                        chemical processing industry.",
