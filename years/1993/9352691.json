 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to enhance the application of modeling                       techniques that support full implementation of computer-                        integrated manufacturing. The curricular areas primarily                        affected are the Manufacturing Technology program and the                       Electro-Mechanical Systems program. The four key areas of                       coursework will be impacted directly range from freshman-level                  studies of automated manufacturing to senior-level research                     projects. The University has been supportive in program                         development especially through the establishment of computer                    laboratories in the Industrial Technology Center. Students gain                 experience with key software applications in numerous areas                     including computer-aided design (CAD), numerical control                        programming, computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), process                        planning, cost estimating, statistical process control and                      computer simulation.                                                            This proposal seeks support for phase-one of a two-phase plan                   to upgrade the automated manufacturing laboratory facilities.                   Phase one establishes an automated manufacturing cell using                     industry-standard benchtop CNC machine tools with robot                         material handling and vision system for automated inspection.                   The cell would also serve as a focal point for student                          application of simulation and SPC techniques. Phase two would                   expand the cell to create a flexible manufacturing system (FMS)                 including ASRS, palletized automated conveyor and bar code I.D.",
