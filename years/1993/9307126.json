The  research involves  investigation of modeling, analysis and  synthesis of visual behaviors of Active Observers.  An Active  Observer is a mobile agent whose task is to observe, and  report/communicate information about the activity of another  agent(s) whose task may be manipulation and/or navigation.  Active  Observers are part of a small team of agents who work together in  a cooperative fashion.  All agents in the team are equipped with  visual navigation capabilities, but the tasks they are engaged in  differ, depending on their role in the team and their goal.  The  agents could navigate independently or in a cooperative fashion  (i.e. in the case of two manipulator agents carrying an object  together).  For manipulatory-agents navigating in a cooperative  fashion, the issue of communication arises; hence, the problem of  representing visual information for communication.  The visual  tasks of the observers-agents will differ depending on whether  their observations serve for the navigation or manipulation  purposes of the other agents.  The main emphasis in this research  is on the control structure that the observer must have in order to  deliver the proper observations for the task at hand.  For the  purpose of modeling behaviors a formalism from the Discrete Events  Systems (DES) theory has been adopted, suitable for investigating  control-theoretic issues of a system.  It is anticipated that the  contribution of this research will be in: 1) modeling visually  guided behaviors which tightly couple visual processing with  control architecture; and 2) the identification of elementary  behaviors needed for navigation and communication and their  composition leading to more complex behaviors.  Two kinds of  elementary behaviors are distinguished, one where observations are  directly connected with physical actions, and the other where  observations and actions are either received or transmitted.  The  use of DES  formalism allows the synthesis of  complex behaviors in  a systematic fashion and guarantees their controllability and  observability",
