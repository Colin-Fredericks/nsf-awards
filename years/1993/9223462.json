 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, foreign direct investment among                           industrialized countries has grown substantially, frequently                    flowing across borders in both directions within the same industry.             In addition, in several industrialized countries, multinational                 production substantially dominates exports as the vehicle for                   foreign market penetration.  These trends have received little                  attention from economists, who focus a disproportionate share of                attention on trade, and largely ignore intraindustry investment.                                                                                                This research will analyze the relationship between the                         international location decisions of firms and trade.  It will                   incorporate multinationals into a general equilibrium model of                  trade with differentiated products.  The model will explain                     intraindustry investment in terms of a tradeoff between                         concentration and proximity advantages, and contrast this with                  investment motivated by factor endowment differences.  The project              will then use a partial equilibrium framework to examine the firm's             choice between exporting and overseas production in a setting with              dynamic market share dependence.  It will also investigate the                  policy implications.                                                                                                                                            These relationships will be tested empirically.  The empirical                  tests will be based on gravity equations, which are ideally suited              to comparing the roles of transport cost and trade barriers in                  explaining the choice between multinational production and trade.",
