 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for the establishment of an Industry/University              Cooperative Research Center for Emission Reduction Research Center              (ERRC) at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT).                                 The focus of the ERRC research is on reducing pollution in                 \"batch processing\" on manufacturing typically used by                           pharmaceutical and the specialty chemicals industry.  Some of the               planned research projects at the Center include:  novel                         amphiphillic star polymers as solvents for emission control in the              pharmaceutical industry; novel ceramic membranes for VOC Separation             and AI system for process design and performance monitoring etc.                     A comprehensive solvent database will also be built to assist              optimum solvent selection and experiment with solvent replacement               opportunities where organic solvent systems potentially can be                  replaced with aqueous or neat systems.                                               Besides NJIT, the Ohio State University, Penn State and MIT                will also participate in the research program of the I/UCRC.                         The Program Manager recommends New Jersey Institute of                     Technology be award $50,000 for the first year of a five-year                   continuing award.                                                                    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager                   and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers               Division will review the progress of the Center on a number of                  renewal criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which              the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) extent to                 which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a              collaborative, robust research program is developing.  If the                   review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support              for the next period of this continuing award.",
