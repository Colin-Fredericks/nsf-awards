The US side will                                         contribute experimental data and computing                                      facilities; the Czech side will provide expertise                               in fundamental theory and ab initio program                                     development.  Results should yield important                                    insights into the electronic structures of                                      molecules including diatomics and such                                          hydrocarbons as benzene.                                                                                                                                        This research in theoretical chemistry fulfills                                 the program objective of advancing scientific                                   knowledge by enabling leading experts in the U.S.                               and Czech Republic to combine complementary                                     talents and pool research resources in areas of                                 strong mutual interest and competence.  Funds for                               the project are awarded through the US-Czech                                    Joint Fund, Prague, in accordance with                                          established guidelines.",
