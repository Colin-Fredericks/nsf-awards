 "awd_abstract_narration": "In most streams, community production is sustained by the                  decomposition of imported plant litter.  The early stages of                    plant litter decomposition have received much study; but little                 work has focused on the fate of fine organic particles (FPOM),                  the form in which most particulate detritus moves through stream                ecosystems.  Utilizing recently developed biochemical techniques,               I propose to investigate the structure and activity of FPOM-                    associated microbial communities in two concurrent field                        experiments.  The first is intended to evaluate a series of basic               hypotheses about microbial production, extracellular enzyme                     activity and community structure over a broad range of                          conditions.  The second is focused specifically on the                          relationship between FPOM degradation rates and the activity of                 lignocellulose-degrading enzymes.                                               %%%                                                                                  This work will contribute to our basic understanding of the                operation of attached microbial communities, a topic of broad                   interest.  In addition, it may lead to the formulation of models                that relate FPOM mass loss, currently difficult to determine in                 situ, to the activity of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, a                    readily quantified measure.  Such a model would permit routine                  monitoring of FPOM degradation rates, an application that could                 contribute to future studies of ecosystem processes and                         management.",
