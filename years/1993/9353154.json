The project also encourages the students  to enroll and achieve in science and mathematics during their  tenure in high school.    SWAT TEAM consists of three consecutive 4-week, 5-day summer camps,  with school-year follow-up activities.  Extending over a three-year  period, each year the camps will enable 50 African-American middle  school students to participate in classroom and field learning  experiences.  The students will learn about environmental science  and structural design, biological science, aviation and aerospace  dynamics, and forensic science as it applies to criminal justice.  They will engage in the scientific methods of observation, data  collection and analyzation, and draw conclusions through the use of  non-hazardous performance events.  They will use microscopes and  computer technology, where appropriate, to complete hands-on  learning experiences.    Career exploration will be a part of each instructional activity.   Students will interact with African-American chemists, engineers,  pilots, etc. to explore careers the require science and  mathematics.    The success of the project will be based on the students' ability  to perform events using science and mathematics, their increased  interest in science and mathematics, their perceptions of their  learning experiences, and follow-up data showing the science and  mathematics classes taken by the students in high school.",
