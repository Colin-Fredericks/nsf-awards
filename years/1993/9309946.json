The first is to  explore how individuals take advantage of information they may pick  up in the course of an ordinary day to modify or change their  opinions.  By focusing on different forms of information, for  example, the source of a policy proposal or the specific terms in  which the proposal is put, the investigators aim to develop an  account of the dynamics as well as the statics of political  beliefs.    The second objective is to demonstrate the economies of multiple  investigators using a common research vehicle.  By having  investigators share the same survey, and by taking advantage of  experimental design and computer-assisted interviewing, twelve  studies, conducted by seventeen investigators at thirteen different  universities, can be carried for approximately the cost of one  conventional, national survey.    This project should substantially enhance our understanding of  information acquisition and research investigation techniques that  promote reliability, validity and economies of scale.  ***",
