The results are important for assembly of  compliant parts, fixturing, and tasks involving pushing and  sliding.  Dextrous sliding manipulation is useful in motion  planning, slip prediction and recovery, object re-orienting, and  regrasping in robotics.  Recent work in dextrous sliding  manipulation has either focused on planar, quasistatic motions or  employed simplified contact models such as point contact.  To  accomplish this goal, the first step is to develop three-  dimensional dynamic dextrous manipulation with various contact  models.  The second step is to incorporate the results of this  research with existing research in the areas of rolling and  nonholonomic manipulation.  Finally, the control algorithms will be  implemented using compliant hands with sliding and dextrous  manipulation.  The results of this proposed research can be used to  control fingers to follow prescribed motion trajectories via  sliding manipulation involving external and internal forces,  stiffness, and motion control.  The outcome, when it is  incorporated with nonholonomic manipulation, can formulate a  complete solution to dextrous robotic manipulation that involves  shifting of contact locations.  The control schemes developed using  the theoretical foundation of sliding and dextrous manipulation can  be applied in autonomous tele-manipulation and manufacturing  automation such as fixturing planning, tasks involving pushing and  sliding, and assembly.",
