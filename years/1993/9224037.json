 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of cultural attention to risk has developed greatly                   over the past two decades.  One area where there has been only                  limited work is that of non-western perceptions of and responses                to risk.  This study of the management of technological risks in                China seeks to expand cross-cultural understanding of the social                construction of risk by examining how different cultural                        formations in modern China have interacted with powerful                        influences from the international environment in devising                       responses to risks.  Through archival research and interviews,                  both in the United States and in China, the project will develop                case studies of Chinese risk management strategies for flood                    control, nuclear power, hazardous chemicals and airline                         operations.  In addition to adding an important non-western                     example to the comparative risk analysis literature, the project                should contribute to understanding how major influences from                    abroad, including technology transfers, international educational               experiences, membership in international organizations, study and               emulation of foreign policy models, and exposure to foreign risk                controversies, affect a nation's \"risk transitions.\"  Sharpening                an appreciation of how risks are identified, assessed, and                      managed will also provide additional insights into Chinese                      approaches to its complex environmental problems and, thus, how                 to build a stronger base for what is likely to be a long-term                   international engagement with China on environmental affairs.",
