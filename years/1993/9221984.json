 "awd_abstract_narration": "The voltage-sensitive sodium channel is an integral component of                impulse conduction by neuronal cells, transmitting the initial                  inward current during an action potential.  The overall goal of Dr.             Goldin's study is to determine the roles of specific structural                 regions of the channel that are involved in gating.  There are four             putative transmembrane amphipathic helices termed S4 in the sodium              channel that have been proposed to function as voltage sensor                   regions involved in voltage-dependent activation of the channel.                Dr. Goldin will test this by constructing mutations at comparable               positions in each of the S4 regions, and by determining if each of              the charges is contributing to the effective valence of activation.             His second objective is to determine if these same voltage sensors              are involved in the process of slow sodium channel inactivation.                While fast inactivation of sodium channels is thought to be                     essentially independent of voltage, slow inactivation very likely               involves some voltage sensitivity independent of activation.  The               effects of each of the S4 region mutations in slow inactivation                 will be tested to determine if the S4 regions are functioning as                inactivation voltage gating charge of the channel.  Dr. Goldin will             accomplish this by using a newly developed voltage clamp to measure             gating currents of channels containing mutations in each of the                 four S4 regions.  These studies should enhance our knowledge about              the normal function of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel,                    ultimately helping to understand the pathological processes that                affect channel function in disease and to design pharmaceuticals                that interact with channels of specific tissues.",
