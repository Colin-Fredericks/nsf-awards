Two new courses will be organized to utilize MOSAIC:  Integrated Manufacturing for undergraduate education and Software Development for Advanced Manufacturing for graduate education.  These will be organized around open architecture design, planning and sensor based manufacturing.  The graduate course will be project oriented.           The research will transfer the MOSAIC architecture to the curriculum to use the integrated CAD/CAPP and computer aided manufacturing environment to design and plan out and machine complex components.  The knowledge of these technologies may be transferred to industry through the student use of the tools.",
