 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project concerns three topics:                                                                                                                              (1)  Concepts of dependence and asymmetry of multivariate                            distributions and product integrals: we consider a                              class of tests for exchangeability of multivariate                              random vectors subject to censoring.                                                                                                                            The tests are based on symmetrized hazard functions and                         derive their form from the product integral                                     representation of multivariate survival functions in                            neighborhoods contiguous to the hypothesis of                                   exchangeability. The aim of the project is to develop                           asymptotic properties of these tests.                                                                                                                      (2)  Resampling methods in estimation and prediction from                            Markov renewal processes:  we examine two different                             resampling methods in estimation of the renewal matrix                          from a censored Markov renewal process and apply them                           towards setting confidence and prediction intervals.                                                                                                       (3)  L-estimation in the accelerated failure time model: we                          develop an extension of L-estimates in a semiparametric                         linear regression model with censored and truncated                             data.                                                                                                                                                           The aim of the project is to develop new inference                              methods in models designed for statistical analysis of                          data arising in application to areas such as medicine,                          econometrics and astronomy.  Three interrelated topics                          will be considered and will deal with testing                                   hypotheses, estimation and prediction based on                                  incomplete data.",
