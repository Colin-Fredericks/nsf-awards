 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development and intensification of winter cyclones               in coastal regions presents a major weather forecasting problem.                Along the eastern seaboard, the development of cyclonic storms and              frontal systems often occurs along the coastal region of the                    Carolinas.  These weather systems may lead to severe weather in the             heavily populated Northeast Corridor in the form of freezing rain,              heavy snowfall, blizzards and extensive coastal erosion.  In order              to study these phenomena, the National Science Foundation sponsored             an intensive field investigation known as the Genesis of Atlantic               Lows Experiment (GALE).  The field phase of the GALE was a two-                 month, multi-agency endeavor executed during the winter of 1986.                                                                                                     As part of the GALE, the Principal Investigator was                        instrumental in designing and implementing a network to study the               redistribution of heat and moisture in the lowest three kilometers              of the atmopshere over the ocean which is known as the marine                   boundary layer (MBL).  The MBL and ocean-atmosphere interaction                 processes appear to play an important role in the genesis of                    cyclones or in the intensification of an existing cyclone.                                                                                                           Analysis to date has demonstrated the importance of the Gulf               Stream and the land-air-sea interface in both the intensification               of cyclonic storms and the formation of frontal systems.  Low level             forcing by boundary layer circulations and increase in baroclinic               instability in the boundary layer appear to be primary mechanisms               for storm intensification.  Additionally, it has been found that                differential boundary layer modification may be the main mechanism              for the formation of some coastal fronts.                                            Through diagnostic studies of the data collected during the                GALE and numerical modeling the Principal Investigator will                     continue to explore the dynamics of coastal cyclogenesis and                    cyclonic storm intensification.  Scientific questions to be                     addressed include: What is the relative contribution of surface                 forcing versus upper level forcing in offshore cyclogenesis?  What              is the relationship between the coastal frontogenesis and incipient             cyclogenesis?  What is the effect of coastal curvature on the                   offshore cyclogenesis?  What is the role of the diurnal variation               of the land processes on the coastal front?",
