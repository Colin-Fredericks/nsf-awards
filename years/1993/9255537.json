Through                   workshops and seminars, MUMEP fosters communication among                       regional mathematics departments. A week-long workshop is                       offered during each of the summers of 1993 and 1994, devoted to                 visual thinking in mathematics.  Mathematics topics are chosen                  from chaotic dynamics and fractal geometry. Workshop                            participants will gain hands-on experience working individually                 and in small groups. During each academic year following the                    respective summer workshop, regional seminars are held in which                 participants continue the mathematical and curricular dialogue                  begun during the workshops.",
