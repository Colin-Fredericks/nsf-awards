 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to develop explants of                the dorsal axial tissues of the Xenopus laevis gastrula as an                   experimental system in which the biochemical mechanisms responsible             for convergence and extension of these tissues can be linked to                 molecular and cellular events.  The project involves combining                  skills and methodologies in bioengineering, biomechanics, cell and              developmental biology.  We have developed a miniaturized force-                 measuring device the \"Histowiggler\", that allows us to measure the              mechanical properties of embryonic tissues and the forces they                  generate in standard engineering measures useful for mechanical                 analysis and mathematical modelling.  We will use this device to                measure the mechanical properties of explants of dorsal axial                   tissues and the forces they generate during normal convergence and              extension and after experimental treatments known to affect                     gastrulation in whole embryos.  Normal and experimentally altered               cell behavior will be recorded by  analyzing shapes and                         arrangements of fluorescein dextran-labeled cells indirectly with               histology and directly with low-light fluorescence microscopy and               video image processing and recording.  Cytoskeletal structure under             normal and experimental conditions will be evaluated with                       immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy.  The results are                   expected to contribute to our understanding of how cytoskeletal                 structures and cell behaviors generate the mechanical properties                and forces driving convergence and extension of the axial mesoderm.             This system will be a step in the direction of developing routine               methods of analyzing the biomechanical function of molecules and                cell behaviors.",
