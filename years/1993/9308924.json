 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308924  Smith  There exists a vast potential for  applying unconventional computing  methods to many electromagnetics  (EM) problems to reduce the amount   of intuitive analysis and to relax  the computational intensity of many  problems.  Choice of a particular  method depends on the application  and the data being analyzed.   Initially this study focuses on  improving the radiation properties  of large distorted satellite  reflector antennas.  Preliminary  investigations indicate the neural  network computing algorithms could  be used for electromagnetic  compensation for surface errors.   The advantages of using this  intelligent approach versus one of  the exiting methods are speed  (allowing real-time radiation  control) and data reduction.  The  first part of this study involves  bringing this new technology to a  mature state.  The ultimate goal of  this effort is application of these  intelligent electromagnetic  compensation methods to active  control of electromagnetic  compatibility (EMC) problems  associated with electronic devices.    Passive control methods using  shielding, ground wires, etc.  have  long been used.   With higher clock  frequencies and the use of  nonmetallic materials in auto  bodies and aircraft fuselages,  unwanted radiation is an ever  increasing problem.  This  investigation proposes to  investigate active control of  radiated emissions.  ***",
