 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theories of the evolution of upright locomotion in primates                (bipedal walking and suspensory arm-swinging) generally assume a                starting point of adaptation to arboreal quadrupedalism.  All these             theories have assumed that quadrupedal locomotion in a complex,                 discontinuous arboreal habitat requires a unique pattern of                     flexible forelimb use accompanied by reduced weight support by the              forelimb, and that together these factors allowed for the                       development of several specialized hominoid locomotor behaviors.                However, no study exists to date that evaluates the differences in              forelimb use between arboreal and terrestrial primate quadrupeds                travelling in both sorts of environments.  And no study in this                 area has examined the actual mechanics of forelimb use in these                 quadrupeds.                                                                                                                                                          This study, from the finest laboratory investigating the                   kinetics and kinematics primate locomotion, will provide such an                analysis of a variety of primate species with different locomotor               patterns.  Preliminary studies already suggest very different sorts             of forelimb use of a single species when involved in different                  sorts of locomotion.  The results of this study will provide                    empirical data with which we may better understand primate                      quadrupedalism and be able to evaluate the accepted stereotype of               arboreal quadrupedalism as a basis for erect locomotion.                                                                                                             This project is also important in its contribution to the                  training of a promising young scholar in biological anthropology.",
