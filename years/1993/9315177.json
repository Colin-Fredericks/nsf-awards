The goal is to bring together teams of  researchers from two existing engineering research centers to  develop academic courses in microsensor and biosensor engineering.   Two semester-length courses will be developed by a curriculum  committee of academic researchers, assisted by an advisory  committee with broad interdisciplinary scientific specialties.  In  order to broaden their impact, disseminated of the courses to  universities in North Carolina will be effected using the state-  wide video network.  The courses will be accompanied by a new  textbook and a series of laboratory experiments.",
