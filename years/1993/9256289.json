Yet because only a handful of                    academic departments offer study in tribology, there remains a                  critical national need to produce experts in this rapidly                       emerging field.                                                                      Funds are requested from the National Science Foundation to                sponsor five (5) students for graduate study leading to the Ph.D.               in the field of tribology.  With five faculty in the tribology                  area, a selection of courses covering tribological topics as well               as extensive laboratory facilities for tribological                             experimentation, the George W. Woodruff School of Mechanical                    Engineering, is well equipped to provide academic training for                  sponsored GRTP students.                                                             The School will aggressively recruit outstanding students                  will seek to promote awareness and interest in the tribology                    field among undergraduates.  The School will also take advantage                of a number of special programs to identify and attract talented                students from underrepresented groups.                                               The GRTP students will receive a comprehensive educational                 experience, including: (1) quality mentoring from a faculty                     advisor; (2) formal training in tribology fundamentals; (3)                     access to high quality laboratory facilities; (4) participation                 in a graduate seminar series; (5) travel to and presentation at                 national conferences; and (6) involvement in tribology                          instruction to undergraduates.",
