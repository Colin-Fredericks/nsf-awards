 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the mathematical foundations                of control theory of those partial differential equations, hybrid               and hereditary systems which arise in science and engineering.                  The issues to be addressed are robust control and stabilization                 of such systems and their effective approximation by finite                     dimensional systems (usually governed by ordinary differential                  equations) together with facilitating computer algorithms.                                                                                                           One of the main problems of structural mechanics is to                     dampen vibrations, or to control the motion, of highly flexible,                often very large, lightweight structures. This project is                       intended to design and analyze control mechanisms which stabilize               those infinite dimensional dynamical systems which model such                   structures. Feedback controls designed to achieve a certain                     performance level often contain unavoidable time delays due, for                example, to the time required to process the information required               to implement the control action. Another aspect of this research                will be the study of robustness of techniques of control system                 analysis and synthesis of such \"hereditary\" systems to errors                   that may be involved in their modelling or approximation.",
