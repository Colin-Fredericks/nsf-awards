 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diurnal carbohydrate reserves provide leaves with carbon for export             at night and during times of low photosynthesis, thereby                        maintaining an uninterrupted supply of carbon to non-                           photosynthesizing plant structures for growth, storage and                      metabolism.  In some plants, like sugar beet and soybean, the                   diurnal reserve takes the form of starch, while in other plants,                like fava bean and spinach, sucrose accumulates.  The objectives of             our program are to identify systematically (1) how carbon                       apportionment to sucrose and starch and of export together are                  regulated in a way that furnishes a diurnal carbohydrate reserve to             leaves and regulates the current rate of export throughout the day-             night cycle and (2) how photosynthetic carbon assimilation, carbon              allocation and export interact when export is restricted or                     photosynthesis is increased, both in plants that accumulate sucrose             and those that do not.  We will measure changes in export rates,                enzyme activities and metabolite levels in leaves of the two types              of plants when carbon allocation is changed by extending the day or             shortening the previous night.  The ways in which restricting                   export by chilling-induced slowing of metabolism in the receiving               organs or of increasing photosynthesis by raising CO2 affects                   photosynthesis and carbohydrate accumulation will be compared in                sucrose-storing and starch storing plants.",
