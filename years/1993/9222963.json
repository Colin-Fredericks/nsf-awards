 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the              camp facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of                 Greenland as part of the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order              to investigate how atmospheric trace elements are deposited on the              ice and what kind of changes they undergo as they are being                     incorporated into the ice.  An understanding of such processes is               necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data                 that can be recovered from ice cores.  While significant progress               has been made recently in extracting and analyzing ice cores,                   progress in understanding the air to snow transfer process for                  reactive chemical species has lagged behind.                                                                                                                    The goal of this project is to provide a detailed understanding of              the atmospheric transport processes that influence the                          precipitation chemistry over the Greenland ice sheet.  The                      examination of variations in air-snow-ice chemistry measurements                during the time for which reliable global meteorological archives               are available will allow the extrapolation of the ice core                      chemistry-atmospheric transport link backward in time to periods                for which meteorological information does not exist.                                                                                                            Knowledge of long-range atmospheric transport is basic to the air-              snow transfer process.  The recovered ice cores contain impurities              and components whose sources are distant, and which were carried by             the atmospheric circulation to the interior of Greenland.                       Variations in the physical and chemical composition of the ice                  along the core reflects to a large extent variations in atmospheric             circulation patterns.  As part of this project a long-term                      atmospheric trajectory climatology will be prepared as well as an               examination of the seasonal and interannual variability of observed             transport patterns.",
