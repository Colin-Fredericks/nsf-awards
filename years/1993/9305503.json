 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305503  TURNER       Few issues focus on the dynamic nature of human-  environmental interaction as completely as does the relationship  between economic development and environmental change.  In  Africa, the development-environment interface has been considered  as a \"crisis\" of Africa, especially in eastern Africa, where  incorporation of farming systems into the global economy and  unprecedented population growth have created intensive pressures  on people, land, and resources.  This doctoral dissertation  research project will provide a case study of one dramatic area  of contemporary human-environmental interaction by exploring  processes of landscape change in the Olmotonyi watershed of Mount  Meru, a densely populated agricultural region in northern  Tanzania.  The investigator will document the social and  ecological history of the landscape from colonial to present  times.  She also will inventory current land-use patterns and  practices and elicit the perceptions of land users about future  prospects.  Detailed interviews with land users will explore  social and environmental changes and individuals views about  past, present, and future land-use and livelihood alternatives.       This project constitutes a holistic and historical  examination of the complex dynamics of human-environmental  interaction in a region undergoing significant change.  It will  expand general knowledge about the human dimensions of global  environmental change, especially the through identification of  the perceptions of local residents of current and future options,  a factor that often has been ignored in examination of possible  forms of \"sustainable development.\"  As a doctoral dissertation  improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable  a promising student to establish a strong independent research  career.  ***",
