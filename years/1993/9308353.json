 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to realistically simulate physical objects' motion  behaviors has become an area of great importance in science,  engineering, training and planning.  Realistic simulation  requires accurately modeling the behavior and interactions of  contacting objects.  In particular, it is necessary to be able  to simulate the same non-interpenetrating motion that real-  world objects undergo.  An important subset of physical  simulation is simulations where all objects are modeled as  being perfectly rigid.  The abstraction of a perfectly rigid  body, though physically unobtainable, is an excellent and  reasonable approximation for many real-world applications in  robotics and computer graphics.  Even with the rigid-body  assumption, simulation is made difficult by the need to deal  with complex surface geometries and contact phenomena such as  friction.  This project aims at extending the capabilities of current  physical simulation systems that model contact and collision  between systems of rigid bodies and explore practical uses for  simulation systems.  Specifically, the investigation centers  on the development of new geometrical algorithms that allow  for simulations with greater levels of geometric complexity,  and the extension of computational complexity bounds and  algorithms for the problem of contact with friction.  This  project will also explore using non-interpenetration  constraints to aid in interactive computer-aided design and  modeling applications.",
