 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    P.I. Robert Sokal   SBR-9307912    There are currently two contending hypotheses for the origin of the Indo-European speakers.  Colin Renfrew has challenged the established view, propounded by Marija Gimbutas, that the Indo-Europeanization of Europe proceeded in three waves between 4400 and 2800 B.C. from trhe Pontic steppes, north of the Black Sea.  Renfrew has the Indo-europeans arising in Anatolia much earlier (7000 B.C.) and entering Europe as early agriculturalists, distributing themselves through Europe with the spread of the Neolithic.  Both of these hypotheses should have very different consequences for the subsequent population relationships among European groups.    Robert Sokal has constructed a unique database on European ethnohistory, recording the location and movements of most known ethnic units from 2200 B.C. to the present.  In the current pilot project, he will test the counts of movements in and out of different locales in Europe against genetic diversities in these areas, and test migration matrices against genetic distances.  These and other tests will determine the degree of robusticity of the database, given the likelihood that there are some omissions or exaggerations in the database.  This series of tests will establish the utility of the database in further predictions of  patterns of genetic variation over the European continent.    ***  P\\anthro\\jfried\\9307912.abs    penses incurred more than three months before the start date of the grant.
