 "awd_abstract_narration": "A combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the                    formation, thermodynamic stability, and chemical reactivity of                  neutral and ionic organic fragments in the gas-phase will be made.              This study will measure sequential carbon-carbon and                            carbon-hydrogen dissociation energies for simple organic compounds              such as cyclopropane, benzene, toluene, and naphthalene, and                    characterize the gas-phase  reactivity of selected ionic fragments              involved in the bond-by-bond disassembly of these molecules. A                  flowing afterglow-guided ion beam instrument will be used to                    measure activation energies for collision-induced dissociation                  reactions of selected carbynes, biradicals, triradicals, and their              corresponding negative ions. These data will allow an examination               of thermochemical issues such as the energetic consequences of                  electronic promotion (hybridization) effects in chemical bonding,               the intrinsic Bronsted acidities of radicals and carbenes, the                  relative magnitudes of the first, second, and third carbon-hydrogen             bond dissociation energies in benzene and related aromatic                      compounds, and the energetic benefit of through-bond coupling and               spin polarization effects in organic biradicals.                                %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Robert R. Squires at the Purdue                    University. This study will measure sequential carbon- carbon and               carbon-hydrogen bond dissociation energies of some simple organic               molecules and characterize the gas-phase reactivity of selected                 ionic fragments involved in this bond- by-bond disassembly. These               experiments will provide new thermochemical data for neutral and                ionic carbon-centered reactive intermediates. Analysis of these                 data will allow an evaluation of some important theoretical                     concepts in chemistry, which include chemical bonding and acidity               of molecules.",
