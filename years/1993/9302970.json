 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302970  Mischaikow       Mischaikow is using the Conley index to study the global  dynamics of evolution equations.  The first question which  Mischaikow is trying to answer is: given a parameterized family  of differential equations what minimal dynamic structure is  common to the system at all parameter values.  For equations such  as Cahn-Hilliard, Ginzburg-Landau, Fitz Hugh-Nagumo, differential  delay with negative feedback and others the goal is to derive  nontrivial model flows and continuous surjections from the global  attractors of the systems of interest onto the model flows.  For  other dynamical systems such as the Henon map, the Lorenz  equations, non-monotone cyclic feedback systems the goal is to  obtain a semi-conjugacy from an invariant set to subshift  dynamics on a finite set of symbols. The second question involves  singular perturbation problems.  The goal in this case is to  compute Conley indices for the perturbed system (and thereby gain  information about the dynamics) using only the dynamics of the  singular system.  The problems being considered include thin  domains and fast slow systems.       Most mathematical models are not derived from first  principals, and hence, are based on heuristics, intuitive  understandings, and approximations of the physical system.  This  means that it is impossible to know precisely the appropriate  parameter values or even nonlinearities used in the model.   Therefore, it is important that the qualitative dynamic  structures observed in the mathematical system be  robust with respect to changes in the nonlinearities and  parameters.       The goal of Mischaikow's work is to develop applicable  mathematical techniques which can identify such robust dynamics  structures.  ***",
