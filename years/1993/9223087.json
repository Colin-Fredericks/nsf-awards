 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to integrate models of various                 aspects of the legal system with oligopoly models in order to                   obtain a more complete description of how various features of the               firms' economic and legal environment influence their decision-                 making with respect to product quality, safety and environmental                quality.  In particular, four features of the economic and legal                environment will be examined:  (1) market structure in the product              market; (2) who benefits and who is potentially harmed by the                   production and use of the product; (3) legal rules which influence              the outcome of settlement negotiations and/or trial in the event of             harm; and (4) the impact of asymmetric information among                        participants in the product's development, testing, sale and use,               and among potential litigants in the event that the product causes              harm.                                                                                                                                                           The methods to be used include applied game theory and information              economics.  Intended applications include products such as                      therapeutic drugs with potential side effects and by-product                    problems such as chemical \"runoff\" (e.g., herbicides/pesticides,                acid rain and ozone depletion) with the potential for generalized               toxic effects on the environment and on third parties.",
