 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224474  Anderson    This proposal requests funds to permit dissertation improvement  research, in Malaysia, by Mr. Gires Usup, a Ph.D. student in the  Boston University Marine Program, Woods Hole, MA, under the  direction of Dr. Donald M. Anderson, Woods Hole Oceanographic  Institution, within a 24-month period, on the bloom dynamics and  physiology of the toxic red tide dinoflagellate Pyrodinium  bahamensa.  Recurring outbreaks of toxic red tides on the west  coast of Sabah, Malaysia, have caused serious public health and  economic problems in that region.  Physiological and toxicity  studies are currently underway on a laboratory culture of an  isolate from Sabah.  The present study is the field component of  the dissertation project aimed at understanding the bloom  dynamics of red tide outbreaks on the west coast of Sabah.   Sampling cruises and monitoring programs will be used to  quantitatively characterize the spatial and temporal distribution  of this toxic dinoflagellate, the movement of its populations,  and the biological events that take place during bloom  development.  The relationship between bloom occurrence, the  physical characteristics of the water column, and meteorological  conditions also will be quantitatively analyzed.    Harmful or noxious algal blooms are becoming increasingly common  in many coastal regions of the world.  When the causative  dinoflagellate is a toxic species, suspension-feeding bivalves  concentrate the potent neurotoxins in their tissues.  Consumption  of these shellfish leads to paralytic shellfish poisoning which  can be fatal to human beings, especially, children.  Dr. Anderson  is a recognized authority on red tide dinoflagellates.  Mr. Usup,  on leave from his position as Lecturer, Marine Sciences  Department, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Sabah Campus, also  has research publications in this field.  Mr. Norhadi Ismail, a  co-author with Mr. Usup in these studies at Universiti Kebangsaan  Malaysia, will collaborate in the present research.  Th is project  is relevant to the objectives of the East Asia and Pacific  Program which encourages proposals for activities in regions such  as Southeast Asia where interactions between U.S. and foreign  investigators have been limited.  ***",
