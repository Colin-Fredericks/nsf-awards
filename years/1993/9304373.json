 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Paul Barbara is supported by a grant from the                         Throretical and Computational Chemistry Program to conduct                      experimental studies of ultrafast chemical dynamics in polar                    solvents.  Four specific areas of research are planned: 1) an                   investigation of the vibrational relaxation in small radical                    anions in polar solvents; 2) the evolution of reactant                          electronic structure during a chemical reaction; 3) the                         dynamical coupling of proton and solvent motion in reacting                     systems; and 4) the role of quantum solvent nuclear degrees of                  freedom in charge-transfer reactions.                                           %%%                                                                             Since many commercially important chemical reactions take place                 in polar solvents such as water, it is important to understand                  the influence which such solvents have on the reaction                          dynamics.  A number of effects, such as solvent cage effects,                   vibrational relaxation and quantum mechanical tunneling, which                  are not present in the gas phase completely dominate condensed                  phase chemical reactions.  It is important to develop reliable                  theories for model chemical systems which can then be applied                   to improving the efficiency of commercially important chemical                  reactions.  The work which is being performed by Barbara                        provides an important experimental basis for the development of                 such theories.",
