 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is evidence that malnutrition during childhood causes                     systematic dental hypoplasias or deformities of particular kinds.                                                                                               This is still controversial, because some scientists argue that                 such hypoplasias are, or can be, the result of heredity, and are                \"naturally\" occurring in different populations.                                                                                                                 This study will establish the rates of dental hypoplasias in                    a large series of living individuals who were children during one               of the worst and most widespread famines of  human memory - in                  China from 1959-1961.   In an examination of over 2,000                         individuals in a rural and urban community, it will establish                   what the changing rates of hypoplasias were before, during, and                 after the famine, what the distinctions between urban and rural                 populations were, and whether sex differences in effects are                    apparent.  As the graduate student involved in the project was a                \"barefoot doctor\" in both these areas, access to the populations                is assured.                                                                                                                                                     This study will be very important in establishing baseline                      data for bioarchaeological reconstructions of human nutrition in                past populations, and for nutritional surveys in underdeveloped                 countries with poor records.",
