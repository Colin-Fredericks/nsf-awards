 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Donald Henry will                  continue his archaeological research in southern Jordan. He will                excavate at three stratified sites proven rich in archaeological                remains. The materials they contain are attributable to the                     \"Mousterian\" cultural tradition and the upper layers of one have                been dated to ca. 65,000 years ago. All are rich in cultural                    remains. Work will center on a block (ca 45 square meters)                      excavation of Tor Faraj which contains a large deep (+3.5m)                     Levantine Mousterian deposit. The top 80 cm. of the deposit                     display hearths and ash lenses defining three \"living floors.\" In               addition to analysis of lithic and faunal remains, Dr. Henry and                his colleagues will study the pollen and phytoliths contained in                the sediments as well as the matrix itself. The team's goal is to               reconstruct and date the changing environment and understand                    Mousterian adaptation within this context.                                                                                                                      Many anthropologists are interested in the question of when and                 where anatomically modern humans emerged and how these groups                   spread across both the Old and New Worlds. While most recent data               points to an African origin, the Near East has been the focus of                much attention because of the apparent intermixing of \"modern\"                  and more \"ancient\" forms as well as the archaeological remains                  which characterize each. The term \"Mousterian\" refers to the                    stone tool tradition and culture which, in the Near East, North                 Africa and Europe, characterizes the last of the pre-modern                     forms. Archaeologists wish to understand how these groups were                  socially organized and what subsistence strategies they followed                since they set the stage from which modern humans emerged. The                  sites which Dr. Henry will excavate date from the end of the                    Mousterian period and are thus directly relevant to this                        question. They are also extremely rich in cultural remains and                  the apparently undisturbed living floors should yield valuable                  social information.                                                                                                                                             This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of the factors which led to the emergence of                  anatomically modern humans. It will shed new light on the                       prehistory of the Near East and provide data of interest to many                archaeologists.",
