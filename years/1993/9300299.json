 "awd_abstract_narration": "Occidental College Biology Department proposes to develop an                    REU site that will bring together a diverse group of                            undergraduates to do summer research in cell and molecular                      biology.  The research will be supervised by the three                          faculty members involved in the Cellular and Molecular                          Emphasis, whose research areas are:  molecular biology of                       aging, molecular immunology, and neurobiology.  These                           faculty members are strongly committed to encouraging women                     and students of color to consider science as a career.  The                     students will be recruited from Occidental itself, a highly                     selective liberal arts college with 40% minority enrollment,                    and from other colleges.  Particular recruiting efforts will                    be focused upon the surrounding community colleges with                         which we already have ties.                                                                                                                                     The program will allow each student to become familiar with                     the literature, perform a project, interact with the other                      students and the faculty in the program extensively, prepare                    and present a poster on their project, and interact with                        several off campus speakers, including alumnae/i who are                        presently graduate students at CalTech, USC, and UCLA.",
