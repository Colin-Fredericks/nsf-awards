 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313546  Hayes  This award will allow the University of Indiana to modernize  its laboratory space that was originally built to  accommodate classical rock analysis in 1962 and now must be  adapted for research in isotopic biogeochemistry.  New hoods  and lob benches will be installed, a computer and data  facility will be established, and a core-storage and layout  room provided with this renovation project.  The  biogeochemistry labs at the University of Indiana are used  by four senior faculty and serve as an important training  center for individuals establishing biogeochemistry research  groups at other university locations.  Through geoscience  research, the focus of this lab is on the cycling of carbon  in modern and ancient environments.  To provide a basis for  interpretation of ancient records, members of this research  lab study structured fractionation of stable isotopes in  modern environments and microbial cultures, the  stabilization of sedimentary chemical systems in  contemporary settings, and the distribution and abundance's  of molecular structures in modern organisms.  The origin and  development of fossil fuels, the geochemistry of sedimentary  carbon, and the development of instrumentation and  techniques for both the analysis of stable isotopes in  traces of organic material and organic molecules are  additional research themes.  The modernization of this  laboratory is very important for the training of the next  generation of biogeochemists, low-temperature geochemists,  and geochemically-oriented geobiologists and  sedimentologists who will give us new knowledge about global  change issues.  ***",
