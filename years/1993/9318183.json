 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318183  Davis  The Grand Challenge Application Groups competition provides  one mechanism for the support of multidisciplinary teams of  scientists and engineers to meet the goals of the High  Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC) Initiative  in Fiscal Year 1993. The ideal proposal provided not only  the opportunity to achieve significant progress on (1) a  fundamental problem in science or engineering whose solution  could be advanced by applying high performance computing  techniques and resources, or (2) enabling technologies which  facilitate those advances but also significant interactions  between scientific and computational activities, usually  involving mathematical, computer or computational scientist,  that would have impact in high performance computational  activities beyond the specific scientific or engineering  problem area(s) or discipline being studied. The  investigators will study the application of high performance  parallel computing to a class of scientifically important  and computationally demanding problems in remote sensing-  land cover dynamics problems including generating improved-  fine spatial resolution data for the global carbon cycle,  hydrological modeling and global ecological responses to  climate changes and human activity. The research is  collaborative, including scientist from the University of  Maryland, University of Indiana, University of news  Hampshire and NASA's Goddard Space Center. The award will  combine research on       -new analysis procedures for remotely sensed data     -the integration of multispectral, multiresolution and       multitemporal        image data sets into a unified global data structure       based on        hierarchical data structures (i.e., quadtrees)      -the utilization of these hierarchical, parallel data       structures for the        representation of spatial data (maps and products       developed from image        analysis) and the development of a spatial data base       system with a     sophisticate d query language that scientist can use to       control the        application of biophysical models to global data sets       -run-time support for constructing scalable and       parallel solutions to      problems involving the manipulation of irregular data       structures such        as quadtrees    -parallel l/O,especially novel methods for mapping large       arrays and     quadtrees onto parallel disks and disk systems, and for       accessing them        using low overhead bulk transfers  The development work will be conducted on a 32 processor    Connection Machine CM5, installed at the University of    Maryland, and on an IBM SP1 which we propose to obtain as    part of the program.  This award is being supported by the    Advanced Projects Research Agency as well as NSF programs in    geological, biological, and computer sciences.",
