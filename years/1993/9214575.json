In this department                                  condensed matter physics and particle/astrophysics                              are the primary areas of research with research in                              the physics of imaging carried out in collaboration                             with the medical school there.  This department                                 concentrates a great deal of effort on materials                                sciences as they study optics, thin film and                                    surface physics, and low temperature physics.                                   Another significant component of the department's                               research involves soft, condensed systems such as                               polymers, liquid crystals, and complex fluids, with                             a goal of providing a platform for understanding                                the fundamental properties of this wide class of                                systems.  The renovation of this facility will aid                              the Nation in fostering the research and the                                    training of students in one of its strategic                                    research areas.",
