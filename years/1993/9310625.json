The second is to understand  why nations change laws to liberalize or restrict their  international current accounts.  The project is important because  no comparative measure of financial openness is available.  The  development of the global financial market is one of the most  significant events of the postwar world economy, and its domestic  and international sources are poorly understood.    The project will begin with the coding of the International  Monetary Fund's Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange  Restrictions.  Each country's laws regarding financial  movements will be evaluated and scored.  The resulting measure of  financial openness will be reported descriptively, and then  examined in explanatory pooled, cross-section, times series models.  ***",
