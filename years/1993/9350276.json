The PFF Program was established at the request of the  President of the United States to recognize and support the  scholarly activities of some of the Nation's most outstanding  science and engineering faculty members early in their careers.   Awards are intended to allow Fellows to undertake self-designed,  innovative research and teaching projects, to establish research  and teaching programs, and to pursue other academic related  activities.    This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research  agenda of attempting to specify the necessary and sufficient  conditions for the use of physiological signals as measures of  psychological processes and states.  Although converging scientific  evidence from laboratories throughout the world suggests that non-  invasive measurement of physiological activity within specific  assessment contexts can provide information on the duration and  character of specific psychological processes, the generalizability  of these relationships to real-world settings remains untested.   Dr. Tassinary will test the boundary conditions on these  relationships through the experimental assessment of typical human  transactions with simulated built and natural environments.  The  theoretical level of analysis will not be restricted to isolated  components of the body or the environment, but will focus on the  level of organismic-environmental transactions, with reference to  both the physical and socio-cultural environment.     This research addresses a critical question involving whether human  contact with ambient conditions of varying physical form and  content influence our cognitive and emotional reactions.  Thus far,  there exists only self-report data to make judgments about how  different configurations of the design environment influence  individuals.  Using a combination of environmental simulat ion and  state of the art psychophysiological recording and data analysis  resources, Dr. Tassinary is at the forefront of a new field of  research in environmental psychology.  This five year award will  also enable him to train undergraduate and graduate students in  this critically important field.  ***",
