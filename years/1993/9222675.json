 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will enable the student                      researcher to complete a dissertation which examines the                        intersections of feminist theory and social studies of science as               applied to research in biomechanics and related fields.  The                    proposed research is a study of the scientific and technical                    practice of researchers in biomechanics and related fields.  The                study will focus on practices in setting research priorities,                   modelling, and representation, and how patterns of authority and                the relations between gender and power affect these practices.                  The project will bridge two gaps in contemporary science and                    technology studies: (1) between formally sociological studies of                laboratories and institutions and culturally oriented studies of                representations in science; and (2) between feminist criticisms                 of science and theories of science, technology and society.                     Particularly, the study will focus on (1) the intersection of                   representations in scientific practice and larger cultural                      metaphors of body as machine; (2) the practices, such as                        filtering, selection, and ordering, that go into the measurement                and mathematization of natural objects; (3) the general                         organization of knowledge work in science and engineering.  This                modest grant will allow the student to travel to several initial                and three new research sites in order to conduct the necessary                  interviews and observations.  The dissertation should be                        completed by December, 1993.",
