 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9353177  National Aquarium in Baltimore  Baltimore, Maryland  James, Sylvia M. and Retina S. Jagan     The National Aquarium in Baltimore is a major resource for marine  and aquatic science in the mid-Atlantic region.  Its live and  interactive exhibits along with its on-site and outreach programs  focus on creating an attitude of respect for the environment and  the ecological balance of life.    The Summer Camp will offer instruction in marine and aquatic  science,  hands-on projects and information on career strategies.   Additionally, the program is designed to encourage the Junior  Aquarists to continue their interest and involvement in the  sciences beyond the four weeks of Summer Science Camp.    As Junior Aquarists, participants are immersed in an environment  unseen by general Aquarium Visitors -- the day to day routines  involved with maintaining a world-class institution.  They go  behind-the-scenes and interact with professionals in the field.   Students gain hands-on experience working alongside the individuals  who have chosen to pursue careers as aquarists, mammalogists,  herpetologists and aviculturists.  Students acquire and  understanding of the secondary and undergraduate educational  requirements needed to pursue various fields of study and how \"book  learning\" is applied to the real world.  Finally, Junior Aquarists  \"do science\" by designing, carrying out and presenting to their  families and friends, research projects using the National Aquarium  in Baltimore's renowned collection of poison arrow frogs.    The program provides the foundation for a lifelong interest in  science and research as well as an extended relationship with the  Aquarium.  Following participation in the NSF-funded Summer Science  Camp program, students can continue to meet on a monthly basis as  part of an ongoing Junior Aquarist Club.  Further, completion of  the Junior Aquarist program can be followed by participation in the  High School Internship Program and ultimately the High School  Studen t Guide program.  The latter carries high school students  through the Aquarium's rigorous seven-week volunteer training  program, provides paying summer jobs and culminates in  certification as full-fledged volunteer exhibit guides.  While  still in middle and high school, students can apply to the Henry  Hall Scholarship Fund for additional marine science opportunities.   Should students attend college, they are also eligible to  participate in the Aquarium's College Internship Program.   Therefore, the Junior Aquarist Summer Science Camp is not a four-  week, one-shot experience.  Rather, it is both the beginning of a  potentially longlasting fascination with marine and aquatic  science, and possibly the catalyst that produces a future  scientist.",
