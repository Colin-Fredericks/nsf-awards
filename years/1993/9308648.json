 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is aimed at developing a knowledge-                  based process planning system for dimensional inspection of                     discrete-part products using coordinate measuring machines in a                 computer-integrated manufacturing environment.  The project is                  structured to rigorously investigate critical issues in such                    dimensional inspection, including evaluation of software                        algorithms, evaluation of uncertainties in measurement results,                 design of inspection strategies, capturing of dimensional                       inspection knowledge in computer systems, and generation of                     standard inspection programs.  The system uses product definition               data, dimensional inspection expertise, and knowledge-based expert              systems to generate process plans for dimensional inspection                    applications.  The system also generates part inspection programs               to be executed on coordinate measurement machines, which represent              an emerging automated dimensional inspection technology widely                  accepted by industry.                                                                The research is a pragmatic problem and contains a wealth of               research problems that require innovative ideas.  Major                         improvements in product quality, inspection throughput and                      flexibility for moderate to low volume applications are                         anticipated.  The research focus is on seamless flow of product and             production information.  The research results will be applicable                in establishing a critical link between the islands of automation               of design and inspection.  It may also advance the state of the art             of automated dimensional inspection technology.",
