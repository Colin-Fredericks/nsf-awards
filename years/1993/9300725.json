The limit theory for degenerate U-                 processes has not yet reached a satisfactory stage, and the                     bootstrap of U-processes, degenerate or not, is far from being                  resolved.  The applications include asymptotic theory as well as                uniqueness and robustness properties of the empirical simplicial                median.  Open questions for U-statistics, such as almost sure                   convergence to zero of sums of normalized products of random                    variables will also be considered.                                                   Modern empirical process theory, developed during the last                 twenty years and not yet totally completed, not only sheds light                on one of the basic questions in Statistics (namely, how well do                sample properties approach population properties) but has been                  providing a high road to the study of important problems in                     asymptotic statistics. U--processes, a non-linear generalization                of empirical processes, should play a similar, although more                    restricted, role. We propose to continue work on empirical and                  U--processes and their bootstraps, and to investigate some                      applications, such as to multidimensional robust location                       parameters.",
