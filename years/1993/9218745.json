 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves various experiments which lead to                        information concerning the dynamics of charge density wave (CDW)                and spin density wave (SDW) ground states.  The collective mode ac              response of CDW and SDW condensates will be investigated in the                 radio, micro, millimeter and infrared spectral range, and will                  emcompass a search for nonlinear excitations of the ground states.              These experiments will lead to information on the interplay                     between collective mode and single particle excitations, including              questions concerning the dynamics of internal modes of the                      condensates.  Experiments will also be conducted under the joint                application of dc and ac fields, in an attempt at exploring the                 possibility of quantum phenomena which may arise at low                         temperatures in the various broken symmetry ground states.  The                 experiments will be conducted on various inorganic and organic                  linear chain compounds.                                                         %%%                                                                             This research involves the study of the behavior of various types               of new, ordered electron states of solids, called the charge                    density wave and spin density wave states.  The electrical                      conductivity will be investigated as the function of frequency and              of applied electric fields.  The objective is to examine the new                type of nonlinear transport phenomena which are due to the                      collective motion of these electron states.  Because of anomalous               response, these materials may also serve as novel detectors and                 generators, and these aspects of the field will also be examined.               The experiments will be conducted in various organic and inorganic              materials where such states develop.",
