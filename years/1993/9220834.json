 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific significance of the unicellular green algae                 treated in the formal genus Chlamydomonas flourishes on several                 fronts including use as a model system in experimental genetics,                molecular biology, and gene manipulation.  Modern molecular                     systematic studies of variability have also revealed a previously               unsuspected wealth of phenotypic and genotypic diversity in the                 genus.  Comparisons of nuclear-encoded, ribosomal RNA gene                      sequences revealed distinct groups of Chlamydomonas species that                share more recent ancestry with other non-Chlamydomonas species,                including groups of colonial Volvocales.  Although these new                    observations conflict with the traditional taxonomy of                          Chlamydomonas and its allies, based largely on light-microscopy,                new evolutionary interpretations of morphological variability                   suggest that undue influence was accorded primitive features and                that ultrastructural and biochemical characters are not in conflict             with the new gene data.  A broader sampling of Chlamydomonas and                allied species will be implemented in a new project designed to                 expand the molecular and morphological database for these algae and             to test evolutionary hypotheses about their origin and                          diversification.  A synthesis of modern genetic and traditional                 morphological approaches to the study of evolutionary patterns will             serve as a key component of a taxonomic reassessment of                         Chlamydomonas and of other green algae as well.",
