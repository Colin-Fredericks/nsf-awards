 "awd_abstract_narration": "By abstracting behavior and carefully engineering interfaces,  software building blocks, also called generic  components, can be produced that  are more easily composable and widely  usable than the specialized  components usually constructed in  current practice.  Because of their  potential uses, such  components are subject to the most rigorous  possible  scrutiny, including applying formal methods of specification and  proof of correctness.    This project investigates two key issues involved in  applying  formal methods to construction and use of generic components:  (1) the  need for a formal specification language and related  tools that fully support  behavioral abstraction, and (2) the need  to deal with practically useful  components, in which efficiency  as well as generality is a key concern.  The  language and tools  issue is being addressed by development of the Tecton  concept  description language, its proof theory, and a Tecton parser,   type-checker and semantic processor (for generating proof  obligations);   these tools  are integrated into a previously  developed interactive proof system.  The  usefulness issue is  addressed by developing formal concepts and models in  Tecton for  highly optimized algorithms, such as generic sorting and  searching  algorithms taken from a C++ generic library.",
