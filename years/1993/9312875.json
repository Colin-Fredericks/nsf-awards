Relationships between performance and chemical formulation are examined for systems that incorporate the phosphatizing compounds into the coating formulation.  Issues addressed in this study include system stability as related to resin/crosslinker polymerization and pigment dispersion; mechanisms and behavior of thermal curing and the influence of the diffusivity of the phosphatizing agents and their reaction with the metal surface; molecular level behavior of the phosphate as related to polymer adhesion and corrosion inhibition; optimal formulation ranges for components of paints; and verification of protection performance.  Optical, analytical, surface-characterization, and electrochemical techniques are used to examine system stability and compatibility, the composition, structures, adhesion, and nature of bonding at the coating interface, and the corrosion-inhibition and barrier effects of the finished coatings.  A consortium of industrial collaborators including Finishes Unlimited, Cargill, Pre-Finish Metals, and G.J. Nikolas & Co. has been formed to perform the testing and verification of coatings developed at Northern Illinois.    The combination of the phosphate, primer, and topcoat into a single-step process offers significant reductions in time, energy, materials, and labor.  More  importantly, the unicoat phosphate/paint system reduces environmental contamination by elimination of primer and pretreatment steps, eliminating wastes containing hexavalent chromium, and drastically  reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) lost in curing and drying.      m <   \u00d5LL     7             vF  d     \u00d5AL     F7             L    i   \u00d5AL     AN             |        \u00d5AC     7              W        \u00d5ICKS   7             X   .     \u00d5OH     7              E  ;     \u00d5IC     F7             {        \u00d5AVIS   7              T        \u00d5CH     T              E        \u00d5AR     ANA           g{        Lin  Abstract    The goal of this effort is to develop an environmentally and economically sound single-step phosphate/paint sys    9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              !           !           !           !
