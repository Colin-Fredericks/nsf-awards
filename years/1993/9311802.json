Tamot, of the  Department of Botany, Tirbhuvan University,  Kathmandu, Nepal, in a research project at the  laboratory of Dr. Peter H. Gresshoff of the  Department of Plant Molecular Genetics at the  University of Tennessee, Knoxville.  The  research is to use DNA amplification  fingerprinting (DAF), a newly developed DNA-  electrophoretic assay, to detect the DNA of the  causative agent of citrus greening disease  (CGD).  The DNA will be isolated separately  from leaf, flower bud and stem tissue of  infected and healthy citrus in Nepal.  Attempts  will be made to isolate DNA from any Bacterium-  Like Organism (BLO), and to generate DAF  patterns.  The difference in DNA amplification  products, one or more polymorphic bands,  generated from DNA of infected and non-infected  tissues with specific primer will be used as  markers for detecting CGD.    Scope:  This research brings a young scientist  from Nepal, a recent Ph.D., who has had some  experience in DAF technology and its  application in plant breeding, with a senior  U.S. scientist who has published extensively in  the field.  The field work by Dr. Tamot in  Nepal, combined with the analytical work at the  University of Tennessee in cooperation with Dr.  Gresshoff should produce two benefits, an  expanded research data and information about  the validity of DAF as an early detector of the  citrus disease, and a better training for the  Nepalese scientist that should enable him to  apply the technique to other biological  objectives in his country.  This represents a  strong cooperative project with a developing  country as well as  support for a recent  foreign Postdoctorate.   ***",
