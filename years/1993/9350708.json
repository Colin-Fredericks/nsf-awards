Improvements  have been made in the undergraduate curriculum that emphasize  the following aspects of software development: rigorous  thinking at a high level of abstraction, formal specifications  and design techniques, use of state-of-the-art software  development tools, and cooperative work. Many of these  objectives are encouraged by  migration away from the  procedural (or imperative) language paradigm embodied by Pascal  towards the object-oriented paradigm embodied in C++ and Common  Lisp (with CLOS). This project aims to establish an  undergraduate laboratory that supports these curriculum  changes.             This undergraduate laboratory  enables students to use object--  oriented programming environments running on the UNIX platform.  These environments (specifically, ObjectCenter for C++, Allegro  Composer for CLOS and ObjectStore for object-oriented data-  bases) enable students to utilize the sort of visual software  engineering environments that are becoming commonplace in  industry. Such environments are especially important for  object-oriented systems development where developers are  confronted with the enormous complexity of large numbers of  related classes and interacting objects. This project also  encourages the use of modern telecommunications to support  cooperative work among students, electronic interaction between  students and faculty, and student access to the larger  intellectual community over newsgroups.",
