 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formation of araB-lacZ hybrid coding sequences normally utilizes                the DNA rearrangement activities of transposable bacteriophage Mu.              Fusion events are physiologically specific: they do not occur                   during normal growth but are found at high rates following                      starvation.  This system is a prime example of inducible genetic                changes now called \"directed mutation.\" We have developed a                     detailed molecular explanation of the complex series of biochemical             events that produce ara-lac fusions.  The cAMP-CRP catabolite                   sensory system and the CLP heat-shock protease play essential roles             in Mu activation during starvation.  PCR technology has been                    validated for the detection of rare fusion events, and there is                 evidence for no-fusion rearrangements after stress.  Thus, the ara-             lac fusion system is one of the best-characterized physiologically              regulated mutational systems.  Genetic studies and molecular                    experiments are outlined here to define the roles of the cAMP-CRP               and CLP systems in Mu activation, to identify alternative                       biochemical pathways to fusion formation, and to clarify the nature             of Mu-dependent DNA rearrangements following stress.                            %%%                                                                             The results of this research will provide definitive answers to                 several issues in the directed mutation controversy and identify                components of the signal transduction network connecting cellular               physiology and DNA biochemistry.",
