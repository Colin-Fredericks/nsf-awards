 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compelling evidence has accumulated for the existence of                     retinylidene (rhodopsin-like) photosensory receptors in unicellular             eukaryotes.  These photoreceptors constitute a new class of                     retinal-containing sensory proteins in nature, evolutionarily                   intermediate between visual pigments in higher animals and sensory              rhodopsins in archaebacteria.  In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two                distinct motility behaviors have been shown to depend on retinal                for light detection:  phototaxis migration and photophobic                      responses.  Indirect evidence indicates the retinal chromophore for             the photophobic response is chemically similar in its retinal                   /apoprotein interactions to the archaebacterial rhodopsins.  On the             other hand, there is data indicating the phototaxis receptor is                 more similar in chromophore properties to visual pigments.  The                 aims of this research are to establish the number of rhodopsin-like             pigments responsible for C. reinhardtii photobehavior, to determine             spectroscopic and biochemical properties of the photoreceptor(s),               and to use this information to clone the corresponding structural               gene(s).  Phototactic and photophobic behavior of retinal analog-               reconstituted cells will be analyzed by quantitative motion                     analysis to establish spectroscopic and chromophore binding                     properties of the retinylidene photoreceptors(s).  Photobehavioral              mutants will be isolated and characterized.  This work will provide             criteria for spectroscopic identification of the photoreceptor                  pigments and for protein enrichment and isolation of radio-labeled              retinal binding fragments.  Protein primary sequence information                will be obtained and used to design oligonucleotide probes.                     %%%                                                                             For most organisms, the ability to detect and respond to light                  stimuli is a fundamental property critical to their survival.  In               animals, the primary detector of light is the so-called visual                  pigment, a protein called rhodopsin which functions in association              with retinal (vitamin A).  A related but different form of                      rhodopsin is found in the photoresponsive apparatus of                          archaebacteria.  Prior work with archaebacterial rhodopsin by this              laboratory has been important not only because of the potential for             expanding knowledge about rhodopsin sensory function in general,                but also for laying the groundwork for development of a potential               new generation of rhodopsin-based miniature photodetectors with                 broad applications.  In the present study, this laboratory is                   focusing on the photoresponses of a unicellular motile green alga,              Chlamydomonas.  This organism exhibits two different types of                   photobehaviors: a phototactic response, in which the organism swims             toward the light, and a photophobic response, in which the organism             swims away from a sudden flash of light.  Preliminary data suggest              that the two photoresponses are mediated by different rhodopsins,               one resembling the visual pigment of animals and the other                      resembling the archaebacterial photosensor.  These photoresponses               will be studied in a multidisciplinary fashion, combining genetics,             molecular biology, biochemistry, and biophysical measurements, to               expand our understanding of this important class of photoresponsive             biomacromolecules.",
