 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311144  Focht  This is an award to support research to  determine whether complementary catabolic  pathways within bacterial strains for  biodegradation of recalcitrant xenobiotic  chemicals such as the polychlorinated  biphenyls can be incorporated into a single  pathway by enhancement of genetic exchange  between added and indigenous soil bacteria.   Current strategies for combining the genes  from two or more catabolic phenotypes  requires isolation of parental strains and  genetic manipulation in vitro.  In this  research, the investigator plans on adding  the requisite chlorobenzoate utilizer  organisms to soil containing indigenous  organisms capable of biodegrading biphenyl  alone to determine whether degradation of the  target substrate is enhanced and to determine  the relative effectiveness of the different  hybrid strains selected and developed during  conduct of this project.    Results of this research are expected to  provide insights into how soil and sediments  that have been contaminated with  polychlorinated biphenyls can be  decontaminated by use of organisms capable of  utilizing these organic compounds as  metabolic substrates.  This knowledge may be  utilized in engineering design of bioreaction  processes and for in situ decontamination of  soil.",
