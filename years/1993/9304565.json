 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipoxygenases are widely distributed dioxygenases whose natural                 substrates are polyunsaturated fatty acids.  These enzymes are                  responsible for the generation of a number of extraordinarily                   potent bioactive substances in mammals.  The role of lipoxygenases              in plants is less well established but they are involved in                     development and in defense against pests and disease organisms.                 This study will be focused on soybean lipoxygenase, L-1, the most               thoroughly investigated of these enzymes.  The goal of the proposed             research is to elucidate the structure-function relationship of                 lipoxygenase.  To this end, the X-ray structure of L-1 will be                  vigorously pursued, following up recent progress.  While this work              is in progress testing the significance of suggestive amino acid                residues and structures will be continued with the aid of                       recombination genetics and enzymatic studies.  A remarkable feature             of the lipoxygenase from both the plant and animal kingdoms is the              high level amino acid sequence homology in \"essential\" regions.                 Insight gained from the proposed studies will be applicable to a                broad range of lipoxygenases.  Although all lipoxygenases catalyze              primarily the formation of hydroperoxides from their substrates,                they vary considerably in regio-specificity, substrate specificity,             pH optimum and secondary reactions.  The proposed studies should                provide a basis for understanding these differences.                            %%%                                                                             The proposed research should lead to an understanding of the                    structure-function relationships of the lipoxygenases.  These                   enzymes and their substrates, the common polyunsaturated acids,                 occur throughout nature.  They have been extensively studied in                 higher plants, as well as more recently in mammals.  Lipoxygenase               products in mammals are potent effectors of vasoconstriction,                   chemotaxis and inflammation.  In plants, the enzyme controls                    phytohormone formation and plant defensive systems.",
