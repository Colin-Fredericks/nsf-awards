 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on reducing the content of                 methane in exhaust gases from vehicles using methane as a fuel.                 The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility of                combining the methane-activating function of partial oxidation                  catalysts and the strong chemisorptive properties of deep                       oxidation catalysts into catalysts that will be active for deep                 methane oxidation at temperatures significantly lower than now                  necessary to be used with currently used platinum catalysts.                                                                                                    Exhaust gases from combustion of methane in vehicles utilizing                  methane as a fuel contain significant amounts of methane.  This                 is likely to impede movement toward acceptability of vehicles                   that utilize methane for a fuel.  Results of this project are                   expected to determine whether the passage of exhaust gases                      through the catalysts synthesized in this project will reduce the               emissions of methane from vehicles using it as a fuel.  The                     proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF                 92-30, Small Business Innovation Research under Topic No. 25d,                  Environmental Systems.",
