 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300474  Conley    This three-year award supports U.S.- Sweden cooperative research  in marine ecology between Daniel J. Conley of the University of  Maryland's Center for Environmental and Estuarine Studies and  Fredrik Wulff of the Department of Systems Ecology, Stockholm  University.  The objective of the research is to determine the  processes controlling the net exchange of nutrients from  sediments of the Baltic Sea.  Using theoretical analyses, field  and laboratory experimental studies and model verifications, the  investigators will work together on determining biogeochemical  control mechanisms in varying geographical areas of the Baltic  Sea.  Annual cruises are planned with researchers from Sweden,  Poland and Russia.    Biogeochemical cycles and processes in a marine system are of  prime concern for local coastal zone and shallow seas.  The  Baltic Sea offers excellent opportunities to study these  processes since it is a well-defined and intensively studied  estuary that has experienced large-scale environmental changes  from eutrophication and human activity.  Both eutrophying  substances and toxic substances (nitrogen and phosphorus) are  increasing in the Baltic, which in turn give rise to storage of  silica in the sediments and low levels of dissolved silicate.   These low levels may have future consequences on species  composition and the food web.  In order to reverse the current  trends in eutrophication, not only found in the Baltic Sea, but  also in other estuaries, the investigators will take sediment  cores from the study sites and characterize them in terms of  their physico-chemical features, and the flux rates for silicate,  dissolved nitrogen species, and phosphorus.  These data will be  used to develop a process oriented model describing the exchanges  of nutrients.  The research will complement and enhance the  present data and advance understanding of the mechanism  underlying changes in the Baltic Sea.  Dr. Conley brings to this  collaboration expertise in the bi ogeochemical cycling of silica.   This is complemented by the Swedish investigator's expertise in  biogeochemical modeling of fluxes of nitrogen, phosphorus and  silica between water and sediments.  ***",
