 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to broaden the agenda for scientific research in                  machine translation, it is proposed to conduct a workshop that will             bring together investigators currently at the forefront of this                 field along with key scientists in related areas of natural                     language processing.  The program has been designed to bring out                the link between evaluation and future directions in MT research.               Evaluation is seen not as a results-oriented activity but rather as             an intellectual exercise that focuses attention on areas in which               research is needed.  The program includes the evaluation of related             NLP research .  In addition, three entire sessions will be devoted              specifically to addressing the issues that MT science is currently              facing:  \"Contributions of Related NLP Research to Future                       Directions in MT,\" and \"Future Directions in MT.\"  Each of these                sessions will be a discussion based on a series of specific topics              prepared in advance by a study team to be designated for this                   purpose, which will guide the debate.  A summary report will be                 prepared for general dissemination.                                                  This activity comes at an important time in the development of             MT science.  Fresh insights are needed, especially from areas of                NLP that incorporate the latest linguistic research in discourse                theory.  The evaluation process,  a spontaneous movement that is                gaining momentum in the MT field throughout the world, helps to                 bring to light the research issues that hold the key to process.",
