This will be accomplished by placing 4He and  3He-4He mixtures inside porous gold and silica aerogel.  These two  substrates, owing to the different manufacturing processes, provide  disorder that are respectively correlated and uncorrelated at large  length scales -- thus allowing for a critical test of current  theoretical ideas.  Preliminary results indicate that when a 3He-  4He mixture is placed inside light aerogel, the coexistence region  at low temperature detaches from the superfluid transition line,  giving rise to a novel miscible superfluid mixture at high 3He  concentration.  This mixture may represent the realization of a  dilute Bose gas system and suggests the possibility of observing an  interpenetrating double superfluid in the limit of zero  temperature.  %%%  In the last twenty years, physicists have made great advances in  understanding the behavior of pure substances undergoing continuous  phase transformations, for example from liquid to vapor or from  superconducting or superfluid states to the normal state.  This  knowledge is not always applicable to realistic situations as most  substances contain defects and impurities.  This project will  investigate the effects of impurities and disorder on the nature of  the continuous phase transitions by placing nature's purest  substance, liquid helium, inside a disordered environment -- porous  glass or porouss gold.  Since the open fraction of the porous  glasses ranges from 0.98 to 0.3, this is akin to the situation  where the impurities constitute from two to twenty percent of a  sample.  Preliminary results indicate that impurities have a  profound and unexpected effect on both the liquid-vapor and the  superfluid transitions, and suggest new mechanisms as to how fluid  mixtures undergo mixing and demixi ng.  ***",
