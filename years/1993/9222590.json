 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project,  supported by the Physical Chemistry Program                   of the Chemistry Division, Prof. C. Johnson of the University                   of North Carolina at Chapel Hill will conduct research in the                   area of diffusion-ordered two-dimensional nuclear magnetic                      resonance spectroscopy.  This research will be devoted to the                   development of techniques and instrumentation, and their                        applications to chemical exchange effects, binding equilibria                   involving surfactants and macromolecules, and micelles and                      micellanes.  Work will also be done on the continued                            development of mobility-ordered two-dimensional nuclear                         magnetic resonance spectroscopy with special emphasis on                        electrokinetic studies  and data analysis for the diffusion and                 mobility of vesicles ranging in size from 50 to 200 nanometers.                 %%%                                                                             The relaxation rates observed in nuclear magnetic resonance                     spectra of condensed media are affected by frictional effects                   determined by the sizes and shapes of molecules as they undergo                 translational and reorientational motions in the medium.  The                   recently developed technique of diffusion-ordered                               two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy allows                  the identification of molecular components of mixtures and the                  simultaneous characterization of the sizes of aggregates and                    other structures present.  Using a variation of this technique,                 mobility-ordered two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance                     spectroscopy, one is able to identify and determine the                         mobilities of ions in condensed media.  The research by                         Professor Johnson serves to improve on these methods and extend                 them into the three dimensional domain.",
