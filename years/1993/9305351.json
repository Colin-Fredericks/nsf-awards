 "awd_abstract_narration": "A compelling question is how animals develop specialized                   organs from a single fertilized egg.  One facet of this process is              the formation of muscle or myogenesis.  When myogenesis is                      duplicated in cell culture, cells turn on numerous genes whose                  expression is required for muscle function.  One such gene is the               skeletal muscle actin gene.  Genes are turned on and off by                     interactions between specialized regulatory proteins and specific               DNA sequences in their promoter or control regions.  Our                        experiments will help determine specific protein-DNA interactions               in the promoter region of the skeletal muscle actin gene which are              important in establishing the different levels of actin gene                    expression observed among cells which have been programmed in                   different ways to become muscle.  We will transfer into different               muscle cells a reporter gene driven by the skeletal muscle actin                gene promoter and establish at what level the reporter gene is                  expressed.  We will next compare results using the same reporter                but with defined deletions in the actin promoter region.  We will               also use \"in vivo footprinting\" to determine more specifically                  where regulatory proteins are bound to the actin promoter in the                DNA of the different cell types.  The results will provide pieces               to the puzzles of gene regulation and development.                              %%%                                                                             A compelling question is how multicellular animals such as mice and             humans develop specialized organs from a single fertilized egg.  We             know that every cell, regardless of its location or function in the             body, contains for the most part the same set of instructions as                every other cell, but that different kinds of cells follow                      different subsets of these instructions.  These instructions are                encoded as genes in DNA.  This project is designed to help                      determine how muscle cells know which instructions to follow.  The              facet of the overall developmental process which results in                     formation of muscle is called myogenesis.  Some steps in myogenesis             can be duplicated with mouse pre-muscle cell lines cultured in the              laboratory.  During myogenesis in culture, cells turn on numerous               genes which code for proteins whose expression is required for                  muscle function.  One such gene is the skeletal muscle actin gene.              This gene is expressed at different levels in different muscle cell             types.  While it is known that the activity of genes is regulated               by interactions between specialized regulatory proteins and                     specific control regions in the DNA, the details of these                       interactions which are important in establishing different levels               of expression of the skeletal muscle actin gene are not completely              known.  Our experiments will use a combination of genetic                       engineering and biochemical techniques to help determine these                  specific protein-DNA interactions and how they might differ among               cells which have been programmed in different ways to become                    muscle.  The results will provide pieces to the puzzles of gene                 regulation and development.  Solution of this puzzle is                         intrinsically attractive because of the undeniable elegance of                  development.  Beyond aesthetics, however, understanding the basic               science of molecular mechanisms of muscle gene expression and                   development may one day lead to applications in understanding and               managing muscle system disorders which are related to failures in               regulated gene expression.",
