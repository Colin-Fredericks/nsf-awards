 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quest for a flexible and efficient knowledge                           representation mechanism is one of the key research problems in                 Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Instantaneous matching of a complex              object description to a large set of predefined objects is a key                computational primitive in many intelligent systems.  This function             of memory based reasoning manifests itself in different activities              such as pattern recognition tasks in computer vision, language                  understanding or general problem solving.  Simultaneous                         satisfaction of many possibly conflicting constraints is another                very important functional requirement in intelligent systems, which             is critical for learning, planning and general problem solving.  It             is generally believed that humans perform such tasks efficiently                (i.e., in almost constant time) by exploiting massive parallelism               in the brain.  This research is aimed at deriving a precise                     characterization of the utility of parallelism in fundamental AI                problems such as constraint solving and matching.  The ultimate                 goal of the research is to produce a computational framework for                parallel intelligent systems.  Specific research objectives are                 design of efficient parallel algorithms for constraint networks,                development of methods to integrate multiple constraint solving                 activities, and applications of generalized matching and constraint             solving to reactive planning, resource allocation and analysis of               scientific data.//",
