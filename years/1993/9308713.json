 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308713  Porter    This project will extend the investigator's prior empirical  research on auctions and bidding and consists of three parts.  The  first consists of an analysis of the incidence and timing of  drilling activity on offshore wildcat oil tracts.  A third of these  tracts are never drilled, and there is significant delay prior to  drilling.  A deadline effect is apparent at the expiration of the  five year lease term.  Initial work indicates that drilling  patterns are inefficient, in that there may be gains from  coordination of drilling plans.  This work will further  characterize the drilling decision, in order to determine how firms  respond to information that becomes available after the lease sale,  and in order to quantify the degree of inefficiency.    The second component consists of a study of joint bidding on  wildcat tracts.  More than half of the bids submitted are joint,  and in 1975 Congress banned joint bids involving two or more of  eight large corporations.  The goal of this research is to  determine the role played by joint bids.  They may foster  competition, by pooling capital or by spreading risk, but they may  have anti-competitive effects by allowing firms to agree to bid  less aggressively.  The project will attempt to discriminate  between these alternative explanations, in order to inform policy  decisions.    The third component will gather data on procurement auctions from  the Justice Department and antitrust trial records.  Previous work  analyzed bid patterns in highway paving contracts let by New York  State in the early 1980s, in auctions where a subset of firms  allegedly engaged in a bid rigging scheme.  This work will examine  other data sets, in order to determine the incidence and  characteristics of bid rigging in other auction markets.  The  empirical techniques employed will differ from those used  previously, as bid rigging schemes depend on the auction rules and  the nature of the goods being sold, and because more detailed data  on the co sts of meeting the contract are available.  The new data  sets will probably include bidding on school milk contracts.    ***",
