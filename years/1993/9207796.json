 "awd_abstract_narration": "The La Selva Biological Station of the Organization for                         Tropical Studies, located in                                                    tropical wet forests of the Republic of Costa Rica, has                         become one of the world's most                                                  active sites for research on the ecology of pristine and                        altered tropical ecosystems.                                                    Recent developments at the Station have fueled a rapid and                      sustained increase in                                                           research usage.  Advanced laboratory facilities, spectacular                    biodiversity resources, a new                                                   Geographic Information/Database Management System, diverse                      habitats for observation                                                        and manipulation, excellent infrastructure, and a welcoming                     socio-political environment                                                     have all contributed to La Selva's continuing growth.                                                                                                           A substantial to fulfilling the research and education                          potential of the station, however,                                              has been the difficulty of access to approximately half of                      the reserve's area.  OTS will                                                   create an appropriate-technology, environmentally benign                        access system for pedestrians,                                                  bicycles, and small electric vehicles.  The Western Annex                       Rapid Transit system (WART)                                                     is a 6-km long, 1.7 m wide paved path that will link                            laboratory/living areas to the most                                             distant sections of La Selva.  Development of the WART                          concept and the environmental                                                   and engineering criteria employed in its design are well                        thought out.  The project will                                                  bring immediate and substantial benefits to researchers                         whose projects range from                                                       molecules to ecosystems, and in habitats from primary                           lowland rain forest to abandoned                                                pastures.  Improved access is critical to realizing La                          Selva's outstanding potential to                                                advance tropical science.  The Western Annex Rapid Transit                      system, using technology                                                        appropriate tot he scale of the transportation problem and                      applied in an                                                                   environmentally-sensitive design, will provide this access.",
