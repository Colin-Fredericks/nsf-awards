This sequence, termed a Mlu1 cell  cycle box or MCB, confers late G1 activity on heterologous  promoters and specifically binds a complex called DSC1 in band  shift assays.  One components component of DSC1 is Swi6.  In Aswi6  antibodies binds DSC1 in band shift assays.  An as yet unidentified  protein in DSC1 is thought to be the primary DNA recognition  polypeptide.  Swi6 is also present in another complex that binds a  related sequence, CACGAAAA, termed in SCB element, that occurs  upstream from the HO and G1 cyclin genes.  In the SCB complex, a  second protein, Swi4, is thought to be the primary DNA recognition  polypeptide.  Given the sequence similarity of MCBs and SCBs and  the fact that both complexes contain Swi6, it is likely that the  DNA recognition polypeptide of the MCB complex resembles Swi4  In  preliminary work several yeast and human genes involved in  regulating DNA synthesis gene expression were isolated from yeast  expression vector libraries using a genetic screen based on  activation of reporter genes containing an MCB element upstream  activation sequence.  One of the novel yeast genes, termed DSA3,  for DNA synthesis gene activator 3, is a particularly strong  activator.  DSA3 may encode the protein that directly recognizes  MCB elements or may encode an upstream regulator of the MCB-binding  complex.  During the proposed 1-year project period, the role of  DSA3 in controlling late G1 DNA synthesis gene expression will be  investigated as follows.  The primary structure of the activator  will be completed to see if it contains domains homologous to  regions of other known proteins.  The function of the activator  will be investigated by determining the effect of deleting the  activator gene on cell viability, DSC1 activity, and DNA synthesis  gene periodicity; by assaying the MCB binding activ ity  of the  activator protein when if is produced by in vitro transcription and  translation; and by identifying proteins that physically interact  with the activator protein.  Results of the analysis will set the  stage for future studies designed to identify other components of  the MCB element activation mechanism, and to determine whether  similar DNA synthesis gene activators are operative in higher  eucaryotes.  %%%  The gene encoding enzymes required for genome replication are  turned on shortly before DNA synthesis begins,  Human tumor  suppressor proteins have been implicated in DNA synthesis gene  regulation, but the overall regulatory mechanism is unresolved.   Studies in yeast have contributed greatly to our understanding of  how these genes are regulated, but two important question remain  unanswered: 1) what protein specifically recognizes the DNA  synthesis genes and targets them f or activation; 2) what protein  senses that the cell has decided to replicated its genome and  triggers the DNA synthesis gene activation mechanism.  Using a  genetic screen, a novel gene that strongly and specifically  activates yeast DNA synthesis genes has been isolated.  During the  proposed project period, the novel gene will be sequenced and its  gene targeting protein or triggering protein.  ***",
