 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of soliton states with energies below the single                   particle gap in charge-density-wave (CDW) conductors is of great                theoretical importance, but as yet, they have not been measured                 directly.  Such states should have fractional charge, and are                   expected to exist at equilibrium in commensurate or nearly                      commensurate systems.  They are also implicated in the conversion               between CDW and normal (band) carriers at electrical contacts.  Two             experiments are proposed to optically observe such states in TaS3.              They combine the expertise of investigators from the Institute of               Radio Engineering and Electronics, Russian Academy of Sciences and              the University of Kentucky; the experiments will be undertaken at               the University of Kentucky.  Bolometric specta will be taken as a               function of uniaxial strain to look for changes in the equilibrium              density and energies of solitons.  Transmission spectra near                    electrical contacts will be taken as functions of CDW current.                  %%%                                                                             Experimental and theoretical research on charge-density-wave (CDW)              conductors such as tantalum trisulfide (TaS3) continues to be of                current interest.  Like superconductors, these materials exhibit                collective electron transport; i.e. the current is carried by                   coherent motion of all the electrons.  Unlike superconductors,                  however, this motion is strongly affected by impurities and other               crystalline defects, leading to a number of unique and surprising               properties.  Defects in the CDW itself, (called \"solitons\") have                energies less than the CDW energy gap.  Such defects are necessary              to convert \"normal\" electrons into CDW electrons at electrical                  contacts; furthermore, fractional electric charge (i.e. less than               the charge of a single electron) is localized at each soliton.                  However, such defect states have never been directly observed.                  This proposal describes two experiments, to be carried out at the               University of Kentucky.  The work is a collaboration between the                host institution and the Institute of Radio Engineering and                     Electronics (Moscow), to look for \"midgap\" soliton states in TaS3               using infrared spectroscopy.  In the first experiment, changes in               the spectra caused by straining the sample, which changes the                   defect concentration, will be sought.  In the second experiment,                changes in spectra near electrical contacts as functions of current             will be explored.",
