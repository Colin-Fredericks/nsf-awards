 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, \"Developing Mathematics Information Centers                      in the Former Soviet Union \u0131FSU!,\" to be performed by the                       American Mathematical Society \u0131AMS! (Dr. Susan                                  Friedlander, Principal Investigator \u0131PI!), will expand its                      existing efforts to assist the development of mathematics                       infrastructure by directly aiding mathematics libraries in the                  FSU and establishing mathematics information centers in                         areas of highly concentrated mathematical activity.  The AMS                    Advisory Committee, which has been coordinating current                         AMS initiatives in this area, funded by donations from AMS                      members and a matching Sloan Foundation grant, would                            provide oversight for this program.  The Advisory Committee                     obtains advice from consultants it has organized in Russia and                  Ukraine, from expatriate FSU scholars resident in the U.S.,                     and from the various Divisions of the Society.  In addition,                    the PI and co-PI's are very knowledgeable about current                         needs of the mathematics community in the FSU, as well as                       existing and planned efforts to aid science in the FSU.  This                   award provides support to demonstrate the effectiveness of                      establishing mathematics information centers and aiding 22                      libraries throughout the FSU by distributing current                            mathematical journals and books.                                                                                                                                The goal of this AMS program is to promote scientific                           interchange between U.S. scientists and their counterparts in                   the FSU, and to establish and foster a capability for                           mathematicians within the fSU to network and communicate,                       and to form and expand alliances within a professional society                  framework for their common benefit.   ***",
