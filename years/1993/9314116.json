 "awd_abstract_narration": "In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes DNA mismatch repair plays major              roles in replicative error correction and genetic recombination.                Disruption of DNA mismatch repair has also been proposed as one                 step in the progression of human neoplasias.  In addition, DNA                  mismatch repair is likely to impact the DNA rearrangements and                  \"hypermutation\" characteristic of immunoglobulin diversification in             higher animals. Mismatch repair might influence the rate of                     expansion of simple sequence repeats that underlies certain forms               of human genetic disease.  The overall goal of this study is to                 determine the roles of newly discovered yeast genes that encode                 polypeptides with structural similarity to bacterial and other                  yeast proteins known to have roles in DNA mismatch repair.  We have             discovered additional genes in yeast (the MLH genes) that show                  significant amino acid homology with the MutL gene of the bacterium             E. coli, and the PMS1 gene of yeast (a mutL-like mismatch repair                gene).  We will determine the nucleotide sequence of the yeast MLH              genes, perform the requisite gene disruptions and determine initial             phenotypes of the mutants in vegetative cells, e.g. mutator                     effects.  We will examine the role of the MLH genes in genetic                  recombination.  We will test for functional similarity between the              yeast and mammalian MLH gene products.  A study of these newly                  found PMS1/mutL homologs should lead to a better understanding of               mismatch repair in yeast.  Finally, structural and functional                   comparisons of the yeast and mammalian MLH genes should help to                 guide the more demanding analysis of MLH gene functions in the                  mouse.                                                                          %%%                                                                             In all organisms DNA mismatch repair plays major roles in gene                  recombination and in correcting errors in gene replication.  DNA                mismatch repair may also be a significant factor in the development             of human tumors and in certain human genetic diseases; it probably              also important in the normal functioning of the immune system.  The             overall goal of this study is to determine the roles of newly                   discovered yeast genes that encode proteins with structural                     similarity to other proteins known to have roles in DNA mismatch                repair.  This study should lead to a better understanding of                    mismatch repair in yeast and should help to guide the more                      demanding analysis of the phenomenon in mammals.",
