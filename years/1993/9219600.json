 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the prior NSF grant period this laboratory cloned and                        characterized a higher plant (tomato) calcium-ATPase gene closely               related to the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase of             animal cells.  They also observed that its messenger RNA abundance              increased dramatically following salt exposure, suggesting that                 this calcium-ATPase may play a role in the mitigation of                        deleterious effects of elevated cytosolic calcium, proposed to                  result from extracellular salt exposure.  Molecular cloning of this             calcium-ATPase now provides the basis to characterize it at the                 molecular level, including a critical assessment of its role in                 cellular responses to salt, and perhaps other stresses.  The                    objectives of the current phase of this research are to:  1)                    establish the precise subcellular localization of this class of                 calcium-ATPase, 2) elucidate the basis for the accumulation of                  multiple calcium-ATPase messenger RNA transcripts, 3) determine the             factors regulating calcium-ATPase gene expression, especially in                response to stress, and 3) critically assess its physiological                  function in responses to environmental stress using transgenic                  plants with altered calcium-ATPase gene expression.                             %%%                                                                             The regulation of cytosolic calcium levels is widely recognized as              a central element of cellular regulatory processes in eukaryotes,               and is essential to the proposed role for calcium as a second                   messenger.  In addition, it has been proposed that salt and                     chilling stress in plants may induce, as the primary cellular                   insult, increases in cytosolic calcium levels.  Both calcium-                   ATPases and a calcium/proton pumps maintain calcium homeostasis in              the cytosol of plant cells.  Based on extensive characterization of             ATP-dependent calcium transport in membrane vesicles prepared from              plant cells, there appear to be at least two calcium-ATPases with               properties likely to be important in the maintenance of very low                cytosolic calcium levels:  one located in the plasma membrane and               one in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.  In spite of the                     relatively extensive characterization of calcium transport                      activities catalyzed by plant calcium-ATPases, little success has               been reported in their purification and molecular characterization.             Research from this laboratory has begun to fill in these gaps, and              the proposed continuation of these studies promises to provide more             critical information on the cellular mechanisms involved in plant               responses to their environment.",
