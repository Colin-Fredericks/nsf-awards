The Conference will provide a forum for                  the presentation of state-of-the-art research findings in the                   area of fracture to an audience of leading workers.  It is the                  eight in a series of such Conferences that started in 1965.  They               are held once every four years at different locations in the                    world, and are attended by eminent researchers.  The gathering of               these individuals at the Conference will allow for personal                     interactions that will provide exchange of information and ideas,               and the possible formation of new research groups.  Proceedings                 of the Conference will be published and will thus be available as               an important archival resource for future use by the engineering,               science and technology communities.",
