 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the relative importance of various influences on                  the behavior of elected representives is one of the central                     concerns of modern political-economy.  Among the possible                       influences are the representative's constituency, campaign                      contributions and lobbying efforts by special interest groups,                  the representative's own preferences, and pressures from various                party and nonparty leaders, such as the president and committee                 chairmen.  Although aggregated vote data are often used to                      measure citizens' preferences in empirical studies of                           representation, and are also analyzed in studies of direct                      democracy, there has been little work carefully linking the                     statistical models to well-defined models of voter choice.  As a                result, the behavioral assumptions underlying these empirical                   studies are often vague.  This is especially problematic for                    analyses of voting data, because of past work showing that many                 widely used statistical techniques are probably inconsistent with               certain reasonable models of voter behavior.  The contribution of               the project comes from developing a framework for the statistical               analysis of aggregated vote data of the sort that researchers                   often encounter in the study of ballot propositions and candidate               elections, that is based on the standard spatial voting model.                  The framework is applied in a number of empirical studies of                    voting data on ballot propositions in California and other states               over various periods since 1892.  These studies utilize not only                voting data on ballot propositions, but also demographic                        information, data on voting in presidential, gubernatorial and                  other elections, and data on roll-call voting in state                          legislatures and the U.S. Congress.  One particularly important                 issue is the extent to which elected representatives act in the                 interest of a majority of their constituents.",
