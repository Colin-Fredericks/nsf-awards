 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309189  Hodgins  This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  Humans  are excellent at recovering from physical failures:  we can often  catch ourselves when we slip on ice, trip over an electric cord, or  miss a step.  We can sometimes catch a dropped object and prevent  it from breaking.  We are not always successful in recovering from  errors but present-day robots rarely even attempt such behavior.   An ability to recover from errors would allow robots to operate  more robustly in unpredictable and unstructured environments.  This  research aims to provide robots with a few simple reflexes: a  tripping reflex that will allow a legged robot to recover from a  stumble, a slipping reflex that will allow it to cross a slippery  floor without falling, and a catching reflex that will allow it to  interrupt the fall of a dropped object and prevent it from  breaking.  The reflexes will be designed and tested in simulation  and on experimental hardware.  Reflex responses are unlike most  robot control algorithms because of the time constraints of a  rapidly evolving dynamic system and because of the need to respond  to discontinuous events.  These properties make this an ideal  domain for exploring questions of parameterization and choice of  strategies for control.  This work will help to provide a  scientific foundation upon which useful transportation and  manipulation systems for unstructured environments may be  constructed, and perhaps to explain some behaviors observed in  biological systems.",
