The critical aspect                                 of this study is to control the cluster size                                    within narrow range.  Many generation methods                                   lead to a broad size distribution.  One method                                  to limit this is to produce the metal clusters                                  within a molecular size cage or channel as one                                  finds in molecular sieves called zeolites.  In                                  addition to ESR and associated optical                                          spectroscopies (infared and diffuse                                             reflectance), the researchers propose a pulse                                   ESR method known as Electron Spin Echo                                          Modulation (ESEM) as a major new tool in                                        characterizing the reactivity of silver cluster                                 species in zeolites.  By analyzing the                                          modulation signal associated with weak                                          electron-nuclear dipolar interactions, it is                                    possible to determine the coordination geometry                                 of paramagnetic species with adsorbed                                           molecules.  In favorable cases this should                                      provide the structure details, not readily                                      obtainable by other techniques, such as the                                     number of adsorbate molecules, their                                            orientation as well as the changes of                                           coordination geometry in the course of                                          reaction.  Thus, rather detailed structural                                     information about reaction intermediates can be                                 obtained by using a combination of ESR, ESEM,                                   diffuse relectance and infrared spectroscopies                                  which will improve our knowledge about the                                      mechanism of heterogenous catalysis on metal                                    clusters.                                                                                                                                                       This project in radiation chemistry fulfills                                    the program objective of advancing scientific                                   knowledge by enabling leading experts in Poland                                 and the United States to combine complementary                                  talents and pool resources in areas of strong                                   mutual interest and competence.",
