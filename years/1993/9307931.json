 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glycoconjugates are widely distributed in nature as glycoproteins,              glycolipids and proteoglycans.  The past decade has produced an                 extraordinary burst of activity in this field.  Crucial roles for               glycoconjugates have been defined for hormone binding, growth                   factors and toxins.  Furthermore, roles have been defined in                    fertilization, differentiation, immune response and the social                  behavior of cells.  These phenomena have contributed to stimulating             investigators to clone the enzymes involved in glycoconjugates                  metabolism.  The growth of glycoconjugate research into Molecular               Biology is complemented by technical improvements to determine                  structure, such as NMR spectroscopy, X-ray  crystallography and                 computer modelling.  The recent advances in this field will be                  presented at the XIIth International Symposium in Poland in August,             by the most active and well-known scientists in their respective                areas.                                                                          %%%                                                                             Young scientists from the USA will be given the opportunity to                  attend the XIIth International Symposium on Glycoconjugates.  The               purpose of this meeting is to present and discuss the major                     advances in the structure and function of glycoproteins,                        glycolipids and proteoglycans.  Application of the recent findings              to biology, medicine, agriculture and biotechnology will represent              the major thrust of the meeting.  This symposium provides an                    important opportunity and forum for exchange of research                        information on an international level.",
