 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biodiversity is generated by the process of speciation and                maintained by factors preventing interbreeding of distinct species              (i.e. reproductive isolation). Reproductive isolation is most                   readily studied in situations like that involving the minnow                    species, Luxilus cornutus and Luxilus chrysocephalus, which                     interbreed                                                                      extensively in the eastern United States.  Dr. Thomas Dowling of                Arizona State University has been studying genetic interactions                 between these two hybridizing species, and he has identified                    geographic variation in the effectiveness of factors maintaining                reproductive discontinuity.  This study expands upon Dr. Dowling's              previous research by examining eastern locations where the two                  species co-occur and adjacent areas to the west and south,                      providing complete characterization of geographic variation in                  reproductive isolation.  Sequence variation of the mitochondrial                DNA control region is being used to infer phylogenetic                          relationships of cornutus and chrysocephalus populations and                    identify the                                                                    importance of pre- and post-Pleistocene effects in structuring of               genetic variation within these species.  Comparisons of these                   relationships with the pattern of reproductive isolation will allow             for tests of the role of ancestry, dispersal, and geological                    history in geographic variation of reproductive isolation.                      Likewise, population phylogenies will allow for examination of the              role of hydrographic history and dispersal on the distribution of               genetic variation within each of these species, providing a test of             hypotheses concerning the origin of species diversity in the                    Central Highlands region, one of the most diverse faunas in North               America.",
