 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309539  Barlow     The compound eye of the horseshoe crab, Limulus, has been a model  system in visual research for decades.   The visual sensitivity of  the eyes of this animal undergo a million-fold change between  daytime and nighttime, controlled partly by an internal \"circadian  clock\" that enables the animal to see underwater in dim moonlight  as well as in bright sunlight.  This project involves a unique  approach with novel techniques in behavior and in neurophysiology.   The objectives are to investigate the visual behavior during day  and night, the activity patterns in the optic nerve in behaving  animals, and the neural coding that underlies \"approach\" behavior  to certain kinds of targets.  Behavioral techniques provide precise  measurements of what the animal can see and how well it can see  under different lighting levels.  Physiological techniques allow  recordings of optic nerve activity from behaving animals by both  tether and by sonar telemetry.  Studies are done on behavior and  physiology in the controlled environment of the laboratory and in  the animal's natural habitat of the ocean, and data will be  incorporated into related studies on computational models of visual  processing.  Results will reveal concepts of how neural activity is  related to behavior, and will have impact not only on studies of  vision, but across many areas of neuroscience, with potential  further implications for artificial vision for robotics development  as well as for possible aids for low vision.  ***",
