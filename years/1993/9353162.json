 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9353162  Purdue University  West Lafayette, IN  Todd-Hicks, Regina and Vanable, Joseph    The primary objective of this project is to stimulate minority  Middle School students to develop an interest in and a facility for  science, and as a result, to choose science as a career.  A  secondary objective (whose achievement should help with attaining  the first) is to stimulate Middle School teachers to reinvigorate  their teaching efforts in their home institutions.    To achieve these objectives, 50 under-represented minority students  from major Indiana cities and eight of their teachers will be  selected for a summer program on the West Lafayette campus of  Purdue University.  The students will have finished the 7th grade  and must show promise for achievement in science and mathematics.   The program will be held for four weeks, and will progress through  a three-year cycle, each successive year building on the previous  one.  At the end of the cycle (assuming the program continues to be  supported), a new cohort of students will be recruited.  To replace  those lost by attrition during a cycle, new students will be  recruited for the 2nd and 3rd years from students who have  completed the 8th and 9th grades, respectively.  Parents will be an  integral part of the program; they will attend workshops at the  beginning and at the mid-point of the program that focus on their  role in helping their sons and daughters to choose a career, and in  sustaining their educational efforts.    The summer program will use several approaches: (1) Inquiry-based  lecture/discussion/laboratory experiences that focus on interesting  aspects of four areas of science: Biology, chemistry, Earth &  Atmospheric Sciences, and Physics (one per week each year).   Although there will be no Mathematics or computer Sciences per se.   These disciplines will permeate the four subjects chosen.  These  experiences should increase the students' knowledge of these areas,  but more importantly, they should engender a sense  that doing  science is a quest, rather than merely memorizing \"facts.\"  We very  much hope that this point would be reinforced in the Middle school  teachers of these students, as well, as they participate in the  lectures, laboratories, and discussions.  (2) Opportunities for  careers in science will be identified during the daytime lecture/  laboratory/discussion sessions, and by visits to laboraties on and  off campus.  Career exploration and evaluation will also be an  important part of evening sessions held in the dormitories, both  with University staff and with representatives from industry.   Particular emphasis will be given to pointing out the issue of  under- representation of minority persons in science, and  highlighting the contributions of minority scientists, both past  and present.          (3) Help to encourage analytical thinking and help to develop  strategies for academic success not only in the lectures, lab  activities, and discussions during the day, but also by various  means in the evening sessions (e.g., sharpening reasoning powers in  the context of enjoyable games; exploring test-taking skills;  emphasizing the value of studying in groups).",
