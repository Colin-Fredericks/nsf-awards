 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304734  Trinkle  This is the first year of a three year continuing award.  The  research addresses automatic planning for robotic systems  performing contact tasks with movable objects in uncertain  environments.  Tasks in this class include mechanical assembly  operations, dexterous manipulation, and fine motion tasks.  The  objective of this research project is to develop a practical,  reliable planner for robotic contact tasks.  The planner will  operate in two stages.  In the first stage, parameter uncertainty  will be ignored to reduce the dimension of the space to be searched  for a manipulation plan.  The geometry of that space will be  determined and regions in which the multibody contact model admits  multiple solutions will be identified and avoided.  In the second  stage, the plan found in the first stage will be modified to make  it robust with respect to variations in the uncertain parameters.   The second stage will not involve a search, so its computational  complexity will be relatively low.  It will however involve  understanding the geometric variation in the space as a function of  the uncertain parameters.  To demonstrate the results of the  proposed research, a planner for planar manipulation systems will  be implemented in a distributed computing environment, with  parallel computers used where appropriate.  A prototype manipulator  system with position, torque, and tactile sensors will be designed  and built to test generated plans.  ***",
