Robust system identification algorithms  produce models that are appropriate for use in robust design.  In  particular, the resulting models are accompanied by a  quantification of the identification error which allows a  subsequent design to proceed against a family of possible  systems.  The combination of the envisioned robust system  identification methods from this research program with robust  design procedures from control and communication theory will  enable important technologies to operate at higher performance  and reliability than they currently are able to attain.    The research issues that will be addressed in this program are  the continued development of existing robust system  identification methods (in particular, to address practical  implementation issues), the extension of robust system  identification methods to classes of system models not previously  addressed (in particular, to time varying and finite time  duration processes) and the application of the system  identification algorithms developed to important technological  areas.  The application of the system identification algorithms  developed to important technological areas.  The relevant  application studies that are part of the proposed research  program are robust detection techniques involving underwater  acoustics and high performance control of a flexible structure.  ***",
