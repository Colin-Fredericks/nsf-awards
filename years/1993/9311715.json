 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will be the ninth in a series of international               conferences on bacteriophage biology.  In earlier years, the                    meetings focused on temperate bacteriophages and were devoted to                bacteriophage lambda.  The 1993 workshop will focus on                          transcription, replication, DNA rearrangements and macromolecular               structure.  Genetic engineering continues to rely upon                          bacteriophage technology for gene manipulation, DNA sequencing,                 structural analysis, gene expression and screening.                             %%%                                                                             This meeting deals with fundamental problems in molecular biology               involving bacteriophage and their bacterial hosts.  Progress in                 understanding these processes at the molecular level has                        contributed greatly to the accelerating advances in recombinant DNA             research.  New techniques developed in bacteriophage biology                    rapidly find their way into the mainstream of recombinant DNA                   research and into industrial applications.  Without an ongoing                  community actively involved in basic research in phage biology, it              is likely that many of these innovations would not have come about.",
