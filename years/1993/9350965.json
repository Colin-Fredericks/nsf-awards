 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the potential for tens of millions of transistors enclosed                 within a package that grants only limited access to the                         internal circuitry, it is a challenge to determine whether a                    modern integrated circuit is fully functional. The Computer                     Engineering Department at the University of Minnesota, Duluth,                  is introducing a VLSI circuit design class in the Fall of 1993,                 and faces the task of testing the integrated circuits that                      students design. This project is adding a Logic Analysis System                 to an existing data acquisition lab to form a test station for                  functionally testing and characterizing digital integrated                      circuits. The existing data acquisition equipment, acquired                     through a prior NSF-ILI grant in 1988, is serving as the                        foundation for the test station, providing control functions                    and analog stimulus and measurement capabilities. The new                       equipment is adding the capability of exercising the device                     under test with a stream of test vectors and capturing its                      response at high speed. With NSF's help, this new equipment is                  enhancing the function of the existing NSF-supported data                       acquisition equipment to form a complete test station for                       testing and characterizing students' digital integrated circuit                 designs. The addition of this equipment is enabling development                 of a future course on techniques for testing and design for                     testability ideas.",
