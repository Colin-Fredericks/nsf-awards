 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an SGER award to investigate the use of visual programming              languages via pen-based computers.  The basic hypothesis to be                  tested is the utility of the pen-base programming approach in a                 human-computer interactive sense as compared with other approaches              such as mouse-based visual programming.  Also those aspects of pen-             based machines that make them particularly suitable for graphics                programming ar investigated.  The approach consists of converting               an existing visual programming system to the pen-based environment,             moving from an iconic structure to a system capable of accepting                hand-drawn diagrams.  Then the two systems are compared for                     usability, facility, and general user acceptance.  Collaborative                pen-based work is also considered in the process of investigating               the visual pen-based programming approach.",
