 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant morphogenesis relies on the continued proliferation and                   differentiation of cells derived from the shoot apical meristem. In             response to a variety of signals, cells in the shoot apical                     meristem convert from vegetative to floral growth. This switch is               accompanied by a number of morphological and biochemical changes,               resulting in a change in the pattern of organ initiation and the                type of organ that is formed. In addition, intercellular signals                appear to be required for establishing the floral pattern. Dr.                  Irish proposes to investigate these processes in Arabidopsis by                 characterizing some of the key genes required for establishing both             the floral pattern of organogenesis and specific tissue identities.             She will take two approaches to address these problems. By using                both molecular and genetic techniques, she hopes to clarify the                 pathway(s) involved in establishing the floral pattern by defining              new genes required to specify the first steps in floral                         morphogenesis. In addition she proposes clonal analysis experiments             aimed at testing the cellular autonomy of previously characterized              mutations, which allow her to define the gene products involved in              cell-cell signalling mechanisms required for the development of the             floral pattern.",
