 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Czech research project between               Anne Greenbaum of the New York University Courant Institute and                 Zdenek Strakos of the Institute of Computer and Informations                    Science, Czech Academy of Sciences, is to analyze and develop                   iterative methods for solving the non-symmetric linear systems and              eigenvalue problems that arise in many areas of scientific                      computing.  Current iterative methods for solving such problems                 are sometimes effective but lack a firm theoretical foundation and              may not be robust.  Dr. Greenbaum and Dr. Strakos intend to                     develop criteria for determining the effectiveness of an iterative              method and to design new methods for which these criteria will be               satisfied.  They will analyze Krylov space methods for shich these              criteria will be satisfied.  They will analyze Krylov space methods             and consider the advantages of choosing approximations from                     different spaces as well.  The researchers hope to explain the                  success of the biconjugate gradient and QMR (Quasi-Minimal                      Residual) methods and to analyze the effects of finite precision                arithmetic on these algorithms.  They also will study the potential             for parallelism in various algorithms and develop parallel                      implementations for specific machine architectures.  Altogether                 results are expected to contribute to our ability to solve large sparse         linear equations.  Iterative algorithms for such problems are keys to           numerous computational solution methods in science and                          engineering.                                                                                                                                                    This project in computational mathematics fulfills the program                  objectives of advancing science by enabling leading experts in the              U.S. and Czechoslovakia to combine complementary talents and                    pool research resources in the areas of strong mutual interest and              competence.",
