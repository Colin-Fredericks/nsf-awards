 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maria Mitchell Observatory employs undergraduate students in                astronomical research in the topics of Galactic structure, Galactic             chemical evolution, stellar evolution, and variable stars.                      Projects take advantage of current observational data, including                the resources of the Maria Mitchell Observatory's photographic                  plate collection, and are generally related to the research                     interests and activities of scientists on the permanent staff and               visiting scientists supervising research.  Ongoing research will                focus on photometry of star clusters to determine the ages and the              morphology of cluster evolutionary sequences and medium and high                resolution spectroscopy of stars in both clusters and the Galactic              field to study the chemical structure and evolution of the Galactic             disk.  The research will also include investigations of variable                stars of particular current interest.  The 80 year time-line                    provided by the Observatory's plate collection will be used.  The               program may expand to include theoretical astrophysics and other                observational fields as the program diversifies.                                                                                                                The Observatory intends to bring six students to participate in the             REU program held in the summer and up to four students to carry out             research in the autumn.  Research projects are designed to                      introduce students to varied aspects of data reduction and                      analysis, using recently acquired as well as archival data, and to              involve students in all aspects of a research work.  The students               are encouraged to view the projects as their own independent work,              to take responsibility for all aspects of its execution and                     completion, and as a result, to obtain recognition through                      authorship of the scientific results.",
