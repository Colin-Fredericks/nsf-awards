He will collect and analyze samples                                     that will be used as the basis for a                                            petrographic study of stone artifacts in                                        eastern India, defined as Bihar and Bengal,                                     including Bangladesh.  The study seeks the                                      identification of the sources of rocks used in                                  the production of religious artifacts of                                        various dates and provenance within eastern                                     India.  This area was drawn together under the                                  Pala dynasty, between the 9th and 12th                                          centuries, when most of the artifacts were                                      made.  The determination of the sources of                                      stones can lead to identification of economic                                   and cultural patterns.                                                                                                                                          Scope: The project will be carried by Dr. Asher                                 with support from the Archeology Department of                                  India.  The study can lead to establishing                                      petrographic studies of artifacts as a viable                                   method for establishing the sources of stones                                   used in these artifacts, as well as to tracing                                  patterns of trade and economic and cultural                                     zones.  The project fits the objectives of the                                  U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program",
