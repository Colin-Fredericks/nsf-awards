 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the 1970's there has been a major resurgence of interest in               the topic of latent variable models.  Latent variable models are                broadly defined as variables which enter the formulation of an                  econometric model and yet are not (directly) observable.  Latent                variables are widely recognized to be major components of the                   behavior of economic agents.  They are inherently dynamic for a                 broad class of models including intertemporal optimization,                     search or duration processes, error correction mechanisms, habit                formation or persistence, rational expectations and state                       dependence.  The likelihood functions of dynamic latent variable                models are mostly analytically intractable, largely because the                 elimination of the latent variables require high dimensional                    interdependent integration with the additional complication that                the actual distribution of the latent variables conditional on                  the observables can rarely be seen.  Without likelihood                         functions, it is impossible to rigorously and accurately test                   economic theories with real-world data because one can not answer               the question what is the probability that the observations are                  due to chance and do not reflect the theory being tested.  A                    number of Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been developed                 and used to estimate the characteristics of these likelihood                    functions.  The main problem arises from the fact the \"brute                    force\" MC estimates of likelihood functions typically take a                    prohibitively large number of iterations for all but small sample               sizes.  A number of acceleration techniques are currently                       available.  These techniques can produce fairly dramatic                        efficiency gains (by a factor of 1,000 or more), but they come                  nowhere close to what is actually required in order to render MC                likelihood evaluation practical for moderate to large sample                    sizes.  The contribution of this project comes from developing a                new generic acceleration technique that in a pilot study achieved               results unheard of in the econometric literature.  All                          indications are that the new technique might well constitute a                  major leap in Monte Carlo technology.                                                                                                                           This project operationalizes the new acceleration technique                     within the context of a broad range of dynamic latent variable                  models.  By removing a key stumbling block to the analysis of                   dynamic latent variable models, the new technique opens                         intriguing new avenues of research across a broad range of                      important economic applications.  In this project the technique                 is applied it to a set of substantive real-life applications                    drawn from the recent literature on financial markets,                          disequilibrium models and housing markets.  Systematic                          comparisons with results derived under alternative techniques                   provide an assessment of the merits of the new techniques from a                practitioner's viewpoint.  Software needed to use the new                       technique will be made available to other researchers.",
