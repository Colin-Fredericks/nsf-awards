 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314639  Kapoor    One of the most important and basic industries for any  industrialized country is the \"Machine Tool Industry\".  Machine  Tools are not only the most basic foundation of any manufacturing  industry, but also one of the most reliable indexes of industrial  economy since the demand and supply of machine tools directly  relate to state of the industrial needs.  The U.S. has been the  leading country of machine tools in the world since World War II.   However, recently the U.S. is fourth in the world machine tool  production after Japan, Germany, and U.S.S.R.   The increasing  trends toward \"integrated flexibility\" in production systems  suggests future machining system must blur the boundaries between  \"operation\" and \"operation planning\", between \"material handling\"  and \"material processing\", and between \"the so-call \"agile  manufacturing\" and \"mass manufacturing.\"  An Industry/University  Cooperative Research Center for Machine-Tool System Research at the  University of Illinois - Urbana has been established to address  these issues.    The initial research agenda of machine tool system research Center  will address: 1.) system/planning and control; 2.) machine tool  structure; 3.) process development and innovation.  A new  initiative \"SMARTCUTS\" is to design, build, and test a future  generation machine tool system that represents a major step forward  in the advancement of machining technology.  Currently, there are  8 company sponsors involved in Center's research projects and  committing approximately $340,000/year.      The Principle Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues at  the University of Illinois - Urbana have the knowledge and  facilities to run this Center.      The Program Manager recommends the University of Illinois,  Champaign be awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year  continuing award.      Near the end of each 12 month period the Program Director and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the  progress of the Center on a number of criteria,  including the following: 1.) the extent to which the  university/industry interaction is developing; 2.) the extent  to  which the support base is developing; 3.) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Director will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
