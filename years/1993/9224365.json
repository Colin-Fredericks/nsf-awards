These form the basis on which the U.S.                  Government can promise its citizens that the Social Security System                                                                                             will be fair and equitable to all who apply.  It has been argued,                                                                                               however, that eligibility determination is biased by virtue of the                                                                                              existence of \"gendered\" concepts in the official Listings of                    Impairments, in the medical judgments made for the record by                    physicians, and in the hearings and decisions of Administrative Law                                                                                             Judges.  It is suggested that these \"gendered\" concepts result in                                                                                               some applicants being ignored, categorized or stereotyped based on                                                                                              gender.  If this argument is correct, the standardized measures may                                                                                             be biased and the procedural safeguards ineffective.  It is                     important, therefore, to determine whether or not such \"gendered\"                                                                                               biasing occurs.                                                                                                                                                 This doctoral dissertation will examine the application of the                  Listings of Impairments and concomitant medical judgments to 150                                                                                                closed cases that were denied and then appealed to the federal                  courts in order to identify any unstated assumptions and norms                  influencing the process.  Cases will be selected from federal                   courts in Dallas, San Francisco and Boston (representing three                  different geographical regions).  The proposed analysis will                    include full transcripts of administrative hearings and judicial                                                                                                decisions as well as the criteria in the Listings of Impairments                                                                                                and the internal rules and regulations of the Social Security                   System.  These texts will be subjected to various forms of                      qualitative analysis, including computerized content analysis based                                                                                             on appropriate coding categories.                                                                                                                               This research will make an important contribution toward enhancing                                                                                              fairness and equity in the Social Security System.  It will also                                                                                                contribute to our theoretical understanding of how possibly biased                                                                                              (but conventional) assumptions affect judicial and quasi-judicial                                                                                               decision-making.",
