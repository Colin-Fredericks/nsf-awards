 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the \"great chain of being\" humankind is placed at the top of the             hierarchy of creation.  In science, ironically, the study of humans             and their behavior is ranked at the bottom in prestige and funding.             Physical and biological sciences are \"hard\" sciences while social               sciences are \"soft.\"  This ranking is maintained even within the                \"science of science\" which has sought to support via citation                   studies the view that scientific research within the physical and               biological sciences are progressive along a fast-moving research                front while the softer social and behavioral sciences fail to                   progress beyond the founding theories of their disciplines.                                                                                                     Derek de Solla Price, founder of the modern \"science of science\"                argued in 1965 and 1970 that a basic feature of the production of               scientific knowledge is researchers' tendency to build on                       relatively recent work.  Price claimed that this tendency evidences             a cumulative enterprise in which scholars extend recently won                   knowledge, and that it distinguishes the production of scientific               knowledge from humanistic knowledge.  If this is true, he argued,               reference networks for scientific literatures should show a                     concentration of references to relatively recently published papers             --the \"research front\"--and few to older papers--the \"archive.\"                 Price argued that humanistic scholarship shows a different pattern,             one in which the age of a previously published document is                      uncorrelated with its probability of being cited.  Finally, he                  claimed that reference networks in the social and behavioral                    sciences fall somewhere between these two extremes.                                                                                                             Although Price's thesis has been an important guiding principle in              \"scientometrics\" and bibliometrics, he presented only weak evidence             for these claims.  Professor Hargens is examining whether research              in different fields generate the characteristic reference-network               patterns Price hypothesized.  Such a study will provide evidence on             putative differences--or similarities--between \"hard\" and \"soft\"                sciences, and will allow us to begin integrating results from                   micro-studies of individual journal articles and macro-studies of               entire research literatures",
