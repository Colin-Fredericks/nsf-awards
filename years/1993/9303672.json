Analyses are being done on sediment trap materials collected in the             Gulf of California at 2 week intervals during the period August                 1990 to February 1993.  The samples provide an opportunity to test              fluctuations in UK37 through multiple nutrient and plankton                     productivity cycles (including bloom periods of Emiliania huxleyi)              over an annual temperature range of ca. 15 Degree C and to directly             compare the molecular temperature values with measured SST.  Thus,              the proposed study will test the veracity of UK37, as defined for               normal marine conditions in Pacific waters, over multiple seasonal              oscillations and through a broad temperature range.  The                        investigation is also evaluating the molecular record of marine                 plankton biomass and their diversity through multiple seasonal                  cycles.  The concentration profiles observed for biologically                   specific compounds will be compared with independent plankton                   counts obtained from concurrent micropaleontological studies on the             same samples by other investigators.  Thus, molecular trends will               be tested as signals of temporal variability in plankton population             dynamics.  The analyses will enhance the of molecular signals of                environmental and climatic change in the sediment record.//",
