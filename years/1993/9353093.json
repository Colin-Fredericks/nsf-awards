 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353093     Friedlander  Dr. Friedlander's recent research involves the study of certain  problems related to the equation of hydrodynamics (the Euler  equations and the Navier-Strokes equations) and to the extended  system of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics.  The mathematics  employed includes techniques from partial differential equations,  asymptotic methods and dynamical systems.  The problems studied are   motivated by questions that arise in geophysical and astrophysical  fluid dynamics.  This research project will involve joint work with  M.M. Vishik.  Dr. Friedlander will continue her investigation of  several facets of these problems.  The research is described under  four headings:  (I) The \"fast\" dynamo problem; (II) Instability  criteria for the Euler equations; (III) The existence of a complete  system of Floquet root vectors in time periodic of fluid dynamics;  (IV) Magnetohydrodynamic stability.    Interactive activities at the host institution include:  (1)  teaching a graduate course on mathematical topics in fluid  dynamics; (2) mentoring and counseling women students and postdocs  in the mathematical sciences; and (3) organizing a two-day workshop  of colloquium style lectures given by distinguished women  mathematicians.    This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to  provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in  engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and  (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering  by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers  employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By  encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable  investment in the Nation's future significantly.  ***",
