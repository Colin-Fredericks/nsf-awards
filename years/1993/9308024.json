 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308024  Silver    Cell division is a central feature in the life of every living  cell.  It is known from the work of this and other laboratories  that intracellular free calcium is an essential regulator of  specific biochemical and physiological aspects of mitosis.  This  laboratory is identifying patterns of calcium transients during the  cell cycle in normal sand dollar blastomeres, using calcium-  dependent aequorin luminescence, multi-spectral video microscopy  and high performance computational analysis of discrete calcium  signals in intracellular microdomains.  Prior results show that  calcium is released into the cytoplasm in discrete, short-lived,  and highly localized pulses within local regions, or microdomains.   Computational analyses, including three-dimensional Fourier  analysis, show that spatial and temporal patterns of calcium  release vary in characteristic fashions throughout the cell cycle.   The goal is to decipher the spatial and temporal patterns of   calcium release associated with specific steps in mitosis known to  be dependent upon calcium-sensitive biochemical pathways (e.g.  nuclear envelope breakdown, anaphase onset, and cytokinesis).  In  this way a library of descriptors of calcium release patterns  associated with specific mitotic events will be assembled.  In  addition, biochemical studies of how the cell mediates the  localized release of calcium within microdomains of the cytoplasm  are underway.  The present focus of the biochemical studies is the  role of phospholipid metabolism in regulating calcium release,  particularly phospholipases and other enzymes associated with the  arachidonate pathway whose lipid-derived products (e.g. inositol  trisphosphate, leukotrienes, arachidonic acid) are known to  mobilize calcium from intracellular stores.  Monoclonal antibodies  to phospholipases A2, C and D, and antibodies to thromboxane  synthase and cyclooxygenase label endomembranes associated with the   cytoskeleton and mitotic apparatus.  Which of these enzyme s are  associated with which endomembrane system, which lipid-derived  products can serve to release calcium from endomembranes in vitro,  and which may be acting in vivo to mediate calcium release  associated with mitotic events will be determined.  %%%  It is known from the work of this and other laboratories that  intracellular free calcium is an essential regulator of biochemical  and physiological aspects of mitosis, the process by which one cell  divides to become two.  The long-term goal of this technically  demanding research is to understand the regulation of intracellular  calcium on a physiological time scale and in three dimensions  within an egg cell undergoing division.  In vitro experiments on  the biochemical role of lipid-derived mediators of calcium release  will complement in vivo experiments using sophisticated video  imagery to develop a three-dimensional picture of when and where  within the cell calcium is released.  The results of this research  will be a major contribution to our understanding of the regulation  of mitosis.  ***",
