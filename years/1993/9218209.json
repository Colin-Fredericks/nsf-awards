 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coastal region of northern California from latitude of 38o             to 41oN represents a region in which the present tectonic regime                changes abruptly from subduction to transform motion at the                     Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ).  Because the triple junction is                migrating north along the coast of North America, an understanding              of the crust and upper mantle structure in this region will provide             insights into the tectonic evolution of the entire U.S. west coast              continental margin as well as other convergent margins worldwide.               This project involves an integrated seismic experiment to image                 the structure of the crust and upper mantle immediately before and              after passage of the MTJ.  This study represents an important part              of a long-term, multi-disciplinary effort on the part of many                   investigators to exploit this well defined system as an in-situ                 laboratory to study physical and  chemical processes associated                 with mantle upwelling, melt segregation and migration, tectonic                 accretion, and crustal deformation in both transform and convergent             tectonic settings, and to evaluate the implications of these                    processes for continental growth and evolution.                                                                                                                      The study encompasses two field seasons.  One season involves              acquisition of eight multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles designed               to image deep crustal structure beneath:  1) Pt. Arena basin, San               Andreas fault, and extinct trench south of the MTJ; 2) the                      Mendocino Transform fault; and 3) the Eel River basin and Cascadia              subduction zone north of the MTJ.  The profiles intersect wells                 both north and south of the MTJ to provide stratigraphic control.               The MCS profiles will also be recorded on ocean-bottom hydrophones              and seismographs and on REFTEK seismographs deployed onshore to                 provide complementary large aperture data.  The other season                    involves acquisition of three onshore explosive-source refraction               profiles, two of which extend onshore/offshore transects shot north             and south of the MTF, in order to cross the fore-arc and slabless               window.  The third refraction profile will follow the trend of the              Franciscan terrane in order to cross the southern edge of the Gorda             plate, map possible along-strike variations in crustal structure                and tie together the two primary onshore-offshore profiles.  All                three land profiles will be densely instrumented with REFTEK and                SGR seismographs.",
