To this  end, we propose to develop a data-acquisition work-station,  featuring a Macintosh VX computer, a high-speed analog-to-  digital board, and LabVIEW software. Unlike our current system,  this workstation has programming capabilities, high sample  rates, multiple channels, and adjustable gains. With six work-  stations, students in Animal Physiology can design and perform  experiments on the biomechanics of locomotion, feeding in  invertebrates, and the dynamic power output of vertebrate  muscle. These new experiments are also made possible by the  addition of SVHS video equipment that allows students to record  and analyze animal motions. In Neurobiology, we propose to  teach the sophisticated technique of brain slice  electrophysiology. Students will measure the electrical  interactions of different cells in the mammalian brain using  brain slice electrophysiology.  By giving students the opportunity to learn advanced techniques  in biomechanics and electrophysiology, we are introducing them  to new ways to address questions that have puzzled, and  continue to puzzle, physiologists: (1) How do animals move,  feed, and what, if any, limits do muscles impose? (2) How do  the cells of the nervous system \"learn,\" respond to stress, and  establish and maintain electrical membrane potentials?",
