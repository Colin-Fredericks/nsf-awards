Reddy, Department of Ocean Engineering, Florida                                 Atlantic University, and Dr. V. Ramakrishnan,                                   Department of Civil Engineering, South Dakota                                   School of Mines and Technology, to conduct with                                 Dr. P. Paramasivam, Department of Civil                                         Engineering, National University of Singapore,                                  a workshop on the durability of concrete with                                   particular emphasis on the marine environment.                                  Nine U.S. participants and at least an equal                                    number from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and                                 Brunei will be selected by an advisory panel of                                 experts in the field of the workshop.  This                                     workshop is a satellite conference for the 4th                                  International Conference on Structural Failure,                                 Durability, and Retrofitting which will be held                                 in Singapore, July 14 and 15, 1993.                                             The magnitude of the durability problem is                                      considerable.  In the concrete infrastructure                                   estimated at $6 trillion, current replacement                                   and repair requirements caused by inadequate                                    durability is conservatively estimated at                                       several billion dollars.  The workshop will                                     focus on the use of new supplementary cementing                                 materials, corrosion inhibitors, improved mix                                   design, rebar types, and construction                                           techniques.  The collaborators are well known                                   researchers in this field.                                                                                                                                      This project is relevant to the objectives of                                   the Science in Developing Countries Program                                     which seeks to increase the level of                                            cooperation between U.S. and developing country                                 scientists and engineers through the exchange                                   of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                                   techniques and through collaboration on                                         problems of mutual interest and benefit.",
