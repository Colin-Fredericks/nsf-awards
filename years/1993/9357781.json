 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate and develop  techniques needed to produce a tool that allows the  applications programmer and computer designer to work   to increase uniprocessor performance.  Computational units,  such as the floating-point units, are becoming faster and  readily available because of the rapid advances in technology  and computer-aided design (CAD) tools.  The performance,  however, is limited by the rate at which data is applied to  the units.  To achieve good uniprocessor performance,  the computational units, memory, and  memory ports  must be efficiently utilized.  This may require  that the applications programmer redesign the algorithms to better exploit the  unique features of the architecture or the computer designer  utilize CAD tools to design special-purpose processors that  exploit the unique features of the algorithms or for best  results, both.  This research investigates and develops: (1)  techniques for extracting statistics on the utilization of the  aforementioned processor resources, and (2) methods for  displaying the performance statistics to benefit both the  applications programmer and the computer designer.  The  results of this research permit the applications  programmer and computer designer to interact closely to  address the problem of efficiently solving challenging  problems such as climate modeling, vehicle dynamics,  semiconductor modeling, and quantum chromodynamics, which are  beyond the scope of existing computers.",
