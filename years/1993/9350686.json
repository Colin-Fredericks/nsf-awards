These include, but are not limited to, electrical                   actuators such as motors and motor drives; valves, power relays                 or solenoids, assorted sensors, signal conditioning and                         interface components; and ruggedized, pre-packaged, brick-                      sized, fully plug-compatible, real time imbedded processors.                    Senior students  design, assemble, and test their own unique                    embedded system applications and are  responsible for all                       aspects of software and hardware performance. Although                          commercial developmental software is provided, alterations,                     software patches, and custom routines are invariably required.                  The proposed laboratory is in real time hardware design, where                  embedded processors and their required software are treated as                  just another hardware component, albeit complicated by their                    attendant software. The principal goal is to expose each                        student to the nonlinearities, time delays, and unexpected                      problems of real-life real-time system design. Funds are                        requested  for embedded computers and their drivers only; funds                 for all other components, such as motors or sensors or relays,                  are provided by Cooper Union, along with the required matching                  funds.",
