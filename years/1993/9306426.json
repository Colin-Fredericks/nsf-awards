 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for the partial support of the Twelfth U.S.                       National Congress of Applied Mechanics to be held during June 26-               July 1, 1994 at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA.  The                 Congress will provide a forum for the presentation of state-of-                 the-art research findings in the entire area of applied mechanics               to a large audience of leading active workers in that field from                academe, government laboratories and industry.  This Congress is                the twelfth in a series of such Congresses that started in 1950.                They are held once every four years at different locations in the               U.S., and are attended by eminent researchers from all over the                 world.  The gathering of these individuals at the Congress will                 allow for personal interactions that will provide exchange of                   information and ideas, and the possible formation of new research               groups, in a variety of disciplines.  Proceedings of the Congress               will be published and will thus be available as an archival                     resource for future use by the engineering, science and                         technology communities.",
