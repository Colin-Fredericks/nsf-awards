 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302065  Reich  A series of experiments are proposed to explore the ground state  properties and excitations of low-dimensional antiferromagnetic  materials that exhibit novel cooperative quantum effects.  A zero-  temperature phase transition will be explored by varying the  parameters in the Hamiltonian of spin-1 chain through the  application of pressure.  A field-induced incommensurate soft mode  in the spin-1/2 chain will be studied in detail.  The properties of  quantum systems with competing interactions will be examined  through experiments on one-dimensional chains with next-nearest  neighbor infractions and two-dimensional systems with geometrical  frustration.  The research will involve crystal growth and  characterization, low-temperature thermodynamic measurements, and  detailed studies of dynamical properties via inelastic neutron  scattering.  %%%  This research involves the growth and characterization of materials  which have magnetic properties largely constrained to occur along  one- or two-dimensions.  The magnetic properties become pronounced  at low temperatures, and are also influenced by application of  hydrostatic pressure.  The research will provide fundamental  information relevant to magnetism, and to the field of high-Tc  superconducting materials.  The materials will be investigated  using magnetic measurements and by the technique of neutron  scattering which reflects dynamical aspects of the atomic magnets  in the various materials.  ***",
