 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303183  Krulwich  Bacillus firmus OF4 is an extreme alkaliphile that can grow well  over a pH range from 7.5 to 10.7, and is also capable of growth  over a range of Na+ concentrations from mM to 1M.  This bacterium  lacks primary Na+ extrusion mechanisms and apparently requires  electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporters for both pH homeostasis and Na+  tolerance.  Na+/H+ antiporter-deficient mutants have been isolated  from Bacillus subtilis, taking advantage of Tn917 mutagenesis, in  order to develop system for heterologous screening and expression  of alkaliphile genes, and for comparative study of a neutralophilic  Bacillus.  Using this system, and Tn916 insertional mutagenesis of  the alkaliphile itself, attempts are being made to identify the  remaining alkaliphile Na+/H+ antiporter gene (s) and possibly,  regulators thereof.  The relationship between each detailed  characterization will be undertaken of the Na+/H+ antiporter that  has the dominant role in pH homeostasis.  The basis for the  alkaliphile's generation of genetic variants will be studied.  Such  variants have the capacity for enhanced growth at the upper edge of  their pH range and at suboptimal Na+ concentration.  They have  previously shown to exhibit an increase in the already high  constitutive Na+/H+ antiporter activity.    %%%  This research will provide an understanding of how microorganisms  can grow under conditions of extreme pH and sodium variance.  This  could lead to applications such as bioremediation under  circumstances where it is currently not proactical because  organisms with the desired metabolic capabilities cannot grow due  to their sensitivity to strong basic environments.  ***",
