 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work supported by this award focuses on problems arising in                the mathematical theory of complex function theory.  Three primary              research themes will be followed.  The first concerns angular                   derivatives of conformal maps, that is, mappings of domains in the              complex plane which are univalent and analytic.  It has been a long             standing problem to determine whether or not a conformal mapping of             a simply connected region onto the unit disk has an angular                     derivative.  Although many special cases are known to be true, only             recently has the techniques of extremal length been developed to                the point where a general existence result is now possible.  It has             been possible to obtain a precise statement about the existence for             the heretofore unknown case of strip domains.  More work remains.               A second area of work will focus on the continued refinement of                 numerical algorithms for conformal maps.  A fast, reliable program              has been developed and used primarily for finding experimental                  properties of maps.  Work will now be done to understand                        convergence properties and use them to study the classical corona               problem for triply-connected domains. Finally, efforts will be made             to determine whether the class of interpolating Blaschke products               generate the entire space of bounded holomorphic functions on the               disk.  It was shown in 1976 that if one uses all Blaschke products,             the statement is true. The interpolating products are much less                 likely to occur, yet have more regularity and therefore are a                   better class to use as approximates.                                                 Complex analysis, the study of differentiable functions of a               complex variable, lies at the heart of vast areas of mathematics                stretching from number theory through potential theory and on to                linear algebra and numerical analysis.  This particular project                 combines some long-standing problems and methods with new                       applications of computational geometry and graph theory.",
