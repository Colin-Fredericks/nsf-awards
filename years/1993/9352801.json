 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352801  Lindgren    Over the next three years the biology department will implement  a new curriculum designed to introduce students to the process  of science more effectively. Courses will be shifted from  content-based teaching to inquiry-based teaching, placing less  emphasis on \"the facts of biology\" and more emphasis on \"doing  biology.\" The goal of this project is to increase both the  quantity and the quality of laboratory experiences available to  students in animal physiology, introductory biology, and  advanced research. This will require the purchase of eight (8)  physiological workstations. Each workstation will include a  Macintosh IIsi computer, MacLab hardware and software, a  printer, and miscellaneous physiological transducers and  amplifiers. Students in Animal Physiology will use the  workstations extensively to study a variety of physiological  processes, such as nerve conduction, muscle contraction, and  heart function. The workstations will not only increase the  pedagogical effectiveness of individual laboratory exercises,  but will also make it practical to introduce a significant  component of independent research into this course. Students in  the introductory course, Structure and Function of Organisms,  will use the workstations primarily to study human physiology.  As with the animal physiology course, the workstations will  allow students to investigate a wide variety of questions  through \"hands on\" experimentation. Finally, the workstations  will be used to increase opportunities for students to  participate in advanced research projects in neurophysiology.  The MacLab system was selected on the basis of my past  experience using other data acquisition systems and on the  basis of a pilot test of MacLab by a student doing an  independent research project at Grinnell this past summer.  MacLab is ideal for use in both introductory courses and  advanced courses because it is easy to operate but also  possesses extensive capabilities for data acquisition,  analysis,  and presentation.  ***y",
