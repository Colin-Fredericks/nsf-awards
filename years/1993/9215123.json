 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical properties of the high temperature cuprate                         superconductors are investigated on the basis of Holstein-Hubbard               theoretical models which include local Coulomb correlations,                    antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and electron-phonon                         interactions in a unified theoretical framework.  Our basic                     approach combines classical and quantum Monte Carlo and molecular               dynamics techniques, exact Lanczos electron groundstate energy and              spectral function calculations, mean-field/variational and self-                consistent diagrammatic techniques in a novel simulational method.              The objective of this research is to study the interplay between                Coulomb correlations, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and                   electron-phonon coupling in doped cuprates, including cooperative               effects such as Coulomb-and spin-fluctuation-induced polaron                    formation, the polaronic tunneling dynamics, polaronic large-                   amplitude lattice displacement fluctuations, and their                          manifestations in the observable normal and superconducting state               electronic and structural properties at finite dopant densities.                The results of this research will provide us with a detailed                    quantitative understanding of a possible, qualitatively new low-                energy physics which can arise from such cooperative effects.                   %%%                                                                             The proposed theoretical research deals with models for the new                 high temperature superconductors.  Detailed, highly complex, models             of these materials which take into account the electronic,                      structural and magnetic properties and their interactions are used              to predict the behavior of the materials in both the                            superconducting and normal states.",
