The Noctuoidea includes several well known groups such as the gypsy moths, tiger moths and woolly bears, and cutworm moths.  Despite possession of interesting biological features (e.g. mimicry, sound production in tiger moths) and their obvious economic importance as pests, several points concerning relationships of these moths remain unresolved.  The heart of the problem lies with the cutworm moths; at this time, it is not clear whether there is one, two, or several unrelated groups currently lumped into the family Noctuidae.  This project will combine molecular  i.e. sequencing one nuclear (28B rRNA) and two protein coding mitochondrial (ND1, COI) genes, all initially analyzed as independent data sets  with morphological data in a total evidence analysis.  The evolutionary trees produced will be used to address how the particular proteins evolved and if current models of protein evolution are supported by this empirical study. %%%          Both anatomical features (morphology) and molecules (gene sequences) will be used to address the higher relationships (phylogeny) of the moth superfamily Noctuoidea.  Included in this large (50,000 species) group of moths that will be the subject of this study ar e several well known groups, many with caterpillars notorious as major insect pests (e.g. gypsy moths, tiger moths and woolly bears, and cutworm moths).  From this study of higher level group relationships, a more stable classification should result that, in turn, will promote future basic and applied research with these moths.  In addition, the project will examine how protein sequences differ among the major moth groups to learn how the proteins themselves have changed over time.  This information will provide baseline data for those interested in constructing models of protein change.",
