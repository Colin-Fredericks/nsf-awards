 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new method for the analysis and design of time integration                    algorithms is to be developed.  This method will allow an algorithm             to be determined from a given set of error acceptability criteria               for the numerical response.  Basically, an algorithm will be                    analyzed as a filter which converts input (load) into output                    (response) and in the process distorts the response above which is              normally associated with the structural transfer function.  Thus,               a numerical transfer function is used to measure the effect in                  phase and amplitude measures for a particular integrator.  a                    parametric analysis of structural parameters (load, structure,                  load-structure interaction spectra) and numerical parameters will               be performed to obtain an overall view of how the method will                   perform under different situations.  Since the behavior of these                measures is a function of these parameters, appropriate integrators             and associated parameters can be chosen depending on individual                 simulation characteristics in conjunction with defined error                    criteria.  This methodology will enable more realistic values of                timesteps to chosen as well as appropriate integrators.  The                    introduction of these more efficient methods will allow simulation              to be longer and finer in spatial resolution.  Ultimately more                  realistic simulations experiments.  Applications will include the               development of an integrator for dynamic fracture propagation which             involves a stiff system having both high accuracy requirements as               well as high and low frequency content.",
