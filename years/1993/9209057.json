 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is                       considerably better than that of five years ago, but it is still                not at a level of accuracy needed for widespread practical                      applications.  If OCR systems are to be a useful alternative to                 skilled human typists, the error rates of the machine must be                   reduced by one to two orders of magnitude.  This project applies                new approaches to the problem.  The problem is here approached by               modeling the various steps in the character recognition process and             then developing analytical techniques for each step.  The project               will continue research on extracting features directly from gray                scale images (as compared with the usual method involving                       binarization of the images before recognition).  The research will              also address construction of character prototypes and development               of flexible graph matching algorithms taking into account both                  typeface specifications and the characteristics of distortions and              noise encountered in the printing process.",
