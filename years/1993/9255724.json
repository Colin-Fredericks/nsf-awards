 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop teaching materials that               will allow high school teachers to introduce various concepts from              dynamical systems theory and fractal geometry into the high school              curriculum.  The project will include the development of                        approximately fifteen modules, each dealing with a single topic                 from fractal geometry or dynamical systems.  Some modules will be               able to be used independently; some will be developed to be used in             a sequence of successive class sessions.                                                                                                                        Each module will contain background materials, preliminary student              worksheets, a short video, and suggested followup activities.                   Specific materials to be developed include videotapes, software,                Hypercard stacks, worksheets, and teacher guides.  The aim is to                help teachers show students the vitality of modern mathematics with             material that complements and enhances the standard high school                 curriculum.                                                                                                                                                     Also planned is a two-week Summer Institute to train teachers to                bring these ideas from modern mathematics into their classrooms.",
