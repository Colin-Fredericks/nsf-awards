 "awd_abstract_narration": "The profound significance regarding the disciplines of                     hydrology and hydrogeology, as well as the associated need for well             trained professionals, is quite evident.  This significance is                  accentuated in drought prone areas like the semi-arid western                   portion of the United States.  The Hydrology/Hydrogeology (H/H)                 Program at the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR) is nationally                   recognized for excellence, with 24 faculty members and over 70                  graduate students.  The UNR summer program was extremely                        successful, especially since this was our first effort.                              We are requesting funding to continue the UNR summer REU                   program in hydrology and hydrogeology.  We have attempted to build              upon our past successes while addressing the few noted                          shortcomings.  Our faculty are quite excited about the prospects                of once again working with a group of exceptional undergraduate                 students.",
