 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first course in computer science is overwhelmingly populated by             students from outside the discipline. A high dropout rate as well               as a low rate of successful completion of the course indicates a                need for a new approach. Poor retention in the following classes                and extremely low numbers of women and minorities point to the need             for better preparation. We propose a preparatory course to address              these concerns that would cover problem solving, some basic                     mathematics, and computer use.                                                                                                                                  Goals include: (1) Improve the success rate for incoming computer               science majors; (2) Serve as a \"magnet\" course to attract new                   majors; (3) Improve the problem solving skills and increase                     awareness of computer science as a discipline among the general                 student population; (4) Give a more accurate introduction to                    computer science as a discipline; and 5) Attract women to computer              science.                                                                                                                                                        The proposed class will give students a firm foundation in the                  mathematical and problem-solving skills needed for success in this              and subsequent classes, as well as give them a better understanding             of what computer science is, i.e., there is more to computer                    science than programming. By motivating learning through a                      \"recreational\" approach to the introduction of mathematical and                 computer science concepts, the proposed class will attempt to make              learning \"fun\" and to minimize the typical frustrations                         encountered. The text \"Mathematics: Problem Solving through                     Recreational Mathematics\" by Averbach and Chein will be revised to              include computer science topics development of cooperative work                 habits will he encouraged through the use of study groups. Proposed             laboratory exercises will allow students to apply the concepts                  presented and to investigate them more fully.",
