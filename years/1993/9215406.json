 "awd_abstract_narration": "The term \"factors\" denotes simple von Neumann algebras.  In                1982, Vaughan Jones started the study of subfactors when he gave                a natural definition of the index of a subfactor of a particular                kind of factor.  He discovered some remarkable restrictions on                  the possible values of this index and some totally unexpected                   connections with knot theory.  Since then many examples have been               discovered.  A tractable large class of subfactors, the so-called               amenable ones, has been completely classified.  The range of                    related areas has continued to grow, with the latest addition                   being the theory of superselection sectors.   Professor Sorin                   Popa has been involved in this subject almost from the beginning                and is the world's leading expert on \"type II factors\".                              This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Classification of                    Amenable Subfactors and Related Topics to be held August 24 - 28,               1993, at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  Professor                   Sorin Popa will be the principal lecturer.  The conference is                   expected to draw participants from the west coast of the U.S. and               Canada, including UC Berkeley, UCLA, U Nevada at Reno, and the                  Universities of Victoria and Vancouver.                                              To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research,               the National Science Foundation each year supports a number of                  NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical                      Sciences.  Each five-day conference features a distinguished                    lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic on important                      current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical                sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository                     monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published                by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for                         Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                       Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                   from typical research conferences.  These are:  (1) Focus on a                  single important and timely area of research by a leading                       practitioner,  (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through               regional emphasis,  (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                  timeliness, and  (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.",
