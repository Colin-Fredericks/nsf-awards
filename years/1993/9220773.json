 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports ongoing U.S-France collaboration                 in computer science between Jorge Nocedal of Northwestern                       University and Jean Charles Gilbert of INRIA (The French National               Institute for Research in Computer Science and Applied                          Mathematics).  The investigators worked previously on algorithms                for unconstrained optimization as applied to assimilation                       problems in meteorology.  They propose to extend their research                 to solving large-scale constrained optimization problems                        involving a large number of variables.  The objective is to                     develop faster and more flexible algorithms and software than is                currently available.                                                                                                                                            The investigators selected an important nonlinear problem with an               arbitrarily large number of variables - the optimization of the                 trajectory of a space shuttle as it re-enters the atmosphere.                   They will apply sequential quadratic programming methods to this                problem.  The proposal takes advantage of complementary                         expertise.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration                  extensive experience in the development of software for large                   scale optimization.  This is complemented by the French                         investigator's expertise in solutions of optimal control problems               and recent studies of control of the space shuttle.  The project                may lead to practical applications, but will advance the use of                 algorithms and software which may useful in engineering and                     scientific problems with large numbers of variables.",
