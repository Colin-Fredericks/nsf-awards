 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Ribet to work in             number theory.  Since 1986, Ribet has been working on Serre's                   conjectures which relate mod p modular forms and mod p two                      dimensional representations of the Galois group of an algebraic                 closure of the rationals.  Ribet also proposes to continue his                  interests in variants involving Shimura varieties, base fields                  other than the rationals and representation modulo powers of p.                      This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
