The texts will be tape-                       recorded, transcribed and translated into English, and then                     subjected to instrument measurement to determine pause and                      intonation patterns. A completed volume of texts will include                   morpheme-by-morpheme analyses and glosses. The project will be                  carried out in close collaboration with a respected speaker and                 teacher in the Oneida community. Such a collaboration will ensure               the widest variety possible in the text sample. The collection of               such textual material is seen as urgent, given the steady                       decreasing numbers of speakers of Oneida over the last two                      decades. It is anticipated that the text volume will benefit                    linguistics regardless of theoretical alignment and also                        community-based projects aimed at maintaining and preserving                    Oneida.",
