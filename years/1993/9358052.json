 "awd_abstract_narration": "9358052  Ferrari  Research will be conducted in the area of Micromechanics, that is  the stress and failure analysis of inhomogeneous materials,  including composites, polycrystals, granular and defective media.  The research will establish relationships between the  microstructure and the macroscopic properties of materials, their  application to the stress and failure analyses of engineering  materials and structures, and the design of advanced materials  tailored for specific engineering applications.  These general  objectives will be pursued by the joint use of analytical,  computational, and experimental methods, applied to various  materials of technological relevance.    The poly-inclusion method proposed earlier by the PI will be tested  against further exact results.  The development of additional exact  and numerical results, respectively for periodic and locally non-  periodic media will be undertaken.  On the experimental side,  ultrasonics will be used to determine simultaneously the effect  elasticities and the interaction function for specific composite  types, and to perform controlled-microstructure experiments.  The  ideas will be extended to other inhomogeneous engineering  materials, including porous and damaged media, and polycrystals.    Research in the area of Functionally-Graded Composites will be  conducted extending previous studies on the optimal distribution of  micron-size alumina particles in aluminum-based materials.  Micro-  Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) will be also studied.  A crucial  characterization technique is the Micromechanical Diffraction  Method, as this yields multi-scale residual stresses, the  mechanically relevant portion of the texture function, the local  effective properties, and various microdistributional data.",
