 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will enhance students' conceptual understanding                 of organic chemistry,develop students' scientific problem                       solving skills, and increase students' enjoyment of science                     using an adaptation of the discovery approach of the new                        University of Michigan organic chemistry sequence to a format                   suitable for a suburban community college. The key modification                 is the provision for a more supportive environment to encourage                 and motivate a very diverse student population. Computer based                  tools will be used to provide conceptual organization and                       structure to laboratory work and to establish stronger links                    between the lecture and laboratory.  The computer based                         organizational shell will combine visualizations of molecular                   models and mechanistic animations with spectroscopic data and                   laboratory observations to help students build mental models of                 chemical phenomena based upon how chemists think at the                         molecular level. In classroom and laboratory lectures, faculty                  routinely will use computer displays to illustrate basic                        concepts of organic chemistry and to show the inter-                            relationships between theory and experiments. Students will use                 the software in the laboratory to better understand the                         underlying concepts, experimental design, and analysis of                       instrumental data.",
