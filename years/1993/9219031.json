 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conidiation (asexual sporulation) in the filamentous fungus,                    Aspergillus nidulans, involves the formation of multicellular                   differentiated structures that produce pigmented, haploid conidia               at precisely scheduled times. It has been shown that light is                   necessary for conidiation, but will only elicit development if                  irradiation occurs during a critical period of development.                     Furthermore, conidiation is induced by red light and suppressed                 by an immediate shift to far red light, a property that is                      characteristic of phytochrome mediated responses observed in                    plants. Several different classes of mutants that affect light                  dependent conidiation have been identified. Some mutants abolish                light sensitivity, allowing conidiation to occur in the absence                 of light, while others affect the ability to conidiate at                       specific wavelengths. Thus, it appears that light signals are                   perceived in A. nidulans by a phytochrome like photoreceptor that               transmits information by an unknown mechanism to genes that                     control asexual development. The objective of this proposal is to               develop a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that regulate                light mediated conidiation in this organism. The major aim of                   this work is to identify and characterize the red light                         photoreceptor through the molecular cloning of phytochrome                      related sequences. A phytochrome like clone has been isolated and               experiments are proposed to compare the sequences and function of               the A. nidulans phytochrome gene with known phytochrome genes                   from plants. These experiments include determining the DNA                      sequence of both genomic and cDNA clones, deducing the pattern of               transcriptional expression, following the pattern of                            translational expression through the use of gene fusions and                    phytochrome specific antibodies, and examining the phenotype of                 gene disruptants. Another aim of this work is to identify                       interactions that occur within the photo transduction pathway.                  Mutants have been isolated in a cloned gene (acoD) that affect                  sensitivity to red light. Experiments are proposed to examine the               transcriptional and translational activity of acoD in different                 growth and illumination conditions, to identify at the nucleotide               level the mutational defects that cause red light insensitivity,                and to identify gene interactions through the isolation and                     analysis of suppressor mutations. These studies will help                       elucidate the complex regulatory mechanisms that affect cellular                differentiation is this eukaryote.",
