 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Principal Investigator is to create a                      hospitable environment for mathematical computation.  The word                  \"environment\" in the following sense:  It is a place where                      programs and people live and interact together.  As such it needs               the following:  Commonality.  There needs to be a rich protocol                 that allows programs to communicate with one another and to share               resources.  Heterogeneity.  Programs needn't be structurally                    similar to one another in order to be capable of communicating.                 Law and Order.  Programs should be protected from one another:                  if one acts irrationally the rest should be protected from it.                  Portability.  The environment should be independent of the                      underlying hardware, which could be a single computer or a                      network of such.  Flexibility.  People using one program or set                 of programs should not be hindered by the existense of other                    people with other goals.  Seeds.  The environment should come                   populated with seedlings of useful programs.  If the environment                is fertile (only time can tell) these will develop into ever                    bigger and more fruitful things.                                                     This award will encourage exploratory research in this                     important area.",
