To implement               these priorities, Lehigh will develop a series of four integrated               lecture-laboratory courses leading to B.S. and M.S. degrees in                  chemical science for materials synthesis and processing.  The                   courses will be centered around nanostructure materials such as                 fine particulate matter, thin layer materials, and materials for                future electronic and photonic applications, which are areas of                 faculty expertise and existing facilities.  The program will                    include a student science seminar running throughout to get                     talented students interested in science, make them aware of their               career opportunities, and assist them in developing their                       individual and social priorities.  Ten-week student internships                 involving research projects jointly supervised by Lehigh faculty                and industrial scientists are also planned for the summer periods.              The program will be continuously evaluated by the review committee              of the Chemistry Department and the Center for Surface Science and              through formal review meetings with a consortium of academic and                industrial scientists.  The program will be disseminated through                reports, publications, and computer programs describing course                  materials and laboratory experiments as well as through 2-3 day                 workshops involving faculty, students, and industry.",
