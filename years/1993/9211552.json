 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the feasibility of reducing emissions of                  nitrogen oxides from stationary power sources by including a                    catalytic reburn step in the process.  The reburn chamber would                 be incorporated into the stack of a boiler or into a heat-                      recovery steam generator following a gas turbine, and would                     incorporate heterogeneous catalysts capable of generating methyl                radicals from natural gas (methane) injected into the exit                      stream of the combustor.  The ability of methyl radicals to                     reduce nitrogen oxides is already well established.  In this                    study, two families of catalysts known to generate methyl                       radicals from methane are used:  lithium-doped zinc oxide and                   magnesium oxide, and rare- earth oxides such as lanthana.                       Catalytic studies and adsorption measurements provide specific                  activities, activation energies, and kinetic rate expressions.                                                                                                  Infrared spectroscopy done in situ is used to characterized the                 surface species on the most active catalysts.                                                                                                                   Successful application of this concept to power generating                      processes would result in an enormous decrease in nitrogen oxide                emissions and would probably eliminate acid rain from power                     generation as a major environmental problem.  It would also                     obviate the need for the more expensive and more cumbersome                     processes involving ammonia that are currently being used.                      Application to other industrial sources nitrogen oxides is also                 envisioned.",
