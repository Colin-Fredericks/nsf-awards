 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a research planning grant for women.  Cell elongation                   depends on the irreversible extension of the cell wall and on                   hydraulic conductivity and turgor of the cell.  The uptake and                  production of osmotically active solutes for maintenance of turgor              is essential to maintain cell elongation for extended time periods.             The cellular mechanisms that coordinate the osmoregulation of the               cell and extension of the cell wall during cell elongation are                  poorly understood.  Cotton fibers provide an excellent experimental             system for studying molecular mechanisms regulating cellelongation.             The fibers on the cotton ovule grow synchronously allowing fiber                elongation to be followed developmentally.  Each fiber is a single              cell which eliminates the complications of cell division.  In                   cotton fibers, malate is one of the osmotically active solutes                  responsible for the maintenance of turgor.  As an initial step in               ultimately identifying the signal transduction mechanism(s)                     responsible for coordinating osmoregulation and cell wall                       loosening, the regulation of PEP carboxylase, the enzyme involved               in malate synthesis during fiber elongation, is being studied.                  Five isoforms of the fiber PEP carboxylase have been identified and             are distinguishable by their electrophoretic mobility on SDS                    polyacrylamide gels.  Two of these isoforms are preferentially                  expressed during maturation of fiber elongation.  The immediate aim             of this project is to determine how these different PEP carboxylase             isoforms are produced.  Two complimentary approaches will be taken:             (1) isolation and characterization of the PEP carboxylase gene(s)               and (2) purification and characterization of the different forms of             the PEP carboxylase protein.  These studies provide the necessary               background to define thephysiological function of these different               isoforms during fiber elongation and more specifically, the role of             these isoforms in the osmoregulation of the fiber cell.                                                                                                         The cotton fiber is commercially valuable in the manufacture of a               large percentage of the world's textiles.  Improved spinning                    systems and increased production speeds place increasing demands on             the cotton fiber by the textile industry.  Efforts to improve the               fiber quality of existing cotton germplasm in terms of uniformity,              strength and extensibility of the fiber are essential for the US to             remain competitive in world markets.  Defining the underlying                   regulatory mechanism(s) controlling fiber elongation utilizing                  modern molecular tools will be of immense importance in future                  development of breeding and genetic engineering strategies for                  improving the fiber's spin value.",
