 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluids are involved in nearly all geologic processes,                      and are ubiquitous in the continental crust to depths of at                     least 10 to 15 km.  As heat is advected by fluid movement,                      it may lead to distinctive patterns of thermal anomalies                        which can be interpreted to gain insight into fluid pathways                    and mechanisms.  Field studies of past and present                              temperatures in the Ouachita  Mountains- Arkoma basin area                      re proposed to gain insight into the mechanisms by which                        fluid flow occurs in the continental crust and the nature of                    possible relationships between fluid migrations and                             orogenesis.  The Arkoma basin and Ouachita mountains are of                     interest because they have been implicated as a source of                       the hot brines which apparently flooded North America in                        Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian time (about 300 +25 Ma),                       leading to widespread potassic alteration, formation of                         Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) lead-zinc deposits, and                           possible resetting of paleomagnetic poles.  Mathematical                        models will also be used to evaluate various hypotheses                         concerning the mechanisms by which fluid flow takes place in                    the continental crust.  Modeling will include a study of (1)                    temporal focusing of compaction- or metamorphic-derived                         fluids, (2) catastrophic release of heat in the crust from                      free convection an the interaction of free- and forced-                         convective flow regimes, and  (3) the conditions under which                    free convection is important in tilted geologic media such                      as may occur in sedimentary basins.  Results of the                             mathematical modeling will be used in conjunction with data                     collected in field studies to evaluate hypotheses concerning                    fluid flow in the continental crust, particularly in                            reference to tectonically-driven fluid migrations.",
