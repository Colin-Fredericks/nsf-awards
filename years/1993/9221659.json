 "awd_abstract_narration": "The active, polar transport of the plant growth hormone auxin is                essential to the control of plant development. Dr. Lomax has used               a simple but powerful approach to isolate the IAA uptake symport by             photoaffinity labelling of the protein in purified plant plasma                 membranes with a tritiated azido-IAA analogue. She has found that               the azido-IAA specifically labels two polypeptides of 40 and 42kD               in plasma membranes isolated from Cucurbita pepo hypcotyls. Both                polypeptides are labeled by azido-IAA with high specific activity,              behave as intrinsic membrane proteins, and exhibit a competition                specificity for various auxin analogs very similar to that for in               vitro and in vivo auxin transport. These data suggest that the                  protein doublet may be an auxin transport carrier(s). The overall               goals of this project are the establishment of function for these               specific plasma membrane auxin-binding polypeptides and the                     investigation of their role in regulating plant development. Dr.                Lomax has completed the purification of these very low abundance                polypeptides. From the purified protein, she has obtained protein               microsequence which has allowed her to design specific                          oligonucleotide probes. These probes will be used to select the                 corresponding cDNA clones encoding the 40 and 42kD auxin-binding                polypeptides. The specific cDNA clones will be used 1) to determine             the nucleic acid and amino acid sequence, 2) for functional                     expression studies, and 3) as probes for the study of                           transcriptional control and pattern of expression of the                        corresponding genes during development. The results of these                    studies should provide significant insight into both the structure              and function of the putative symport protein and the role of IAA                uptake in the regulation of growth and development in plants. The               proposed studies will also forge a much needed link between the                 physiology and molecular biology of auxin action.",
