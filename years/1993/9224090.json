 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the science and technology policies of six              American states that differ in the level of their industrialization             and the size of their science and technology base.  The                         investigators will conduct interviews and collect documents for                 case study analysis of both antecedents and effects of policies in              New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Washington, California, and               Rhode Island.  Hypotheses identify several factors that may favor               development of science and technology policy: predisposing                      structural conditions, economic transformation and stress, state                political capacity, business leaders, involvement of the mass                   public, and state governor initiative.  Factors that may oppose                 development of science and technology policy are: individualistic               or traditional political culture, traditional businesses, labor                 unions, minority and community groups, agricultural and rural                   interests, elements of the mass public, state legislators, and                  state economic development agencies.                                                                                                                                 This study will provide many insights of value for policy                  makers in the areas of science, technology and economic                         development.  It will also contribute to our understanding of                   regional differences within the United States, and to the role that             central institutions of society play in determining state's                     responses to the challenges and opportunities created by rapidly-               changing science and technology.",
