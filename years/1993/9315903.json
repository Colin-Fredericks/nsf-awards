 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315903  Bigio       This is investigate the feasibility of developing global  measures of mixing to be used in the evaluation of mixer designs  and to compare the performance of various mixing configurations  based on mixing performance.  The quantitative evaluation of mixing  extent is a critical problem in polymer and elastomer processing  and the proposed approach, which attempts to develop a quantitative  relationship between the global details of mixing and chaos theory,  is a novel one.       If an easily evaluated, global measure of mixing can be  developed, the selection and optimization of the mixing aspects  polymer and elastomer processing can be quantitatively evaluated.   At present, materials are typically \"overmixed\" because of  uncertainty in the mixing efficiency.  Such practices are both time  and energy inefficient.",
