 "awd_abstract_narration": "9256682  Brown       The principal objective of the National Science Foundation  Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to increase the numbers  of talented U.S. undergraduates enrolling in doctoral programs in  critical and emerging areas of science and engineering.   Proposals were solicited from institutions whose existing  facilities and staff could accommodate additional graduate  students in Ph.D. programs of high quality.  The program is also  intended to contribute to strengthening the Nation's human  resource base across all geographic sectors and among all under-  represented groups.  Graduate Research Traineeship awards are  packages of student support.  The colleges and universities that  receive the awards are responsible for the selection of trainees,  retention of trainees, and administration of traineeships.       Cornell University plans to increase the number of U.S.  Ph.D. statisticians through a program of interdisciplinary  training.  The objective of the program will be to produce  students with the skills and desire to (a) conduct cross-  disciplinary research in science and engineering and (b) foster  undergraduate education in the mathematical sciences,  particularly probability and statistics, from a broad,  interdisciplinary perspective.  Students will attend a weekly  workshop/minicourse program to introduce them to the applications  of statistics.  As their study progresses they will attend more  specialized courses both in statistics and other fields of  science and proceed to interdisciplinary statistical research.",
