 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mutations are one of the mechanisms by which bacteria evolve new                physiological and metabolic capabilities.  It is presumed that                  mutations occur randomly in dividing cells without regard to their              utility.  They occur predominately by mistakes during DNA                       replication or repair.  Recent evidence from extended nonlethal                 selections suggests that under certain conditions the selection                 itself can influence the rate or nature of the mutational events.               This referred to as adaptive mutagenesis.  It appears to occur only             during periods when cell growth is limited by some nutritional                  scarcity, which is a common and recurrent environmental condition               for bacteria in the natural world.  Currently, we know very little              about how bacteria genetically and physiologically respond to                   natural environmental conditions such as nutritional scarcity.  We              are using a combination of microbiological, biochemical and genetic             approaches to determine if mutation rates increase during extended              nonlethal selections and if the mutational events show preference               for specific regions of the genome.                                             %%%                                                                             The information obtained from this project will allow us to decide              if adaptive mutagenesis is a general physiological response in                  Escherichia coli bacteria and will extend our knowledge of                      bacterial physiology in cells that are in a non-growing but                     metabolically active state.",
