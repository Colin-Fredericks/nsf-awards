 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of evolutionary biology is to develop concepts that                can be used to address specific questions. An important concept in              evolutionary biology is that the characteristics of organisms are               well matched (i.e., co-adapted) to each other. For example, the                 thermoregulatory behavior of reptiles with bacterial infections                 matches the temperature at which their immune systems function                  best. The purpose of this study is to determine to what extent the              concept of co-adaptation can be applied to the thermal biology of               reptiles. Because reptiles obtain most of their  body heat from the             environment, describing their temperature relationships is critical             to understanding their ecology. We will address the relationship                between the nocturnal snakes that exhibit unusually low body                    temperature during activity. We will surgically implant                         temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters in snakes to determine                  their body temperatures in the field. In the laboratory, we will                study the effects of variation in body temperature on snake                     physiology (e.g., digestive rate, metabolism, crawling speed).                  Through statistical comparisons of body temperatures and their                  effects on physiology, we will determine the extent of co-                      adaptation in rubber boas. Our analytical methods also will provide             a framework for future studies of co-adaptation.",
