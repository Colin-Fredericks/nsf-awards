 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually all animals are both predators (in some sense) and                    potential prey for other animals.  Understanding the behavioral                 implications of this simple truism has been a major focus of                    ecologically-based behavioral research over the past 10 to 15                   years.  This research has led to considerable insight into the                  nature of animal decision-making, and has enhanced the ability of               biologists to predict animal behavior under natural conditions.                 Research on anti-predatory behavior has also yielded much insight               into both the evolution of behavior and the nature of large-scale               ecological systems.                                                                                                                                             Dr. Lima's research follows in this tradition and focuses                       specifically on a prominent area in anti-predatory behavior: the                detection of predators by socially-feeding animals.  A great deal               of work in this area indicates that animals somehow coordinate                  their anti-predatory vigilance (that is, alert behavior), and, in               essence, detect predatory attack as a socially-integrated unit.                 This work has many ecological and evolutionary implications,                    particularly for the evolution of cooperative behavior in                       animals.  However, Dr. Lima's recent NSF-funded research reveals                that dark-eyed juncos do not coordinate their vigilance, nor do                 they detect attack as an integrated unit.  These discoveries                    raise several interesting questions, which Dr. Lima will now                    pursue.  He will see if his anomalous findings hold across                      several bird species.  Dr. Lima also will investigate how flock                 members find out that a predator has been detected by other                     individuals; previous work indicates that there is very little                  direct transfer of information within the flock.  This research                 will indicate whether or not a major reassessment is needed in                  this important and long-standing area in the study of anti-                     predatory behavior.",
