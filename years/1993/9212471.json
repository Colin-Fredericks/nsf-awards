 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Hungary research project on \"Mathematical Models of the               Cell Division Cycle\" is between Dr. John J. Tyson of Virginia                   Polytechnic Institute & State University, and Dr. Bela Novak of                 the Technical University, Budapest.  Recent molecular studies                   have revealed four classes of proteins that participate                         prominently in the division control mechanism.  Two proteins                    (cdc2 and cyclin) combine to form a heterodimer (\"mitosis                       promoting factor,\" or MPF) that, when activated, triggers all the               major events of mitosis and cell division.  The activity of MPF                 is, in turn, controlled by protein kinases and protein                          phosphatases that determine the phosphorylation state of MPF.                   The goal of this joint project is to develop mathematical models                of the cell division cycle, in order to build secure, reliable                  connections between molecular details of the control mechanism                  and classical observations of the behavior of the intact                        regulatory system.  The model will describe the regulation of the               MPF activity by phosphorylation, and how the phosphorylation                    state of MPF is determined by the DNA-to-protein ratio of the                   cell.  The research should yield a mathematical tool to refine                  assumptions and guide reasoning about the essential events of                   cell growth and division.                                                                                                                                       This research in cell biology and mathematics fulfills the                      program objective of advancing science by enabling leading                      experts in the United States and Hungary to combine complementary               talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                   interest and competence.",
