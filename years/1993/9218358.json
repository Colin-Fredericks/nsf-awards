 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research deals with in vivo studies of the role of                 charged and uncharged tRNA molecules in the efficiency, accuracy,               and regulation of translational elongation.  (1) Cells with two                 kinds of tRNA mutations, miaA and ts-tRNATRP, will be transformed               with modified RF2 frameshift constructs and tests will be made of               the efficiency of the programmed frameshifts.  Effects on these                 frameshifts of overexpressing tRNATRP from a cloned plasmid gene                will also be determined.  (2) Both wild type and hyperaccurate Smp              strains containing the modified RF2 frameshift constructs will be               subjected to manipulation both of charged and uncharged tRNATRP.                Effects of uncharged tRNA and the fraction of charged tRNA on these             programmed frameshifts will be determined.  (3) A specific peptide              from the MS2 coat protein containing residue 32, encoded by a UGG               (Trp) codon, will be isolated in order to determine (by radioactive             lableing and peptide mapping) what amino acid(s) is inserted at                 this position during Trp limitation.  (4) The effect of                         manipulating charged and uncharged tRNATRP levels on the frequency              of substitutions at Trp codons during rate-limiiting elongation                 will be examined.  (5) A vector system to test translational                    efficiency of low- versus high-usage codons will be placed in the               hyperaccurate Smp strains in order to test whether fidelity                     conditions alter \"translational polarity\".                                      %%%                                                                             During cell growth, aging, starvation, and disease protein                      synthesis is modulated.  Although many hypotheses have been                     developed about how such regulation is accomplished and what the                cell gains through such regulation, very few studies have been                  designed to evaluate the regulation of synthesis at the level of                translation in living cells.  The studies proposed here take                    advantage of a unique genetic/biochemical system which permits                  control of the concentrations of specific tRNA molecules in living              cells and evaluating the protein synthetic effects of varying these             tRNA levels.",
