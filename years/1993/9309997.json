Similarly, responses to  both a written word (e.g., a newspaper's forecast of rain) and a  spoken word (e.g., a weatherman's \"Rain\") may closely resemble  responses to the actual event (e.g., the rain itself).  These sorts  of relations seem to be implied whenever we speak of symbolic  function.  Despite their arbitrary nature, however, the particular  symbolic relations that comprise any given language are relatively  standardized and unchanging.  Furthermore, preliminary data suggest  that some dimensions of symbolic relations may be particularly  resistant to change.  An interesting question to be asked of basic  symbolic (or equivalence) relations, then, concerns their  flexibility.  Under what conditions will symbolic relations be  changed, disrupted, or abandoned?    The present research will investigate the nature of symbolic  relations by focusing on their stability, once established.  The  primary objective of this research is to discover the conditions  under which symbolic relations are likely to change.  In a series  of four experiments, college-student subjects seated in front of a  computer display will be taught a \"mini-language\" or symbol system  by training relations between abstract figures.  Once symbolic  relations are demonstrated (as determined by a specified pattern of  responding on standardized test-trial arrangements known as  stimulus equivalence), experiences that contrast with or disconfirm  the originally established relations will be arranged.  For  example, in one experiment subjects will be penalized for showing  one of the originally-trained relations.  Subsequent tests will  reveal whether the programmed challenges have altered the original  symbolic relations.  Attempting to disrupt established symbolic  relations will increase our understanding of the conditions under   which natural language classes are able to accommodate change, as  well as the conditions under which modification of established  relations is unlikely.  Not only may such information be of value  in understanding basic language processes, but efforts to teach  language skills may be strengthened by findings related to  potential sources of disruption.    ***",
