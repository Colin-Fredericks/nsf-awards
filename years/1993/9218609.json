 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of the proposed integrated research is to                    exploit the peculiar composition of hackberry (Celtis) endocarps                for an isotopic approach to paleoenvironmental reconstructions.                 This project will quantify how the stable C and O isotopic                      composition of organic and inorganic components in the endocarps                reflect environmental conditions and how genetic variability                    affects these relationships.  Endocarps of Celtis fruit mainly                  consist of aragonite, but also contain smaller amounts of organic               C.  The high mineral content may be one reason why Celtis endocarps             are a common, and well-preserved, plant remnant in Cenozoic                     sediments of the Great Plains.  We propose to conduct experiments               to determine the effect of individual environmental parameters                  (light intensity, water potential, temperature, humidity) on the                delta C 13 and delta O 18 values of various plant components and                on the isotopic composition of organic matter and carbonate in                  Celtis  endocarps.  The present relationship of endocarp isotope                ratios to regional climate will be examined by collecting Celtis                fruit, tissue, and climate data, from many locations in the United              States. We will establish predictive relationships between climate              and stable isotope values by sampling a subset of Celtis trees from             a USDA experiment involving more than 120 sources of germplasm.                 These  experiments  at 12 sites in the United States span the                   entire north-south temperature range as well as the east-west                   rainfall and atmospheric water deficit ranges.  The effects of                  diagenesis on the isotope ratios, and its implications for the use              of Celtis in Cenozoic paleoclimatic studies, will be examined via               short-term experiments.  Should these studies prove encouraging,we              will then submit a proposal to begin a second phase of the project              in which we will collect, and isotopically analyze, endocarps from              Holocene to Oligocene sediments of the Great Plains.",
