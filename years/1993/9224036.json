 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project will develop an innovative set of instruments               to  study  how  members of the general public react  to  emerging               global   environmental  problems.   The  proposal  assumes   that               willingness to take action on environmental issues is  influenced               by  some combination of the underlying backgrounds and values  of               individuals and the way in which environmental issues enter their               awareness and are framed for them.  The researchers will design a               set  of  questions to assess willingness to take action in regard               to  four  specific  environmental problems:  greenhouse  warming,               species loss, and two \"newly emerging\" environmental issues to be               chosen  during  the  course of the research.   Vignettes  in  the               questionnaire  involving  each  environmental  problem  will   be               experimentally manipulated to vary whether they involve claims of               harm  to  the  individual, to others, or to  the  biosphere,  and               whether  such  claims  of harm are said to be  disputed  by  some               experts  or  not.   Willingness to take action will  be  assessed               through a variety of questions concerning willingness to pay  for               countermeasures and likelihood of joining activities to  pressure               private   industry   and  government  agencies   to   deal   with               environmental problems.  These vignettes and other parts  of  the               questionnaire will be developed through a series of pilot studies               and then employed in a small scale (N=200) telephone survey of  a               representative sample of adults living in Northern Virginia.   If               this  project is successful, the researchers contemplate mounting               a  larger  investigation  employing  the  experimentally  varying               questionnaire vignettes developed here.                                                                                                                               This  project  will contribute to an understanding  of  the               conditions  under which members of the general public are  likely               to  join  activities designed to deal with emerging environmental               problems.    In   addition,  this  research  will   improve   our               understanding of the general process by which attitudes in regard               to emerging and unstable issues become formed.",
