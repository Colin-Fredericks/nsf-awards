 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigators at the University of Southern California will                     undertake research to model and investigate some of the important               dynamical processes that have been identified in the Arctic Ocean               and adjacent Seas.  The Arctic Ocean and its adjacent seas play an              important role in global warming, and it is important to understand             its dynamical behavior on many space and time scales.  At several               locations during the winter, major sources of dense cold seawater               are formed and sink.  Much of this water reaches great depths and               eventually spreads through the world's ocean basins.  This thermo-              haline circulation is a major factor in understanding the long-term             evolution of the coupled atmosphere-ocean system.  This work will               examine some aspects of this problem.  Primarily, the mechanisms                whereby the motion of the dense water that is formed by intense                 cooling and/or freezing is controlled by the environment in which               it is created.  Among the issues of interest are: a) The origin and             dynamics of small and meso-scale eddy structures that have been                 observed repeatedly by satellite (IR) images and reported by field              investigators at different Arctic locations.  b) The formation of               a halocline between the upper mixed layer and the underlaying                   Atlantic water, which tends to shield the ice cover from an upward              heat flux.  c) The upwelling and/or downwelling processes that have             been observed in the marginal ice zones.  d) Interaction between                the shelf and the basin waters.                                                                                                                                 To accomplish this work, both laboratory experiments and numerical              calculations will be made with well defined objectives.  A wide                 range of generic problems will be tackled starting from the                     simplest convection experiment with a non-uniform heat flux to the              most complex in which virtually all of the controlling parameters               are incorporated.  In this way individual and combined effects of               these various inputs can be studied.",
