 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide variety of spatiotemporal patterns exist in nature with                  a wide degree of complexity, from simple and regular to highly                  disordered structures.  These structures show some order in                     the midst of complex nonlinear behavior.  The coupling of                       chemical reactions and transport processes, such as diffusion                   or hydrodynamic convection, is known to lead to the formation                   of spatially organized distributions of reactive compounds.                     Analysis and prediction of pattern-formation in chemically                      reacting systems to date have been for homogeneous medium and                   there is lack of understanding if and in which way                              inhomogeneity of a medium will distort the patterns that exist                  in a uniform medium.  This relates directly to the performance                  of commercial heterogeneous catalysts, which are inherently                     nonuniform.  The answer has implications on the assessment of                   the impact of spatiotemporal patterns on the performance of                     catalysts.                                                                                                                                                      This research involves experimental, numerical and theoretical                  studies of the formation, evolution, characterization, and                      impact of spatial and spatiotemporal patterns on catalytic                      surfaces.  The experiments will provide quantitative data                       about the dynamic features of the patterns on catalysts with                    simple and symmetric geometry in a well-controlled environment                  for several test reactions, and will provide important                          information on the impact (or lack of impact) of catalytic-                     surface inhomogeneity on the observed patterns.  The                            experimental information will serve as a guide to theoretical-                  model development and modification and for determining                          parameter values.  Numerical and theoretical studies will help                  direct and organize the experimental research and point out                     potentially interesting regions of experimentation and                          catalyst geometries, and guide the development of principles                    predicting pattern formation and its impact.  The research                      should provide insight into the role and impact of                              spatiotemporal patterns on the performance of heterogeneous                     catalysts.",
