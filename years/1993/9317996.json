 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317996  Salamon       The New York Academy of Medicine has a longstanding mission to  improve the health of the public by acting on broad medical issues  ranging from basic biomedical research, through those issues  bearing on clinical investigation, clinical medicine, health care  delivery, public health activities and health policy matters.  The  Academy devotes special attention to defining and working toward  solutions of urban health problems.  In order to continue to  develop useful and important new programs, the Academy must be able  to provide its research and education community with access to  communications and information resources.  Therefore, The New York  Academy of Medicine requests $30,000 for a two-year grant to  establish a connection to the NSFNET.  This connection will  integrate the Academy's LAN into the NSFNET, and thereby provide  access for all of the Academy's researchers, program developers and  staff.  In addition, The New York Academy of Medicine Library, a  research library of national importance, would make its catalog  holdings and staff expertise accessible through the Internet.  The  Academy Library serves as a Regional Medical Library in the  National Network of Libraries of Medicine.  In this role, the  Academy would use the NSFNET connection to further its training and  information retrieval services to 900 health science libraries in  the region covering New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and  Delaware.  The connection would also make possible a project  enabling ten health science libraries in the region to obtain  Internet access via LIFENET.  ***",
