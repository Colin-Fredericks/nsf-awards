But there are  gaps in this barrier. Specially differentiated organs --  circumventricular organs -- in the ventricular walls contain  neurons with receptors for a variety of blood-borne chemicals.  These neurons form early warning networks that maintains brain and  body homeostasis. They are influential regulators of autonomic and  neuroendocrine system functions. Some of these organs have shown to  be crucially important in the regulation of blood pressure but  there is as yet no understanding of the role of the newly  discovered peptide neurotransmitters or how the organs function  together as a system. This NSF grant will allow eight young  scientists to participate in a summer research conference on the  circumventricular organs organized by the Federated Societies of  Experimental Biology. The purpose of this conference is to bring  basic and clinical scientists together to exchange information and  to foster a greater understanding of the potential importance of  this area of research.  ***",
