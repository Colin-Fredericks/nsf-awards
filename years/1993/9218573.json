 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is concerned with the further development of                 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) as a method to                    determine the three-dimensional structures of larger biomolecules               in solution.  It is only very recently that labeling with stable                isotopes and the use of three- and four- dimensional heteronuclear              NMR has allowed the structure determination of proteins larger than             10 kDa in solution.  Here the solution structure determination of               a larger alpha helical proteins.  These challenges form the                     backbone of the proposal and will be approached with improvements               in efficiency by using heteronuclear cross polarization, with                   improvements in resolution by using multiple quantum filters and a              larger number of dimensions and with improvements in analysis of                key multi-dimensional NMR experiments.                                          %%%                                                                             Recent developments in the methods of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance                Spectroscopy have made possible the determination of the three-                 dimensional structures of smaller proteins in solution.  Three                  dimensional solution structures are relevant to the understanding               of their biological functioning, can convey dynamic information and             may be obtained by NMR in cases where other methods fail because of             lack of crystals.  This proposal describes investigations into the              development of more advanced NMR methods to help analyze the                    solution NMR spectra of larger proteins, nucleic acids and                      complexes thereof.  The studies will be carried out with a medium-              sized protein as a model system.  The new methods will make NMR                 structure determination possible for larger proteins and nucleic                acids and thus contribute to the better understanding of structure              and function in this larger class of biomolecules.",
