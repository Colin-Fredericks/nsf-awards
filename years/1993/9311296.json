 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311296  Giere  Contemporary philosophy of science with its current view of the  nature of science and scientific theory developed out of an  explicit reaction against the Logical Empiricist school of  philosophy that dominated our view of science for nearly a quarter  of a century after World War II.  To understand our current views,  it is extremely important to understand the positions against which  we have reacted.  Logical Empiricism grew out of the long  empiricist tradition in Anglo-American philosophy which includes  Locke, Hume, Mill, and Bertrand Russell.  But the new mathematical  logic, developed by Russell and Whitehead in the first decade of  this century, played an equally important role.  It provided a  language in which empiricist claims could be formulated, techniques  for developing empiricist analyses of scientific hypotheses and  methods, and, above all, a standard for rational reference.    The objective of this workshop is to promote research on the  origins of Logical Empiricism by bringing together a number of  active researchers for three days of discussion on previously  circulated papers.  This group of researchers will then produce a  comprehensive and unified volume that will help legitimate the  study of this history both within the philosophy of science and  within the broader discipline of philosophy as part of the history  of twentieth century philosophy.    Interest in the history of Logical Empiricism has recently been  promoted by a number of conferences celebrating the births, in  1891, of the two major founders of Logical Empiricism, Rudolf  Carnap and Hans Reichenbach.  The concerns of this workshop is by  no means to continue the celebration, but to capitalize on the  interest these celebrations generated to promote the study of the  origins of Logical Empiricism as part of both the philosophy of  science and the history of philosophy.  The organizers hope thereby  to provide encouragement for younger scholars who have taken up  this important study.  ** *",
