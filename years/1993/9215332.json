Special emphasis will be given to the Segal and Sullivan                        conjectures and their generalizations.  Professor May's ten                     principal lectures will include the following interrelated                      topics.                                                                              - Unstable equivariant homotopy theory                                          - The Sullivan conjecture and its applications                                  - Equivariant bundles and classifying spaces                                    - RO(G)-graded cohomology theory                                                - The Segal conjecture                                                          - The stable category; G-spectra and their completions                          - Tate, Borel and co-Borel homology                                             - The Atiyah-Hirxebruch-Tate spectral sequence                                  - Equivariant K-theory                                                          - Equivariant infinite loop space theory and algebraic                     K-theory                                                                        A main value of this conference will be to let interested                       researcher \"see the forest, not just the trees\" of this area of                 algebraic topoloty.  The lecturer, Peter May, is one of the                     leaders in the field.                                                                This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Equivariant Homotopy                 and Cohomology to be held August 2 - 6, 1993, at the University                 of Alaska in Fairbanks.  Peter May of the University of Chicago                 will be the principal lecturer.                                                      To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research,               the National Science Foundation each year supports a number of                  NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical                      Sciences.  Each five-day conference features a distinguished                    lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic on important                      current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical                sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository                     monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published                by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for                         Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                       Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                   from typical research conferences.  These are:  (1) Focus on a                  single important and timely area of research by a leading                       practitioner,  (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through               regional emphasis,  (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                  timeliness, and  (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.",
