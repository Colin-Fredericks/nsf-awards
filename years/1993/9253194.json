 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Kentucky seeks support to develop a statewide                 network of middle grades mathematics teachers, align mathematics                content and teaching practices in the state with the NCTM                       Standards, and provide opportunities for collaboration among                    classroom teachers, instructional supervisors, teacher educators,               and university mathematicians.  Eight teams of university faculty,              classroom teachers, and instructional supervisors will develop                  seminars designed to enhance the teaching of algebra, geometry,                 probability and statistics.  Pedagogical emphases include problem               solving, use of manipulatives and technology, cooperative learning,             and alternative forms of assessment.  The teams will conduct                    seminars for 300 middle grades teachers throughout Kentucky, who                will in turn conduct workshops and establish support groups for                 middle grades teachers in their respective districts.  All eight                state universities and four private colleges in Kentucky will                   participate in the project.                                                                                                                                     Cost share provided by the universities and the schools is 25% of               the award.",
