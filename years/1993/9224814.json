This 6th symposium                will be held in Oahu, Hawaii on June 7-11, 1993.  It has an                     International Organizing Committee of  13 members from 5 countries.             The complete program includes sessions on Electronic Component                  Nondestructive Characterization & Evaluation; Biomimetic and Biotic             Materials; Interfaces; Nondestructive Characterization for Process              Control; and Verification of Materials Processing Models.                       %%%                                                                                   This International Symposium on Nondestructive                            Characterization of Materials will be the sixth symposium, held in              three different countries at time intervals varying from one to                 three years.  It provides a forum for active scientists and                     engineers to exchange the recent advances in their respective                   fields.  It is also a forum for the materials researchers and the               nondestructive testing researchers to exchange information and to               promote understandings.",
