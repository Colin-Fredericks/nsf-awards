 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across the globe, more than one-third of all households are                headed by women.  In parts of Latin America, the share of female-               headed households approaches one-half.  Despite these striking                  statistics, very little research on housing in developing                       countries has examined gender and related issues.  Prevailing                   theories have focused on social class, often treating \"the urban                poor\" as an essentially homogeneous group.  This doctoral                       dissertation research proposal will examine the role of gender                  and household composition in addition to other socioeconomic                    characteristics as factors influencing housing choices made by                  women heading households in two lower-income neighborhoods in the               Mexican city of Guadalajara, Jalisco.  Structured surveys will be               used to examine correlations between different types of                         households and informal housing submarkets.  This phase of the                  research project will set the stage for in-depth interviews                     focusing on female-headed households in order to examine how                    constraints and resources related to class, gender, and household               composition affect the evaluation of housing alternatives.                           By examining gender and household composition in addition to               socioeconomic variables in the analysis of housing opportunities                available to the urban poor, this research project will enhance                 understandings of fundamental differences among various                         subgroups, especially households headed by women.  The project                  also will provide valuable insights for planners and others                     responsible for providing housing for disadvantaged segments of                 the population.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement award,                  this award also will provide support to enable a promising                      student to establish a strong independent research career.",
