 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports offshore coring into the coral reefs of                Barbados to retrieve a detailed sea level record for the past                   20,000 years.  U-series dating of the reef crest coral indicates                that sea level was approximately 120 meters below present sea level             during the last glacial maximum.  Sea level rise was not monotonic;             rather, it was marked by a series of jumps with rates of sea level              rise exceeding 2cm per year at least three times during the                     deglaciation.  The glacial meltwater associated with this sea level             rise is clearly recorded in the oxygen isotopic records of                      planktonic foraminifera.  Immediately preceding this sea level jump             was the initiation of North Atlantic Deep Water production and                  associated meridional heat transport.                                                Measurement of C-14 and U-Series ages on the same coral                    samples, will also provide a unique opportunity to calibrate the C-             14 time scale beyond the 10,000 year dendrochronology.  The                     radiocarbon calibration beyond 10,000 years is critical for climate             research that compares radiocarbon-dated proxies with absolute                  chronologies based on annual layer counting, such as ice core                   records or astronomical calculation.  These results have immediate              implications for climate and geophysical models that incorporate                phase lags or rates of climate change based on calibrated                       radiocarbon records.",
