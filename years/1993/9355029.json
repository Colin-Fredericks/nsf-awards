Multidisciplinary research will train a more  diverse group of new scientists in hydroclimatology, to investigate  global climate change, its effect on regional water resources, and  ensuing political and social alterations, and in hydrometeorology,  to deal with surface-atmosphere interaction in a new and more  integrated manner.  Environmental hydrology will integrate surface-  and subsurface-water study for better understanding of these  interactions, as well as contaminant transport phenomena and water  chemistry processes.  In this respect, an accelerated option will  provide an excellent retraining program for degreed professionals  currently unable to contribute to an environmentally-focused world:   petroleum engineers, exploration geologists, and other resource  scientists.  Water resources engineering will prepare students for  nonstructural aspects of rebuilding the national water resources  infrastructure and improvement of water supply reliability and  remediation activities through use of more sophisticated  technologies.  ***",
