Examination of such New                            World disjunctions using DNA restriction site                                   information has not been done previously.  The use of                           chloroplast DNA, nuclear ribosomal DNA and                                      morphological data will generate three independent data                         sets to investigate the potential processes leading to                          the current distribution such as long distance                                  dispersal, vicariance events, relict distributions and                          convergent evolution.  Disjunct species and genera have                         been comparatively well documented between the arid                             lands of North America and South America, but no robust                         phylogenies exist for these taxa to interpret the                               biogeographical processes.  This project is designed to                         answer systematics questions such as the relationships                          between the three Loasaceae subfamilies, the sections                           in Mentzelia and species within sect.  Mentzelia, which                         contains the majority of South American species.  A                             revision of sect. Mentzelia, including molecular,                               chromosomal and SEM seed coat data is needed to                                 complete a modern revision of the genus.  Morphological                         and molecular data will be analyzed both separately and                         integrated, using parsimony methods.  The resulting                             phylogenetic trees and measures of genetic divergence                           will be used to evaluate the hypotheses regarding the                           present distribution of Mentzelia.",
