 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309979  Leahy    Questions concerning the dynamics of aggregate variables such as  prices, employment, investment, and consumption represent the  core of business cycle analysis.  One striking feature of these  variables is the radical difference between properties of these  aggregates and the nature of the individual behavior that  underlies them.  The behavior of a firm's prices, investment, and  employment, and the behavior of an individual's consumption all  involve frictional elements that lead to inertia at the  microeconomic level.  Heterogeneity among individuals, however,  tends to smooth the behavior of the corresponding aggregates.   Yet, in spite of their apparent continuity, these aggregates are  in the end the sum of their parts.  They therefore inherit  certain properties from the behavior components.  Renewed funding  will continue this research on the precise way in which  microeconomic frictions influence aggregates.      Previous work focussed on theoretical issues involved with the  introduction of informational considerations into the field of  aggregation.  The current project will pursue empirical  approaches to aggregation using a unique data set on mortgage  refinancing that is particularly well suited to the study of  aggregation.  The project also develops new theoretical ideas and  tests the applicability of the theoretical research with data  from specific historical episodes such as the Latin American debt  crisis of the early 1980's.  The project also develops a model of  monetary policy formulation in the presence of adjustment costs  and imperfect information.  The model permits rigorous analysis  of the issues involved in choosing between a gradualist and a  more aggressive approach to monetary policy.  The results will  shed light on the nature of recent U.S. monetary policy and have  lessons for a wide range of other policy issues.  ***",
