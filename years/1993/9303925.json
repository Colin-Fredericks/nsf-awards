 "awd_abstract_narration": "In ranked data each observation is a permutation of n items.   Because the permutations do not have a natural linear ordering,  many common statistical methods are inappropriate for ranked  data.  However, the permutations of n items can be naturally  placed on the vertices of a polytope inscribed in a sphere in n-1  dimensional Euclidean space.  This geometry suggests new  graphical and analytical methods for analyzing full and partially  ranked data.  Of particular interest are probability density  histograms, spectral analysis, kernal smoothing methods, and  confidence regions.  Statistical methods are proposed to analyze ranked data.  Ranked  data occur when a group of \"judges\" are asked to evaluate a set  of items and then to rank them in order of preference.  Hence,  each \"judge\" states his first, second, etc., and last choices  among the items that he has evaluated.  Proper methods to  graphically display and analyze ranked data are very important.  This type of data is encountered frequently in the social  sciences, in market research, and in elections.  A less well  known, but equally important area in which ranked data are  encountered is expert systems for military applications.",
