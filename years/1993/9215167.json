Using advanced imaging technologies on                                   marine and mammalian gametes and embryos,                                       dynamic events in the cell cycle and during                                     development will be observed.  The application                                  of imaging equipment in the broad field of cell                                 and developmental biology and the biological                                    insights derived from such technology will                                      continue to lead to important discoveries.                                                                                                                      This workshop, organized by Dr. Gerald Schatten                                 of the University of Wisconsin, Madison and Dr.                                 Claudio Barros, of the Catholic University,                                     Chile, will take place in the Marine Laboratory                                 of the Catholic University of the North,                                        Coquimbo, Chile.  The participants, young                                       scientists on a postdoctoral level, will come                                   from countries in South and Central America and                                 from other countries. The program should result                                 in a very successful exchange of                                                scientific/technological information which                                      could lead to long term interactions between                                    the participants.  The areas of development and                                 reproduction are of general concern to                                          scientists around the globe and sharing                                         knowledge and technique in this area is                                         essential.  The global scientific community                                     will most certainly benefit from this                                           interaction.",
