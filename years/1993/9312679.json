 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312679   Bajzek       The advent of information services and the emergence of a  set of information navigation and access tools (such as Gopher  and WAIS) have made the Internet more user-friendly and more  useful to novices, as well as enhancing its potential value to  veteran users.  Users do not yet receive maximum benefit from  these tools.       PREPnet plans to configure these tools to produce  environments that match the needs of its constituency groups.  We  believe that education and training coupled with the planned  information environment will make PREPnet more valuable to users.       Also, to improve the quality of its current connectivity  services and to plan to meet future demands, PREPnet needs to  gain a better understanding of performance-related factors, such  as availability, load, congestion, and delay.  Many midlevel  networks suffer from the lack of a freely-available,  standardized, low-cost package to gather, record, and process  aggregate performance statistics that can be compared with  statistics from other networks.       Prepnet proposes that NSF support a joint project with the  Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to develop a set of tools,  application, and procedures for measuring network performance  that would be deployed by PREPnet and other midlevel networks.  ***",
