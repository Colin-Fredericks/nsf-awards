 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-owned Research Vessel ENDEAVOR, operated under a charter                party agreement by the University of Rhode Island, has operated                 continuously for 16 years.  The average projected life of a                     research vessel is 30 years.  This project will make major                      modifications and upgrades to the vessel to prepare her for the                 second half of her operational life.                                                                                                                            The viability of an oceanographic research vessel to conduct the                changing needs of ocean science research diminishes with time.  The             modifications and upgrades will modernize the ENDEAVOR and equip                her to be as effective and reliable as when she was originally                  delivered for service in 1976.                                                                                                                                  The improvements focus on three major areas.  Improvements to                   increase and enhance the ability of the ship to conduct ocean                   science research; upgrades to improve the day to day operation and              maintainability of the ship; and refinements to improve the                     habitability of the ship.  Attention to all these areas will result             in a vessel well equipped to continue a long standing tradition of              good service to the community of ocean science research.",
