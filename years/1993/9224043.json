 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most people have a standing decision to be tolerant or intolerant.              Researchers concerned with tolerance have generally assumed that                people rely on these established beliefs when reacting to disliked              groups.  Yet outburst of intolerance and repression are part of the             United States' historical landscape.  Why have these outbursts                  occurred?                                                                                                                                                       This research investigation provides a possible explanation for                 these fluctuations in tolerance.  When people feel threatened,                  which is likely when an unpopular group bursts onto the political               scene, a natural response is anxiety.  These feelings of anxiety                may subsequently result in political intolerance.  Preliminary                  results from a series of pretest studies corroborate the                        relationships among threat, anxiety and intolerance:  people's                  perceptions of a group's belligerence and treachery result in                   increased anxiety and, hence, increased intolerance.  But how are               these threat perceptions, shaped?                                                                                                                               The investigators will examine the impact of threat on tolerance by             studying variations in how the media and political and legal elites             present unpopular groups and their ideas. To examine these                      concerns, the researchers present video stimuli to people in a                  series of experiments developed in three phases.  Phase I involves              creating realistic videos about the two most frequently chosen                  least-liked groups in the pretest studies:  racist and pro-choice               groups.  Four videos for each group will contain combinations of                the two experimental manipulations:  high and low versions of the               probability of the group coming to power, and threatening and                   reassuring versions of the group violating the norms of proper,                 orderly behavior.  They will also create video segments that have               legal or political elites priming abstract democratic principles.                                                                                               Phase II consists of manipulation checks to ensure that the videos              actually manipulate the intended qualities.                                                                                                                     Phase III involves conducting the full experiments.  In the first               experiment, subjects will be randomly assigned to a video                       presentation that includes the normative violations and probability             manipulations.  The second experiment will use these videos with                the democratic norms segment added to them.  The third set of                   experiments will examine variations on these basic experiments,                 including placing tolerance in an electoral context, varying the                length of media coverage, and varying the nature of exposure to                 news stories about the group.                                                                                                                                   The model of political decision making they develop potentially has             wide application in the areas of media priming and framing effects,             controlled and automatic processing of information, and affective               and cognitive reactions to political stimuli.",
