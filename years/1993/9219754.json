 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the acquisition of an unlimited              cpu license to the source code of the GEOTOOLS computer program                 which integrates state of the art software for interpreting                     magnetotelluric (MT) data, a relational data base in standard,                  internationally accepted format, and utilities for converting MT                data to standard format. The GEOTOOLS program has been adopted as               standard by the geophysics research community working in the MT                 area and is already accessible to workers in Canada and Mexico. The             PI will obtain the license at a very substantial educational                    discount and will provide it to all interested educational                      organizations in the U.S.                                                            The MT community uses natural electromagnetic energy to image              internal Earth structure in terms of properties such as electrical              conductivity. Analysis of MT data is very computer intensive and                progress in the field has been inhibited by diverse data formats                that complicate data sharing, by difficulties of visualizing the                3-D data, and by the problem of interfacing data with incompatible              analysis software programs developed by different groups. Access                to the GEOTOOLS program will result in a uniform, flexible MT data              analysis environment for all of North America.",
