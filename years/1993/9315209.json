 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is the starter grant increment of Dr. Murphy's                       Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Chemistry. The research                     deals with the synthesis of colloidal semiconductors and their                  application to molecular recognition by DNA, open framework                     structures and tuneable nonlinear optical materials. In the                     molecular recognition studies, colloidal CdS and CdSe will be                   used as an inorganic mimic of the globular protein histones                     about which DNA strands wrap themselves. The luminescence                       spectrum of the semiconductor cores upon irradiation will                       provide insights into the nature and mechanism of DNA wrapping                  and unraveling that accompanies DNA replication and                             transcription. Hollow spheres of CdS and CdSe, which may                        exhibit unusual photoluminescence, will also be prepared and                    embedded in polymer films and sol-gel glasses. These materials                  should be attractive for nonlinear optical applications. Since                  the luminescence of CdS and CdSe is sensitive to surface                        adsorbates, nonlinear optical properties can be tuned by                        adsorption of molecules on the encapsulated colloids.                           %%%                                                                             Quantum-sized colloidal semiconductors have size and surface                    properties which lend themselves to a variety of diagnostic and                 optical applications of academic and technological significance.",
