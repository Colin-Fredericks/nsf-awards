 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main theme of this research is centered on microstructures                  formed in polymer systems by taking advantage of the interplay                  between functional groups, such as coulombic interactions.                      Although the studies start by using block copolymers in the absence             of coulombic interactions, i.e., neutral polymers, the creation of              microdomains of polymeric materials by introducing interactions,                such as electrostatic charges, will be emphasized.  The experiments             will be complemented by a collaboration with A. Khokhlov of Moscow              State University who will provide theoretical development on how                clusters and aggregations which form microdomains can be calculated             based on free-energy considerations.  The interplay of experimental             limitations and theoretical assumptions and approximations,                     including the use of well-defined polymer systems which are to be               synthesized in collaboration with D. G. Peiffer at Exxon and the                Institute of Organo-Element Compounds, Russian Academy of Sciences,             Moscow, is essential to providing a deeper understanding on the                 formation of microstructures.                                                                                                                                   The research effort is related to the exploration of our                        understanding on how microstructures can be manipulated in polymer              systems in order to achieve specific macroscopic properties in                  existing polymer materials.",
