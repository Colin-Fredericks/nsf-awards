 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to concerns of the Alternative Dispute Resolution                   (ADR) community, the project will develop and validate a                        Mediation Skills Assessment Program (MAP).  The MAP will be                     comprised of role-play exercises, work samples, structured                      interviews, and/or other tests shown to be valid predictors of                  success in mediator jobs.  Because MAP will identify individuals                who are likely to be talented mediators, MAP should reduce costs                associated with poor mediator performance and/or high mediator                  turnover.  The MAP will enable ADR programs to select, develop,                 and maintain a high quality mediator workforce.                                                                                                                 The strongest predictor validation programs integrate content,                  construct, and criterion-related methods.  Using a construct                    and/or content-oriented approach to the development of predictors               is good science, even if a criterion-related validation study is                planned.  This project for the development and validation of MAP                emphasizes the development of predictors that have strong content               or construct-oriented support.  A criterion-related validation                  study will be undertaken once the predictors are developed.  In                 Phase I, the project will determine whether criterion-related                   validation is appropriate or feasible, and the type(s) of                       mediator jobs to be studied in Phase II.                                                                                                                        The research will yield several products useful to ADR programs:                A job analysis questionnaire, a data base of questionnaire data,                the Mediation Skills Assessment Program, a client satisfaction                  survey, and supervisory rating scales.  Because there currently                 are no validated personnel management tools available to the                    mediation community, any one of these products could be marketed                to such organizations.",
