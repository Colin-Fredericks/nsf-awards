 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds training and support for teachers in the                       use of interactive texts in mathematics instruction.  The                       workshops are held during two consecutive summers at four of                    the six existing Interactive Mathematics Text Project                           centers.  They include ongoing seminars throughout the                          academic year.  This 24 month project introduces teachers in                    Towson (Maryland), Detroit, Los Angeles, and Houston to                         interactive texts so they can use them in their classrooms                      and begin authoring their own texts.  Monthly seminars                          during the school year support the classroom work of the                        teachers and provide a chance for them to share, consult                        with experts, and provide feedback to the PI.  In the second                    summer, the teachers work with texts continues as they learn                    additional authoring systems.                                                                                                                                   The technology and methodology used in this project are new                     to teachers.  The project provides insights and                                 understandings into how readily teachers adapt this                             technology to their classrooms and how extensively teachers                     need to be trained to feel comfortable with it and value its                    use.                                                                                                                                                            Cost sharing is estimated at 73%",
