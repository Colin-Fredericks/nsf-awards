 "awd_abstract_narration": "A nerve cell in the primary somatosensory cortex of the brain                responds to stimuli, such as touch, over a restricted part of the               body surface.  The peripheral area of stimulation that elicits                  activity in the cell is called the cell's \"receptive field.\"  When              such a cell is deprived of its normal input, its receptive field                shifts so the cell now responds to stimuli in areas that were                   ineffective earlier.  These shifts may involve mechanisms similar               to those the brain uses for other forms of plasticity, where change             occurs during growth or during learning, by changing the                        effectiveness or presence of the connections called synapses among              nerve cells.  There are several levels of synaptic connections in               the neural pathway from the skin to the cortex of the brain.  This              work uses electrophysiological recording, pharmacological agents to             block specific kinds of normal synaptic activity, and local                     anesthetic to induce effects of temporary denervation in the                    cortex.  These studies on single cells allow investigating the                  changes that occur over minutes rather than days, so the emphasis               is on the fast mechanisms of neural signalling and transmission                 rather than the slow mechanism of new growth.  In the novel                     approach here, not only the cortex will be studied, but also                    activity of subcortical single cells to define how shifts occur,                and to determine the influence of cortical feedback connections on              subcortical neurons.  This integrative approach is likely to have               impact beyond somatosensory work alone to the whole field of neural             plasticity and the role of sensory experience to sensory and                    behavioral function.",
