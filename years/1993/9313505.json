The university has witnessed an increased enrollment  of students in the last ten years,  a trend that is reflective of  the growth experienced within the Department of Chemistry.  DeLoach Hall, home to the chemistry department, is a twenty-four  year old facility in need of modernization.  Faculty and students  engage in chemical research projects that emphasizes marine and  environmental chemistry, biotechnology and high speed computing.  However, present conditions within DeLoach Hall impede research  productivity.    Funds are requested to renovate laboratories by  replacing the HVAC system, providing needed fume hoods and  snorkel vents, and installing a research-grade cleanroom.  These  renovations will allow faculty and students to conduct research  of a high quality and enable them to embark on new research  areas, including collaborative projects with faculty from North  Carolina State University.  Furthermore, as a result of the  facility improvements, the department will be able to improve its  research training capability at both the undergraduate and  graduate level, thus better preparing students for graduate  education and entry into the nation's pool of trained scientists.  ***",
