 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine phytoplankton produce a variety of organic osmolytes                     including the nitrogenous compound glycine betaine (GBT) and                    its sulfur analog, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).  We                       believe that GBT and DMSP make large and hitherto                               unrecognized contributions to the cellular nitrogen and                         sulfur pools in many species of marine phytoplankton and to                     particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and particulate organic                      sulfur (POS) pools in surface seawater.  Very little is                         known about the production, distribution and cycling of                         these labile biogenic compounds. Information from the                           literature and from our own preliminary studies suggests                        that many species of phytoplankton produce both GBT and DMSP                    simultaneously and that nitrogen availability may affect the                    relative proportions of GBT and DMSP.  We therefore will                        conduct laboratory and field studies to test the following                      hypotheses:  1) GBT makes up a significant (5-20%) fraction                     of cellular nitrogen in certain species of marine                               phytoplankton.  Likewise, DMSP is a major constituent of                        cellular sulfur; 2) As with DMSP, there is a relationship                       between taxonomy and GBT production; 3) The levels of GBT                       and GMSP in phytoplankton are a function of nitrogen                            availability, with use of DMSP favored under N-limitation:                      4) phytoplankton take up GBT and DMSP from their                                surroundings and release them under certain conditions; 5)                      In the field production of GBT over DMSP, or selection of                       species which produce GBT, will be favored in high nitrogen                     environments.  Our study will provide new and important data                    on the quantitative role of methylated nitrogen and sulfur                      osmolytes to the cellular nitrogen and sulfur budgets of                        phytoplankton and to PON and POS in the sea.  This                              information will lead to a better understanding of the                          biological cycling of nitrogen and sulfur in the ocean. ***",
