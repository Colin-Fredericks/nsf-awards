 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304467  Ho  The first and most critical step in any crystallographic experiment  is to obtain a single crystal that diffracts x-rays.  The  experiments in this proposal attempts to systematically develop  rules for growing crystals of A-, B-, and Z-DNA for structural  studies.  There are two primary factors that affect the growth  pattern and the ultimate structure of an oligonucleotide in a  single crystal: 1) the conformational of the DNA and 2) the forces  holding the molecules in the symmetric arrangement of the crystal  (i.e. the crystal packing forces).  Dr. Ho has previously show that  the conformation of the DNA in a crystal is dependent on its  conformation in the crystallization solutions.  This, in turn, is  affected by the solution conditions for crystallization and the  sequence of the DNA being crystallized.  For Z-DNA, Dr. Ho had  previously predicted crystallization conditions by estimating the  propensity of a particular sequence to form Z-DNA.  The stability  of Z-DNA is calculated as the difference in the hydration free  energy for a given sequence in the B- versus Z-conformations.  Dr.  Ho proposes to continue this work by extending the calculations to  include empirical estimates of Z-DNA stability for sequences that  have steric inhibitions to Z-DNA formation.  Furthermore, this same  approach can be used to predict the conditions for crystallizing  the A- form of DNA.  To crystallize B-DNA, attention will be paid  to specific sequence requirements that stabilizes only this right-  handed conformation.  In addition, the problem of crystal packing  forces, how they affect crystallization and how they affect the  structure of an oligonucleotide once in the crystal will be  addressed.  Experiments will be carried out to determine the  enthalpic versus the entropic contributions to these energies, and  to compare steric versus hydrophobic effects on the intermolecular  interactions within the crystal lattice.  %%%  The structure of the DNA duplex was first determined forty y ears  ago through x-ray diffraction studies on DNA fibers.  This general  structure launched a new era in the biological sciences by defining  the underlying molecular principles of genetic processes in the  cell.  Since that time, the structure of DNA has been shown to be  even more variable than originally suspected, taking new bends and  twists that may act as additional signals for controlling such  basic cellular functions as transcription and replication.  Again  x-ray diffraction has played a major role in the discovery of these  new and different structures.  These recent studies, however,  utilize single crystal of short DNA fragments (oligonucleotides),  which give us structures of specific DNA sequences at the atomic  level.  The primary hurdle to these studies has been the ability to  grow single crystals that are suitable for structure  determinations.  This process is generally treated more as an art  rather than as a quantitative science.  This is surprising since  crystallography is perceived as a very exacting science.  Dr. Ho  proposes studies that attempt to define the intrinsic and extrinsic  conditions required to crystallize DNA sequences in the various  conformations.  This includes the design of the sequence for  crystallization, and the types and amount of salts and alcohols  that need to be added to these sequences to help stabilize a  specific DNA conformation.",
