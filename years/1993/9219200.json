Strains of this  bacterium cause disease in a wide range of important  crop plant  species.  Virtually all of the pathogenic strains of P. s. syringae  produce syringae produce syringomycin, which is a potent phytotoxin  related to the polypeptin class of peptide antibiotics.  The syrD  gene of P. s. syringae is required for the production of  syringomycin, and its predicted product, SyrD, has strong homology  with proteins in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family,  and it carries all of the key sequence and structural features  required for function by ABC proteins.  Preliminary experiments  have demonstrated that the syrD gene is restricted to pathovar  syringae strains of P. syringae.  It is proposed that SyrD gene is  restricted to pathovar syringae strains of P. syringae. It is  proposed that SyrD is an inner membrane protein that functions as  the pivotal translator in the secretion of syringomycin by P.s.  syringae.  Objectives of this project are: 1) to determine of SyrD  is a membrane protein that functions as an ABC transporter protein  in syringomycin secretion.  2) To determine if the syrD holologs in  strains of P. s syringae that produce analogs of syringomycin  encode SyrD proteins that are functionally interchangeable.  3) to  identify and genetically analyze other protein components of the  syringomycin export apparatus.  %%%  This research is significant because (i) syringomycin is an  important virulence determinant in diseases caused by P. s syringae  (ii) secretion of syringomycin by an ABC transporter mechanism  involving  SyrD would represent the first demonstration of such a  system in toxin production by any plant pathogen, and would  establish SyrD as the first known protein for bacterial phytotoxin  secretion, and (iii) the mechanisms of lipopeptide antibiotic  sec retion is largely unknown, reflecting the poor knowledge of the  secretion  mechanism for bacterial antibiotics in general.  Further  analysis of SyrD could provide important knowledge about the  secretion of lipopeptide antibiotics produced by medically and  agriculturally important bacterial pathogens.  ***",
