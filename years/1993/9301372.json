The contributed talks and discussion  sessions will highlight recent progress in signal transduction  mechanisms in plants, and will bring together scientists  approaching this key topic from genetic, molecular, biochemical and  cellular physiology approaches.  Specific sessions include: (1)  Perception and transduction of light signals, (2,3) Stress  signaling (two sessions), (4) Hormonal signaling, (5) Pattern  signaling, (6) Cell:cell communication, (7) Protein kinase systems,  (8) Signaling the cell cycle, (9) Novel signal systems and  experimental approaches.  The conference will be attended by 150  scientists chosen to represent a cross-section of those interested  in the subject.  The focus on signal transduction in plants in the  context of a FASEB Summer Research conference format will provide  a unique forum for sustained, focused, in-depth discussions of  emerging topics that are critical to our understanding of the  underlying mechanisms controlling plant growth, development and  environmental responses.  This conference will bring together  scientists approaching plant signal transduction from different,  complementary, conceptual and technical approaches and hence  generate an interdisciplinary synthesis in this fast moving topic.   It is anticipated that this conference will be the first in a  biennial series focusing on Signal Transduction in plants,  alternating with the established Plant Genetics/Gene Expression  FASEB Conference.  %%%  This conference will focus on signal transduction in plants.  The  FASEB Summer Research Conference format will provide a unique forum  for sustained, focused, in-depth discussions of emerging topics  that are critical to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms  controlling plant growth, development and environmental responses.  ***",
