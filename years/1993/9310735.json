 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310735  Bernstein  The Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of  Michigan will purchase a real-time control processor and related  diagnostic equipment which will be dedicated to support research  in control-system engineering.  The equipment will be used for  several research projects, including in particular:  control of  unstable plants, control with actuator constraints, control of  rotating spacecraft, control of acoustic vibration, control of  flexible structures, and control of fluids.  Control -system technology is an enabling technology for many  complex, high performance systems.  In many of these applications  the control system is so essential that the system simply cannot  operate without it.  On the other hand, failure of the control  system can have dire consequences.  Graphic examples include the  Chernobyl disaster and Airbus crashes.  In view of the importance  and risks of control-system technology, this proposal seeks  laboratory equipment in the form or real-time control processor  and related diagnostic equipment to allow researchers to carry  out a broad range of experiments in feedback control technology.  The proposed real-time processor is the central piece of  equipment needed to carry out closed-loop control experiments.   With this equipment, new control laws represented in a high level  language can be transformed into real-time assembly code for  high-speed execution.  This capability will allow researchers to  implement linear and nonlinear controllers designed for a variety  of applications.  Among the projects that will utilize the  equipment are two projects that focus on fundamental problems in  feedback technology, namely, control of unstable plants and  control with actuator constraints, as well as four projects that  focus on specific applications, namely, control of spacecraft,  acoustics, structures, and fluids.  ***",
