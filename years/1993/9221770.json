 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many biological processes cycle rhythmically over a twenty-four                 hour (circadian) period.  Disruptions of this rhythm cause \"jet                 lag\" and are a feature of many neurological and psychiatric                     diseases.  In mammals, the pacemaker that controls this rhythmicity             lies in a brain structure called the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the             hypothalamus.  Cells in this nucleus exhibit many cyclic                        properties, even when removed from the brain and studied in a dish,             in vitro.  Unfortunately, the isolated cells tend to be unstable                and thus are difficult to study for long periods.  Dr. Earnest has              developed a genetically engineered suprachiasmatic cell that                    replicates in culture but still demonstrates properties of intact               suprachiasmatic cells.  With this NSF small grant for exploratory               research, he will screen colonies of these cells to determine which             ones exhibit the circadian time-keeping function.  If the proposed              projects demonstrate that circadian timekeeping is a stable                     functional characteristic of suprachiasmatic clones, potential                  applications of this experimental model would be limitless and                  could serve to rapidly advance our knowledge of the cellular and                molecular organization of the circadian pacemaker mechanism in the              brain.  Increased understanding would aid the development of                    therapies for sleep disorders due to altered time schedules, space              flight, and neurological disease.***//",
