 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  proposed research project will concentrate on four                    areas relating to minimal surfaces of finite type.                                   The first area will involve the development of                             algorithms to calculate integral periods that arise in the                      Weierstrass representation of minimal surfaces.                                 Determination of these periods is critical in insuring that                     finite type minimal surfaces are well-defined.                                       The second area of study will be to analyze which                          finite type minimal surfaces are embedded in Euclidean three-                   space.  Work already completed by the proposer in analyzing                     Hoffman-Meeks-Costa surfaces will be expanded upon and the                      proposer and student research assistants will study the                         relationship between finite type minimal surfaces and the                       algebraic curves that generate them.                                                  A third research component will be the expansion of                       the proposer's Mathematical package \"Finite Type.\"  This                        package will facilitate the general study of finite type                        minimal surfaces.                                                                    Finally,  an integral part of the proposed project will                    be summer research experiences for one student during each                      of the 1993, 1994, and 1995 summer periods.  Student                            research activities will be directly related to one of the                      three research areas of the project and will strengthen the                     student research program of the mathematics/computer science                    department at Gustavus.",
