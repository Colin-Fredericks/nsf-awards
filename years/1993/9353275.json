 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353275  Smith  The NSF Longitudinal Retention Survey is designed to collect  information on retention and graduation rates of first-time  freshmen in the RCMS institutions (Appendix 1).  The purpose of  this survey is to assist the RCMS Project Director in reviewing  annually the retention and participation of RCMS institutions'  student population in general, and subgroups of women,  underrepresented minorities and SEM (science, engineering and  mathematics) majors in particular.    The survey tracks the longitudinal retention and graduation rates  of each year's total first-time freshman population and its  subgroup of SEM majors for a period as long as six years.  These  two groups are further divided into subgroups of males, females,  Black males, Black females, Hispanic males, Hispanic females,  American-Indian males, and American-Indian females.  The data  elements surveyed for each year's first-time freshman cohort  subgroups include:  headcount of each subgroup, retention rates  after one and two years, and graduation and continuation rates  within four, five, and six years.    In the first year, the survey will include the fall 1985 to fall  1991 first-time freshman cohort groups.  The data collected  initially will establish six-year trend statistics of retention and  participation in the RCMS institutions.  These trend statistics can  be updated annually through continuous survey efforts in the  future.",
