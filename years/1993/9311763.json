 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves two periods of industrial residence in                two different companies working on projects of current concern.                 One company makes ferrites and would like help defining the raw                 material and processing variables that have the greatest impact on              product quality.  The second company is scaling up a process for                making a high temperature superconductor from development to                    prototype pilot plant level.  They anticipate problems associated               with changing scale and would like help defining the processing                 parameters that are most likely to affect the reproducibility of                product properties.  The primary activity at both companies will                be working on the relationship between processing and product                   properties.  Such investigations require extensive analysis of                  particle size, shape and distribution, characteristics after                    forming before thermal treatment, phase and microstructure                      development, final composition and morphology, and product                      properties.                                                                          The intensive interaction with industry will allow an                      upgrading of the educational curriculum that subsequent teaching                about ceramics can be related to actual experiences in the real                 world.  While allowing the investigator to identify promising                   research topics in industry.  In addition, the familiarity with                 these companies and their product lines will make it possible to                pursue research appropriate to establishment of long-term                       relationships.",
