 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to investigate the influence of                chirality on phases and phase transitions in liquid crystals                    through the use of optical activity and light scattering                        measurements.  Previous work has demonstrated that high chirality               has a significant effect on both the phases which form in liquid                crystals and the transition between phases.  This project seeks to              extend this work by:  (1) performing similar optical activity and               light scattering measurements in a new liquid crystal system to see             if the previously observed effects of chirality are universal or                compound specific:  (2) employing dynamic light scattering to probe             the time evolution of the complex fluctuations which occur in some              phases and near phase transitions in highly chiral liquid crystals;             and (3) investigating the fluctuations which take place in highly               chiral liquid crystals at phase transitions induced by electric                 field.  The goal in all these studies is to determine the limits of             the present theoretical ideas concerning chiral liquid crystals and             to suggest ways they may be extended to properly describe highly                chiral systems.",
