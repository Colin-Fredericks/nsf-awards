 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of Analytical and Surface Chemistry and in the              subfield of chemical sensors.  The objective of this research is                to determine the feasibility of detecting ultratrace levels of the              highly toxic hydride gases arsine and phosphine by taking                       advantage of the reversible interaction of these gases with noble               metal surfaces.  Arsine and phosphine are extremely toxic with                  threshold values for human exposure as low as 50 parts per                      billion. The lower detection limits for existing technologies are               only about 10-30 parts per billion, leaving too small a margin for              error.  In contrast, the surface detectors to be developed in this              project are simple, small, relatively inexpensive, fast, and                    highly sensitive.  Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that               detection limits may be reduced up to three orders of magnitude                 over those attainable with currently available technology.  This                Phase I research will focus on the dependence of sensor response                on detector type, film thickness, nature of substrate,                          temperature, and interferences, so that one method can be selected              for more complete characterization and prototype development                    during Phase II.                                                                %%%                                                                             This research should demonstrate the feasibility of novel                       technology that could help establish the U.S. as a leader in                    ultratrace detection.  This technology could be used worldwide by               the semiconductor industry and their chemical suppliers for                     improved safety and process control as well as for monitoring                   highly toxic arsine in natural gas.",
