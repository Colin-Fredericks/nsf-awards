 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are proposing to purchase a gas chromatograph-mass                           spectrometer (GC-MS), a compatible GC, and the appropriate                      equipment to create a Moravian College Scientific                               Instrumentation Network (MOCOSIN) linking laboratories and                      classrooms in the Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, and                     Physics Departments. This combination of the instruments and                    MOCOSIN is designed to:     introduce mass spectrometry and GC-                 MS into the curriculum across the sciences;     facilitate                      efficient use of expensive resources throughout the science                     division;     encourage broad collaboration among faculty and                   students by providing an intellectual as well as an electronic                  link among students and faculty of all departments; and                         provide all science departments with a connection to NSFNET.The                 combination of an MS and a GC, a versatile and powerful tool                    for separating complex mixtures and characterizing their                        components, will be used as a connecting thread for courses                     across the natural sciences. GC-MS will be introduced to                        students in General Physics and Chemistry courses where it will                 be used to illustrate isotopes and mass spectrometry. Students                  will use GC-MS again in intermediate level Biology, Chemistry                   and Physics courses as an analytical tool for separation and                    identification of organic compounds. Since all Biology majors                   take Organic Chemistry and all Chemistry majors take General                    Physics, by the time students use the GC-MS in their advanced                   Biology or Chemistry courses, they will have gained                             considerable sophistication in the use of the instrument. We                    believe our particular combination of the experiments and                       electronic network is unique and should serve as a model for                    other small colleges.",
