 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many women are attracted to psychology as a college major;                      however, the majority of women nationally choose careers and                    graduate work in applied and clinical settings, rather than in                  research. At our institution, psychology attracts the third                     largest group of majors, with approximately one in four of                      these women (28%) obtaining teacher certification as                            preparation for a career in education. This project, therefore,                 has created an integrated classroom laboratory for experimental                 psychology. Students use computers regularly to study research                  methods and experimental psychology in an integrated fashion.                   Also, these hands-on applications allow students to gain                        experience and heighten confidence in their ability to conduct                  research as professional scientists, in applied field settings,                 or as classroom teachers.",
