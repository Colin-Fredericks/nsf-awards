The  Center has two fundamental goals:  (1) to conduct exemplary  research and (2) to substantially enhance the involvement of  minorities in science and engineering in this Nation.  The center  has three research component subprojects including:  (1) the use of  light and its properties to study structure and dynamical processes  of aggregated molecules absorbed onto surfaces of different types  of materials, (2) the use of spectroscopies to investigate  structures and properties of mass-selected cluster beams syntheses  of clusters, and (3) the use of ultrafast laser techniques for  characterization and assessment of nonlinear properties of films  and semiconductors for electronic and/or photonic device  applications.    CASI was established in 1988 with funding from the National Science  Foundation under the Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE)  Program.  The CASI project meets the goals of the MRCE Program  especially (1) to increase the minority presence in science and  engineering by making substantial resources available to upgrade  the research capabilities of strong and productive minority  institutions, (2) to allow the institutions to continue use of  research as a tool to increase the effectiveness of related science  and engineering activities for minority groups in its region, and  (3) to provide opportunities for minority faculty and students at  City College and nearby institutions to engage in meritorious  research that leads to publications in refereed journals.  ***",
