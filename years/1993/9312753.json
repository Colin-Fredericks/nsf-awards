 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine how the Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya                      experience, diagnose and treat mental disorders.  A period                      of 24 months will be spent collecting data that will address                    interrelated concerns within three domains: (1) traditional                     Maya ethnopsychiatry, (2) the relationship of the Maya                          ethnopsychiatric model to the Western biomedical psychiatric                    model, and (3) medical pluralism and hierarchy of resort of                     treatment of mental disorders.  An ethnoepidemiology survey                     will be central to the project.  This survey will establish                     the prevalence and cultural definition of the mental                            conditions under study, form the basis for screening of                         cases in subsequent stages of the research, and for                             recruitment of self-identified cases of recognized folk                         disorders.  Focus on the experiences of the sufferers of                        mental disorders has yet to be undertaken in this region and                    will provide valuable information on the afflictions, the                       system of ethnomedical practice, the beliefs which direct                       treatment choice, the dynamic relation between belief and                       behavior, and the relation between the indigenous and                           biomedical systems.  The use of the Western psychiatric                         assessment instruments (e.g., Computerized Diagnostic                           Interview Schedule) will provide comparative information on                     cultural variation in psychological disorders.  Importantly,                    knowledged gained about Maya disorders and their definition                     and treatment will allow public health officials to more                        effectively design treatment strategies for the Maya.",
