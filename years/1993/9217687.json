 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of 13 U.S. scientists in a                U.S.-Japan Seminar on Macromolecular Design for Advanced                        Materials, to be held in Napa Valley, California November 6 to                  12, 1993.  The co-organizers are Professor Virgil Percec of Case                Western Reserve University and Professor Yukio Imanishi of Kyoto                University.  The focus of the meeting will be on the most recent                advances in the elaboration of novel polymerization methods and                 their use in the design of new and well-defined complex                         macromolecular architectures capable of generating advanced                     materials with controlled optical, electronic, ionic, biomedical,               high-strength and other special properties.                                                                                                                     This meeting is the sixth in a series of U.S.-Japan seminars in                 this field held over a period of 18 years.  The seminar is timely               because advanced materials underlie current and projected                       developments in the electronics, communications, aerospace,                     automotive, and health care industries.  Important contributions                are being made in each of these areas in the United States and                  Japan, and increased exchange of ideas and information should                   lead to further collaborative research between scientists in the                two countries.",
