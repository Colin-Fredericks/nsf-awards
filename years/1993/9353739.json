This program was established to work with states that compete least effectively for federal academic R&D funds.  The objective of the AAAS project is to develop a clearer understanding of the concept of state \"competitiveness\" in research by developing criteria for assessing competitiveness over time.  The project will be organized (1) to  review and examine state EPSCoR programs in terms of objectives and subsequent accomplishments; (2) to examine across disciplines the assumptions underlying \"competitiveness\" of university research; and (3) to conduct a workshop of scholars to define and build consensus around \"competitiveness\" criteria relative to the objectives of EPSCoR.  An advisory committee constituted by the AAAS Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy will oversee the study.  Reports will be prepared summarizing the results of the study. ***",
