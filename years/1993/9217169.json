 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research employs on a novel time-resolved spectroscopy for                 specular thin films and surfaces based on ellipsometry.  Rapidly                evolving thin films and surfaces can be characterized in real time              with sub-monolayer sensitivity and resolution.  The technique                   differs from alternative methods because of its speed, it requires              no in vacuo instrumentation, it operates passively during                       deposition, and it can probe surfaces even in the most adverse                  environments such as chemical vapor deposition.  The technique is               being applied to a number of growth processes in group IV                       semiconductors.                                                                 %%%                                                                             This project continues the development and application of a                     technique to measure the deposition of atomic layers.  The                      technique is unique in that it measures the growth atomic layer by              atomic layer.  In addition, it is very fast and robust and can be               used to monitor growth of semiconductor layers in the chambers that             are used commercially.  The technique is based on reflection of                 light from the surface that is growing.  The technique is being                 applied to a number of materials, primarily semiconductors.",
