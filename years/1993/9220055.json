 "awd_abstract_narration": "The superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a family of metalloenzymes                 that defend against toxic oxygen species.  While bacteria                       ordinarily contain MnSOD, FeSOD, or both in the cytoplasm, a small              number contain a periplasmic CuZnSOD, called bacteriocuprein.  The              periplasmic location of bacteriocupreins suggests that they defend              against oxyradical stress originating outside the cell.  The goal               of this project is to investigate the physiological function and                structure of this SOD type in bacterial species exposed to external             oxyradical stress.  Two bacterial cell models will be studied.                  Caulobacter crescentus, a pond bacterium that tolerates high                    concentrations of oxygen, and Legionella pneumophila, a pulmonary               pathogen that escapes oxygen-dependent killing by macrophages.  In              C. crescentus, SOD function will be studied by measuring                        transcriptional activation in gene fusions of periplasmic CuZnSOD               and cytoplasmic FeSOD.  In L. pneumophila the CuZnSOD gene will be              cloned and a mutant lacking CuZnSOD will be constructed and                     characterized.  In these studies, the mutants and gene fusion                   strains will be exposed to internal and external oxyradical                     stresses.  In addition, the ability to invade, multiply and to grow             in a HL-60 macrophage system will be studied for the L. pneumophila             mutants.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Many microorganisms can be killed by toxic forms of oxygen, a gas               we breath, but a few types of bacteria are resistant.  It has been              proposed that the resistant bacteria survive because they can make              special enzymes that fight against the energized, toxic forms of                oxygen.  One unusual enzyme that can fight against \"toxic\" oxygen               was discovered in my laboratory.   This basic research project will             study the structure of the unusual enzyme and determine how it                  works to destroy \"toxic\" oxygen, thereby allowing the cells to                  survive and grow in its presence.",
