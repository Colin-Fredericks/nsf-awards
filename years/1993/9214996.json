 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is centered on three-dimensional spatial                      reasoning and its applications in intelligent engineering systems.              Theories and techniques from the fields of geometric modeling and               artificial intelligence (AI) are integrated so as to attack                     difficult problems that arise in design, manufacturing and other                activities in the life cycle of mechanical and electromechanical                products.                                                                            The main body of the research is a natural sequel to previous,             National Science Foundation supported work on automatic recognition             of machinable features, and on accessibility analysis for the                   inspection of mechanical parts with Coordinate Measuring Machines               (CMMs). USC's feature recognizer will be integrated downstream,                 with experimental process planners and with commercial NC                       (Numerical Control) cutter-path generators for driving machine                  tools.  It will also be integrated upstream, with feature-based                 design systems.  The existing feature finder is very promising                  because it can handle complex volumetric interactions between                   features, and produces removal volumes that satisfy stringent                   conditions for machinability.  It will be redesigned so as to                   operate incrementally, thereby providing immediate manufacturing                feedback to a designer.  It will also be extended so as to extract              the geometric information required by process planners and NC code              generators.  Research on inspection planning will seek to produce,              fully automatically, complete programs for driving CMMs (and                    potentially other equipment such as laser probes), given toleranced             solid models of mechanical parts.  Dimensional inspection is                    closely related to tolerancing, and will build upon on-going work               at USC on the semantics of tolerance specifications.  Issues of                 measurement interpretation (soft gaging) also will be addressed.",
