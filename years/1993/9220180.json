It will provide a detailed focus on a small scale                     cattle production system that is expanding due to increasing                    external market demand for beef.  The effect of this intensified                demand will be analyzed in terms of changes in the communal land                tenure system and consequences for environmental quality.  Aside                from addressing scientific concerns of the stability of communal                resource systems and the mechanisms (e.g., indigenous knowledge                 and household participation) that regulate such systems in the                  face of external market forces, the information gained should                   provide useful information for development planners.",
