A group of university based brain scientists are developing this program. These scientists are very interested in having the program adapt for use by scientists in all parts of the country. It is clearly important to introduce young children to the brain and how it functions from the standpoint of understanding the nature of substance abuse and the significance of neurological injuries. This could also have an impact on the infrastructure of neuroscience research by encouraging young people to seek a career in science and developing a lay public that appreciates science.  ***       .       ?   o                   =       8   ^&  B   !/      ,   D   o&  E   \u00d5        $  B   H%  D       J       L       N    '  W   =&  O           g&  Q           t   S   u.  f   &   X           p+      6+  ^    +  _            +  e            U    &   ;F u        S V    F  V9315395  Lemmon      This grant will purchase equipment for use in presenting a program about the brain to elementary school chi    h                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                a   f   h                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    !         !
