 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316888  Becker      This award supports participation of five US mathematics educators  in a joint US-China-Japan seminar on mathematical problem solving.   The seminar will be held in China in October 1993. Papers and  discussion at the seminar will deal with the present states of  problem solving research in the three countries: comparison of  student performance in problems solving, including word problems  and language factors; mathematical model making in problem solving;  students' consciousness of the processes which are used in solving  problems and arriving at solutions; pre and in-service teacher  education; assessment and evaluation of learning in  teaching/learning problem solving; technology use in problem  solving; and analyses of the goals of mathematics education when  emphasis is placed on problem solving and technology use.  Factors  and issues that promote educational achievement in problem solving  will be identified.    This seminar holds promise for advancement of knowledge since  Japanese and Chinese researchers have strong interests in problem  solving research, and have produced important work in the area.   The noted success of the educational systems in Japan and Asia will  be explored in the area of math education, providing a basis for  future collaboration and exchange of research findings.",
