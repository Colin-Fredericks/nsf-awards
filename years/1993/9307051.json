 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307051  Horodyski    Metamorphosis in insects is regulated by juvenile hormone (JH), a  compound produced in the corpora allata (CA), a neurohaemal organ  attached to the brain by the nerve fibers. Metamorphosis is  prevented if the JH levels in the blood are high during a molt.  Besides controlling metamorphosis, JH also regulates completely  separate physiological processes in the adult female insect,  sexual maturation and egg development. In order to control these  functions, the levels of JH fluctuate in a characteristic manner  during development.    JH levels are regulated both by the control of its synthesis by  the CA and the control of its degradation by catabolic enzymes  present in the blood. Dr. Horodyski wants to further understand  the regulation of JH synthesis by the CA. It has previously been  shown that JH synthesis is positively and negatively regulated by  neuropeptides  synthesized in the insect brain. One of these  peptides, allatotropin (Mas-AT), has been  purified, sequenced  and shown to stimulate JH synthesis in CA of adult insects of the  order Lepidotera (butterflies and moths). He has isolated the  gene for Mas-AT, and has begun to characterize the structure of  this neuropeptide and the control of its synthesis using  molecular biological techniques. These methods are much more  sensitive than traditional biochemical approaches when studying  peptides that are present in such small amounts.    He has shown that this is synthesized as as part of larger  precursor which contains other peptides. The functions of these  peptides are not yet known. The Mas-AT gene is expressed in the  brain and in the nerve cord, and the mRNA is present during  larval life and during adult development. Its presence suggests  another role besides the control of JH synthesis, since Mas-AT  was inactive in stimulating JH synthesis in larval CA. He will  identify the cells in the times in which the gene is expressed.  He will initiate studies to characterize the receptor protein  which med iates the cellular response to Mas-AT, and to define the  target cells for the action of this peptide.  ***",
