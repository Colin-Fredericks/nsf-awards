Jackson of the University of                     California at Davis will perform a series of investigations on                  the reaction dynamics of two fullerene compounds composed of 60                 and 70 carbon atoms each, reacting with molecules belonging to                  families known as free radicals, and those characterized by                     weak bonds, large electron affinities, and low ionization                       potentials.  The experiments are to be done with a newly                        constructed molecular beam machine built expressly for the                      purpose of these studies.                                                       %%%                                                                             Fullerenes comprise a recently discovered class of chemical                     compounds of carbon atoms in which the locations of these atoms                 originally defined a nearly spherically shaped geodesic                         surface.  The appellation \"fullerene\" is used in recognition of                 Buckminster Fuller whose architectural researches on geodesic                   domes popularized such structures.  A fullerene composed of 60                  carbon atoms has the atoms located at the corners of pentagons                  and hexagons, these regular polygons forming a closed surface                   just like that of a soccer ball.  Such a cluster of atoms is                    therefore also popularly referred to as a \"Buckyball\". The                      generic term fullerene is now commonly applied to refer to such                 atomic clusters irrespective of their actual numbers of                         composing atoms, and its use has now been extended to also                      include tubular structures.  Fullerenes are found to be                         unusually stable and, even though originally thought to be rare                 in nature, can actually be easily made and are found in a                       variety of substances as a result of chemical processes.  Due                   to the potential of technological applications, fullerenes are                  the subject of intense investigations of their physical,                        chemical, and material properties.  Their chemical reactivities                 are not well understood and the purpose of this fundamental                     research project is to contribute to the knowledge base of                      these systems and thereby help in their eventual exploitation                   for technological applications.",
