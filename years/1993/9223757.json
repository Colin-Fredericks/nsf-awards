 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Applied social science\" have been too little studied in the                    history of science.  To study it requires full understanding not                only of the science, but of the culture in which it is applied.  In             perhaps no other area is the mutual interaction of science and                  society clearer than in the applied social sciences.  Ms. Lynette               Schumaker, under the direction of Dr. Kuklick, is exploring the                 growth of such an \"applied\" area, developmental anthropology, in                Zambia in the late colonial and early postcolonial periods, 1945-               75.  She is aiming to show how the development science movement                 took material shape in the technology, work organization, and field             practices of a path-breaking school of anthropology--the                        \"Manchester School,\" famous for its theoretical advances.  Her                  study follows development anthropology through three important                  stages in its evolution.  The first part of the study considers the             models and precedents available to anthropology in the Central                  African environment, and shows how anthropologists negotiated a                 place for their research in the colonial governments's aggressive               new post-war development strategy.  The second part focuses on                  changes in field practices and technology created by the challenges             of urban research, and shows how the relationship between                       anthropologists, their assistants, and the subjects of research was             transformed by the rise of African nationalism.  The third part                 discusses the work culture of anthropology and its influence on the             work culture of the international development organizations.  It                also appraises anthropology as a colonial science and the role it               played in conceptualizing Africa and Africans for the other                     sciences.",
