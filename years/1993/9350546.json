 "awd_abstract_narration": "93-50546  Strobel  Montana Research Infrastructure Enhancement Program  The State of Montana has initiated a statewide plan to improve the quality and effectiveness of  its science and technology infrastructure.  In a series of statewide meetings, involving hundreds  of volunteers from the University System, the State, and Montana science and technology  businesses, the State produced the Montana Science and Technology Policy and Plan which was  followed by a detailed Action Agenda.  This Plan and Action Agenda form the basis for this  proposal to NSF EPSCoR.    Montana proposes to support research, human resource development, and technology transfer  activities to improve the state's research infrastructure and competitiveness.  Because  biotechnology infrastructure and human resource development are high priorities in the State  Plan, four specific research teams in biotechnology will be supported (peptide receptors, plant  biotechnology, microbial surface interactions, and environmentally influenced mutagenesis) and  the Montana Biotechnology Center will be expanded to coordinate and promote biotechnology  research statewide.  Montana will also support teams of researchers in optical science/laser  technology and non-linear science (mathematics), and an individual from a group under-  represented in science, engineering and mathematics.  All projects included in this proposal have  been extensively peer reviewed by an external mail review and state panel system.    A Science Enhancement Program (SEP) will be established to fund activities statewide which  can contribute to the overall goals of the State Plan and Action Agenda.  Start-up grants,  research opportunity awards, visiting scientists, technicians, graduate students, travel, scientific  conferences, technology transfer activities, and public education will be supported through the  SEP on a competitive basis.    All EPSCoR-supported activities will be coordinated and integrated with other NSF initiatives  in Montana, including the En gineering Research Center (ERC), the Systematic Initiative in  Mathematics and Science (SIMMS), and the Alliance of States Supporting Indians in Science and  Technology (ASSIST), and other EPSCoR agency programs where appropriate.  Interaction and  collaboration with industry will be encouraged, and an aggressive education and information  campaign will be supported to keep Montanans informed about the importance of science and  technology in the state.  The State of Montana has pledged a dollar-for-dollar match for this  proposal to NSF.    The NSF EPSCoR program will result in the development of two sustainable Montana Research  Centers (in biotechnology and advanced materials) and in measurable improvements in the  number and quality of competitive research programs statewide.  As a result, Montana will  attract higher quality graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and new faculty, and will be  viewed, within and without of the state, as a significant contributor to the nation's science and  technology goals for the 21st century.",
