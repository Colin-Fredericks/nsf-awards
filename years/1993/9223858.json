The experience with the COSU-                                   II conference was much the same as COSU-I:                                      150 delegates from 14 foreign countries and                                     the U.S. attended the meeting for three days                                    of discussions about new directions in                                          technology and policies for managing ocean                                      coasts.  In all, more than 30 papers were                                       presented at the conference and those papers                                    have been organized into a proceedings.  The                                    COSU-II conference is now successfully                                          completed and the USC Sea Grant Program is                                      now preparing the conference proceedings.                                       With a generous grant from the Max and                                          Victoria Dreyfus Foundation, we have been                                       able to have all of the papers entered into a                                   single computer file in preparation for                                         editing and publication.  This action                                           provides funds to complete publication of the                                   proceedings.",
