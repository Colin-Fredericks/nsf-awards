 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308925  DeBrunner  The goal of this project is to investigate the use of  multiple bases representations of digitized speech signals  to improve the performance of speech enhancement and speech  syntheses systems.  In the past  it has been shown that the  use of several basis sets simultaneously provides better  energy packing than a single basis set for speech  compression systems.  This research will determine the  quality of reconstructed speech using multiple bases  decompositions with the overall objective of improving the  performance of digital hearing aids.  The proposed technique  will be compared to sinusoidal model based algorithms and  traditional noise suppression and cancellation techniques.    This research is important since it has the potential to  advance the fields of speech enhancement, speech synthesis  and speech recognition as well as provide useful results  that could be used to design new digital hearing aids.  ***",
