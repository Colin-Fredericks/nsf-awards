 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sex differences in brain and behavior are a result of the                  perinatal hormonal environment.  Exposure to testicular androgens               during critical developmental periods can permanently alter the                 anatomy, biochemistry, and physiology of the central nervous                    system.  A major question is how do the gonadal steroid hormones                regulate the differentiation of the brain at the cellular level.                It is likely that the hormones act through fundamental                          developmental mechanisms, such as controlling how many cells are                born, how such cells migrate to reach their targeted                            destinations, and whether or not they survive.  In this Small                   Grant for Exploratory Research, Dr. Tobet will exploit recent                   technological advances to examine the mechanisms by which gonadal               steroid hormones influence neuron migration during brain                        development.  He has identified a molecule in radial glial, a                   particular cell type of the brain, that could play a role in                    hormone-dependent cell migration.  Dr. Tobet will now localize                  this molecule in the brains of developing males and females and                 then determining whether its synthesis is regulated by gonadal                  steroid hormones.  In addition, he will establish an in vitro                   culture system to examine cell movements and contacts directly                  and under defined and manipulatable conditions.  The results from               this work will provide new insights leading towards understanding               the biochemical steps involved in the actions of steroid hormones               on the developing nervous system.  The identification and                       characterization of molecules that regulate the translation of                  gonadal steroid signals into permanent changes in brain structure               and ultimately function are essential for determining the process               of sexual differentiation.  The importance of these hormonal                    effects is underscored by evidence of sex differences and                       androgen influences in the susceptibility to certain syndromes,                 learning disabilities, and neurological disorders.",
