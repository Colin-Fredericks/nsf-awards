 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Miami will operate the R/Vs ISELIN and CALANUS                during 1993 as general oceanographic vessels in support of NSF-                 sponsored research projects.  The R/V ISELIN is a 170' general                  research vessel owned and constructed by the University of Miami.               Although the vessel is capable of world-wide oceanography it sails              mainly in the Atlantic.  In 1993 it will work off the northeast                 coast of the U.S. from April until July.  The ISELIN will do two                cruises off Bermuda in July, followed by two in the Bahamas and                 Caribbean in August and September.  The final cruise will be in                 October and November off the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific.                                                                                                  The R/V CALANUS is a 68' general research vessel owned by the                   University of Miami.  The Calanus normally sails off the coast of               Florida on short cruises.  In 1993 Calanus will do a series of                  short cruises interspersed with two cruises in the Bahamas and one              in the Gulf of Mexico.                                                                                                                                          These vessels are part of a fleet used by NSF to support                        oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research requires                   highly specialized equipment that must be permanently installed on              a ship for which the ship must be specifically designed.  This                  equipment also requires highly trained crew members for maintenance             and operation.  These vessels do not operate in the same manner as              general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore NSF supports the                    operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to                     oceanographic research that are operated by universities and                    research institutions and around the country.",
