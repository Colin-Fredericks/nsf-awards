 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fefferman  9311692        This project will focus on several ongoing research themes  in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.  In  particular work will continue on the extension of the theory of  singular integrals on product spaces.  Here the objective is to  analyze the properties of operators which commute with various  groups of dilations of Euclidean space.  So far, a complete  theory is available only for the classical dilations and product  dilations.  The theory evolving is quite different from the  Calderon-Zygmund theory. Work will also continue on problems from  elliptic equations with non-smooth coefficients.  In particular,  the solvability of the Dirichlet problem with Lp coefficients  will be treated.  An important goal in this research is to  determine the extent that one can perturb coefficients of the  equation and still guarantee that the solutions still remain in  the same Lebesgue space.  In the same spirit, elliptic operators  in nondivergence form with coefficients which are only assumed to  be measurable will be studied.  The approach used will be that of  approximating solutions by solutions to equations with smooth  coefficients and determine whether or not the process leads to  unique limits regardless of the smoothing of the original  operator.  ***            Partial differential operators form a basis for studying  the generic forms of partial differential equations. The analysis  of these operators through deep abstract methods leads to  surprisingly complete information about related classes of  equations.  Present research concentrates on operators in which  smoothness assumptions are limited to the bare essentials.  In  this way, results reflect a more realistic picture of the  physical world which the differential equations seek to  represent.",
