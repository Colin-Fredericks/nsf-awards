 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel processing as a subject has already been introduced in                 the CSE curriculum by an Honors program in Parallel Processing.                 Through this ILI program, we introduce an instructional plan to                 make the subject available to all CSE majors in order to                        prepare them for large-scale, meaningful parallel processing                    projects in the Senior Design Project courses. This plan                        includes: introducing an applied parallel processing topics                     course, covering parallel processing as a subject in the Senior                 Design Project courses, and making the proposed equipment                       available to undergraduate courses for programming exercises.                   In addition, several new industry-sponsored, parallel                           processing student projects will be introduced in the Senior                    Design Project course sequence.One of the goals of the Senior                   Design Project course sequence is to provide real-life                          industry-like experiences for our undergraduate students                        through industry-sponsored projects. Because of the interest of                 local industries in the proposed ILI program, a major portion                   of the institutional matching funds has been provided by                        contributions (contingent on this NSF grant) from E-Systems and                 Mercury Computer Systems. Thus, this project will provide a                     unique opportunity for us to achieve our goals through the                      cooperation and contributions of the NSF, UTA, and industry.",
