 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305573  The proposed research is to study efficient ways of applying maximum likelihood  (ML) inference to complex survey data.  The methodology we intend to apply is  based on the ideas of weighted distributions.  It consists of expressing the  joint probability density functions (pdf) for units in the sample as products of  the sample inclusion probabilities, expressed as functions of the observed data,  and the marginal pdf holding in the population.  These products are normalized.   ML estimators are obtained by maximazing the resulting weighted pdf with respect  to the unknown model parameters.  Survey data are often used in the social sciences and by government agencies to  estimate parameters of interest (e.g. cell frequencies; relationships among  variables).  Often the survey is complex in the sense that the chance that an  individual is in the sample depends on many factors.  As illustrated in the  statistical and econometric literature, failure to account for the features of  the sampling design in the inference process may yield misleading results.  The  significance of the proposed research is that it will hopefully provide a unified  approach for drawing inferences from complex survey data that will account for  the known features of the sampling design.",
