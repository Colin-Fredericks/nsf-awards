 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twin Cities Public Television (TCPT) purposes to develop                        \"Newton's Apple Multimedia Collection\" from their unique                        collection of multimedia-based science instruction materials                    built from the successful PBS series.  These materials will                     be designed to stimulate creativity and improve the quality                     of teaching and learning for all grade levels.                                                                                                                  This pilot project will include three discs of 25 to 30                         segments selected from over 200 in the areas of physical, life and              earth sciences.  Technology education will be included in many of               the video segments and addressed in greater detail                              in the printed support materials.  Each segment will                            be from 5 to 10 minutes to supplement active classroom                          learning.  It will include the development of video teacher                     workshops, printed teacher support materials and computer                       software.  The video discs will be produced in Spanish and                      English and a videodisc version for the hearing impaired.                                                                                                       This project has a well documented rationale on conceptual                      change, curriculum development models, and effectiveness of                     videodisc technology and television usage.",
