One vital aspect of risk assessment is the accurate  quantification of worker exposure to the agent(s) involved.  The specific aim of this proposal is to provide the Industrial  Hygiene curriculum with the instrumentation necessary to teach  students the basic skills involved in adequate quantification of  chemical/physical stressors in the occupational environment. The  equipment requested enables students to gain expertise in  quantification techniques covering a broad range of commonly  encountered occupational hazards.  Students will gain knowledge in  the scientific principles of instrument operation, procedures of  instrument calibration and manipulation, and the actual use of the  equipment in field situations.",
