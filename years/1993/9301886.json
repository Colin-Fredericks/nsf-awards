It requests support from NSF for connection  of this campus network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel  network located in the southeastern United States.  It will  provide operations management and information services and it  will give Brookings Institution a 56 thousand bits per second  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second) National Backbone network.       The Institution needs greater functionality and network  speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make  file transfers along with being able to collaborate with peers at  other schools on common projects.  Students and faculty research  will benefit from the link.  This is also a unique opportunity  for the school to explore innovative educational resources.  ***",
