 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a team of U.S. investigators                    under the direction of Dr. George Hendrey of the Brookhaven                     National Laboratory to travel to New Zealand over a two year                    period to work with researchers under the leadership of                         Dr. Bruce Campbell and Dr. Paul Newton at government facilities                 in Palmerston North, New Zealand. Government and university                     investigators in New Zealand have proposed establishing a free-                 air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment to investigate                  the effects of CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere on a grassland.                 Increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is expected to result               in changes in terrestrial plant production and carbon storage                   that may exert feedback regulation on the rate of increase in                   atmospheric carbon dioxide.                                                                                                                                     The team under Dr. Hendrey has collaborated in the conception of                this experiment and will design the FACE apparatus, build                       electronic control assemblies, erect the apparatus in New                       Zealand, and provide technical support and training to insure the               success of the operation. The U.S. group has developed the                      technological means for maintaining close control over carbon                   dioxide concentrations in an open field setting without any form                of containment. Support for this project in New Zealand comes                   from the Public Good Science Fund under the direction of the                    Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MORST).",
