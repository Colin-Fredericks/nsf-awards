 "awd_abstract_narration": "Widespread concern about the presumed global-scale deterioration of             coral reefs mandates the need for documented case histories of the              world's coral reefs.  To meet this need, the Colloquium organizers              assembled a series of case histories.  Some 50 case histories from              22 different countries were selected as examples of the health,                 hazards and history of reefs.  These case histories were used as                the basis for critical review by coral reef scientists at a three-              day Colloquium in June 1993.  Based on these case histories, the                Colloquium addressed several key questions:  What is the                        geographical extent of coral reef deterioration or under stress?                How will the expected global warming influence reefs?  How can                  natural vs. anthropogenic-induced changes be identified?  Does sea              level history explain some of the variations in the vigor of reef               communities?  What is the impact of oil spills on coral reefs? How              do excess nutrients from land-runoff affect reefs?  Immediately                 following the Colloquium, an open two-day Forum with keynote                    speakers presented the results of this review to the public.                    Selected case histories, their review and recommendations from the              Colloquium and Forum will be published in the University of Miami               Serial Publication.",
