 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308505  Firebaugh         This is a project to determine whether rising income in  poor  countries has contributed to improved welfare for  the  ordinary  population in those countries.  The research  will  assemble  data  on  indicators of social development  (e.g.,  caloric consumption, infant survival, life expectancy) for a  sample  of  60 poor countires over the last quarter  century  and  test the welfare consequences of both income growth and  economic dependency.  The research also proposes changes  in  the  way  in which cross-national research on such questions  is typically conducted.        This  project will contribute to a growing  effort  to  find  ways  to measure the social consequences  of  economic  growth  and  of  economic  dependence  on  other  countries.  Previous  efforts  to study not simply economic  development  but  also  social  development have  been  hampered  by  the  absence  of  suitable  data  and  faulty  models.   If  this  research  is successful it will provide a much firmer  basis  than  past  studies for understanding the  impact  on  human  lives of the economic changes that are sweeping the world.  ***",
