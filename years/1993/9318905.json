As part of its Annual Workshop  ADMI, a training and planning tutorial on networking is proposed  for small institutions located predominantly in the northwest  area of the nation.       The tutorial will provide an overview of networking and its  use and help to develop plans for Native American colleges,  reservation institutions of higher education, and others to  become effective network users.  Communication links between  small colleges and larger institutions are of vital importance  which allow educators to cross over barriers that exist between  two year colleges, four year colleges, and research universities.  ***",
