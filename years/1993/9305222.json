The structure of the meeting will be designed to maximize             interaction between commercial instrument builders and research                 scientists and will be very different from a typical scientific                 meeting.  Instead of set-piece descriptions of completed science                projects, the oceanographers will be ask to discuss the problems                that they face in turning technological developments in other                   fields into useful devices that can advance knowledge of marine                 chemistry and chemical oceanography.  Similarly, the business                   representatives will be invited to talk about the problems that                 they face in producing instruments for the rather small market that             is represented by the oceanographic community.                                                                                                                  After initial presentations that outline the problems and                       prospects, a large portions of the time will be devoted to informal             discussions during which it is hoped that fruitful alliances                    between research scientists and instrument building businesses will             develop.",
