 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to initiate a fine-grained analysis                 of relationships between demographic and behavioral processes on                the one hand and genetic structure on the other, in a natural,                  complexly organized mammalian population, savannah baboons (Papio               cynocephalus), of Amboseli National Park, Kenya.  Data on births,               deaths, movements of males among social groups, social dominance,               and reproductive behavior in three groups of free-living baboons                extend back for almost two full generations, over a 20-year                     period, and provide a unique data set for the study.                                                                                                            A significant characteristic of the multi-male, multi-female                    baboon groups, and those of most other monkey species, is their                 strongly matrilineal structure.  The effects, within and among                  groups, of this matrilineal structure will be evaluated through                 analysis of maternally inherited, mitochondrial, DNA.  Within                   individual social groups, long-term as well as short-term                       patterns of male residency, social dominance status, mate choice,               and variability in female reproductive success are predicted to                 impact on patterns of genetic variability, both separately and in               combination.  Microsatellite genotyping, involving development of               a microsatellite library for biparentally inherited, nuclear DNA,               will be used to investigate these effects.                                                                                                                      An understanding of relationships between genetic variability and               that of demography and social structure is critical for use of                  contemporary information to make inferences about the history of                natural populations and projections of their future, as in                      evolutionary and conservation biology.  Both the development of                 the molecular techniques and the empirical findings obtained in                 this research will have potentially broad application to other                  systems.",
