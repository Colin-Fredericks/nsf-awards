 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in nuclear physics involving Stephen J. Sanders and Francis W.                  Prosser, University of Kansas, and Christian Beck at the Center                 for Nuclear Research, Strasbourg, France.  The objective of the                 research is to study the details of the formation and decay of                  highly deformed quasi-molecular resonances in light to medium                   mass heavy ion collisions.  Underlying the research is the role of              the fusion-fission mechanism in light nuclear systems.  The                     research involves experimental measurements in both the United                  States and France.  Initial measurements establishing the                       characteristics of the fission process in a mass 48 system will be              done using the ATLAS facility at Argonne National Laboratory.                   Subsequent measurement of energy-dependent, side-feeding of                     states in binary fragments will be produced using the                           EUROGAM detector located at the VIVITRON accelerator in                         Strasbourg, France.                                                                                                                                             The collaboration takes advantage of unique facilities in both the              U.S. and France. Different aspects of the problem will be                       addressed at the two facilities, with the (EUROGAM) work                        aimed at decay properties.  The project takes advantage of                      complementary expertise in the fusion-fission process in light nuclear          systems.",
