 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ecological consequences of heterogeneity in resources                  depend on the way resources are arranged in space and on the                    functional properties of organisms seeking them. The PI's derived               a model of consumption by herbivores that incorporates variation                in spatial arrangements of plants, and velocities and food                      processing abilities of animals. The model generated the                        following hypotheses: 1) Increasing patchiness in plant                         communities causes encounter rate with resources to decline as                  foraging time increases. 2) The decline in encounter rate is                    opposed by increasing resource apparency and size. 3) Spatial                   pattern fails to influence intake rate when resource encounter                  rate exceeds an animals food processing rate. 4) At a given                     scale, the influence of spatial pattern on intake rate will be                  greatest for animals of intermediate body sizes. To test these                  hypotheses, the PI's will manipulate spatial patterns of                        resources, resource apparency, and resource size available to                   herbivores in laboratory and field experiments. Results from                    these experiments will provide an assessment of the model's                     ability to predict intake rate of consumers in comparisons with                 predictions from more traditional predictive theory.                            %%%                                                                             The PI's have developed one of the first models that relates                    resource patchiness, resource abundance, foraging movements of                  herbivores, and body size to resource acquisition by herbivores.                The model has generated a series of testable hypotheses, some of                which are unique and counter-intuitive. Tests of these hypotheses               will provide an important contribution toward a much needed                     general theory of herbivore foraging.  Results from this research               have important implications for landscape scale management of                   grazing systems, and for a general understanding of foraging                    behavior in light of the habitat fragmentation currently                        occurring in many natural systems.",
