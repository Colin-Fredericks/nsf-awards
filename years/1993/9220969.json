 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to examine the effect of major                ion constituents arising from acid deposition on soil structural                properties.  Acid deposition effects the composition of the soil                solution and the migration of constituents through the soil.                    Recognizing that the chemistry and mineralogy of soils are                      transformed by acid deposition, it is postulated that acidification             alters physical properties of soils including the behavior of                   cementing agents perhaps even in well buffered soils The effects                of acid deposition on soil morphology and structure will be                     examined in two kinds of laboratory experiments. Prolonged leaching             of different soils in long columns, and leaching of soils contained             in shallower pans subjected to different treatments, including                  wetting and drying.  For controlled experiments, two kinds of                   cement, carbonated and iron-aluminum oxides will be used in mixed               natural and artificial soils.  In evaluating the importance of                  selected cementing agents to soil structure, physical properties                of the soil including hydraulic conductivity, cohesion and                      aggregate stability will be examined by comparing acid   and                    control treatments under different buffering conditions.  To the                extent possible, non-destructive X-ray, gamma ray or CT-scan                    observations of the internal structure of the soil will be made to              relate changes in internal structure to measured physical                       properties.  Because soil relates to soil chemistry and hydrologic              processes, understanding the interrelation among them should                    improve our ability to predict how different environments respond               to acid deposition.",
