Langdon of the University of Southern California                                and Dr. V. Sklenicka of Institute of Physical                                   Metallurgy, Brno, Czechoslovakia.  Creep                                        deformation at high temperatures is an important                                problem in many industrial applications and the                                 problem is compounded in those materials, such as                               copper-based alloys, which are prone to the                                     development of extensive internal cavitation and                                ultimately to cavitation failure.  The                                          researchers will employ their laboratories'                                     extensive experience in the areas of high                                       temperature creep and cavitation failure.  They                                 will conduct high temperature creep tests on                                    selected copper-based alloys with the long-term                                 objective of obtaining a more complete                                          understanding of the deformation mechanisms and                                 the role of grain boundary sliding in the                                       development of internal cavities.                                                                                                                               This project in materials science fulfills the                                  program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    United States and Eastern Europe to combine                                     complementary talents and pool resources in areas                               of strong mutual interest and competence.",
