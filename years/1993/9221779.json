Yet people make many systemic errors                in their intuitive judgments.  These errors impede important                    decisions that people make on a daily basis, such as medical                    diagnosis, political and legal policy-making, and planning for                  the future.  The specific aims of the research are to evaluate                  and explore the implications of a conceptual framework developed                by Gavanski and Hui (1992) for understanding the mental processes               that underlie judgements of probability.  Gavanski and Hui have                 argued that, contrary to previous theories, people are not                      necessarily bad statisticians, in that their judgment strategies                are not fundamentally incompatible with statistical principles.                 However, they are sometimes bad samplers, in that they may access               inappropriate sets of information from memory for making their                  judgments.  Both accurate and inaccurate judgments can be                       understood according to what sets of information people access.                 This research will (a) test some basic assumptions underlying the               framework, (b) apply the framework to understanding the processes               by which cognitive organization (i.e., the categorization of                    information in memory) influence people's ability to judge                      various probabilities, (c) evaluate novel predictions of the                    framework for conditions under which people will make either                    accurate or inaccurate judgments, and (d) use the framework to                  account for and clarify the processes underlying some established               judgment phenomena.  The long term objective of the research is                 to provide an understanding of how people judge probability and                 when and why they make judgment errors. In addition, the research               will lead to the identification of tasks particularly likely to                 evoke judgment errors and to the development of techniques for                  improving people's judgments and decisions.",
