It is a study of the processes by               which   male and female resident physicians choose their  medical               specialties.   It  will  be carried out  through  both  telephone               surveys  and  intensive,  face-to-face interviews  with  resident               physicians  in  Nashville,  TN.   Results  will  be  analyzed  to               determine  the  extent  to  which the processes  by  which  women               physicians tend disproportionately to end up in specialties  such               as    pediatrics   and   gynecology   involve   constraints   and               discrimination versus preferences and values.                                                                                                                         This  research  will contribute to a very active  field  of               research on the nature of the processes producing sex segregation               among  occupations.  In addition to the scientific  gains  to  be               achieved  by  the research, this award will materially  assist  a               highly  promising student in completing research  for  the  Ph.D.               dissertation.   Thus  it  contributes to  the  future  scientific               manpower  of  the nation and the thorough training  of  the  next               generation of sociologists.",
