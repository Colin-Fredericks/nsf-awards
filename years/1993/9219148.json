 "awd_abstract_narration": "Five sites in the Palouse Loess of the Columbia Plateau, that each              span the last 75,000 yr (the last glacial cycle through the current             interglacial), will be mapped in exposures, described, and sampled.             The sequence of sites will form a bioclimatic transect from about               200 mm to 700 mm precipitation, warm  to cool temperature, and                  shrub-steppe to forest.  Tephrochronology, soil stratigraphy, and               thermoluminescence dating will provide chronological control and                correlation among sites.  The stable isotope geochemistry and                   abundances of opal phytoliths and the stable isotope geochemistry               of soil-formed calcium carbonates will yield information about                  fluctuations in plant cover, plant community type, and temperature              through time.  Site stratigraphy and the micromorphology (soil                  microscopy), physical, and chemical properties of paleosols will                yield interpretations of loess aggradation and erosion cycles, of               soil development, and of relationships of changing vegetation and               climate to soil-forming processes and landscape evolution.                      Measurement of magnetic susceptibility of paleosols and loess will              serve as a critical test of the climate proxy model developed from              Chinese loess.  The sub projects above will be synthesized into a               quantitative descriptive model of change in 5,000 to 10,000 year                time slices through the last 75,000 yr.  Two longer stratigraphic               sections that date back to 175,000 yr B.P. then will be sampled and             analyzed using the same techniques to reconstruct the record of the             penultimate glacial-interglacial cycle                                          Project goals are to provide direct information on changes in                   climate and vegetation, to quantify region-wide responses of the                pedologic, sedimentologic, and hillslope-geomorphic systems to                  those changes, to further document a losess-based proxy record of               activity of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, and to test several climate              proxy records.",
