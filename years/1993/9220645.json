X           This is the first year funding of a three year continuing award.  This research develops a theory regarding the utility of social laws in a computational environment, laws which guarantee successful coexistence of multiple programs and programmers.  It focuses on the coordination of activities of computer agents, but the investigations will be guided by, and impact, coordination in societies which involve humans as well.  A number of approaches to activity coordination have been discussed in the literature; this research concentrates on one approach which, although very commonsensical, has received relatively little attention in the computer science community.  Roughly speaking, the approach is as follows.  The society will adopt a set of social laws; each agent will be required to obey these laws, and will be able to assume that all others will as well.  These laws will on the one hand constrain the plans available to the agent, but on the other hand will guarantee certain behaviors on the part of other agents.  The domain of traffic laws for  mobile robots illustrates the point:  Rather than install a centralized controller (the most common approach in robotics today), or have the robots continually negotiate in order to avoid collisions (the spirit of which is representative of much work in distributed AI), this approach will have robots obey traffic laws such as \"keep to the right of the road\".  Again, although very commonsensical, this approach has not been developed in a systematic fashion; as we shall see, it poses some highly nontrivial problems.  One part of the proposed research is concerned with the off line design of social laws, along the lines mentioned in the previous paragraph.  Another part is concerned with the on line evolution of social conventions:  even when we as designers are not in a position to impose social laws ahead of time, we will want to design the agents in a way which will encourage the evolution of conventions over time.  In service of these goals, the following is proposed:  (1) define precise models for multi agent systems, in which social laws are explicitly represented; (2) define and investigate the basic computational problems involved in off line synthesis of useful social laws; (3) implement the idea of social laws for artificial agent societies in the framework of particular domains of application, while still proving analytical results about the usefulness of these laws in those domains; (4) investigate the evolution of social conventions in a computational framework.  More specifically, understand how different parameters (such as memory and communication) affect the efficiency of convention evolution; and (5) investigate the interaction between social structure (such as authority hierarchies) and social laws.      h)          0*0*0*",
