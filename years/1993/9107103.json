This reference               work, which will be the first new grammar of the language to                    appear in over fifty years, will consist in a comprehensive                     description of all aspects of the language, including                           pronunciation, word formation, syntactic structure, and dialect                 variation.  It will also include information on its linguistic                  history and development.  In addition to being a major                          contribution to Hausa linguistic scholarship per se, the grammar                will also serve as an invaluable reference work for scholars                    interested in comparative Chadic and Afroasiatic, and for general               linguists concerned with broad questions of linguistic theory and               typology.  The project will be carried out at Indiana University,               a major center of African studies, by the Principal Investigator,               an internationally recognized authority on the Hausa language,                  assisted by a team of Hausa language experts, including a number                of linguistically trained Hausas speakers.  The final product                   will be a large reference book prepared using modern computer                   capabilities and distributed through normal academic publishing                 channels.",
