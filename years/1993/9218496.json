 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support of a one-year Small Grant for Exploratory             Research (SGER) to test an hypothesis that frazil ice and anchor                ice form in glacial meltwater flowing into subpolar marine water                and form deposits that may be distinguishable from deposits of                  temperate and polar glacial environments.  The proposed study to                search and document that frazil and anchor ice form at the termini              of glaciers and play a role in sediment transport is high risk, but             if successful, this study will have identified a significant new                mechanism of sediment dispersal, thus leading the way to an                     increased understanding of ice-front processes in the Antarctic.                The field-based study will consist of (1) video surveys with an ROV             submersible to detect frazil and anchor ice and to study the                    glacier terminus, (2) CTD profiles, water samples and sediment                  traps to study processes of dispersal and sedimentation, and 3)                 bottom cores to document the record of these processes.",
