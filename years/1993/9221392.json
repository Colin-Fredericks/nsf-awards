 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Charles Harris is supported by a grant from the                       Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to conduct                      experimental and theoretical studies of the effects of                          solvation on the rates of chemical reactions in solution.                       He will measure unimolecular dissociation and bimolecular                       recombination rates on picosecond and femtosecond timescales                    using a variety of experimental methods such as transient                       pump-probe electronic absorption spectroscopy, transient                        Raman scattering, and transient IR spectroscopy.  The                           systems he will study include triatomics, pseudotriatomics,                     mono- and di- metal carbonyls, and substituted polyenes.                        The solvents used in these studies are primarily monatomic                      rare gas liquids.  He will also perform molecular                               simulations of the systems being studied using Generalized                      Langevin and Generalized Brownian dynamics.                                     %%%                                                                             Theories dealing with chemical reactions in the gas phase                       are quite well developed.  Much less is known about the                         factors which influence chemical reactions occurring in                         solution, and this is where most important chemical                             reactions occur.  In these very fundamental studies, Harris                     will explore the effects which solvent molecules have on                        reactions in solution which are initiated by absorption of a                    photon of light.  The combination of experiment and theory                      will lead to a better understanding of the factors affecting                    chemical reactions in solution.",
