 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific aim of this research planning grant for women is to                identify and subsequently characterize cytochrome P450 enzymes                  expressed during murine embryonic development.  This will be                    accomplished initially by screening tissue sections of mouse                    embryos using in situ hybridization and radiolabeled probes                     encoding known P450 enzymes.  Probes that hybridize specifically                will be used to characterize the temporal pattern and cellular                  sites of expression of P450 transcripts during embryogenesis.                   Identification of specific hybridizing transcripts will be                      accomplished using techniques such polymerase chain reaction,                   molecular cloning and sequencing.  Once cloned, endogenous P450                 transcripts can be expressed in host cells and the functional                   activities of specific murine P450 gene products can be                         characterized.                                                                                                                                                  The purpose for carrying out these studies is to identify chemicals             produced by embryos that are important in regulating normal                     developmental processes.  It is proposed that the production and                degradation of such regulatory compounds involves members of a                  large family of enzymes known as cytochrome P450 which metabolize               a wide range of chemical compounds in almost every tissue of the                body.  By utilizing a plethora of available molecular tools to                  study P450 enzymes, it should be possible to identify and then to               characterize the functional activities of those P450 enzymes                    expressed during embryogenesis.  This knowledge will provide                    considerable insight into which endogenous compounds or chemicals               are produced by embryos and what role they might play in regulating             normal fetal development.",
