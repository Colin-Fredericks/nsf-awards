 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in organic synthesis between David Crich of the University of                   Illinois at Chicago, and Michelle Bertrand of the University of                 Aix Marseille III.  The research involves synthetic applications of             radical chemistry and focuses on a series of experiments to                     probe, understand and apply radical cyclization reactions in                    asymmetric synthesis.  The investigators will synthesize a variety              of carbon-carbon dienyl acetates and identify their cyclization                 reactions. Radical cyclizations induced through the addition of                 sulfonyl to alkenes will also be studied.  The U.S. investigator                brings to this collaboration expertise in the design of new free                radical chain reactions and their application to the synthesis of               complex molecules.  They will continue to work on acyl radicals                 and their cyclizations reactions and the used of diastereoselection             radical reactions in carbohydrate chemistry.  This is                           complemented by the French investigators' work on the study of                  sulfonyl radical cyclizations.                                                                                                                                  Radical cyclizations have been extensively studied in recent years              and are now employed in organic synthesis.  Macrocyclizations,                  which is addressed by the investigators, have not been studied.                 Results of this research may lead to new techniques that provide                the basis for designed synthesis of new materials and natural                   products.",
