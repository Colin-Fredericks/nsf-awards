 "awd_abstract_narration": "The department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Calvin                    College is creating a Macintosh laboratory in which students                    can use Mathematica and other mathematical software to do                       mathematics. All sections of first-year calculus are being                      taught in a lecture/lab format, meeting three hours per week                    for lecture and for one two-hour period each week in the                        laboratory. The laboratory component of the course is improving                 the student experience in calculus. Students are gaining a                      deeper, more conceptual understanding of mathematical ideas                     because they are freed from some of their computational                         limitations and can visualize more easily using the powerful                    graphical capability of Mathematica and the Macintosh. Students                 are working in pairs; thus facilitating cooperative learning.                   The laboratory is equipped with 19 Macintosh IIvx computers.The                 laboratory are also being used in most upper-level mathematics                  courses, but in a somewhat different way. Students in those                     courses are already familiar with the software, so they are                     working more independently. They are given regular assignments                  that require them to go to the lab on their own to complete the                 assignment using Mathematica.",
