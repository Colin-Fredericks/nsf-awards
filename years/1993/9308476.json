The research tool for this study is the Monte Carlo method tailored for the simulation of realistic devices.  This has the advantage that new device designs do not have to be manufactured before their performance can be examined; instead, their characteristics are simulated on a computer. The Monte Carlo method is a statistical method used to solve the Boltzmann transport equation and noise is directly calculated from the fluctuations of the underlying physical quantities: velocity and number of electrons or holes.  The method will first be calibrated on some simple devices and then applied to progressively more difficult and complex cases, including p-i-n photodiodes, avalanche photodiodes, and quantum well infrared photodetectors.  The advantages and disadvantages of each design will be examined and possible ways of improving the performance investigated.  Since noise can be very sensitive to the details of the physical models used in simulation, this study can also be used to learn more about properties of materials used for photodetectors.  ***",
