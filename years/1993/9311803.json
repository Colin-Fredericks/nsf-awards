As  in previous years, the purpose of this conference is to provide an  informal forum for the presentation and discussion of new work on  selected topics in nonlinear optics, quantum electronic, and  lasers, and their applications to physics and chemistry.  An  informal atmosphere with a strong emphasis on discussion is  intended to encourage the exchange of ideas in a manner not  possible at regular meetings of professional societies.  Particular  effort is made to provide an opportunity for graduate student and  postdocs to interact in this informal atmosphere with foremost  experts in the field.  A total attendance of approximately 135  scientist, including students and postdocs, from universities and  industry is anticipated.  It is proposed that the estimated total  expenses for the conference of $42,000 be shared by the National  Science Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force  Office of Scientific Research, the Army Research Office, and the  Chairman's Special Fund of the Gordon Research Conferences.  The  National Science Foundation grant will be used to provide partial  support for invited speakers and selected junior faculty  postdoctorals and students who, because of limitations of their own  source of funding, require financial assistance to attend the  conference.  No honoraria will be paid.    ***",
