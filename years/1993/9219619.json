 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computations and analysis provide much more detailed pictures               of molecular motions in membranes than is directly available                    experimentally.  The essential strategy is to verify the                        computational methods by comparison to experiment, and then to                  use the computational methods to see membrane phenomena in much                 greater detail than would otherwise be possible.   For many                     membrane proteins, traditional crystallographic and spectroscopic               methods for structure determination are not readily accessible.                 In those cases, the computational methods in this work may                      contribute greatly to structure determination.  A significant                   beginning has been made in describing the detailed motions of                   ions and water molecules in ion channels and the details of                     charge distributions that give rise to surface potentials in                    biological membranes.  It is anticipated to extend this work that               has been begun and to explore other membrane phenomena, such as                 protein-lipid interactions in membranes.  This work will be                     greatly facilitated by the utilization of massively parallel                    computers.                                                                      %%%                                                                             The objective of this work is to provide new insights into the                  detailed molecular physical bases of biological membrane                        function.  The methods to be employed are all computational and                 theoretical and include molecular simulation, statistical                       mechanics, and molecular modeling.  These techniques are mutually               complementary to each other and to modern methods of experimental               molecular and membrane biophysics.",
