Creation of an  observatory for undergraduate teaching and student research is  the mechanism for the implementation of this goal. Specifically  the project not only provide authentic experiences in a variety  of physics classes, but also institutes new quantitative  courses and opportunities for student research and senior  portfolios. Pre-service secondary teachers in a new course of  laboratory methods, design activities utilizing the new  technology for pre-service elementary teachers and non-majors,  thereby reducing their \"technophobia\". Working with  professional organizations like the American Association of  Variable Star Observers and International Amateur-Professional  Photoelectric Photometery, undergraduates engage in  observational astronomy program that result in professional  presentations of their results. Existing telescopes are  upgraded by the addition of electronic digital setting circles  and integrated CCD imaging photometers.     ***",
