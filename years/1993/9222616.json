 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Kenneth Showalter is supported by a grant from the                    Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                 studies on nonlinear dynamics in chemical systems.  Research                    will be conducted in three specific areas: 1) he will develop                   and characterize new chemical wave behavior in open and closed                  chemical systems; 2) he will develop feedback methods which are                 capable of controlling chaos in chemical systems; and 3) he                     will study chemical waves on membranes in capillary tubes.  The                 work will incorporate both experimental and theoretical studies.                %%%                                                                             Nonlinear dynamics has blossomed in the past decade to become                   what many regard as a genuine scientific revolution, and it is                  now recognized throughout the natural sciences as a powerful                    tool for understanding complexity in nature.  Chemical systems                  have played an important role in advancing the field because                    they are especially amenable to experimental and theoretical                    analysis, and hence serve as ideal models of more complex                       biological systems.  With this grant Showalter will pursue                      experimental and theoretical studies to develop a better                        understanding of dynamical complexity of chemical systems.",
