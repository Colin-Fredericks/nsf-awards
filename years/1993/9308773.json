Unfortunately,  regularities are difficult to implement, unless they are  imposed on a system by some kind of \"higher authority,\" such  as the programming language.  The problem with implementing  regularities stems from their intrinsic globality.  Unlike  an algorithm or a data structure that can be built into  specific modules, a regularity is a principle that must be  observed everywhere in the system, and cannot be localized.  One can, of course, implement a desired regularity by  painstakingly building all components of the system in  accordance with it.  But such a \"manual\" implementation of  regularities is laborious, unreliable, and unstable and  difficult to verify and to change.    The goal of this work is to develop and explore an approach  to regularities which greatly simplifies their  implementation, making them more easily employable for  taming of the complexities of large systems.  This approach,  which is based on the concept of law-governed architecture  (LGA), provides system designers and builders with the means  for establishing regularities simply by declaring them  formally and explicitly as the law of the system.  Once such  a law-governed regularity is declared, it is enforced by the  environment in which the system is developed.  The efficient  enforcement of such regularities is a central objective of  this research.    Although not all desirable regularities can be established  this way, the approach should be able to support a wide  range of \"law-governed regularities\"--which can be formally  defined, and efficiently enforced--including module-  interconnection frameworks, access-control schemes, variety  of object-oriented regularities, various protocols for  distributed systems, regularities that help in unifying  heterogeneous systems, and others.  ***",
