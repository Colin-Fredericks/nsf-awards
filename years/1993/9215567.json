 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reinforced concrete composite sandwich wall systems are becoming                very popular  due to the many benefits of combining lateral,                    gravity and in-plane loads along  with the thermal benefits of the              insulated sandwich construction.  These walls  typically consist                to two layers (wythes) of reinforced (or prestressed) concrete                  sandwich around a middle layer of insulation, providing sufficient              R-rating for  thermal efficiency.  In order to maintain the                     insulated rating and to prevent  a thermal short-circuit,                       non-metallic tie connectors, such as fiber-composite  ties are                  required.                                                                                                                                                       The objective of this research is to determine the amount of                    composite action  resulting in the sandwich system subjected to                 lateral and bearing loads.  This  objective entails the development             of the commensurate analytical tools coupled  with the experimental             tests to verify the theory.  approximately 32-ft long wall  tests               subjected to lateral or bearing loads will be conducted.  Industry              collaboration and cooperation is a key element in shared cost and               participation  in this project.  This research is expected to                   result in a theoretical model for  analysis os future walls,                    behavioral characteristics (including amount of composite action),              design recommendations, and potential provisions for inclusion  in              new design standards.",
