 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spatial dimensions of the spread of AIDS (Acquired Immune                  Deficiency Syndrome) have not attracted significant scientific                  attention.  Most epidemiological studies of the spread of AIDS                  focus on male homosexuals and intravenous drug users.  These                    studies imply that the spatial spread of AIDS will occur across                 geographical environments, but they have not been followed by                   systematic investigations of the geographic and temporal patterns               of AIDS dispersal, or the types of geographical environments                    through which the spread of AIDS is most rapid.  This project                   attempts to fill this gap in knowledge by investigating the                     spatial diffusion and forecasting of the AIDS epidemic.  It will                test hypotheses concerning the spatial diffusion of the epidemic                in the aggregate and separately for the three major risk groups:                male homosexuals and bisexuals, intravenous drug users, and                     heterosexuals.  The hypotheses to be tested are drawn from the                  geographic literature on diffusion theory and spatial                           epidemiology and are set within conceptual understandings of the                mechanisms and behaviors specific to the disease.  At the core of               the project, mathematical models will be developed relating                     incidences of AIDS to various temporal and spatial variables.                   The explanatory and predictive capabilities of these models will                be tested at a number of different spatial scales, including                    counties.  More focused tests will also be conducted for major                  risk groups in the 100 largest metropolitan areas, by counties                  within six states, and by census tracts for four major cities.                  Investigations of the spatial diffusion of AIDS are few, but they               provide crucial inputs to knowledge about this critical problem.                Further research on the spatial aspects of the spread of the                    epidemic is necessary to inform planners and policy makers as                   they formulate strategies to contain the epidemic.  The spread of               AIDS has an important spatial dimension, and this research will                 add significantly to the theoretical and empirical body of                      knowledge related to this important societal problem.  This                     research will also enhance general understandings of the process                of spatial diffusion.",
