Consequently, the central pattern generators that are  responsible for producing the motor outputs to drive rhythmic  movements are highly flexible.  Under the influence of different  neuromodulators, these pattern generators can produce a variety of  different outputs.  In addition, many movements require the  coordination of large numbers of muscle groups, including ones that  may also be involved in controlling other behaviors.  This is  particularly clear in the case of functionally related rhythmic  patterns, such as those that drive the four parts of the foregut in  crustaceans.  Recent research on this system has shown that the  four pattern generators, which were once thought to be four  discrete entities, interact in a variety of ways.  The research to  be undertaken will examine a number of aspects of the  neuromodulation of the rhythmic motor systems in the stomatogastric  nervous system, focusing on the interactions of the pattern  generators.  In addition, this research will address another issue  that has arisen recently, namely the effects of modulation on  spatially distributed pattern generating networks.***",
