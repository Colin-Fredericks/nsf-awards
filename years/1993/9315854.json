 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315854  Miles  This award will fund a project focused on understanding the  directional characteristics of an invertebrate's ear which,  because of its size and placement, must use novel mechanisms  to localize sounds.  The study will investigate both the  mechanics and the neurophysiology of the system to determine  if novel phase delay mechanisms are responsible for the  unique capability.    This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and  Control Initiative which encouraged the submission of  proposals that through the study of neurophysiological  systems could advance engineering science and advance the  knowledge of biological systems through the use of  engineering analysis techniques.  The research being funded  by this award has the potential to lead to advances in  sensory system processes and, in addition, should enable  engineers to discover new methods to detect acoustic signals  for use in other engineering applications.  ***",
