 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electron cryo-microscopy and image analysis have become                         useful tools for determining 3-dimensional structures of                        macromolecular assemblies at near atomic resolution.  Our                       laboratory is uniquely equipped with a 400 kV electron                          microscope funded by the National Center for Research                           Resources of NIH as a national facility.  To complement our                     NIH support, this proposal is aimed at improving the                            specimen preparation procedure,, cryo-specimen holder                           performance and data collection on our 400 kV electron cryo-                    microscope.  The first half of this proposed technology                         development will be carried out in collaboration with Gatan                     Inc. to build a carbon cryo-coater for vacuum deposit of a                      thin carbon film onto frozen, hydrated specimens, and high                      resolution cryo-specimen holder for the JEOL 400 kV electron                    microscope.  The performance of this equipment will be                          evaluated with a variety of biological specimens under                          investigation in our Resources Center.  The final version of                    this equipment will become standard products of Gatan.  The                     second half of this proposal is to develop software for                         capture and analysis of electron diffraction patterns and                       images of biological specimens with our newly acquired                          1024x1024 slow scan charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.                         This software will be made available to the research                            community.  These enchanced technologies will be used for                       several collaborative and user projects in our NIH supported                    Resource Center.",
