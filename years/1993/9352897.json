The  participating institutions, who serve 235,000 students, have a  long history of cooperation and joint development. This  collaborative effort includes restructuring the curriculum,  developing materials to reflect the changes to be made, and  using technology and new pedagogies. Faculty/staff development  is being provided during all phases to build faculty support  and confidence in these new approaches to teaching mathematics  (776 faculty). During the  evaluation process, they are  examining outcomes at key benchmark points in the areas of  faculty development, student learning, and developmental  processes. A team of administrators, faculty, and staff are  providing leadership and management to the project with support  from key individuals who serve on the National Advisory  Committee.",
