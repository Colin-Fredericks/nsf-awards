 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Planning Grant for Women assesses women's                         participation in, and support for, working-class movements.  The                project specifically investigates womens strike involvement and                 support, employing the cases of the 1989-1990 United Mine Workers               of America (UMWA) strike against Pittston Coal Company (USA) and                the 1984-1985 National Union of Miners (NUM) strike against British             Coal in the United Kingdom of Great Britain.  Women actively                    supported these strikes but were mobilized in contexts in which                 their standing was indirect.  Only miners have direct standing and              indentity in mining strikes, and, in the United States and Britain,             miners are exclusively men.  This planning grant develops a                     framework of movement standing with specific regard to women, and               employs a modified political opportunity model for understanding                women's movement activism.                                                                                                                                      The planning grant promises to develop a model for comparing strike             involvement and gender participation differences in two countries.              The comparative nature of the project should enhance our                        understanding of these phenomena.",
