 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses practical and theoretical issues                   encountered in the lossy compression of information.  The problem               of successive refinement, or progressive transmission, concerns                 efficient approaches to incremental specification of data produced              by an information source in order to render it in more detail at                each of several encoding stages.  A prime theoretical issue is the              determination of conditions under which this can be done in such a              way the total data rate required is no less than that needed by                 someone tasked with only the final rendering in the sequence                    without the requirement of generating the intermediate versions.                Practical algorithms inspired by theoretical advances in universal              lossless data compression, especially the Lempe-Ziv and arithmetic              coding formalisms, have profoundly affected the way text and data               files are compressed for transmission and storage.  Analogous                   theoretical issues and practical techniques are sought for                      universal lossy data compression based on searching the imprecisely             described past for an approximate rather than an exact match of the             next segment of the yet-to-be-encoded data.  the results should                 significantly impact the way actual data sources, especially images             and video, get encoded in practice.",
