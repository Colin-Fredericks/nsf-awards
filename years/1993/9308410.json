Drilling operations began in  January, 1985, following conversion of a state-of-the-art ocean  drilling vessel, the JOIDES RESOLUTION, for scientific ocean  drilling.    The first 51 legs of the program have examined the history of  global climate change in the equatorial and polar regions, the  early stages of continental rifting, fluid flow in sediments of  active margins, and the composition and alteration of the oceanic  crust. Sediment samples cored from the Norwegian Sea, eastern  equatorial Atlantic, and Weddell Sea record synchronous change to  glacial conditions approximately 3 million years ago which marked  the beginning of northern hemisphere glaciation. Drilling on the  Antarctic margin has traced the history of continental glaciation  back to at least the early Oligocene and possibly late Eocene, 42  million years ago. Drilling results in the northwest Indian Ocean  are being used to correlate the initiation of monsoon circulation  with uplift of the Himalayas. Seismic reflection records from  rifted continental margins often record parallel, dipping  reflectors. ODP drilling on the Norwegian margin has shown that  these reflectors are basalt flows that form during continental  rifting and gradually change in chemistry from continental to  oceanic as rifting proceeds. Drilling along the Antilles, Peruvian,  and Japanese trenches has documented the importance of fluid  transport to the deformation and alteration  of margin sediments.    New ODP developments in drilling and instrument technology have  allowed coring of unsedimented oceanic crust. A 500-meter core into  the lower oceanic crust in the southwest Indian Ocean records the  successive formation and solidification of magma chambers along the  Indian Ocean spreading center. A major surprise was the high  magnetization of these lower crustal rocks, which is at odds with  existing models for the formation of sea-floor magnetic anomalies.  In the eastern equatorial Pacific ODP has initiated attempts to use  mining drilling techniques to drill young ocean floor. Although the  initial drilling results were disappointing, development of this  new technology for ocean drilling will be continued. Deployment of  down-hole instrument packages for long-term measurement of crustal  conditions and processes are an important objective of the program.  In recent years, close collaboration with Global Seismic Network  planning has lead to initial deployment of long-period, digital  seismometers in ODP boreholes. Temperature and pressure sensors  have been deployed in holes drilled into an active hydrothermal  system on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the northeast Pacific. Data  from these instruments are being recovered using submersibles and  remote vehicles.     The Ocean Drilling Program began a four year drilling program in  the Atlantic Ocean in early 1993. The major scientific problems to  be addressed during this period include oceanographic and climate  change of the Arctic during the Neogene, the formation of rifted  and volcanic continental margins, changes in equatorial circulation  and productivity, the composition of the lower oceanic crust, the  history of sea-level fluctuations during non-glacial periods of the  Tertiary, and the formation of metal-rich sulfide deposits along  the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.     The Ocean Drilling Program is managed through a contract with the  Joint Oceanographic Institutions, Inc. (JOI). JOI has subcontracts  with Texas A&M  University for management of scientific support and  drilling operations aboard the JOIDES RESOLUTION, and with  Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory for management of logging  operations. Scientific advice and direction for the program are  provided to JOI through the international scientific organization,  Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling (JOIDES).  The long term directions for ODP drilling are established by JOIDES  initiated Conferences on Scientific Ocean Drilling (COSOD). The  most recent of these international meetings was held in 1987 and  was attended by over 350 scientists from 20 nations. Shorter term  planning evolves from the JOIDES advisory structure composed of 15  panels and committees with approximately 250 total members. The  selection of actual drilling sites is in response to drilling  proposals submitted to JOIDES by individuals in the international  scientific community.    The responsibility of Texas A&M as science operator is to collect  cores from beneath the floors of the world's oceans and to assure  that adequate scientific facilities are available for the analysis  and preservation of these samples. In fulfilling this obligation,  Texas A&M: (1) contracts for drilling operations on the JOIDES  RESOLUTION; (2) develops operation plans and drilling schedules;  (3) staffs the ship with scientific personnel and technicians; (4)  maintains shipboard laboratories and equipment; (5) Stores,  archives and disseminates samples; (6) publishes the Proceedings of  the Ocean Drilling Program which  summarize the scientific results  of the program, and (7) develops new drilling and coring technology  required to address the scientific program developed by JOIDES.      The responsibility of the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory is  to supply a full suite of geochemical and geophysical services  which involve the acquisition, processing, and dissemination of in  situ logging measurements. Routine logging services are performed  by Schlumberger Offshore  Services.  ***",
