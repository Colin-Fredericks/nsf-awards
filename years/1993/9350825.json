The two-semester  series of experiments is structured as a set of multi-  experiment projects which give students an early introduction  to modern instruments and to the different fields of chemistry.   A diode-array UV/visible spectrophotometer is being used for a  discovery-based organic spectroscopy project in which 32  students record the spectra of a number of compounds in one  class period.  It also is being used for a phosphate analysis  which, for the low levels of phosphorus often found in natural  water, requires a sensitive instrument capable of accommodating  long path lengths cells.  Finally, it also is being used in a  coordination chemistry project.       ***",
