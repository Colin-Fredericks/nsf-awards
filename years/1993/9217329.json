The                                     collaborators are Steven Manson of Georgia                                      State University and Pranawa Deshmukh of the                                    Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.  During                                 the initial phase of the project, the Indian                                    collaborator will be supported with travel and                                  living expenses to do developmental work using                                  the computational facilities at Georgia State                                   University.  The proposed research will study                                   i) the influence of relativistic interactions                                   in the photoionization of high-z atoms using                                    the RRPA formalism with enough channels to                                      obviate truncation errors, ii) investigate the                                  inner shell threshold behavior of                                               photoionization cross sections, iii)  explore                                   the photoionization of ions with the RRPA                                       technology, iv) examine the systematics of                                      generalized oscillator strengths for neutral                                    atoms, excited states, and atomic ions.                                                                                                                         Scope:  This research will provide training for                                 graduate and advanced undergraduate students in                                 the methods of calculating and understanding                                    atomic and molecular structure and collisions.                                  The techniques and computer codes developed                                     will strengthen the theoretical physics program                                 at the collaborating institutions.  The results                                 will provide further insight into the basic                                     nature of these fundamental atomic processes                                    which are important in plasma physics,                                          atmospheric, solar, and astrophysics, radiation                                 physics and therapy, and for studies of                                         possible x-ray and nuclear-pumped laser                                         mechanisms.",
