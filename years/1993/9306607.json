 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale genomic rearrangements including the loss of                   significant amounts of DNA are known to occur during the                        development of the organism in several groups of animals and some               plants, but the mechanisms for these changes and the functions                  served are not known.  Dr. Wyngaard in a career advancement award               will be learning new DNA-based technologies to explore the pattern              and process of chromatin diminution and genomic rearrangement in a              group of freshwater copepods (planktonic crustaceans) where these               phenomena are well known.  Probes for particular classes of DNA                 will be used to test whether DNA excisions involve specialized                  groups of genes and whether the sequence of losses has functional               effects in the development of the organism.                                     %%%                                                                                  Chromosome rearrangements and loss of significant amounts of               DNA, the genetic material, characterize groups of ciliated                      protozoa, crustacean copepods, and nematodes during the development             of individual organisms.  Dr. Wyngaard in a career advancement                  award is applying powerful new molecular methods to the study of                these phenomena, in particular to determine whether classes of                  genes are excised during development and whether the sequence of                losses has functional effects in growth and maturation.  The work               will advance understanding of molecular genetics and evolution in               animals.",
