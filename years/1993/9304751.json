Mutation at  highly solvent-exposed amino acids on the surface of iso-1-  cytochrome c is proposed as a means of probing the energetics of  the denatured state with reduced interference from native state  energetic relative to mutation at buried amino acids.   Hydrophilic to hydrophobic mutations at such sites will be used  to test the prediction of heteropolymer theory that such  mutations should stabilize the denatured state.  Hydrophobic to  hydrophilic surface mutations will also be investigated to see if  they have the opposite effect on the denatured state energy.   Histidines are believed to ligate to the heme of cytochrome c in  the denatured state.  Using mutagenesis methods to vary the  sequence position of the histidine we will attempt to modulate  the size and shape of the denatured state.  The thermodynamics of  all mutants will be characterized by both guanidine-HC1 and  thermal denaturation techniques.  A reversible disulfide mutation  method and  Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy will be used  to directly assess the impact of our mutations on the denatured  state of the protein.  %%%  Understanding the factors that stabilize the folded state of a  protein relative to the unfolded state is a central issue in  Biochemistry.  Being able to rationally control the stability of  a protein would be of great importance to the pharmaceutical  industry which is increasingly developing protein  pharmaceuticals.  The work to be undertaken will explore methods  of selectively perturbing the unfolded state of a protein, by  focussing on mutation of amino acids that are exposed on the  surface of a protein.  The work will be carried out with the  protein iso-1-cytochrome c which will be isolated from Baker's  yeast.  Standard thermal and chemical methods will be used to  characterize the energy requir ed to unfold the mutant forms of  the protein.  Two methods, reversible disulfide mutation and  infrared spectroscopy, will be used to evaluate the degree to  which stability changes originate from the unfolded state of the  protein.  These experiments have the potential to provide methods  of stabilizing or destabilizing a protein which do not affect the  folded structure of a protein and thus would have minimal impact  on biological activity.  ***",
