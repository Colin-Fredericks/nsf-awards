 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein G is a multi-domain component of the cell wall of some                  Streptococcal species and binds to all subclasses of human                      immunoglobulin G (IgG) by the constant Fc region.  The IgG                      binding function of Streptococcal Protein G is contained in a                   globular domain  of 56 amino acids designated GB.  The objectives               of this proposal are 1) to determine the tertiary structure of GB               and relevant mutants using NMR spectroscopy; 2) to use this                     domain as a model to study protein folding and stability using                  NMR, microcalorimetry, CD, fluorescence spectroscopy and site-                  directed mutagenesis; and 3) to study the basic mechanisms of                   molecular recognition involved in the high affinity interaction                 of GB with the heavy-chain, constant region (Fc) of IgG using the               above methods.  The long term objective is to better understand                 the function of this class of Fc receptor proteins and engineer                 new classes of Fc receptor proteins.                                            %%%                                                                             GB is an ideal protein to probe the relationship of amino acid                  sequence to structure and stability.  It is on the lower limit in               size for a stable unique protein structure.  Furthermore it                     achieves its stability without disulfide bonds or tight ligand                  binding.  Its small size permits the application of numerous                    biophysical techniques to study the folding and stability, in                   particular NMR methods.  Little information is yet available                    concerning the specific nature of the binding interaction of GB                 with Fc or the mechanism of its class selectivity.  Because                     Protein G is class specific in its binding to IgG and binds to                  the portion of the immunoglobulin that defines its class, we                    believe that our proposed studies will not only help elucidate                  the mechanism of recognition but also permit the engineering of                 Fc receptors with new class selectivities.  Fc receptors with new               properties will have numerous medical and biotechnological                      applications.",
