Genes have been identified which are  required for stationary-phase induction of resistance to extreme  acid (pH 2-3).  These include katF and several Tn5 insertions of  unknown location.  The following questions are being addressed:   What are the roles of pH and anaerobiosis is stationary-phase acid  resistance?  Which gene products participate in acid resistance,  and how are they regulated?  Do some acid-resistance loci also  participate in pH homeostasis during growth?  Does stationary phase  also confer alkaline resistance response?  The objectives are:   observe pH dependence, if any, of stationary-phase acid resistance;  measure pHint homeostasis and pH-dependent growth of acid-sensitive  strains; screen E. coli Tn10 and lac fusion strains for acid-  sensitivity, and map the loci; characterize stationary-phase  alkaline resistance in E. coli.  %%%  pH is a major environmental parameter for bacteria, and internal pH  is significant in terms of bacterial physiology and energy  transduction .  This research will lead to an understanding of how  bacteria can survive and function in extremely acidic environments.  ***",
