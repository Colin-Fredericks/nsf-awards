The Committee studies behavior and its bi-                                      directional interaction with neural and endocrine                               mechanisms and its ecological and evolutionary                                  context.  The strength of the committee derives                                 from bringing all three levels of analysis together                             as an integrated system, including mental processes                             and integrative physiological systems other than                                the brain.                                                                           This degree granting Committee is unique in                                the nation because it combines the biopsychology of                             humans with the biopsychology of animals.  The                                  University of Chicago is the only university to                                 provide both graduate and undergraduate training in                             behavioral neuroscience and endocrinology and this                              award enables them to renovate their research and                               research training space in this important research                              area.",
