 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although Third World frontiers have received considerable                  attention in recent years, their urban segment has been                         neglected.  Urban frontier studies are few in number, rarely do                 they reference the experience of other Third World locales or                   North America, and they fail to formulate a conceptual framework                of frontier urbanization and integration into a national urban                  system.  Existing frameworks of frontier urbanization derive                    largely from research on 18th and 19th century North America,                   which tends to reflect more developed portions of that frontier                 experience.  This research project will provide an understanding                of urban place evolution in Third World frontiers.  It will                     compare the evolution of frontier towns cross-nationally to                     understand better similarities in the urban process from place to               place.  It will also build a conceptual framework to account for                the transition of urban places from their formative phase in a                  rudimentary frontier setting to an emerging urban sub-system in a               mature, but evolving, economy.  This will be accomplished by a                  detailed study of the frontier urbanization process in Ecuador                  for the period 1960 to 1990.  Data will come from census and                    other secondary sources, surveys, and informant interviews.  Five               major urban centers will be examined in terms of economic                       activity, human resource profile, transformation in patterns of                 interaction with local hinterlands and other portions of Ecuador,               shifts in the type of interaction, and the explanatory factors                  influencing these trends.                                                            This research will provide a bridge to existing frameworks                 of frontier urbanization, which largely derive from research on                 North America during its own frontier development.  It will                     address the function of frontier towns and their integration into               a national urban system in a Third World context.  Population                   growth and national settlement policies in these nations are                    promoting an acceleration or urban development in heretofore                    sparsely populated regions.  rates on irregular surfaces.  New                  knowledge about how urban places develop and become integrated                  into a national urban system will provide both scientists and                   policy makers with a basis for evaluating the impact of this                    phenomenon on economic, social, and environmental systems.",
