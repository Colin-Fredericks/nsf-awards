The stratigraphy of this region                       is well                                                                         known and it has a rich record of vertebrates in the                            latter part of                                                                  the Eocene.  Prior to flooding of this region, the                              combined Chinese                                                                and American teams will salvage fossil bearing materials                        from the                                                                        sites that will be lost.  This is very important because                        this                                                                            particular formation has morphologically complete                               specimens                                                                       preserved in deposits, and as such, these fossils will                          shed light                                                                      on a dynamic interval, when the climatic, faunal, and                           biogeographic                                                                   changes of the Eocene-Oligocene event occurred.",
