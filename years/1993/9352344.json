 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352344  Carr  The School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma will  improve the quality and scope of its undergraduate education  for both majors and nonmajors through the creation of a  computer-based synoptic laboratory. This facility primarily  consists of a network of UNIX-based servers and X terminals,  and enables students to access and effectively process current  and/or archived meteorological data using software produced by  the UPC (UNIDATA Program Center).  The facility meets three needs. First, it will permit more  innovative techniques in exposing nonmajors to scientific  concepts which may impact their daily lives, and allow them to  gain a better understanding of local and global weather,  climate, and environmental issues. Second, this facility will  satisfy the need of undergraduate majors in atmospheric science  to utilize, software packages on X terminals for simultaneous  viewing of text and raster image graphics in a classroom  environment. This laboratory will greatly facilitate the  teaching of important meteorological concepts via real-time use  of conventional, profiler, surface mesonetwork, satellite,  radar, and model data. Third, the School will convert from a  VMS computing environment to a UNIX-based one, enabling it to  fully participate as a primary node in the distribution of  weather data over the Internet.  The creation of a computer-based synoptic laboratory addresses  these crucial needs because of the versatility and power of the  UNIX-based servers, and the enhanced graphics capabilities of  the X terminals. The quality of undergraduate instruction will  be improved considerably since faculty and students will be  able to utilize UPC software packages with current or archived  meteorological data in both classroom and research endeavors.  ***",
