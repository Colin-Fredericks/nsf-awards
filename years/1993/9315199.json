 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315199  Rao  This award of $180,000 is for curriculum development in smart  composite structures, which encompass several technologies that  enable flexible structures to sense and control their own  geometric, environmental and structural characteristics to achieve  high performance and self-diagnostic capabilities.  The work  necessitates the integration of (i) composite structure modeling  and fabrication, (ii) advances in sensor and actuator technology,  (iii) advanced control methodology, and (iv) artificial neural  networks.  The objectives of an interdisciplinary team of faculty  members are to: (i) introduce smart structure concepts to senior  undergraduate and graduate students, (ii) develop interdisciplinary  educational experience, (iii) enhance the design component of  curriculum and capstone design projects, and (iv) train future  scientists and engineers in areas of national importance and  technologies critical to defense missions.  The approach adopted is  to (i) develop a two-course sequence on smart structures, (ii)  integrate multidisciplinary laboratory experience with coursework,  (iii) develop senior undergraduate capstone design projects  soliciting feedback from an advisory committee in finalizing the  topics, and (iv) develop course materials and multi-media  instructional tools, and (v) disseminate curriculum development  results to the greater engineering community.",
