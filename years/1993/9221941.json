 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Pepperberg studies interspecies communication and animal                    cognition.  Using a specific modeling technique, she and her                    students have trained an African Grey parrot to produce vocal                   (English) labels in response to questions about abstract                        categories of color, shape, material, similarity and difference,                absence of information, relative size, and quantity.  On these                  tasks, the bird's performance is comparable to that of great apes               and marine mammals.  Ongoing research, which includes two                       additional parrots, will continue to (1) study acquisition of a                 human code by parrots and examine the effects of species identity               of the trainers; (2) examine the level of acquired                              competence--the extent to which this code can be used for                       comprehending questions, numerical concepts, object-object                      relations, equivalence relations, prepositions, displacement, use               of verbs, recognizing 2-dimensional forms, negation, and how                    labeling might affect object recall and form perception; and (3)                examine how social modeling may offer insights into other studies               of vocal learning.                                                                                                                                              The results of this work have wide-ranging implications for at                  least three areas.  (1) Studies of avian versus mammalian brain                 function:  Given that the avian brain, although considerably                    different from that of mammals, can process information in                      similar ways, might Dr. Pepperberg's procedures assist clinicians               who are devising programs for brain-damaged humans?  (2) Programs               for teaching language to dysfunctional children:  Dr.                           Pepperberg's training techniques are being used, with some                      success, for developmentally-delayed children; might the                        procedures also work for children with other types of deficits?                 (3) Targeting parrots for wildlife conservation initiatives:  If                parrots are as intelligent as chimpanzees and dolphins, shouldn't               we make the same attempts to save them and their habitat as we                  are making for these other species?",
