However, we                                             propose a novel Transferred                                                     Electron Device (TED) termed the                                                Modulated Impurity Concentration                                                Transferred Electron Device                                                     (MICTED) that is expected to                                                    generate milliwatts of power up to                                              300 GHz.  The MICTED differs from                                               conventional TEDs by incorporating                                              a modulated doping profile which                                                substantially increases the                                                     harmonic content in the current                                                 waveform.  The increased harmonic                                               content of the MICTED leads to                                                  second and third harmonic                                                       Transferred Electron Oscillators                                                (TEOs) which deliver more power                                                 than TEOs using conventional TEDs.                                              This study will assess the merits                                               of the MICTED as a solid state                                                  oscillator source between 100 and                                               300 GHz, and involve device theory                                              and design, device fabrication and                                              testing, and device simulation.                                                 The MICTED is expected to have a                                                significant impact on millimeter                                                wave research where low noise and                                               moderate power local oscillator                                                 sources are in great need.                                                                                                                                      Par one of the proposed research is                                             a fundamental feasibility study of                                              the MICTED.  This section propose                                               Monte Carlo and Drift/Diffusion                                                 device simulations that include                                                 harmonic balance calculations.                                                  Also, a 94 GHz prototype GaAs                                                   MICTED will be designed,                                                        fabricated, and tested.  In Part                                                two, we will theoretically and                                                  experimentally investigate                                                      optimized InP MICTEDs for operation                                             up to 300 GHz.",
