 "awd_abstract_narration": "Li  9225145       This project concentrates on three areas of research in  mathematical analysis.  The general theme is that of determining  existence, regularity, local and global behavior and symmetry  properties of solutions of nonlinear equations and systems. In  particular, work on semilinear elliptic partial differential  equations will continue, examining the Lane-Emden equation and  Matukuma equation of astrophysics.  This includes a complete  classification of positive solutions, and to determine whether  all solutions are radial with limiting values of zero or  infinity. A second line of investigation considers anisotropic  curve shortening.  This has a more geometric flavor in which  embedded plane curves evolve according to a rate proportional to  the normal vector. The present work focuses on a generalized  setting of curves on manifolds in a Minkowski geometry.  Efforts  will be made to determine when such flows can shrink to a point  when standing symmetry hypotheses are not present.  The ideas  represented by this work can be viewed as models for the  evolution of phase boundaries such as the boundaries of growing  crystals.   The third direction this works takes involves  measure-valued branching processes, including the model on the  evolution caused by point catalysts.  ***        The work has its roots in stochastic partial differential  equations arising in the study of spatially distributed birth and  death processes.  A particular goal is to analyze nonequilibrium  reactions in the presence of multiple catalysts.",
