 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research consists of four projects related to effective                    transmission of information between agents.  One study will                     investigate evolutionarily stable outcomes in cheap-talk games.                 Communication about private information cannot be ignored in an                 evolutionary framework.  It forces players to obtain efficient                  payoffs when no conflicts of interest exist.  The goal is to study              whether evolutionary forces favor the informed party, whether                   messages are used efficiently when talk is cheap but not free, and              whether nontrivial communication must occur when players' interests             partially coincide.  The project will also characterize how much                must be communicated when agents have different interests.                                                                                                      A related study will investigate games of communication that change             over time in order to discover whether words will take on meanings              that apply in more than one context and whether agents will use                 words honestly in complicated settings even if it is against their              short-term strategic interests.  The third project will provide a               general framework for studying deviation-based equilibrium                      refinements and dynamic behavior in games.  This topic has strong               connections with communication, although it is not directly related             to communication.  This study will better our understanding of                  results in situations where evolutionarily stable sets of                       strategies fail to exist.                                                                                                                                       The fourth project will study a specific model of communication in              order to describe conditions under which it is optimal to delegate              decision-making authority to an informed expert (the doctor in a                doctor-patient relationship).  In the model the patient may be                  unable to acquire perfect information either because he is                      boundedly rational or because it is not in the best interests of                the doctor to communicate completely.  It may be inappropriate for              the patient to give complete decision-making authority to the                   doctor either because the doctor's preference is different from the             patient's or because the doctor does not know the patient's                     preference.  Preliminary study suggests that full communication may             be impossible whenever the doctor and the patient have different                preferences.",
