 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decomposition is a vital ecosystem process that results in the             recycling of nutrients needed for plant growth.  Most existing                  decomposition models predict rates indirectly form measures of                  regional climate and litter chemical composition.  Mechanistic                  models of litter decay, based  on the actual level of microbial                 activity, are still lacking.  This reduces our ability to predict               the effects of ecosystem disturbances such as those anticipated                 form global climate change.  We will address this problem by                    evaluating a decomposition model based directly on microbial                    production of enzymes involved in litter breakdown.  Our model is               based o the testable hypothesis that microbial populations grow by              optimizing the relative production of extracellular enzymes that                obtain essential carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) from their                         environment.  We propose that microbes will change the amount of                (C-acquiring enzymes produced depending on the availability of N                compounds in the environment.  If inorganic N compounds are easily              obtained, microbes should allocate more of their resources to                   producing C-acquiring enzymes.  This should result in grater                    microbial growth and faster decomposition of litter.  If inorganic              N is in low supply, microbes should produce more organic N-                     acquiring enzymes and allocate less resources towards acquiring C               compounds.  This should result in both reduced microbial growth and             decomposition rats for litter.                                                       To evaluate this model, we will place mesh bags containing                 three of types of leaf litter on forest soil plots.  Some of these              plots will receive N fertilizer at two levels of application.                   Others will not receive N fertilizer.  This will provide a range                of variation in inorganic N availability over which to test the                 model.  During decomposition, litter samples will be collected and              analyzed for microbial biomass and the activities of several                    enzymes involved obtaining C and N form organic compounds.  These               enzyme activities will serve as measures of microbial resource                  allocation to nutrient acquisition.  The significance of our model              is that it mechanistically links N availability to decomposition                rates.  If validated, it may facilitate assessments of nutrient                 limitation in field studies as well as contribute new information               for nutrient cycle modeling.  Such information should also improve              our ability to predict forest ecosystem responses to inputs of                  atmospheric N pollution at levels now found in forests near                     agricultural and urban areas.",
