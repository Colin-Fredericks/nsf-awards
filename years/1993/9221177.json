 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three research areas will be pursued: (1) New photochemical                     reactions that proceed by way of alkyl propargyl,                               alpha-acyl-substituted alkyl propargyl, or acyl propargyl                       biradicals will be explored. This study will include a                          consideration of the multiplicity of the biradical intermediates                and the consequences to the course of reaction. (2) Independent                 preparation of carbonyl-substituted biradicals that are                         intermediates in intramolecular \u01312+2!- photocyclization will be                 carried out. (3) The role of triplet energy and specific structure              on the selectivity of hydrogen abstraction by heteroaromatic                    nitrogen triplets will be investigated. Intramolecular abstraction              of primary, secondary, and tertiary nitrogen in pyridines,                      pyrimidines, and pyrazines will be studied.                                     %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor William C. Agosta at Rockefeller                   University. Molecules that contain a light absorbing group, and in              addition, a carbon-carbon double and triplet bond will be                       irradiated. The intermediates in these reactions will be                        investigated by observing the final products of the reactions.                  These intermediates will be generated by other methods to provide               more insight into the electronic state and nature of the                        intermediates. The role of energetics of excited states and                     structure of certain nitrogen containing molecules in the                       intramolecular transfer of a hydrogen will be studied as well.",
