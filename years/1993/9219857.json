 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to obtain a picture of a protein and               its solvent at atomic resolution and to test how well the average               position and mobility of atoms in the structure are modeled by                  molecular dynamics calculations.  This can be accomplished                      experimentally by determining the protein's vibration and                       equilibrium structure using diffraction methods and theoretically               by using empirical force fields.                                                Crambin is a hydrophobic, plant protein (MW = 4720) that is unique              because it diffracts beyond 0.83 A and has 99% of its diffraction               data observed at this resolution limit.  This means its structure               can be determined free of the usual restraints of protein                       refinement.  Although crambin's function is not yet known, it has               activity as a local anesthetic.                                                 The above goal will be addressed using crambin by the following                 specific means: unrestrained refinement of the crambin model                    against the 0.83 A, 130 K and the 0.945 A, 300 K X-ray data;                    corefinement of neutron and X-ray data at 300 K; refinement of                  crambin X-ray data at multiple temperatures; full-crystal molecular             dynamics simulations and comparison with the X-ray structure; and               analysis of the methods to predict protein water structure.                     %%%                                                                             This project provides a unique opportunity to obtain an                         experimental picture of a protein molecule, its surrounding                     solvent, and its dynamic movement in extremely sharp detail using               single crystal X-ray diffraction.  The fine features that are                   revealed can be tested against theories that are currently being                used to predict and refine the architecture of proteins.  The fact              that crystals of crambin are extremely well ordered make possible               the determination and testing of these details.",
