 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate modeling research has shown that the polar regions of              the global climate system are the most sensitive to climatic                    perturbations.  Therefore, it is felt that global climate change                will first be evident in those regions of the Earth.  In this                   research program the results of an experiment with a modified                   version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (GENESIS/CCM1) that                 includes sea ice, leads and sea ice transport, will be used to                  determine the sensitivity of the climate to sea ice variations, and             to identify variables that, through monitoring, could provide an                early warning of global climate change.                                                                                                                              In this project an analysis of the results of experiments with             the GENESIS/CCM1 will be used 1) to determine if the mechanisms of              climate change identified in the previous model studies the CCSI                model Study occur in the more complex modeled system, 2) to                     determine the impact of sea ice on the energy and moisture fluxes               at the ocean-atmosphere interface and their effect on climate both              globally and regionally, and 3) to examine the possibility that the             monitoring of variables associated with sea ice, including lead                 fraction, snowfall, temperatures, and energy and moisture fluxes,               could help provide a prediction of future global climate change.",
