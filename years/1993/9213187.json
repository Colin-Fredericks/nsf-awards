 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until recently, the role dead and dying trees play in the                  global carbon cycle has been ignored.  Preliminary estimates                    indicate tree mortality amounts to a substantial global flow of                 4-17 X 1015 grams of carbon per year and that global stores of                  dead wood could be in the range of 85 to 295 X 1015 grams of                    carbon.  This indicates that a major detrital flow and pool has                 been ignored, with potentially large consequences for balancing                 past, current and future global carbon budgets.  Moreover, this                 information is required to develop strategies to conserve and                   sequester carbon in the future.  The proposed project will study                woody detritus production, decomposition, nutrient                              mineralization, and stores in Russian taiga forests.  This work                 takes advantage of a 60 year-old permanent plot system which                    presents a unique opportunity to rapidly increase understanding                 of woody detrital dynamics in this part of the globe.  Long-term                tree mortality records will allow us to examine how woody                       detritus production varies with species of tree, stocking                       density, and succession.  Moreover, these records provide a                     series of trees with varying time since death that can be used to               estimate decomposition and nutrient mineralization rates.                       %%%                                                                             By knowing woody detrital input, decomposition, and current                     stores, we will estimate whether coarse woody debris is                         increasing, decreasing or stable during succession.  Coupled with               other existing plot data (such as living biomass) this data will                allow us to estimate dead wood stores and inputs from existing                  large-scale forest survey data.  Aside from providing a much                    needed database for a forest type of global significance, the                   proposed project will help develop the local expertise needed to                carry out more extensive regional studies.",
