 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bruchid beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus,                                   is an important pest of cowpeas in both field                                   and storage situations.  The species is                                         extraordinarily variable in nearly every aspect                                 of its behavior and life history.  In this                                      collaborative research project, entomologists                                   in the U.S. and  Nigeria will characterize                                      genetic variation in life history features                                      among Nigerian samples of this beetle.  The aim                                 is to apply a measurement protocol developed by                                 the U.S. researcher, Dr. Rodger Mitchell, of                                    the Ohio State University, to African                                           populations with which the Nigerian researcher,                                 Dr. T. I. Ofuya, of the Federal University of                                   Technology, in Akure, is familiar.  The joint                                   research will address such basic questions                                      about the life history strategies of                                            feral populations of this species as:  Are the                                  populations similar over broad areas or do                                      local adaptations evolve as easily as the                                       traits change in laboratory experiments?   This                                 first full scale description of the feral                                       biotypes of the species will provide                                            information on the capacity of local                                            populations to evolve new traits and adapt to                                   new hosts.  That information will be useful in                                  identifying the way resistant varieties affect                                  the life table of the beetle and in considering                                 the rationality of biological controls.                                                                                                                         This research promises important contributions                                  to the basic ecological science community in                                    identifying patterns of variability and                                         improving understanding of the basic                                            information needed to consider how bionomic                                     variability evolved.  The combination of                                        scientific interest and potential application                                   to an important concern of developing                                           countries, satisfies the criteria of mutual                                     benefit in research partnership, and                                            enhancement of science and engineering                                          infrastructure of the Science in Developing                                     Countries program.",
