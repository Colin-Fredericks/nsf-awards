 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307019  Fleishman    Animals communicate with an amazing variety of signals.  Even closely related  species often have signals that differ greatly in appearance.  Understanding how  this diversity has evolved has been a major aim of evolutionary biologists since the  time of Darwin.  Dr. Fleishman will test an important new theory, known as  \"sensory drive,\" which suggests that the great variety in the design of visual  signals of different species evolved because the different habitats occupied by each  species influenced the visual system in a different way.  For example, differences  in the typical light intensity or background vegetation coloration in a habitat will  influence what color and/or motion pattern is easiest to see.    Dr. Fleishman will test this theory by studying the evolution of signal diversity in  four species of small lizards from Puerto Rico.  These lizards, known as anoles, are  closely related, but each species occupies a distinctly different type of habitat.   Male anoles attract mates and defend territories using visual displays which  consist of elaborate motion patterns of the dewlap, a colorful, expandable flap of  skin under the throat.  Each species has its own dewlap color and its own pattern  of motion.  In lizards, detection of moving objects by the visual system depends  upon a brain structure called the optic tectum.  By making neurophysiological  recordings from the optic tectum of each species, Dr. Fleishman will determine  what combination of stimulus color and movement most effectively stimulates the  tectum.  He will then make careful measurements, in the field, of the light and  color conditions typical of the habitat of each species.  He will return to the lab  and test the effect of these different light and background conditions on the ability  of the optic tectum to respond to moving objects of different colors and motion  patterns.  He will test the \"sensory drive\" hypothesis by comparing the color and  motion patterns in the actual displays to t he ideal color and motion patterns  predicted from the laboratory studies.",
