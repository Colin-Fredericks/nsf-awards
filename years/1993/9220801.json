 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Hungary Joint Fund research project on \"Phenomenology                 and Microscopics of High Temperature Superconductors\" will be                   conducted by Dr. Alfred Zawadowski of E\u001atv\u001as Lorand University                  in cooperation with Dr. Gergely T. Zimanyi of the University of                 California Davis.  The researchers consider the Marginal Fermi                  Liquid (MFL) theory one of the most successful phenomenologies                  for high Tc superconductors.  Their early studies explored the                  importance of higher order perturbative corrections, producing                  improved agreement with the experiments.  They now introduce the                notion of the Anti-Ferromagnetic MFL (AF-MFL) theory, the basic                 assumption of which is that the spin correlations are dominantly                anti-ferromagnetic.  They will analyze the high order corrections               with the help of renormalization group methods, and explore many                experimental consequences.  On the issue of spin-charge                         separation, they will address the importance of non-scaling                     contributions, and the question of a minimal model.  The                        researchers also intend to develop a novel microscopic approach to              higher dimensional Luttinger Liquids, based on a well-controlled                expansion technique in a model of a two-dimensional wire-mesh.                  Their initial scaling studies revealed that spin and superconducting            fluctuations are the dominant excitations of the model at low                   temperatures.  They will establish their momentum dependence to                 distinguish between magnetic ordering tendencies and spin-liquid                formation.  Results should determine experimentally accessible                  response functions and add to our understanding of the special role             of two dimensions in problems of high temperature                               superconductivity.                                                                                                                                              This research in materials theory fulfills the US-Hungary Joint                 Fund's objective of advancing science by enabling leading experts               in the United States and Hungary to combine complementary talents               and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              competence.",
