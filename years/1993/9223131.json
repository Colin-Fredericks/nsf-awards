 "awd_abstract_narration": "The under representation of females among faculty in the fields of              science  and engineering has been a concern and a topic of                      research of many committees, institutions, and scholars.  There                 seem to be a multitude of causes behind this under representation               of females in scientific academic jobs.  Starting from high                     school, women seem to drop out of the science/engineering pipeline              at practically every step along the way.  This project focuses on               the last stage in this process - the low proportion of women at the             associate or full professor ranks.   It is the first study to be                based on a continuing panel of PhD's and to use the panel nature                of this data to follow people's careers as they develop over                    time.   This approach is superior to the cross sectional analysis               in other studies because it controls for the size of the entrant                cohort, allows covariants to have independent effects on the                    probabilities, and accounts for people who leave academia.  The                 panel data allow analysis of the entire time pattern of the                     likelihood of promotion and comparison of the probabilities of                  eventually receiving tenure.                                                                                                                                    This project focuses on gender differences in promotion in academic             jobs in the fields of economics, the other social sciences, science             and engineering.  It uses panel data collected by the National                  Science Foundation in its biannual survey of Doctorate Recipients.              The project investigates whether women and men who enter academia               with similar backgrounds have the same likelihood of progressing                in academic careers and progress at similar speeds in their                     careers.                                                                        Using hazard rate analysis, the project estimates gender                        differences in the probabilities of receiving tenure.   A similar               approach is used to study the promotion to full professorship.  The             first stages of the research will consider the field of economics.              Specifications and models developed for the field of economics will             then be extended to other fields with the social sciences and to                science and engineering.  The final stage of the analysis will                  perform similar on all fields together in order to be able to draw              conclusions about the overall promotion process in academia and on              how differences among fields in the promotion process can be                    explained by different characteristics of the fields themselves.",
