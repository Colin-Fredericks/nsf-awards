 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site is established             at the Fluid Dynamics Research Center (FDRC) of the Illinois                    Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago.  The program will be                  aimed at qualified undergraduate students enrolled at IIT as well               as at other universities and colleges in the state of Illinois.                 It will be designed to provide the students selected with hands-                on experience in fluid mechanics research in an environment where               they will be exposed to new and exciting research problems and to               techniques that are at the 'cutting edge' of this field.  The FDRC              provides a strong disciplinary focus in Fluid Mechanics and                     Aerodynamics.  Research is supervised by six experienced faculty                members.  An REU participant would be a member of a research team,              interacting with the faculty as well as with other students.  They              will be given specific assignments tailored to obtain the right mix             of knowledge, the acquisition of new skills, and a sense of                     accomplishment and belonging.  The program includes site visits to              other R&D institutions and a round-table discussion with engineers              from these institutions who are involved in R&D.  It will provide               a rich learning experience and a good perspective on research                   opportunities in engineering.",
