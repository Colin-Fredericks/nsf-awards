 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how desert plants avoid exceeding the limits              of their water transport system. Water is lost by evaporation when              plants capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during                        photosynthesis. To support continued growth, such losses must be                replenished by water pulled from the soil via the roots to the                  leaves in a manner not unlike drinking from a straw. If the suction             driving water movement becomes to great, as can happen when the                 evaporation rate from leaves is too high or the soil is too dry,                the plant's water transport system can become non-functional. This              condition, known as cavitation, results from the entry of air into              the vascular system producing an air embolism and interrupting the              movement of water. The limits of the water  transport system, and               hence the plants maximum drought tolerance, are determined by the               structure of its component conduits. The proposed research will                 determine the limits on water transport in plants from habitats                 with different patterns of water availability. The ability of each              species to maintain water transport by remaining within the limits              of its vascular system or controlling the loss of vascular function             under harsh conditions will be evaluated. The results will advance              our understanding of whole plant responses to water stress.",
