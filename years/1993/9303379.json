 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with a wide spectrum of problems                 in noncommutative ring theory.  The principal investigator will                 work on (i) a construction of all division algebras generated by                homomorphic images; (ii) a proof that for every two varieties U                 and V in the sense of universal algebra, the category of                        representable functors of U into V has an initial object; (iii) a               characterization of all co-sheaves of sets on a topological                     space; (iv) a common generalization of such results as \"every                   group structure on a Stone space is an inverse limit of finite                  groups\" and \"every associative algebra structure on a linearly                  compact topological vector space is an inverse limit of                         finite-dimension algebras\"; (v) results on a curious construction               for division algebras, which consists of choosing a nonprincipal                maximal filter F of subspaces of an infinite-dimensional vector                 space V, and forming the factor-ring of the ring of endomorphisms               of V that repect F by the ideal of those endomorphisms whose                    kernel belongs to F.                                                                 This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring               is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                            multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                  satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                  not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                          multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                      matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                  has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing               significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.",
