 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a new and detailed approach to the investigation               of chemical scavenging processes in the Atlantic and Pacific                    Oceans, using the distributions of the rare earth elements (REE) as             indicators of particulate removal and redox cycling under varying               conditions of primary particle flux and water column structure.  In             situ pumping, will be used to collect large suspended particulate               samples as part of an ongoing study of dissolved/particulate                    fractionation for a suite of major and minor elements.  Established             trace metal seawater sampling techniques will be used to collect                REE water samples.  The dependence of dissolved and particulate REE             patterns and cerium anomalies on the mass concentration,                        composition, and vertical flux of the suspended particle field will             be explored.  This will be accomplished by profile measurements at              four oceanographically distinct sites: 1) the productive Northeast              Pacific margin environment, 2) the oligotrophic Northeast Atlantic,             3) the Gulf Stream/NW Sargasso Sea frontal system, and 4) the                   variably productive Central Equatorial Pacific.  The REE will be                used as probes of scavenging processes over spatial and temporal                gradients in primary and new production.  Results will have broad               implications for the critical variables which regulate biological               uptake, adsorptive scavenging, and redox-controlled removal of                  trace inorganics in open ocean and ocean margin environments.",
