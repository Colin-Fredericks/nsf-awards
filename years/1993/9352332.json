 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital image processing is a rapidly evolving field with                       growing applications in science and engineering, such as high-                  definition television (HDTV).  Many of the theories and                         concepts pertinent to image processing are within the scope of                  understanding by  undergraduate students who learn them in                      prior courses. The introduction of image processing to the                      undergraduate curriculum facilitates the understanding of many                  important, yet abstract, techniques students acquire in signal                  processing, communication theory, and random variables courses.                 Moreover, this provides them with an excellent preparation for                  advanced study in  related fields. Experiments based on image                   processing are an integral part of the course and the                           establishment of an image processing laboratory  enables                        students to carry out experiments that supplement lecture                       materials. These experiments cover a wide range of practical                    applications that extend from the acquisition of an image to                    the edge detection of a noisy image. The conduct of these                       experiments necessitates a high-speed computer equipped with a                  frame grabber, a video camera and a high-resolution monitor.                    For educational purposes, an image-processing laboratory manual                 and an integrated software package capable of implementing all                  proposed experiments are planned.",
