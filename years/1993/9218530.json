 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI will investigate the time span required for death                       assemblage formation and the extent to which the temporal                       events in its formation, and hence the temporal history of                      the community, are discretely preserved.  To do so requires                     an inexpensive method for dating time-since-death of shells.                    The method under development is based on the observation                        that the proteinaceous matrix in the shells of bivalves                         gradually decomposes, freeing protein-bound amino acids                         which then accumulate, and the observation that these free                      amino acids gradually diffuse out of the shell.                                 Accordingly, the degree of proteinaceous matrix remaining                       and the amount of free amino acid present (determined by the                    balance of production and diffusional loss) are both time                       dependent properties of the shell.  For the technique to be                     useful, it is essential that it be usable on shelf                              assemblages.  The shelf is typified by a preponderance of                       small species and a significant cross-shelf thermal                             gradient, each of which would tax the capabilities of the                       technique.  Accordingly, the purpose of this proposal is to                     demonstrate the ability of the amino acid dating method to                      answer the following important questions about death                            assemblage formation:  (1) What time span is required for                       death assemblage formation in clastic depositional regimes?                     (2) Which temporal events in the community are discretely                       preserved during death assemblage formation (not how                            stratigraphically compressed they are, but are they                             discreetly preserved in stratigraphic sequence)?  (3) Can                       the rates of taphonomic alteration be determined or at least                    can the extent to which taphonomic alteration is correlation                    with shell age (time-since-death) be measured?",
