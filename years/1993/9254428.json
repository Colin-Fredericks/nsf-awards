 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 3-year leadership project will enable 2-cohorts of                         Houston area 8th and 9th grade physical science teachers to                     attend a Leadership Institute at the University of Houston-                     University Park.  Each cohort will have 24 teachers.  The                       Leadership Institutes have a two week summer institute and                      six Saturday workshops during the academic year.  Each                          cohort will attend for two years, overlapping in year -2 of                     the project.  Physics and Chemistry content will be                             delivered with discipline appropriate pedagogy.  To broaden                     a teacher's network, some AY follow-up will occur at a                          professional meeting of the Texas Science Teachers'                             Association.  Leader Teachers will give peer-led workshops                      in their local and neighboring districts.  They will be                         supported by LEAs, industry and the senior personnel from                       the project.  The Principal Investigator for the project is                     Dr. Hugh T. Hudson.                                                                                                                                             Cost sharing equals 10% of the NSF award.",
