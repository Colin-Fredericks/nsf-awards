 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310058  Broselow      Research on the sound structure of human language has generally  proceeded from two directions.  Phoneticians have traditionally  focused on creating abstract models of the mental representation of  sound structure, with the ultimate goal of discovering universal  constraints underlying the surface diversity of human language.   With the increasing availability of sophisticated technology for  speech analysis, these two strands of research have begun to  converge, with the beneficial result that abstract phonological  models can be tested against precise descriptions of sound  properties.  This project will investigate one candidate for a  universal constraint on linguistic structure from both a  phonological and a phonetic perspective; the goal is to compare the  abstract representations motivated by phonological analysis against  the phonetic properties revealed by instrumental analysis.    The particular structures to be investigated are syllables of  different types.  It has long been recognized that syllables are  one of the basic structural units of human language, and that  syllable weight (the length of a syllable's vowel and the number of  consonants following that vowel) plays a fundamental role in many  grammatical processes, such as the positioning of stress and  accent.  One currently controversial issue concerns the number of  distinctions in syllable weight to which languages make reference:  while most languages seem to distinguish only two degrees of  syllable weight, a few languages have been argued to require  additional distinctions.  The question of whether syllable weight  distinctions are maximally binary reflects a more fundamental  issue:  since it has been proposed that no linguistic process  requires reference to more than a binary distinction, limiting  syllable weight distinctions to binary would be consistent with a  significant constraint on possible variations across human  languages.  One approach to maintaining the claim that syllable  wei ght distinctions are maximally binary involves the postulation  of particular phonological representations for syllables that  reduce all syllables to one of two categories:  light vs. heavy.   The project involves both detailed analysis of the phonological  evidence for these abstract representations of syllable weight, and  testing of the predictions made by these representations against  the instrumental data available from phonetic analysis.  ***",
