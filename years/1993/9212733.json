 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Shearography\", a laser interferometry technique, enables direct                observation and measurement of strain concentrations and variation              of the displacement field.  Shearography performed with the aid of              electronic image acquisition and processing can eliminate the                   practical problems that have precluded the use of other laser                   interferometry techniques for nondestructive inspection under field             conditions.  Electronic Shearography (ES) is being tested as an                 inspection technique for detecting cracking and other sources of                stress concentration in structures.  The technique offers full-                 field inspection capability, can be performed in real time, and is              easily suited to automated computer aided data analysis.                                                                                                        The ES images, however, lack clarity due to their speckled nature,              and the technique currently lacks remote detection capability.                  This  drawback has seriously limited the scope of this technique.               Using higher resolution for image acquisition and processing will               alleviate this problem.  A newly developed geometric filtering                  technique will be applied to reduce speckle noise.  Additional                  telescopic lenses will be used to facilitate remote measurements.               The combination of the hardware and software tools will result in               excellent image quality that will make this ES technique acceptable             for field inspection of civil engineering structures.  The ES                   technique will then be evaluated during field inspection of                     bridges, in conjunction with other state of the art inspection                  techniques.",
