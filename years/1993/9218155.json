 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                   between Professor Therese Cotton of Iowa State University and                   Professor Katsume Niki of Yokohama National University.  The                    objective of the research is to develop methods for enhancing the               heterogeneous electron transfer process at the electrode surface.               An understanding of those factors that are important for reversible             electron transfer could result in the preparation of bioelectronic              devices based upon the photosynthetic components.  Professor Cotton             will continue development of monolayer methods and use resonance                Raman spectroscopy (RR) and surface-enhanced resonance Raman                    scattering (SERRS) to characterize the monolayers.  Professor Niki              will develop electrode surface modifications for improving electron             transfer kinetics.  The adsorbed monolayers will then be                        characterized by electroreflectance spectroscopy.  Also involved in             the project is Professor Robert Uphaus of Iowa State University.                                                                                                The U.S. and Japanese groups have complementary expertise in the                characterization of proteins and other electroactive species on                 electrode surfaces.  The use of RR and SERRS in the U.S. component              of the research will provide vibrational spectra of the various                 redox active species.  The Japanese group will determine                        electroreflectance spectra on the same systems.  Measurement of                 optical changes in the pigments as a function of potential will be              extremely valuable in those cases where the vibrational spectra                 overlap strongly.  Moreover, the use of optical measurements may                enable the accurate determination of the midpoint potential of BChl             and BPheo in the reaction centers.  This information is very                    important with respect to the mechanism of photoinduced electron                transfer.",
