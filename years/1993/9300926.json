 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Grants for Improving Doctoral                   Dissertation Research program.  It is a study of institutional                  change and cultural production in the New York art world of the                 1980s.  It will be carried out through interviews and examination               of existing documents at examples of three categories of                        establishments.  Results will be analyzed in terms of theories of               the modernizing thrust in the evolution of cultural institutions.                                                                                                    This research will contribute to the rapidly-growing field of              cultural sociology, providing data on a world center of culture-                production during a time of rapid social and economic change.  In               addition to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,                this award will materially assist a highly promising student in                 completing research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it                        contributes to the future scientific manpower of the nation and the             thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.",
