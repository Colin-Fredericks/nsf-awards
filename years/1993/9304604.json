 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to better understand complex hydrologic processes                 and to test hypotheses regarding hydrologic responses to changing               physical or climatic regimes, many hydrologists have organized                  their research around development and testing of physically                     based, distributed-parameter models.  These models are founded on               a number of assumptions, one of the most important of which is                  that spatially distributed data on crucial variables and                        parameters is available.  In high alpine systems, the storage of                water in snowpacks and the release of that water through                        snowmelts is a major component of hydrological systems.  Alpine                 snowpacks are spatially heterogeneous, however, with their                      distribution and rates of accumulation and melting a function of                the influences of rugged topography on precipitation, the                       redistribution of snow by winds, and surface radiative energy                   fluxes.  This doctoral dissertation project will develop and test               a dynamic snowpack initialization model, which will provide                     improved data on the spatial and temporal patterns of snowpacks                 and meltwaters for use in hydrologic models of alpine regions.                  The model will be tested using data for three watersheds in the                 Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.  Data scanned                   from aerial photographs will be used in conjunction with data                   acquired within snowpacks and in downstream portions of                         watersheds to provide more reliable hydrological information                    about the water content of snow and the spatial and temporal                    patterns of melting.  Analyses of these data will permit                        refinement of models related to meltwater inputs from snowpacks                 into hydrologic models for the watersheds.                                           This project will provide valuable new information from a                  number of different perspectives.  Through exploration of the                   potential for using new photogrammetric techniques to infer                     snowpack characteristics from aerial photographs and development                of a dynamic snowpack initialization model, the project will                    advance research methodologies.  The project also will make                     substantive contributions as it enhances understandings of the                  complex factors that affect the geographic and temporal                         distributions of snow and meltwaters in alpine areas.  As a                     doctoral dissertation improvement award, this award also will                   provide support to enable a promising student to establish a                    strong independent research career.",
