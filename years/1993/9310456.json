 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a planning grant to provide support to Arizona State               University to study the feasibility of developing a new concept                 for bringing colleges and universities together with industry to                significantly improve on their current separate lifelong learning               efforts.  This will be done through a two-pronged approach.  The                first involves the co-location, perhaps at ASU Research Park, of                several industrial universities, Mesa Community College (MCC) and               ASU engineering/business professional development, and training                 activities in a campus-like environment.  This co-location                      concept has been strongly endorsed by Motorola University and                   Intel University, and a steering committee has been formed to                   formulate a detailed plan in physical planning, programming,                    organizational structure and cost for further actions by the                    joint venture partners.   The second part of this two-pronged                   approach involves the establishment of a Cooperative Training and               Education Center for Life-Long Learning using the NSF/IUCRC                     model.  The purpose of this Center is to establish an educational               research and development arm to the jointly operated                            infrastructure.  Some specific examples of what the Center will                 be involved in are: developing short-courses and training                       sessions to meet the industry demand; producing new course                      material including software; and experimenting with new teaching                paradigms and methodologies specific to life-long learning.                     Faculty of the Center will consist of faculty members of the                    industrial universities, a selected group of faculty at MCC and                 ASU and outside contracted experts.                                                  The Program Director recommends Arizona State University be                awarded $25,000 ($12,500 co-funded by Engineering Education) for                six months for this planning grant.",
