This referendum involves a series of                         constitutional arrangements intended to maintain the country's                  geographic and political integrity.  Of particular importance is                the status of Quebec.                                                                                                                                           The investigators have gained space on a telephone survey to be                 conducted of a national sample of two thousand Canadian                         respondents.  The survey involves a study of institutionalism and               political democracy in Canada with particular focus on the                      sociopolitical, economic and cultural values of the Canadian                    electorate.  The telephone survey will be undertaken with a split-              half sample immediately before and immediately after the October                26th referendum.  The data obtained from this investigation will be             archived for use by other social scientists interested in political             behavior and political participation.  The study will provide a                 unique opportunity to gather data in a timely and cost-effective                fashion on this extremely important referendum issue.",
