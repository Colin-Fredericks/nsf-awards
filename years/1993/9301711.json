 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301711  Ruckenstein    Porous polymer particles are useful in applications such as  chromatography, ion exchange, reactive polymer matrixes, and  for controlled release of drugs.  The synthesis of these  macroreticular particles is, in general, based on the  suspension polymerization of a dispersed phase that consists  of monomer, crosslinking agent, initiator, and a suitable  inert liquid which does not polymerize and that functions as a  porogen.  The size of the particles obtained depends upon the  suspending medium as well as the dispersant it contains.  The  porosity of the particles is controlled by varying the volume  fraction of the porogen and adjusting the concentration of the  crosslinking agent.  This project has two goals: (1) to  develop new methods for the preparation of porous micron-size  particles and to learn to control their internal surface area  and their pore size distribution, and (2) to suggest some  applications in the area of the heterogenization of  homogeneous catalysts.    The development of a new method for the preparation of porous  polymer particles based on the concentrated emulsion  polymerization method is planned.  The concentrated emulsion  is obtained by dispersing a hydrophobic (hydrophilic) liquid  into a surfactant-containing hydrophilic (hydrophobic) liquid  with mechanical stirring.  The volume fraction of the  dispersed phase should be larger than 0.74, which represents  the volume fraction of the most compact arrangement of spheres  of equal radii, and can be as large as 0.99.  The concentrated  emulsions have the appearance and behavior of gels and  therefore can be handled easily.  The concentrated emulsion is  stabilized by the adsorption of the surfactant on the surface  of dispersed droplets.  This concentrated emulsion method  employs a small volume fraction of continuous phase thus a  small amount of the hydrophobic phase is employed to prepare  hydrophilic particles.    Three kinds of porous particles will be prepared: (1) porous  crosslinke d hydrophobic particles, (2) sparse  poly(vinylbenzylchloride) matrices encapsulated by porous  nutshells of crosslinked polystyrene, and (3) porous  crosslinked hydrophilic particles of polyacrylamide or other  hydrophilic polymers.  Some applications that will be studied  include using the second category of materials synthesized to  entrap cobalt carbonyl anions and materials synthesized under  the third category to immobilize enzymes that are compatible  with the hydrophilic pores.  ***",
