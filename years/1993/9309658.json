 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chamberlain         This research is on approaches to partitioning VLSI systems  for distributed simulation on multiprocessor architectures.  The  approach is to use knowledge of a VLSI system and the distributed  simulation algorithms to perform a partitioning and assignment of  system components to processors in a manner that minimizes the  execution time of the distributed simulation. Central to the  approach is an initial partitioning that is refined as  information is gathered about the simulation workload.  In this  way assignment of components to processors can take advantage of  measured data that is unknown (and therefore unavailable) prior  to the simulation run.  The approach has three phases:  1.     Algorithms for initial partitioning of the circuit  components are being developed;  2.     Means of assigning partitions to processors are being  developed; and  3.     Rules for migrating components from one processor to another  are being devised.",
