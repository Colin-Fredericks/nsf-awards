 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trichomycetes are commensalistic fungi that live obligately in            the guts of various insects, crustaceans, and millipedes.  The                  variety of host and habitats, the worldwide occurrence of all                   families, and the intercontinental distribution of some genera of               these fungi indicate that the relationship with arthropods is very              ancient.  Dr. Robert Lichtwardt of the University of Kansas seeks               to understand how and when trichomycetes evolved and became                     geographically distributed with their arthropod hosts.  Data from               Australia and New Zealand suggest that some fungal taxa may have                had common ancestors on Gondwana at least 70-80 million years ago.              Evidence to support the Gondwanan origin of austral trichomycetes               will be sought in southern South America.  Studies of other gut                 fungi in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater arthropods may provide             evidence of how long certain species have been radiating with their             hosts, and the roles of dispersal and vicariance in allopatric                  distributions.  Phylogenetic analysis of trichomycete genera will               assist in understanding their evolution and biogeography, and                   isozyme phenotypes of cultured isolates from different geographical             regions of the world will provide some information on species                   variability.  Harpellales, whose species grow only in larval stages             of aquatic insects, will be studied to see whether or not their                 propagules can disperse phoretically with adults.",
