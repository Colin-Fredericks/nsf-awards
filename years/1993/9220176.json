 "awd_abstract_narration": "One form of resistance that plants employ against viral                    disease is the development of necrosis at the site of initial                   infection.  This hypersensitive response (HR) limits the virus to               the infection site and prevents it from spreading throughout the                plant.  Although many of the metabolic changes associated with HR               are known, the nature and function of the genes that control the                response remain a mystery.  A novel strategy for the isolation of               host genes that control a HR against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) has             been conceived.  A full-length, infectious cDNA clone of TMV has                been modified to permit the introduction of foreign open reading                frames in place of the viral coat protein gene.  Foreign genes                  inserted into this viral vector are expressed in planta with                    protein levels ranging from approximately 0.1% to 1% of the total               extractable protein.  The isolation of HR-specific genes using the              TMV-based expression vector will involve the \"shotgun\" cloning of               pooled cDNAs derived from HR-positive host plants into the                      universal cloning sites of the vector.  In vitro transcription                  reactions will be performed, and the transcribed RNAs will be                   inoculated directly onto appropriate host plants that lack the HR-              controlling genes (\"systemic hosts\").  The inoculated leaves will               be monitored for the appearance of necrotic infection sites or                  other evidence of HR.  Individual viruses eliciting a HR will be                propagated and viral RNA will be extracted.  The segment of the                 viral RNA representing the cDNA inserted into the cloning site of               the TMV vector will be amplified by PCR techniques using primers                that flank the inserted gene.  The genes will be sequenced and will             be used as probes for the analysis of RNA expression in plant                   tissues before and during viral infection.  Antibody preparations               generated in rabbits immunized with proteins produced in E. coli                will also allow the analysis of protein expression patterns.                    %%%                                                                             The successful development of this technique would allow very                   important plant resistance genes to be cloned and characterized                 after many failures to do so by other productive research workers.",
