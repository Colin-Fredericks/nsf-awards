 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zhang will continue his research on various invariants of C*-              algebras, including the real rand, the topological stable rand, the             exponential rand and length, the C*-projective length of the                    Grassmann space, and the homotopy groups of the unitary group and               the Grassmann space of certain C*-algebras.  He will also continue              his investigation on the internal structure of the multiplier                   algebras in terms of the K-theory and its torsion subgroup of the               associated C*-algebra.                                                               The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                 being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
