 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop an analytical framework               for analyzing and better understanding the transition of the                    centrally planed Eastern Europe economies to a market oriented                  system.  The adjustment process has been going on now for three                 years, and there is a better understanding of the dynamics of                   change in Eastern Europe.  While many state firms have gone out                 of business altogether, others are struggling to remain in                      operation often clamoring for state subsidies to keep them                      afloat.  At this point it appears that most state firms have not                been able to begin the kind of restructuring required to make                   them efficient and productive enterprises.  The proximate cause                 of this has been lack of progress on meaningful privatization.                  As a result unemployment throughout the region has increased                    dramatically because  privatization has not proceeded quickly                   enough to  offset declines in public the sector industries.  This               project is important because it will develop a much needed                      analytical framework for assessing policy options for attaining                 needed reform.",
