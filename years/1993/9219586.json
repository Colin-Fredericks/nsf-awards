 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lignans and neolignans are an ever-increasingly important class                 of compounds ubiquitous throughout the plant kingdom, whose                     rather  remarkable plant defense, phytoalexin, cell-division                    promoting and pharmaceutical properties are only now beginning to               be fully recognized.  Although they are most often found                        enantiomerically pure, the mechanisms by which their achiral                    precursors undergo stereoselective coupling, and their subsequent               postcoupling enantiospecific transformations, have eluded                       definition for several decades.                                                 This proposal addresses the essential unknown biochemistry of                   major class of phenylpropanoid metabolites, the lack of knowledge               of which has placed an enormous constraint on our ability to                    study this area of metabolism at the gene level.  The prognosis                 is, however, excellent:  recent studies in this laboratory                      resulted in the discovery of a highly unusual, novel coupling                   enzyme which directly and sterioselective couples achiral                       precursors: it is not a typical H2O2-dependent peroxidase.  Thus,               one can systematically determine its mechanism of action and to                 define the scope of the transformations that can be engendered by               this enzyme.  In a similar vein, the enantiospecificity of post-                coupling transformations can be systematically examined.                        Consequently, this study will bring order to this apparently                    chaotic branch of phenylpropanoid metabolism in terms of                        elucidating biochemical pathways involved.  Following                           purification of the enzymes of interest to apparent homogeneity,                the application of immunocytochemical methodologies will permit                 us to determine the subcellular location and tissue specificity                 of lignan formation, and whether metabolite channeling into                     lignan and lignin pathways occurs.                                              %%%                                                                             Plants are well known for their ability to produce novel chemical               compounds  which can be utilized in both medical and industrial                 use by humans.  Often chemical synthesis of these compounds is                  impractical due the detailed chemistry of some of the compounds.                However, by first purifying the enzymes in the plant essential                  steps in the biochemical pathway are understood and often an                    essential step in the chemical synthesis can be overcome.                       Furthermore, this leads to isolation of the genes responsible for               the enzyme production and the capability to express the compound                in other plants.  The class of compounds called lignans are novel               biochemicals which can be use an novel biomaterials.  This                      research will study the enzymes and the reactions necessary for                 their synthesis.",
