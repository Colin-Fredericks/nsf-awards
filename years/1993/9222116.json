The                                     site characterization procedure may be used                                     to assess the extent and severity of                                            contamination before remediation begins and                                     to evaluate progress during remediation. The                                    procedure to be developed is based on                                           Bayesian estimation techniques that combine                                     field measurements with predictions from a                                      stochastic groundwater model that provides                                      estimates of the mean and variance of solute                                    concentration throughout a contaminated site                                    that are revised whenever new measurements of                                   hydraulic conductivity, pressure head and/or                                    contaminant concentration become available.                                                                                                                     This research is related to a project                                           previously supported under NSF Grant No.                                        85-14987.  It complements research the                                          investigator is conducting with support from                                    the National Institute of Environmental                                         Health Sciences on field studies to                                             characterize the role of sorption on removing                                   contaminants from groundwater.  Results of                                      this project are expected to be used to                                         improve the engineering design and operation                                    of systems to decontaminate groundwater                                         aquifers.",
