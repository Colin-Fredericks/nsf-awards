 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310374  Case       Parasites maybe responsible for the maintenance of  reproductive patterns, \"Red Queen\" hypothesis.  In some systems  asexuals have significantly more parasites than sexuals, but pilot  data for the current studies show just the opposite pattern.   However, it is impossible to use such data as a direct test of the  Red Queen hypothesis since a variety of mechanisms, such as  parasite transmission dynamics and virulence, can shape patterns of  parasite distribution in the wild.  The Red Queen hypothesis generates predictions about which  mechanisms must be important in host/parasite interactions in order  for asexuals to be favored:  i) host susceptibility must be the  most important determinant of parasite distribution in a  population; ii) host susceptibility must be genetically determined;  and iii) host susceptibility must be frequency-dependent, with the  most common genotype becoming the most susceptible over time.  The  current study will experimentally test these predictions in the  sexual/asexual gecko system.  %%%  Understanding the maintenance & development of major demographic  properties, such as mode of reproduction among species, is a major  goal of population biology.  However, theory predicting that  parthenogenetic forms are rare because they are more susceptible to  parasites has largely remained untested in complex ecological  situations.  The present research takes an ecological perspective  to a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology.  ***",
