 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318497  Li       The rapid development of fiber-optic technology has made  high-speed network services possible.  However, the current gap  between the bandwidth of the standardized optical networks and the  theoretical limit of optical fiber bandwidth suggests that a great  deal of research remains before an effective optical network can be  deployed.  The objective of this research is to explore the  possible architectures, routing protocols, and system and device  implementations for the metropolitan-area or wide-area  wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) all-optical networks.  Such  a wide-area network will present certain challenges which are not  found in a local-area network.  The researchers will explore  wavelength-division-multiplexing as the fundamental shifting  technology for all-optical networks due to its potential impact for  significant capacity upgrades through parallel transmissions on an  optical fiber.  Work will done to enhance dramatically the  efficiency and throughput of such a WDM all-optical network by  introducing the novel concept of wavelength converting (or  wavelength shifting) and by developing unique wavelength routing  schemes which consider new models and requirements of all-optical  networks.  The throughput and utilization of WDM networks is  expected to be at least doubled under the expected traffic loads.   Moreover, incurred disruptions are expected to be reduced by 2  orders of magnitude.  This will advance the art of previously  conceived wavelength-continuous WDM networks.   A close  collaboration will be formed between experts in the networks,  systems, and device areas of photonics.  ***",
