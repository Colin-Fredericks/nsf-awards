Two cases are compared: (1)  women in large corporate firms, and (2) women in an elite feminist  practice.  This comparison will identify social factors in  professional work environments that can advance or impede the  interests of women as they advance in status in these firms.   Comparisons of women's experiences in male-dominated professionl  organizations and in an organization where women exercise power and  authority will yield knowledge about aspects of organizational  structures, cultures and ideologies that contribute to gender  stratification in the legal profession.      In-depth interviews will be employed to elicit narratives about  career experiences that reveal professional ideologies,  organizational values and the propensity of women to articulate  gender-related needs and interests.  The sample includes 50 women  drawn from large firms in a midwestern city and the entire  professional staff of a leading women's legal reform organization.   The study will contribute to a theoretical framework for the study  of the integration of women into the legal profession as well as of  gender dynamics within elite professional workplaces.  ***",
