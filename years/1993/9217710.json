 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few years, very high quality CdTe/Cd(1-x)Zn(x)Te                    quantum wells (QW) and superlattices (SL) with x=0.08-0.15 have                 been grown on Cd(0.96)Zn(0.04)Te substrates at the Centre d'Etudes              Nucleares (Grenoble, France), using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).               These structures have an unusual mixed band structure in which                  excitonic transitions are type I (spatially direct) for heavy holes             (hh) and type II (spatially indirect) for light holes (lh).  An                 exceptionally strong nonlinear effect has been observed in the                  absorption spectra of these materials at low temperature and the hh             exciton absorption is found to be significantly reduced by very                 weak optical pumping above the band gap.  This non-linearity is of              cosiderable interest for possible applications.  A comprehensive                study of the effect in QWs and SLs is proposed, using time-resolved             transmission spectroscopy on time scales from ps to ms.  Uniaxial               stress will be used to modify the relative energy position of the               hh- and lh-excitons, and combined optical-infrared pumping to alter             trap populations.  The research will have three main objectives:                (1) to establish the cause of the non-linearity and to set up a                 quantitative model of the process; (2) to find the conditions in                which the nonlinearity is maximized, establish the optimum material             and structure parameters for device applications, and (if feasible)             make a working bistable optical switch; and (3) assuming that hole              traps in the barrier layer are involved, to use the phenomenon as               a probe of the trap states, thus obtaining information about the                quality of the barrier material.                                                %%%                                                                             Modern communications systems use pulses of light travelling in                 glass fibers to transmit information.  When the optical pulses are              manipulated (for instance, in order to send them to a particular                destination) they have to be converted into electrical pulses,                  amplified and routed, and then converted back to optical form for               transmission to their destination.  All such methods depend on the              phenomenon of \"optical nonlinearity\":                                           This proposal concerns a newly discovered nonlinear medium:  a thin             (10-40 nm) layer of cadmium telluride (commonly called a \"quantum               well\") sandwiched between thicker layers of cadmium zinc telluride.             the absorption of this medium has been found, in preliminary                    experiments at low temperature, to be strongly affected by a light              intensity of a fraction of a watt per square centimeter, an                     intensity easily achievable with a conventional light bulb.  This               remarkable sensitivity was discovered in the course of a basic                  study of cadmium telluride quantum wells, in collaboration with a               research group in Grenoble, France.  The purpose of the proposed                research is to elucidate the mechanism of this remarkable                       sensitivity, to design a medium optimizing the non-linearity, and               to build an optical switch using this medium, which should require              very low power to operate.",
