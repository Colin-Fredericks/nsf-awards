 "awd_abstract_narration": "BACKYARD SAFARI (Working Title) is an engaging series of 26                     half hour programs designed to introduce topics in Natural                      Science to children ages four to six.  The series will be                       shot on-location and hosted by an appealing young women of                      color, who will serve as a role model to female and minority                    children who are normally disenfranchised from participation                    in science.  A variety of settings and topics will be used                      that appeal to all preschoolers -- from urban/inner cities                      to surburbia to Appalachia.  A special feature of the series                    will be an animated gnome - like character called                               Crinkleroot.  Using the rotoscope technique similar to that                     in the \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\", Crinklroot will interact                     in screen with the host and special, acquired footage.                          Thus, Crinkleroot is able to do things the host can't do --                     for example, interacting with time-lapse photography as a                       flower blooms, or as a spider climbs its web.                                                                                                                   Outreach to parents and childcare providers will be an                          important part of BACKYARD SAFARI.  It is imperative to                         communicate that all children, regardless of race, sex, or                      disability are \"science material.\"  Activities will be                          developed that engage adults and children in hands-on,                          physical science activities using materials commonly found                      in any home or school.",
