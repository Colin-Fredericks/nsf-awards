 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in endocrinology between J. Michael Conlon of Creighton                         University and Hubert Vaudry of the Laboratory of Molecular                     Endocrinology, University of Rouen.  The objectives of their                    research are to continue investigations on the isolation and                    characterization of novel regulatory peptides in frog brain and                 to identify the structure and function of other amphibian                       pancreatic polypeptides and tachykinin-related peptides.  The                   investigations involve tissue collection, purification and                      characterization, and synthesis of the peptides.  Subsequently,                 the researchers will conduct receptor binding studies with the                  ultimate goal of characterizing as many novel biologically active               peptides as possible.                                                                                                                                           The project takes advantage of complementary expertise in the                   U.S. and France.  The U.S. investigator provides the experience                 and facilities for isolating the pure frog peptides and for                     determining their complete primary structures.  This is                         complemented by the French investigator's ability to characterize               peptides functionally.  He has developed specialized bioassays                  utilizing frog tissues. The results of their joint efforts will                 be of interest to endocrinologist and will improve our                          understanding of the evolution of peptide hormones and their                    receptors.",
