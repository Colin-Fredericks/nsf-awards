 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses measurement of local convective surface                    rainfall and attendant surface and boundary layer atmospheric                   variables, on the creation of a prototype database for fundamental              studies on rainfall properties and dynamics, and on the                         determination of predictability properties of local surface                     convective rainfall.  The significance for hydrology is that the                study will: (1) enhance the hydrologic database of rainfall and                 other storm data with very-fine resolution data with beneficial                 consequences for studies on the statistical and dynamical                       properties of surface rainfall and its extremes, (2) assess the                 fundamental dynamical and microphysical mechanisms at work during               the occurrence of heavy surface rainfall with beneficial                        consequences for efforts devoted to dynamical parameterizations,                (3) provide predictability measures that would be very beneficial               for hydrologic studies of hazardous flood events.  A host of                    specially calibrated instruments for surface meteorological                     measurements, including very sensitive optical raingauges and a                 phased array wind profiler will be used for measurement of                      convective events in three locations in Iowa City, Iowa during four             spring and summer months of each of the two project years.  The                 quality-controlled data will be used to create a prototype database             that would be made available (together with documentation) to the               scientific community for fundamental studies.  The data will also               be used to aid in the formulation of mathematical models of heavy               rainfall that are physics-based and consistent with the observed                temporal features of the process and that could be used to assess               the predictability properties of local surface rainfall.//",
