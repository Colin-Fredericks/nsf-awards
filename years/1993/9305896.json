 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies have demonstrated that photosynthesis rates at any given                irradiance depend critically on the light history over time scales              of minutes to hours and days.  However, these studies have failed               to provide a predictive understanding of photosynthesis in variable             light.  New technology makes it possible to examine the roles of                photosynthetic, photoprotective and photoinhibitory processes in                controlling the instantaneous rate of photosynthesis.  This                     technology includes fast repetition rate (FRR) fluorescence for                 examining photoprotection, photoinhibition and photosynthesis, and              18O mass spectrometry for measuring the rate gross photosynthesis               and oxygen cycling in the light.                                                                                                                                In the laboratory, this study will calibrate FRR fluorescence-based             estimate of gross photosynthesis against measured rates of gross                photosynthesis obtained from 18O2 exchange and quantify the roles of            photoprotection and photoinhibition in controlling the rate of                  photosynthesis. In field research, in situ FRR fluorescence                     measurements will be used to establish a two-dimensional (i.e.                  depth and time) description of the photochemical and non-                       photochemical quenching coefficients, calculate the instantaneous               rate of photosynthesis and examine the roles of the photoprotection             and photoinhibition in controlling phytoplankton photosynthesis in              situ.",
