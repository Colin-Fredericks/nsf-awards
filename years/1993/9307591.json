 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307591 May The results of the proposed work will have benefits to basic and applied research.  The benefits to basic research are that these data will contribute to our understanding of the evolution of mating genes.  Basidiomycetes mushrooms have mating genes like Coprinus cinereus and constitute a major part of the world's flora.  In addition, similar evolutionary pressures are thought to affect plant mating genes.  The system I have chosen is an extreme example of molecules that must simultaneously conserve functions function and expand diversity.  Consequently, by understanding the evolution of this mating gene, I will obtain results bearing on a central problem in biology today; how do new gene functions evolve? %%% Potential benefits to applied research are apparent.  C.cinereus is representative of a large class of fungi, many of which are economically important.  To name a few, Ustilago maydis, a pathogen of corn and Phanerochaete chrysosporium, a fungus currently used for biopulping of wood products, are both Basidiomycetes fungi.  Their mating systems are much like that found in C. cinereus.  As humans need to manage and control these and other fungi, they need to know how the organisms move from one location to another and how fast they evolve.  Mating genes, because of their incredible variability provide very good genetic markers for migration.  Because of their inherent role in the evolution of such organisms, studying their ev olution will be important to understanding organismal evolution.",
