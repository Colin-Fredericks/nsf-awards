 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over and above fine-spatial acuity, a substantial number of                     visual capabilities exist on which persons can be expected to                   differ reliably.  One such capability which has received                        insufficient attention is temporal acuity, the capability to                    resolve stimuli which are presented over time.  Results of the                  Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish               the technical basis for a new human performance measurement                     product that has as its purpose the measurement of visual                       temporal acuity with a battery of tests.   The research                         objectives of the Phase II study focus on collecting data                       necessary to bring laboratory demonstrations of temporal                        phenomena in vision to a level useful outside the laboratory by                 moving the temporal acuity measures from the present battery to                 the new and faster computer hardware; developing and testing new                candidate measures of temporal visual acuity; developing the                    synthetic performance task (a task with substantial visual                      components, requiring vigilance and quick response to fine visual               detail embedded in a large and variable visual field); collecting               data relating Temporal Acuity Battery (TAB) measures to                         performance on the synthetic task; developing reliability vs.                   time trade-off functions and establishing guidelines for practice               until stability and long-term reliability; collecting data from                 other laboratory spatial and temporal visual tests (e.g., static                and dynamic contrast sensitivity) to serve as correlates of the                 TAB; conducting studies assessing the effects of alcohol and                    aging on temporal acuity; pooling the data collected from all                   studies to perform Factor Analysis of the battery; and                          establishing the prototype battery.  The project aims to produce                an assessment system that provides test administrators with                     useful data interpretations and prediction on field studies and                 in the workplace.  Such a system can contribute to our                          understanding of how to improve temporal visual acuity                          performance to the extent that such abilities are required for                  jobs, tasks, leisure activities and how to identify temporal                    aspects of visual displays so as to advance understanding in                    engineering design.",
