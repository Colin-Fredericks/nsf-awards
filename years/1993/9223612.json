 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223612  McCarthy  The Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse, France is planning to  launch four balloons equipped with scientific instruments in August  1994, and the University of Washington (UW) has been invited to  participate.  The purpose of the balloon flights  is to study  auroral wave-particle phenomena, and to support the ISTP spacecraft  observations.  Each balloon will carry a pinhole X-ray camera, a  large X-ray spectrometer, a VLF sensor, an electric field boom, and  a magnetometer.  Data obtained by these instruments  will  complement the measurements made on the ISTP spacecraft, GEOTAIL,  WIND, and POLAR, and other spacecraft (FREJA and INTERBOL).  The  balloon and spacecraft observations will also be supported by  ground-based observations such as the incoherent radar facilities  of EISCAT and the CANOPUS program in Canada.  An opportunity thus  exists to conduct a comprehensive study of both large- and small  scale wave-particle phenomena using data obtained from different  regions of space, from the ionosphere to the distant geomagnetic  tail and interplanetary space.  This coordinated program can yield  a valuable data set that can help in the interpretation of complex  geophysical data.  This proposal requests support for the UW to participate in the  French balloon program.  We have been asked to provide the X-ray  camera and data processing units (DPU).  The other experiments,  balloons, and the personnel to launch the balloons will be provided  by France and Europe.  ***",
