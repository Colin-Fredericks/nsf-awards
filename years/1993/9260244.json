 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanocrystalline materials are desired in many applications due to               their ability to provide superior mechanical properties coupled                 with improved wear and corrosion resistance.  In this Phase I                   effort, the ability to develop a number of nanocrystalline                      materials using pulsed reactive electrodes (PRE) either in the form             of a rod, wire, or in some cases braided wires submerged in a                   reactive or nonreactive dielectric fluid, is demonstrated.  Control             over the processing parameters can result in nanometer size powders             with tailored size, shape and morphology that can be                            characterized.  The technique can be adapted for producing                      carbides, nitrides, borides or oxides.  The follow-on Phase II                  effort will probably focus on adding reactive gases that flow                   alongside the electrode in a specially designed holder and a                    technique for consolidation of the nanocrystalline materials into               shapes ranging from sheets, using high shear compaction, to plates              and other intricate shapes.  Extensive testing of these compacted               shapes for strength, corrosion and high temperature behavior is                 also planned in the Phase II effort.  Methods for scaling up this               technique to produce commercial quantities of nano-crystalline                  powders for use in numerous applications will be considered.                                                                                                    Production of nanocrystalline powders can result in a quantum jump              in structural materials technology.  Alloys and nanocomposites thus             produced should facilitate applications in numerous electrical,                 magnetic, and packaging applications.  Other uses include                       crucibles, nozzles, smart materials, sensors, and several                       structural components.",
