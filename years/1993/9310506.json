 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310506  Fuller    The morphology and phase behavior of polymer mixtures can be  influenced by the application of external fields.  This research  examines the manipulation of polymer mixture morphology by the  use of electric fields.  Preliminary results on polymer  solutions are offered that demonstrate a variety of new  phenomena, such as electric field-induced de-mixing  and re-  mixing of polymer mixtures.  These results suggest the  possibility of systematically controlling the interfacial  properties of polymer blends, and the manipulation of their  domain structure.  Such control could be used in the processing  of polymer mixtures to arrive at specific bulk material  properties and improve interfacial mixing.    The research extends these preliminary results to include  polymer blends and polymer gels.  In addition, both upper and  lower critical solution temperature systems will be examined,  since the specific shape of the phase boundary is predicted to  determine whether application of an electric field will cause  either de-mixing (UCST systems) or re-mixing (LCST systems).   Finally, the project considers the simultaneous application of  electric and hydrodynamic fields, since real processes normally  include the presence of flow.  Since hydrodynamic forces are  also known to affect the phase behavior of polymer liquids, a  nonlinear coupling  of the effects of electric and flow fields  would be expected.    The research combines experimentation and theory.  Small angle  light scattering and scattering dichroism are used to measure  the structure of polymer mixtures subject to external flow  fields  Both experiments methods provide measures of anisotropy  in concentration fluctuations and can be used in situ.  The  theoretical analysis utilizes current mean field approaches  whereby the dynamics of concentration fluctuations can be  expressed in terms of the relative importance of fluxes due to  the external fields and relaxation mechanisms arising from  osmotic forces.  ***",
