 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing systems that use complex graphic and image based                      information require the storage and retrieval of very large data                files.  Optical disk systems offer the largest storage capacity of              any random access storage system, but widespread use, especially in             the PC market, has not occurred because of their high cost.  A                  major cost item in these drives is the high power laser diode they              require.  This cost can be dramatically reduced by developing more              sensitive optical recording media so that lower power, less                     expensive laser diodes can be used.                                                                                                                             We plan to apply materials and device design concepts we have                   developed in the course of our study of phase change materials to               develop erasable optical recording media suitable for use with                  lower power, less expensive laser diodes.  These materials will                 have rapid crystallization kinetics and stability in both                       structural phases.  This new phase change erasable media will have              potential application in business and technical computing, as well              as interactive education and entertainment systems.  This superior              technology provides an excellent opportunity to compete in markets              recognized for major growth over the next decade.",
