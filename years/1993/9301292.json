The program's                                    awards provide opportunities for joint                                          research, and the use of unique or                                              complementary facilities, expertise and                                         experimental conditions abroad.  The actual                                     financial support for this research will be                                     from the U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science                                        Program.                                                                                                                                                        This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. W. Dickson                                   Cunningham of the University of Illinois at                                     Urbana to work with Dr. Fernando Flecha Alkmim                                  at the Federal University of Ouro Preto in                                      Brazil.                                                                                                                                                         This research project involves the study of the                                 tectonic evolution of the eastern edge of                                       Brazilian Shield.  The project addresses                                        important questions concerning the structural                                   significance of the Brasiliano (=Pan African)                                   mobile belt and the tectonic relationship of                                    the Precambrian basement of the Mantiqueira                                     province to the Sao Francisco craton.  The                                      project has important implications for                                          understanding processes of Precambrian                                          continental amalgamation and the structural                                     evolution of South America.                                                                                                                                     The structural geology of the Mantiqueria                                       province is poorly known and existing maps of                                   the region emphasize Brasiliano trends in the                                   province.  Recent reconnaissance investigations                                 by UFOP and the University of Illinois                                          researchers indicate that the region contains                                   evidence for an older basement terrane                                          containing Transamazonian (2.0 b.y) age                                         structures.  If this is correct, it will                                        totally change perceptions of the pre-Gondwana                                  geology of the eastern margin of South America.                                 The Mantiqueira province may correlate better                                   with West African cratons than with South                                       American cratons.  The Brasiliano belt may mark                                 a Late Proterozoic suture superimposed on older                                 Transamazonian trends.                                                                                                                                          To address these issues, Dr. Cunningham plans                                   to conduct a detailed structural analysis                                       combined with detailed petrographic studies,                                    satellite imagery analysis, topographic studies                                 and geochronological sampling along three east-                                 west transects between Ouro Preto and the                                       Atlantic coast.  A multi-disciplinary approach                                  using these techniques has never before been                                    applied to tectonic problems in eastern Brazil.                                                                                                                 The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel, a stipend for                                       twelve months and a small travel allowance for                                  in-country travel and field work.",
