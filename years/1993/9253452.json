 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an educational networking testbed to              test conjectures about major changes in the teaching environment of             the Pittsburgh Public Schools made possible through the                         installation of an electronic data network that will ultimately be              available to all students and teachers in the school district.  The             proposed network will be novel in its distributed architecture and              distributed administrative structure.  Teachers and students will               use the network to access information and people outside of their               classrooms.  These new resources will be incorporated into                      curriculum, reform efforts, and the network will be used as a tool              for the development, implementation, evaluation and dissemination               of new curriculum components.                                                        The project will develop a set of network-based activities and             provide a framework in which such activities can be implemented                 throughout the local school system, tested, evaluated and made                  available to other school districts around the nation.  The project             also establishes mechanisms to institutionalize the use and                     maintenance of network technology in the Pittsburgh Public Schools.             The model that will be developed for the Pittsburgh Public Schools              will be applicable to other urban school systems, and materials                 generated in the course of the project will be immediately                      available for the use of other school districts via district's                  connection the internet.  The project thus tests the educational                utility of wide area networks for the national K-12 community and               will provide empirical date on costs and essential factors                      contributing to effectiveness.                                                       The project is a joint effort of the school district, the                  University of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center,              which itself was jointly founded by the University of Pittsburgh,               Carnegie Mellon University and the Westinghouse Electric                        Corporation.  The proposed activities will build coalitions                     involving these groups and many others across the local community.              Within the school district the project involves cooperative                     activities which include students, teachers, instructional                      specialists, administrators and the Pittsburgh Federation of                    Teachers.  The proposed network is the key element which will allow             these groups to work together efficiently and smoothly.  It is also             the key to significant changes in the structure and quality of                  education in the Pittsburgh Public Schools and, by extension, in                other school districts across the country.                                           Full implementation of the proposed network will require an                estimated five years to complete.  The present proposal will fund               a two-year pilot phase of the larger project.  This pilot phase                 will attempt to answer all those questions which Pittsburgh - or                any other school district contemplating the development of an                   extensive computer network - should understand before proceeding to             a full-scale implementation.  Funding for the three-year                        implementation phase which follows will be sought from a                        combination of NSF programs and programs managed by other federal               agencies and private foundations.",
