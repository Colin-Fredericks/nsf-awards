 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to develop a series of 12 exhibits on the topic of                   feedback.  We will create an introductory cluster of 4-5                        exhibits situated in our \"Patterns\" section to introduce the                    basic concepts.  We sill situate each of the remaining 708                      exhibits in the area of the museum that suits it                                phenomenologically.  A continuity in the theme of feedback                      will be created through Feedback Pathways (both a field trip                    Pathway and a general use Pathway) and associated maps which                    will be available in the introductory cluster>  These will                      guide both visitors and school classes from area to area with                   feedback as the unifying element.  The feedback behavior                        exemplified in these exhibits will be accessible to both young                  and older audiences and will be strongly connected with the                     \"Themes of Science\" listed in the California State Science                      Framework for Pre-College Science Education.  The exhibits                      will receive extensive use in our teacher training programs at                  both the elementary and secondary level.  Exhibit evaluation                    will take place at the level of extensive prototyping by                        exhibit development and teaching staff and on a more formal                     level in conjunction with a formative evaluation program.  We                   will disseminate this work in a publication describing                          inexpensive classroom versions of Exploratorium exhibits.  In                   addition, we will experiment with the dissemination of our                      work to other museums through the Internet Computer Network.",
