 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide experimental                        apparatus (a wind tunnel and a water tunnel) for undergraduate                  engineering students in the Fluids/Thermal Laboratory (junior                   level; 1 credit hour, required course for a B.S. in Mechanical                  Engineering) and the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory (senior                  level; 3 credit hours; required course for a B.S. in Mechanical                 Engineering) that would permit them to investigate important                    problems in fluid mechanics and heat transfer, which they                       cannot currently investigate. The wind and water tunnels (with                  basic instrumentation system, and model and calibration sets)                   would be used for \"new\" investigations concerning the                           foundations of viscous and pressure drags, aerodynamics, and                    convective heat transfer. The addition of these \"new\"                           investigations to the Fluids/Thermal Laboratory would                           substantially improve laboratory experiences of undergraduate                   Mechanical Engineering students (particularly since the                         majority work full- or part-time during the day).  Furthermore,                 the acquisition of a wind tunnel and a water tunnel (with the                   associated instrumentation systems) would permit, and                           encourage, undergraduate engineering students to pursue \"self                   initiated\" investigations, \"independent study\" courses, and                     \"undergraduate research\" in general areas of fluid mechanics,                   convective heat transfer, aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and                      biofluiddynamics. Importantly, in most of the envisioned \"self                  initiated\" investigations, the students would only need to                      construct \"models and/or systems\" to be tested in the wind                      tunnel and/or in the water tunnel; this would be a major                        improvement when compared to the current situation, where the                   students are also required to construct the associated                          experimental\\test apparatus.",
