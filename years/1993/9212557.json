 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to construct allocation rules                  satisfying appealing properties.  Special attention is paid to                  rules that are equitable and immune to manipulative behavior.  The              project studies bargaining, taxation, allocation of private goods,              allocation of public goods, and allocation of indivisible goods.                In general, economists do not pay enough attention to normative                 issues of fairness and many important questions that the general                public cares about have been neglected for too long: Who should pay             for disaster relief?  How should the cost of military alliances be              distributed?  Are the salaries of executives justified?  How should             the \"peace dividend\" be allocated?  Is the income disparity between             industrialized countries and countries of the Third World                       acceptable?                                                                                                                                                     The most convincing argument one can make in favor of an allocation             rule is that it satisfies appealing properties and, in this                     research, properties of rules, not the rules themselves, are the                starting point.  Several kinds of properties will be analyzed.                  Monotonicity properties state that all agents should be affected in             the same direction by changes in their environment; these changes               can be in resources, technology, population, etc.  Consistency                  properties guarantee that the recommendation made by a rule is                  never contradicted by the recommendation it makes when some of the              agents leave the scene with their payoffs.  The converse property               allows us to deduce the desirability of a decision for a whole                  economy on the basis of its desirability for small subgroups.                   Strategy-proofness says that the rule provides agents the incentive             to tell the truth about the data over which they have control.                                                                                                  Studying the manipulability and the implementability of rules                   should indeed be components of any comprehensive research program               on mechanism design.  This study is very important because it will              help trace out the boundary between which combinations of social                objectives are compatible and which are not, taking into account                the strategic behavior of agents.",
