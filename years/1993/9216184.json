 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both the social sciences and the Federal Statistical System                are vitally dependent on survey research tools.  The knowledge                  required to use and refine these tools is unusually broad,  drawing             on a blend of many disciplines.  As a result,  the current                      organization of U.S. universities does not serve well the needs of              innovative survey research.  NSF funding for the Center for Survey              Methods in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area offers a chance               to overcome the weaknesses of current programs.                                      The University of Maryland,  University of Michigan, and                   Westat,  Inc.,  jointly propose to create and staff a Center for                Survey Methods located at the University of Maryland's College Park             Campus.  Stanley Presser will be the Director;  Robert M. Groves,               the Associate Director.  Existing Maryland staff will be                        supplemented by a permanent Michigan team located at College Park,              a Westat team ,  and video instruction by Michigan faculty from Ann             Arbor.  The curriculum will pool existing Maryland courses,                     existing courses of the Michigan Summer Institute in Survey                     Research Techniques,  newly created specialty courses,  and a                   series of short courses targeted to the needs of the Federal                    Statistical System staff.  An evolutionary strategy is proposed for             the Center,  starting with easily developed and time-proven courses             and organizational ties,  to a fully integrated course structure                blending theory and practice and increased integration across                   organizations.  The research program of the Center will be built                around the selection of faculty devoted to ongoing research,                    research uses of a survey practicum,  small seed grants,  Master's              research experience requirement,  the research activities of                    visiting scholars,  and a research design seminar.                                   One measure of the Center's success will be collaborative                  research involving Center faculty and other survey statisticians                and methodologists who are affiliated faculty and/or located on                 other campuses.  This strategy will be critical in advancing the                field of survey methodology.",
