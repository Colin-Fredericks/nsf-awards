At the same time quality of service will be improved to all connected sites including larger, less remotely located institutions.  This growth of connection points will reduce the distance from the new institutions to the closest SURAnet backbone point, thus reducing the cost of access lines.  The larger number of aggregation points will also reduce congestion and packet loss at each aggregation point.  Additionally, they will provide a variety of information and support services to assist institutions in defining and selecting appropriate hardware and software to establish their own institutional TCP/IP local area network (LAN).",
