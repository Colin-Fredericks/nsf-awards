 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a model science lab at Chesapeake                     College's Cambridge Satellite Center in Dorchester County.                      Through the use of innovative, hands-on approaches as well as                   the direct use of multi-media, data manipulation and                            simulational software, this laboratory will be used to involve                  students in science and technology, help them to establish a                    science knowledge base from which to work, and encourage them                   to follow a career path in a science or engineering field.                      Faculty will revise the approach currently employ in teaching                   the basic biological and physical sciences to provide an                        enhanced learning environment that will call upon students'                     natural curiosity as a starting point in the design of                          experiments.  The Cambridge Satellite Center is located in                      Dorchester County, whose population is 27.9 percent African-                    American.  In 1991, 41% of all first-time, full-time freshmen                   from Dorchester County attended Chesapeake College, as did 79                   percent of all part-time undergraduates in the County. It is                    anticipated that this grant will markedly improve the                           recruitment of science candidates from a targeted minority                      population that resides in the area.",
