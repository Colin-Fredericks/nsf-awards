 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of operating systems requires an understanding of                     some of the fundamental concepts in computer science:                           concurrency, synchronization, deadlock, communication, and                      efficiency. The traditional method of lecture and reading does                  a disservice to students who are being exposed to these                         difficult concepts for the first time. Undergraduate computer                   science students need creative, innovative ways of learning                     these concepts in the context of the operating systems course.                  The future of computing is in distributed and parallel                          processing. The operating systems course is the best place to                   assure every computer science student receives a solid                          foundation in these fundamental concepts.The EOS operating                      system lab is designed to increase the number of ways a student                 has to learn major operating systems principles. Computer                       laboratory exercises actively involve students with concept-                    relevant programming and graphical simulations. The ease-of-use                 and graphical output of the lab applications encourage                          exploration of operating system subject matter and allow for a                  more effective teaching mode; that of directed discovery                        learning. The exercises developed for the EOS lab provide a                     high learning to coding ratio for programming assignments, and                  elucidate fundamental computer science concepts in an exciting,                 interactive manner through simulation. Assignments associated                   with the subject content of each lab are performed on the                       workstation and are submitted and graded through electronic                     mail.",
