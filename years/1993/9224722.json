 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224722  Panagiotopoulos  This award supports Professor Athanassios Panagiotopoulos of Cornell  University to collaborate in chemical engineering research with  Professor Daan Frenkel of the FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular  Physics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  Both of their research  groups have been very active in the field of molecular simulation of  phase equilibria and free energy calculations.  The primary research  objective of their collaboration is the development of methods for  the calculation of phase equilibria for long-chain polymeric  systems, and the application of these new methods to simple physical  models of multisegment molecules.  They will use the results of  their calculations for systematic comparisons with statistical  mechanical theories of polymer thermodynamics.  They will also  attempt some direct comparisons with experimental data where  appropriate.  The proposed research will utilize the complementary  skills of the two research groups in simulations and algorithm  development.    The determination of the chemical potentials and phase behavior of  macromolecular systems from molecular simulation is a long-standing  problem in statistical mechanics with significant potential  theoretical and practical implications.  The collaboration of the  Cornell and FOM groups is likely to contribute substantially to  finding a solution, due to a combination of the powerful new  techniques they have recently developed.  ***",
