 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311208  Geber       This study examines the roles of habitat fragmentation and  host-parasitiod interactions in influencing the distribution and  population dynamics of a geometrid moth living in a naturally  patchy habitat.  It examine the habitat structure, synchrony of  local populations, dispersal between populations, and impact of  host-parastoid interactions.  The work combines field experiments  and observations with the development of a discrete time simulation  model on a spatially explicit landscape to examine and intergrate  the influences of habitat subdivision and host-parasitoid  interactions.  Understanding the population dynamics and distribution of species  occupying subdivided habitats is critical to both the fields of  population biology and conservation biology.  The dynamics of  colonization, extinction and dispersal interacts with predator-prey  dynamics to determine population processes for species living in  patchily distributed habitats.  Theoretical work exists in both the  areas of habitat fragmentation and predator-prey interactions.   yet, little empirical work stands behind these bodies of theory,  and very little theoretical and almost no empirical work has  attempted to intergrate the two fields.  %%%  Metapopulation dynamic's are being increasingly used for models if  population structure in both theoretical & conservation contexts,  yet there are few examples showing time metapopulation structure.   This study offers the potential of establishing an example of a  metapopulation.  ***",
