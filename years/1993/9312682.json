 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this workshop is to critically                         examine current needs for strong motion data to support                         advances in earthquake hazard mitigation.  The requirements                     include a complete definition of the earthquake wavefield                       that may effect engineering structures as a function of                         earthquake source conditions and propagation path: range,                       depth, geology and topography.  Both deterministic and                          random characterizations are considered.                                                                                                                        Specific objectives of the workshop include:                                                                                                                      Review past and current activities in earthquake strong                         motion recording, processing, archiving, analysis, and                          application.                                                                                                                                                    Identify crucial strong motion data needs in earthquake                         engineering and engineering seismology.                                                                                                                         Develop a strategic plan to fulfill those needs.                                                                                                                Explore and implement a working group to coordinate,                            advise and provide supporting details for implementation                        of the plan, and to oversee the activities initiated to                         implement the plan.                                                                                                                                           The objective will be accomplished in a 1-1/2 day workshop                      involving geotechnical and structural engineers and earth                       scientists.",
