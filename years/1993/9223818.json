 "awd_abstract_narration": "New firms face a number of performance obstacles created by their               newness and small size.  These obstacles include lack of                        legitimacy in the industry and marketplace, the challenge of                    raising sufficient capital, and the risks and uncertainties of                  new technology development.  Yet, some entrepreneurs transform                  these obstacles into opportunities by using their newness, small                size, and cutting edge technologies to attract other firms in                   cooperative relationships, called strategic alliances.  The                     strategy of allying with other organizations has become                         increasingly prevalent, and yet little is known about the                       objective value of such relationships to new ventures.                          Using a longitudinal data base on a population of 102 new                       ventures in the U.S. semiconductor industry which have created                  635 strategic alliances with other firms, this research tests a                 model of financial performance and strategic alliances.  Among                  the variables to be investigated in the research as factors                     affecting financial performance are: (1) alliance partner                       attributes such as relative power, cultural distance, and                       prominence; (2) the number and type of strategic alliances                      formed; (3) technological innovativeness; (4) strength of the                   founding top management team; (5) organizational resources like                 investment capital raised; and (6) broader market conditions.",
