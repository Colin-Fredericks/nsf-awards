 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carleton College proposes to renovate research                             space in Mudd Hall for the Departments of Chemistry                             and Geology. The remodeling of the chemistry                                    facilities will provide new labs devoted to                                     research in physical, organic, inorganic and                                    analytic chemistry, and biochemistry.  In addition,                             instrument rooms and  hazardous waste storage will                              be reconfigured.  The result will be a logical and                              efficient arrangement of research space which will                              noticeably enhance the department's research                                    program.  All seven chemistry faculty members                                   maintain active research programs and work together                             with about two dozen students per year.  Each year                              Carleton graduates about 25 to 30 students with                                 chemistry majors.                                                                    The renovation of the geology research                                     facilities will result in a room dedicated to                                   computers, a modernized geochemistry lab with                                   proper ventilation and storage, a dedicated rock                                preparation room, and a properly ventilated area                                for x-ray machines.  The renovation will have a                                 significant impact on the research of 3 faculty and                             the 20 plus geology seniors who conduct independent                             research projects each year.",
