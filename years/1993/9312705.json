 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to support a special issue of IEEE Transactions on             Plasma Science and a related international workshop on plasma                   astrophysics.  The Special Issue on Space and Cosmic Plasma will                provide an update on research in space plasma physics in the areas              of magnetospheric/ionospheric interactions, the magnetospheres of               the planets and stars, and the physics of plasma effects related to             other astrophysical objects.  Special emphasis is placed on                     laboratory and computer simulation of space plasmas and the                     application of these results to outstanding problems such as                    dynamical processes, energy transport, diagnostics, plasma                      diffusion in the magnetopause, nonlinear interactions, particle                 acceleration, double layers, critical ionization velocity effect,               electric currents, and instabilities in the near-Earth plasma                   environment.  The goal of the Second IEEE Workshop on Plasma                    Astrophysics is to provide an update on research in space plasma                physics in the areas listed above for the Special Issue.  The solid             foundation that the solar system provides to plasma physics can be              extrapolated to plasmas having large-scale astrophysical and                    cosmological interest.",
