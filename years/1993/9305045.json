 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional forecasting methods often assume that there is a  \"true\" model for the process under study.  Under such an  assumption, one can use maximum likelihood method to estimate the  model and then use the estimated model for forecasting. In  practice, however, there is no \"true\" model.  Consequently, the  traditional forecasting method may fare poorly in long-term  forecasts.  To overcome this difficulty, we proposed in this  project an adaptive forecasting procedure that can produce  accurate long-term forecasts. The proposed procedure selects a  statistical model for each forecasting horizon. In other words,  under the proposed procedure, different models are used to  produce different multi-step ahead forecasts. Our preliminary  results suggest that such an adaptive procedure outperforms  substantially the traditional forecasting 1 methods. In this  project, we plan to investigate properties of such an adaptive  forecasting procedure, to provide theoretical justifications of  the procedure, and to develop statistical criteria of model  selection in adaptive forecasting. The second part of the  proposed research is concerned with Bayesian time-series  analysis.  Its main objective is to develop new methodologies for  Bayesian inference that (a) make use of the recent developments  in repeated stochastic substitution such as the Gibbs sampler,  (b) allow for various structural changes in a process, and (c)  provide a flexible framework for estimating common features in a  vector process.  For instance, we consider a Markov switching  framework for modeling macroeconomic time series and for  discriminating non-nested non-linear time series models. We also  augment a probit model to a random variance-shift model to relate  the probability of a variance change to a set of chosen  explanatory variables.  These preliminary results are very  encouraging as they successfully describe many features that  cannot be captured by the traditional time-series analysis.  The proposed research consists of  two main projects. In the first  project, we propose to develop new methods that can produce  accurate long-term forecasts. The basic idea of the proposed  research is that different models are selected to produce  forecasts of different horizons. Under the proposed research,  statistical models are used adaptively in long-term forecasts.  Advantages of the proposed new forecasting methods include (a)  they relate directly model selection to the objective of  forecasts, (b) it relaxes many \"unrealistic assumptions\" commonly  imposed by the traditional forecasting methods, and (c) they make  use of the recent advances in statistical  computing. Our  preliminary experience on forecasting the U.S. monthly consumer  price index for foods indicates that the proposed methods  outperform substantially other forecasting methods available in  the literature. The second project is concerned with time-series  analysis. It emphasizes the recent developments in statistical  algorithms and the advances in computing.  The main objective is  to develop new methodologies that can incorporate prior  acknowledge on subject matters into data analysis in an efficient  manner.  It also widens the applicability of many statistical  methods by enlarging the class of possible statistical  distributions such as using scale mixture of traditional   distributions.",
