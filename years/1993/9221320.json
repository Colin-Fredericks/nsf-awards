 "awd_abstract_narration": "As early as 1962 Rachel Carson recognized the need for                     biological solutions to environmental problems.  She said: \"A                   truly extraordinary variety of alternatives to the chemical                     control of insects is available.  Some are already in use...                    others are little more than ideas in the minds of imaginative                   scientists,... .  All have this in common: they are biological                  solutions, based on the living organism they wish to control, and               to the whole fabric of life to which these organisms belong.                    This research project will work within this context to develop                  natural alternatives to pesticide and herbicides as crop-land                   management tools.                                                                    The long-term goal of our research is to understand the                    behavior of insects that ate natural predators on pests that                    reduce the productivity of agricultural crops.  We will identify                attributes of the landscape that are favored by a predator on                   aphids, the ladybird beetles.  This knowledge could allow us to                 naturally reduce the number of insect pests by designing an                     agricultural landscape that promotes a large population of                      predators.                                                                           The first step in this research is to define the link                      between various crop types and the predatory insect.  This is                   done by determining if there is a match between the abundance of                naturally occurring stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in the               insect predators and the agricultural crop.  A future step will                 be to link the spatial distribution of the predators with respect               to landscape elements.  These two steps are a unique approach to                studying the behavior of insects because they combine technology                from geology and chemistry (analysis of naturally occurring                     stable isotopes), entomology (insect population dynamics,                       biological control), and geography (landscape mapping using                     geographical information systems).",
