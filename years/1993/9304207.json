The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Penny                                        Anderson to work with Dr Gilles Kahn, at INRIA                                  Sophia-Antipolis, France.                                                                                                                                       This research will explore how the wealth of                                    theoretical work in formal logic, proof theory,                                 logical frameworks, and related topics can be                                   used to improve programming practice.  Dr.                                      Anderson will investigate the use of higher-                                    order abstract syntax and related techniques in                                 systems based on formal deduction that have                                     efficient and well-designed user interfaces.                                                                                                                    Effective user interfaces are essential for                                     most of the activities one might wish to                                        undertake with the support of automated                                         deductive systems:  theorem proving, language                                   prototyping, semantic analysis, program                                         development, etc.  These tasks require the                                      management of large amounts of detail, and for                                  even medium-sized problems they become                                          infeasible without extensive support for                                        presenting information to the user. In order to                                 carry out experiments with deductive systems                                    that are needed to bring theoretical work to                                    practical application, one needs user interface                                 tools that are general in the same sense that                                   logical frameworks are.  The use of higher-                                     order encoding techniques has the potential to                                  simplify the task of tailoring user interface                                   tools to particular formal deduction systems.                                   The purpose of this research is to bring                                        together research in the application of logical                                 frameworks with research in user interfaces to                                  deduction-based systems.  This should result in                                 better understanding of implementation                                          techniques and useful refinements of the                                        underlying framework; the use of these                                          encodings should clarify the semantic basis of                                  the interaction with the user.",
