 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous reports have cited the deplorable state of scientific                  and mathematical illiteracy that exists within the U.S.                         Numerous approaches are being made to rectify this problem in                   grades K-12.  However, until students who have benefitted from                  these new approaches reach the university, something must be                    done to help today's university students.  This project is                      using the power of modern computers in the classroom to                         motivate, interest, and engage students who are taking a                        required business statistics course so that they can become                     more adept at quantitative reasoning and problem solving.  In                   order to reach this goal,  lesson modules are being developed                   that use quality color graphics, intensive computation, and                     multi-tasking to illustrate and demonstrate selected                            statistical concepts.  Each module consists of computer-based                   lecture materials, classroom exercises, instructor notes, and                   student experiments.  These lessons illustrate statistical                      concepts by integrating the computer into the classroom                         environment; involve students in problem solving by employing                   real, interesting, and relevant databases, statistical                          experiments and simulations; and illustrate situations where                    statistics can be used as an effective tool to understand and                   solve problems.  Potential impacts include improved student                     performance, an increase in students' abilities to use                          statistics to formulate and answer their own questions, and                     enhanced interest in quantitatively-oriented business careers.",
