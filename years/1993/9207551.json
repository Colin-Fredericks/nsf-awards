 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML) is a research unit of the                    University of California                                                        (UC) located on the Sonoma coast 70 miles north of San                          Francisco.  Since 1966 the                                                       Laboratory has provided unique opportunities for field                         research on a rich flora and fauna in close proximity to the                    Laboratory buildings.  BML has well-equipped laboratories,                      an excellent seawater system, strong on-site support staff                      and a firm commitment from the Davis campus to continue                         developing the facilities and support needed by the growing                     number of resident and visiting researchers at the site.                        The Laboratory is located on the Bodega Marine Reserve                          (BMR), a 362-acre protected field site with a diverse set of                    marine and terrestrial coast habitats.  Adjacent subtidal                       areas are protected and available for study within the                          Bodega Marine Life Refuge.                                                                                                                                      Subtidal research on invertebrates, algae, and fish                             (population biology, physiological                                              ecology, biochemical and behavioral studies) is expanding                       rapidly at BML.  This project will supply partial support                       for expansion of the existing dive locker and  installation                     of an Enriched Air Nitrox Scuba facility.  Nitrox Scuba is                      quickly evolving as the technology of choice for scientific                     underwater operations.  Current research diving at BML is                       accomplished using air Scuba under physically demanding                         conditions.  Nitrox Scuba capability will approximately                         double the time available per dive for benthic studies,                         while reducing diver fatigue, nitrogen narcosis, and                            incidence of decompression                                                      sickness.  An enhanced diving facility is vital if BML and                      visiting researchers are to expand in situ benthic research                     exploiting the unique aspects of the site.",
