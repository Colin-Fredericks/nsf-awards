 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful computer-based                tools for storing, managing, and manipulating information about                 spatially-distributed phenomena.  GIS has proved extremely                      valuable to municipalities, government and non-profit agencies                  and private business, assisting them in information management,                 planning and decision making, emergency response, and monitoring                of environmental change.                                                                                                                                        Effective use of GIS requires substantial training and expertise.               This has been a major obstacle to full realization of GIS'                      benefits in government and industry.  This project will develop a               software-based GIS Expert Assistant as an aid to enhance the                    training process, assist the occasional user, and improve                       reliability and consistency of GIS analysis results.  The GIS                   Expert Assistant will be built using the knowledge engineering                  techniques developed by the artificial intelligence community,                  and will incorporate knowledge and techniques recognized by                     experts in the GIS field.                                                                                                                                       The GIS Expert Assistant will function as a readily-available                   consultant or aide, providing immediate assistance while a user                 is interacting with the GIS.  It is not intended to replace or                  overrule the experienced practitioner or instructor, but will                   enable more efficient use of these scarce human resources.                                                                                                      This research will provide the basis for implementing a                         commercial software package to assist users of GIS packages in                  learning and using their GIS more effectively.",
