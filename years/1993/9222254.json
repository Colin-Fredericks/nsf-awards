 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rabaey         High Level Synthesis has undergone remarkable progress in  recent years. A number of powerful synthesis environments have  been proposed in the area of real time signal processing, both in  Europe and the United States. Unfortunately, most of the existing  tools span only restricted application domains or very specific  architectural styles. To be successful at an industrial level, a  unification of the synthesis approaches is clearly essential.          The goal of this research is to boost the field of  high-level synthesis for digital signal processing by bringing  together researchers from the IMEC Research Center at Leuven,  Belgium and the University of California at Berkeley. The  objectives are to exchange synthesis techniques and tools in an  attempt to come to a unified framework, addressing the global  architectural domain. At the same time, this cooperation will  result in the training of researchers with a wider vision and  scope of expertise in the field of high level synthesis.",
