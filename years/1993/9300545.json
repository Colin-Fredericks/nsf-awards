 "awd_abstract_narration": "SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) has permitted              undergraduate students to take part in hands-on, research scale                 geophysical exploration.  Students first complete the four-week                 field segment of SAGE in the Rio Grande rift of New Mexico.  Here               they do research using seismic reflection and refraction, gravity,              magnetism, electrical resistivity, electromagnetics, and                        magnetotellurics.  They are involved in every phase of the field                research from the collection and processing of the data to its                  interpretation culminating with both an oral and written report.                After the field segment the students return to their campuses where             the research continues provided the required supervision exists.                This is closely monitored by a SAGE faculty member and is augmented             by a visit to a SAGE faculty's campus and attendance at a                       scientific meeting.                                                                  SAGE is sponsored by Los Alamos National Laboratory and 5                  schools who furnish faculty and geophysical equipment.  Additional              equipment is provided by industry, e.g., ARCO and Kennecott, among              others, assisted SAGE in 1992.                                                       This proposal seeks support for 13 undergraduate students to               attend the SAGE research program for each of the next three years.              Students are accepted from any school.  Strategies to recruit                   underrepresented students successfully brought four women, one                  Hispanic, and one Navajo to SAGE 1992 as part of the 13 REU                     students.",
