 "awd_abstract_narration": "93-50539   Shreeve  Idaho Systemic Improvement Plan  The state of Idaho has a strategic vision - a clear image of what it wants to achieve - and a  strategic plan to reach its goals.  The vision is simple, confident and reality-based:  a) to identify  and develop a research capability in areas where Idaho scientists/engineers can first establish  regional preeminence and subsequently to use that research strength and capacity to emerge as  a national leader; b) to have its institutions of higher education gain a national reputation for  their educational superiority based upon a foundation of individual fulfillment in a dynamic  environment which promotes growth in science, engineering and mathematics education and  research; and c) to have a network of activities which provides for human resource development  and which introduces faculty/student research - and the knowledge that the research generates  - to the region's private sector industries and federal laboratories.  The years of the Idaho NSF  EPSCoR I program (FY 1989-92) were extraordinary in terms of positioning the state to reach  these goals.  EPSCoR I has helped Idaho to help itself.  As a result, the state is now fully  committed to a systematic, systemic improvement program for continuous development - in  quality and quantity - in science and engineering (S&E) research and education at each of its  institutions.",
