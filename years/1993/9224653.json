The theme of                 the Forum is the Advanced Materials and Processing Program (AMPP)               developed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)                 to implement the recommendations of the report Materials Science                and Engineering for the 1990s.  The Forum program will focus on                 the restructuring of materials science and engineering in the                   United States from research to manufacturing.  Discussion topics                will include the relationship between materials science and other               federal initiatives, such as Grand Challenges in computing;                     federally funded industrial consortia, such as SEMATECH and CSE;                and the emerging role of government laboratories in technology                  transfer.  This award for partial support of the 1993 SSSC Forum                is under the direction of Ronald D. Taylor.",
