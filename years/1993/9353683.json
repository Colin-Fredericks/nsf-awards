They will also participate in  critical discussions about the methods.  Topics to be included are:   hands-on discovery-based learning; reflective teaching and action  research; cognitively-guided instruction; technology-based science  teaching; the relationship between laboratory and classroom work in  middle and high school; the role of textbooks in teaching science;   and the effect of school-based management on teaching practice.   There will be a distribution of the conference proceedings which  will cover plenary papers, summaries of the interactive sessions,  models of good practice presented by teachers, and an assessment of  what makes good practice and how to reinforce it.  The conference  is expected to have a total attendance of about 400 with a  composition of science educators, scientists, business people,  state and federal government policymakers, congressional staff, and  others for invited presentations and joint discussions.  ***",
