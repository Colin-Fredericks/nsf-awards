It proposes to                                      emphasize the rich and exciting frontiers that                                  are at the crossroads of these two major                                        research areas.  This area of physics has not                                   been covered in recent years in India from a                                    unified perspective.  The topics to be covered                                  include the standard models of particle physics                                 and of cosmology; neutrino physics; fermion                                     masses and mixings; physics beyond the standard                                 models including (a) grand unification, (b)                                     supersymmetry, (c) superstring phenomenology                                    and (d) dynamical schemes on the origin of                                      masses and families; inflation, dark matter,                                    baryogenesis and related areas.  Lecturers are                                  from the U.S., Europe, FSU, and Asia.  Students                                 are from Bangladesh, China, Sri Lanka,                                          Pakistan, India and Nepal (BCSPIN).  Fifty                                      percent of the students will be from India.                                                                                                                     Scope:  The exposure of students and young                                      researchers to lectures by world renowned                                       scientists greatly strengthens the scientific                                   potential in these countries, and fosters                                       scientific cooperation between the developing                                   countries and the U.S. and, particularly,                                       between India and the U.S.  This school is the                                  fourth in a series of highly successful schools                                 that were designed to promote interest in                                       physics research in the BCSPIN region.  It is                                   supported financially and organizationally by                                   leading institutions of India including the                                     Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, S.N.
