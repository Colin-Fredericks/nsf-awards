 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this work, the study of inverse problems in                  mathematical analysis, is one of recovering physical properties                 of an object or phenomenon from data obtained by remote                         observations.  The problems are well-posed in the sense that the                data sets are not so burdensome as to rule out any solutions, but               sufficient for the reconstruction. The problem of determining a                 quantum mechanical potential from its scattering amplitude goes                 back to the beginning of quantum mechanics.  But little attention               is given to finding data sets for which the problem is                          well-posed in the sense that the mapping from the potential to                  the scattering data is continuously invertible.  One likely                     candidate for such a data set is backscattering data, the subject               of this research.  Much successful work has been accomplished on                the question in three dimensions, though mainly confined to small               potentials.  The present work seeks to remove this assumption and               look for more general results, possibly giving up some degree                   of well-posedness.  Work will continue on                                       two-dimensional backscattering as well, where a type of                         singularity in a parameter makes backscattering a much more                     untractable problem, even assuming compact support of the                       potential.Inverse problems in the context of this project are                   formulated in terms of classical equations, such as the                         Schrodinger equation. These equations may represent wave                        phenomena involving magnetic and electric potentials, acoustics                 and other type of waves in the presence of obstacles.  Although                 much of the research focuses on the mathematical analysis of the                inverse mapping, its connections with the physical world are                    easily traced.",
