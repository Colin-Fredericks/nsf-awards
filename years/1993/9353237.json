 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353237  Sprague    The Mesa, AZ Public School District is a national leader in  promoting the use of hands-on inquiry-based science teaching in  elementary schools.  The Mesa approach to elementary science is  one of the models used by the National Science Resources Center  in the NSF-supported Leadership Institute that has been attended  by teams from 126 school districts.  These districts, as well as  other districts that are implementing changes inspired by the  Mesa model, encounter many of the same barriers to organizational  change, the same logistical problems relating to science  materials in the classroom, and the same questions concerning  professional development of teachers and school administrators.     For this reason, the Mesa Education Foundation will host a  three-day Advanced Leadership Conference for teams from districts  that are implementing change efforts in elementary science.  Dow  Chemical and Hewlett-Packard have supported the change efforts in  many of these districts, and both companies will be contributors  to the conference.  The conference will focus on three strands:  organizational change, management of science materials centers,  and staff development.  This conference will facilitate: 1)  advanced training by staff from exemplary districts, 2) sharing  of ideas and strategies among the districts that are implementing  change, and 3) formulation of widely applicable change indicators  and a model for technical assistance to school districts. The  proposed conference has an excellent format, an outstanding  leadership team, and a solid plan for disseminating the results  of the meeting.  The potential impact of this conference extends  beyond the districts that will send representatives.    Cost sharing for this project represents 125% of the NSF  contribution.  ***",
