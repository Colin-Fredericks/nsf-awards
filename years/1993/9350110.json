 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will achieve a quantitative understanding and                      description of instabilities of the current-voltage characteristics             of amorphous silicon Thin Film Transistors (a-Si TFTs), and will                link these phenomena with the deep defect states in the a-Si                    bandgap.  Studies of current-voltage characteristics of TFTs in the             subthreshold regime (at gate voltages substantially smaller than                threshold) and, especially, studies of the leakage current can be               very useful for understanding degradation phenomena.  Dr. Globus                will analyze the results of the time and temperature dependence                 measurements of current-voltage characteristics under the voltage               stress, annealing at elevated temperatures, and relaxation after                quenching.  She will study the leakage current in a-Si and poly-Si              TFT; derive information about the density of states in a-Si:H and               poly-Si using measured data in subthreshold regime; and will obtain             more detailed information about the density of states in a-Si:H,                the structure of defect absorption modes, the energy levels, and                optical spectra of defects from IR optical measurements on a-Si and             poly-Si thin films.  The understanding, and control of metastable               defect formation in a-Si are essential because this process is a                principal obstacle to the practical use of a-Si:H, and for the                  insight into fundamental physics of amorphous silicon.                                                                                                          The interactive activities at the host institution will include                 teaching a course entitled \"Thin Film Transistors\", presenting                  guest lectures, and counseling and advising students.  Dr. Globus               will share, with the student body, her experiences as a scientist               in Russia, where almost half of scientists and engineers are                    female.                                                                                                                                                         This project furthers the VPW program objectives which are (1) to               provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
