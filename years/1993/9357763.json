 "awd_abstract_narration": "Synthesizing realistic images is a fundamental challenge for  computer graphics.  One of the most difficult aspects of this  task is the  simulation of global illumination:  the  interreflection of light between  surfaces.    This research applies finite element methods to the simulation of  global illumination.  The work is divided into three subprojects:  (1)  error metrics for global illumination,  (2)  adaptive meshing for radiosity, and  (3)  generalization to scenes with arbitrary reflectance. Rather than attempting to measure ``realism'', which is a  rather  nebulous perceptual quality, simpler, quantitative accuracy  measures  are being developed.  Using these error measures,  existing and future image  synthesis algorithms can be evaluated  and quantitatively ranked.    Adaptive  meshes for radiosity mesh generation is only partially automated in many  radiosity  systems, and little is known about the errors introduced by  various  meshes.  Recent experiments on simplified, two-dimensional scenes show that  the use of adaptive meshes and  higher degree approximations can lead to much  faster and/or more  accurate solutions than those of existing algorithms.  More  accurate, better looking pictures result when the radiosity mesh  follows  discontinuities in the solution function such as those at  shadow boundaries.  These ``discontinuity meshing'' techniques have been embraced by  researchers.  In this  research, meshes for radiosity are compared and  evaluated using  error metrics as an objective criterion.  This rigorous  analysis  of radiosity functions suggests new mesh generation techniques  allowing more accurate simulations.    Generalization to scenes with arbitrary  reflectance, the final sub-project, is the generalization of these methods to  scenes with realistic light scattering.  The reflectance of real  surfaces is  not purely diffuse or specular, but is described by a  complex bidirectional  reflectance  distribution function (BRDF).  Recent work suggests that the use of  spherical harmonics or other  appropriate basis functions greatly facilitates  the approximation  of direction-dependent light functions.  Such representations  for  functions of both position and direction are being analyzed and  developed.  The ultimate goal is the development of accurate,  efficient algorithms for  simulating global illumination on  complex scenes with arbitrary reflectance and  transmittance.",
