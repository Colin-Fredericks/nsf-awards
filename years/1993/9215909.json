 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of seven U.S.                         scientists in a joint seminar on the topic of the influence of                  tropical rivers on costal oceanographic processes in the region                 of southern New Guinea and the Coral Sea.  The seminar will be                  held at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) located               near Townsville, Queensland, Australia in June 1993.  Coastal                   environments adjacent to tropical rivers include many unique                    characteristics.  Tropical and subtropical rivers discharge                     nearly 3/4 of the runoff and sediment reaching the coastal ocean.               The geological record preserved by accumulating sediments                       provides important information.                                                                                                                                 Australian researchers are investigating a multi-disciplinary                   range of processes along the southeastern coast of New Guinea and               in the Coral Sea near the mouth of the Fly River.  U.S.                         scientists are investigating similar processes on the continental               margin near the mouth of the Amazon River.  This seminar will                   bring together Australian and U.S. oceanographers to discuss                    their current research.  The meeting is being co-organized by Dr.               Charles Nittrover of SUNY-Stonybrook and Dr. Gregg Brunskill of                 AIMS.                                                                                                                                                           The formal sessions will be devoted to delineating the                          similarities and differences between the two coastal systems. A                 further objective will be to evaluate observations and                          conclusions with regard to their generality for tropical                        settings.  Placing these two river systems in perspective will                  provide an understanding of other low latitude river systems.                   Participation of researchers from Papua New Guinea is also                      expected.",
