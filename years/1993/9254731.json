The dissemination effort, to be coordinated by the Independent                  Colleges office, includes the following activities:  A series of                regional colloquia, symposia, and workshops, and two national                   PKAL colloquia; Presentations at regional and national meeting os               disciplinary and educational associations; Implementation of a                  system of mentor/consultants available to assist institutions in                their reform efforts; Publication of meeting proceedings and                    major position papers on critical issues in the reform movement                 and Evaluation of the impact of reform efforts in undergraduate                 science and mathematics education.  Building the network and                    dissemination efforts will be strengthened significantly by                     utilizing an electronic network to be established on the                        Internet.  The electronic network will be used for                              communications, conferencing, and file exchange.",
