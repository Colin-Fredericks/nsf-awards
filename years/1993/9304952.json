 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to 1) determine earthquake paleoliquefaction                 features and landforms where they occur by means of remotely-                   sensed data, including LANDSAT Thematic Mapper and SPOT                         Panochromatic images, and 2) provide new information on the ages                and locations of past earthquake in the New Madrid seismic zone                 (NMSZ).  Focussing o known liquefaction features identified during              previous field work, the work will compare possible prehistoric                 sand blows to those that formed during the great 1811-12 New Madrid             earthquakes.  Radiation characteristics unique to the possible                  prehistoric features will be used to locate other possible                      prehistoric sand blows.  The results of this analysis will be                   verified by field investigation at selected sites.  This research               is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program              and is supported under the NSF Career Advancement Award program for             women.",
