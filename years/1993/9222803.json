 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nervous system is composed of numerous cell types.  The                     mechanisms that control development of the different cell types are             poorly understood.  It is clear that a complex array of signals                 sent between the developing cells are essential.  One type of                   signal is communicated through direct contact between the surface               protein that influences the final stages of maturation of one cell              type, the neuroglial cells.  The current project will examine in                more detail the role and mode of action of this protein in cultured             retinal cells.  Artificial genes will be constructed and introduced             into the retinal cells.  These artificial gene constructs will                  block normal expression of the protein in the retinal cells, thus               allowing the investigators to directly observe the role of this                 molecule in specific developmental events.  The protein being                   studied is one member of a large family of proteins, and one or                 more members of this family are present on most if not all cells of             the developing nervous system.  Insights gained as to the function              of one member of this protein family will supply a better                       understanding of mechanisms active in development of all nervous                system cells.***//",
