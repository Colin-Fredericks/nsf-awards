 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has long been a controversy over the impact of immigration                on the United States economy.  In the North the influx of                       migrants in the early 19th century created downward pressures on                urban wages, mitigated only by the frontier which provided a                    safety valve for the existing wage earners who moved there to                   escape the lack of opportunity in the coastal cities.  At the                   same time many immigrants moved directly to the less settled                    regions increasing national output.  For the South during the                   Antebellum period there is great controversy regarding the                      geographic and economic mobility of international immigrants.                   The purpose of this research is to analyze the internal migration               behavior of international immigration to New Orleans, the major                 port of entry in the South.  Migration behavior will be                         investigated by developing a sample of foreign passengers                       arriving at New Orleans in 1849 and tracing the location and                    economic fortunes of these passengers in 1850 and 1860 using the                manuscript census of population and indexes to those censuses.                  This research is important because it will shed light on the role               immigration played in the economic development of the United                    States.",
