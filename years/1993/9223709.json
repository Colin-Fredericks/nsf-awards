 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor James Mayer of the University of Washington will                      conduct basic research on oxo-organometallic chemistry with                     support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                    Program.  This will be a three-pronged effort towards                           discovering and developing reactions in which the metal-oxo                     functionality is involved in fundamental transformations of                     organic molecules.  Tungsten-phosphine compounds of the type                    WCl2(PR3)4 will be investigated in their oxygen-abstraction                     reactions with alcohols, trimethylsylyl ethers, and                             carboxylates.  Similar reactions involving sulfido and imido                    functionalities will also be studied.  In the second area of                    research, the chemistry of rhenium-oxo-acetylene compounds will                 be explored.  These reactions will include hydroxide to                         oxo-hydride migrations, and reductions and deprotonations.  The                 third area of research will examine                                             rhenium-oxo-tris(pyrazolyl)borate chemistry, specifically                       photochemical arene activation and migratory insertion of the                   oxo group into rhenium-alkyl bonds.  These studies will lead to                 a general broadening of knowledge in the area of                                oxo-organometallic chemistry, with potential applications to                    major industrial oxo-organic compounds.                                         %%%                                                                             The field of organometallic chemistry has seen great                            application in the chemistry of commercial organic compounds.                   This grant will support an extension of organometallic                          chemistry into the chemistry of organic compounds containing                    oxygen atoms, such as alcohols, ethers, and acids.  The                         controlled manipulation of the carbon-oxygen bonds is the                       objective of this research, which will exploit the highly                       versatile properties of compounds containing the metals                         tungsten and rhenium.",
