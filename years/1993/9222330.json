 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support for the study of                         selective binding of oxo metal cations by Dr. Kenneth N.                        Raymond of the Department of Chemistry, University of                           California, Berkeley.  Shape selective ligands for cations such                 as osmyl and vanadyl will be developed.  These ligands will be                  designed to stabilize the high oxidation state metal center                     through normal coordinate binding, while at the same time                       incorporating hydrogen bond donors for interaction with the oxo                 cation.  Preliminary results show that the hydrogen bonding                     interaction can be significant if carefully oriented, rigid                     ligands can be developed.  Ligands to be investigated include                   aminocarboxylates, catechol amides, catechol phenols and                        amidates.  The resulting compounds will be characterized by                     crystal structure analysis, vibrational spectroscopy,                           electrochemistry, and solution thermodynamics studies.  Both                    the specificity and complexing ability of the ligands will be                   tested.                                                                         %%%                                                                             The goal of this project is to develop effective and selective                  agents for scavenging metal oxo cations.  A new approach                        involving the positioning of hydrogen atoms on the complexing                   agent in such a way as to bind to the oxo group associated with                 the metal will be tried.  The research has implications for                     separation methodology, including that for members of the                       lanthanide and actinide families which are found in radioactive                 waste.",
