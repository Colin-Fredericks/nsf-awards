 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353077   Butts    Using systemic reform in mathematics and science education as the  catalyst, the Atlanta Public Schools propose to initiate a self-  study planning process that will examine all aspects of its public  school education system. The effort will build upon the strong  partnerships that currently exist between the school system, local  businesses, service organizations, institutions of higher learning  and the Mayor's Office. The focus of the self study will be to  identify structural changes needed to significantly improve the  delivery of mathematics and science instruction to all Atlanta  Public School students. The study will identify steps that need to  be taken to effect comprehensive and coordinated improvement in  student achievement.     Six task forces, comprised of representatives from key stakeholder  groups, will gather data for the self study. This data will serve  as the basis for developing a five to seven year plan for revamping  the system's overall instructional program to produce not only  improved mathematics and science achievement, but to better  integrate instruction among all core disciplines. Critical  information will be used to initiate comprehensive change in the  Atlanta Public School System's overall instructional program.   ***",
