 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore three general avenuew of research using               both polarized and unpolarized neutron scattering techniques.  The              first involves the magnetic ordering and spin fluctuations                      associated with copper and rare earth moments in the oxide                      superconductors.  the second concerns the superconducting aspects               of these systems, including the investigation of the nature of the              vortex state in these 'magnetic-superconductor' materials, as well              as the determination of the magnetic penetration depth in                       superconductors via polarized neutron reflectometry.  The third                 project deals with the spin dynamics of isotropic ferromagnets.                 Polarized beam techniques will be used to separate the longitudinal             and transverse spin dynamics of materials, such as Invar alloys                 where substantial discrepencies have been found between the                     magnetic excitation spectrum observed directly with neutrons and                the temperature dependence of the magnetization.  Investigation of              the longitudinal and transverse fluctuation spectra just below the              Curie temperature, and their behavior as a function of applied                  field will be undertaken.                                                       %%%                                                                             This project will explore three general avenues of materials                    research using neutron scattering techniques.  The first involves               the fundamental structural and magnetic properties of the cuprate               superconductors, in an effort to establish the origins of the                   superconducting state in these novel systems.  The second aspect                concerns the determination and understanding of the materials                   properties which control the superconducting parameters of central              importance to commercial applications, such as vortex pinning to                produce high critical current materials.  The final area deals with             the fundamental and practical properties of soft magnetic                       materials, which have commercial applications as transformer cores,             magnetic shielding, etc.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the             Invar class of soft magnets, as these are of technical importance               because their density does not change with temperature, in contrast             to most metals which expand upon heating.",
