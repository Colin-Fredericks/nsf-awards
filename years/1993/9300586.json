Eleven students, half of whom will                     be from predominantly minority institutions and half of whom                    will be from Cornell will be selected to participate. To aid                    students in understanding the connection between their                          research and real-life concerns of communities, student                         research projects will be identified, the results of which                      have important applications to solving environmental                            problems. Example research topics include Design of Optimal                     Composting Systems, Microbially-Mediated Destruction of CFCs                    in Anaerobic Environments, Long-term Change in a Deciduous                      Forest, and Genetic Variability in Small Isolated                               Populations. A one-week orientation and weekly group                            sessions will include discussions of the research process,                      how to ask insightful questions of research mentors, and the                    applications of scientific knowledge to solving problems in                     minority communities. Academic-year faculty advisors will                       visit the students on their research assignments and will                       assist the students in writing up their research for                            publication.",
