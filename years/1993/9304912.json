 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304912  Lagally    The proposed effort aims to combine scanning tunneling microscopy  (STM) with diffraction techniques to investigate diffusion,  interactions with steps, initial film formation, and a number of  other aspects of the kinetics and thermodynamics of film formation.   Measurements are planned both in real time and in a quench-and-look  mode.  Epitaxial, Stranski-Krastanov, and Volmer-Weber systems will  be investigated.  From a combination of theoretical and  experimental effort, quantitative values of energies, barriers, and  rates will be extracted.  Systems include Si, Ge, and a number of  metals on SI(001) substrates.  Stress effects will be investigated  using also Si whiskers as substrates.  Because in STM measurements  the electric field from the tip may influence rates of kinetic  mechanisms, a comprehensive investigation of this phenomenon will  be undertaken.  %%%  In this research diffraction methods and scanning tunneling  microscopy are used to investigate atomic scale mechanisms involved  in film growth.  These mechansisms all have some sort of  morphological or microstructural consequence.  An analysis of the  changing morphology can be interpreted in terms of the responsible  mechanisms.  There are in principle two ways of doing this: 1)  real-time measurements or 2) quench-and-look measurements.  In the  former, one attempts to follow the changing positions of atoms or  the shape and size of particular structures.  The latter is  effectively a series of snapshots of the morphologies that are  frozen in at different times.  The proposed work is important  because crystal growth is at the basis of all thin-film technology.  ***",
