 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  an Accomplishment-Based Renewal award to continue               research  on the role of hydrodynamical and biological  processes               during  settlement of infaunal invertebrates.  The ultimate  goal               of   the  research  is  to  determine  the  spatial  scales   and               hydrodynamical  and  biological conditions  for  which  substrate               selectivity  by  settling  larvae  account  for  observed   adult               patterns  of distribution.  The research addresses the  following               three  general  questions. 1) Where are competent larvae  located               within  the water column and what is their settlement rate  as  a               function  of  flow and sediment characteristics?   2)  Do  larvae               actively  select  preferred substrates  over  spatial  scales  of               meters in the laboratory and of 100's of meters to kilometers  in               the field?  3) How is sediment selection accomplished in flow  --               that   is,  are  there  specific  larval  behaviors  that  permit               exploitation   of  the  physical  regime  to  facilitate   active               selection  and are there physical conditions for which  selection               is  impossible?   Experiments to address these question  will  be               conducted  while  continuing  the  study  of  sediment  selection               capabilities of particular infaunal invertebrates as  a  function               of  life  history characteristics and habitat affinity of adults.               The intent is to iterate on generalizations regarding the role of               settlement in explaining mesoscale adult distributions through  a               combination  of  laboratory and field studies  on  a  variety  of               \"types\"   of   species   (e.g.,  in   terms   of   life   history               characteristics, taxonomic position and adult habitat affinity.",
