 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308452  Demski     Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide that was  isolated from brain in 1971.  This hormone is released from  neurons of the anterior basal forebrain which project through the  ventral hypothalamus to the median eminence and act upon the  pituitary to regulate the control of luteinizing hormone and  follicle stimulating hormones.  Thus, GnRH plays a pivotal role  in ovulation and testosterone production.  However, with the  development of sensitive and specific antibody techniques, it has  now become clear that GnRH neuronal network is a complex,  heterogenous system, comprising three or more discrete neuronal  groups and spanning vastly different regions of the brain.   Besides the hypothalamic area, the peptides are produced in cells  in the terminal nerve ganglia and the midbrain tegmentum near the  oculomotor complex.  Little is known of the physiological roles  that these two other neuronal systems may play.  Using state-of-  the-art neuroanatomical techniques, Dr. Demski and his  undergraduate students will map the functional connections of  GnRH system in these brain regions.   They will provide a  detailed anatomical examination of developing brains.  A special  retrograde neural tracer will be used to identify cellular  connections between GnRH-containing neurons and cerebral blood  vessels.  In addition, Dr. Demski will lesion the terminal nerve  at different stages of development and determine the effects on  the physiology and development of specific behaviors.   The  results should provide new insights into the organization,  function and mechanisms of action of the GnRH systems lying  outside the endocrine hypothalamus.  Moreover, many reproductive  dysfunctions in humans result from a disorder in the GnRH system.   For example, Kallman's Syndrome, a congenital disorder  characterized by sterility and anosmia, is caused by a defect in  the migration of GnRH neurons and hypogonadism, characterized by  delayed puberty and sterility, results from Gn RH deficiency.   Fundamental information gained from this work may help facilitate  the development of effective treatments for patients suffering  from GnRH dysfunctions.    ***",
