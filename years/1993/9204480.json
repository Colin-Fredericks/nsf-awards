 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of mesoscopic physics has had significant progress during             the past few years.  The theoretical progress has been driven by                the statistical approach to sample fluctuations in the ensemble of              small disordered systems.  As the sizes of the systems are made                 smaller and smaller, eventually they approach the electron mean                 free path.  Then the motion of an electron becomes ballistic.  On               the other hand, due to the complex geometry, this motion can still              be chaotic.  Such a system is similar in many respects to other                 systems (atomic or nuclear) which display quantum chaos.  For                   analytical calculations disordered systems turn out to be simpler               than chaotic ballistic ones because of the additional ensemble                  averaging.  The idea of this research is to use disordered systems              as a laboratory for the investigation of quantum chaos.  In a                   diffusive regime we plan to derive relations and develop analytical             methods which can be extended to general cases.  Theoretical                    studies will also be carried out on problems of persistent currents             in isolated rings and the magnetic susceptibility of isolated                   metallic grains - problems closely connected to quantum chaos.  We              will take into account interactions between electrons since                     existing one-electron theories are in substantial disagreement with             experiment.                                                                     %%%                                                                             The field of mesoscopic physics is a very current one which deals               with basic problems in fundamental physics and yet has important                ramifications for microelectronics.  The present research will                  theoretically deal with a number of problems in mesoscopic physics.             In particular, the research will study the onset of quantum chaos               in these systems.  Clearly, besides its fundamental importance, the             conditions under which a microelectronic system becomes chaotic, or             unstable, is of interest to the computer and communications                     industry.",
