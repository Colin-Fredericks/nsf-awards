 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is upgrading an existing one-semester Modern                       Physics Laboratory into a two-semester Junior Physics                           Laboratory through the development of new experiments in laser                  spectroscopy and modern optics.Physics majors at Trinity                        receive an excellent introduction to experimental physics.  We                  have established a first-rate lower-division laboratory                         sequence, including an exceptional program on the use of                        computers in physics.  However, we are convinced that students                  at Trinity and many of its peer institutions do not obtain                      sufficient experience with the advanced experimental techniques                 employed in today's research laboratories.  We are therefore                    introducing revisions in our curriculum, including a required                   Senior Thesis research project, to bring students much closer                   to the research capabilities of contemporary physics.  By                       placing a very high priority on modern experimental techniques,                 we intend to attract a much larger number of talented majors                    interested in careers in advanced physics research, and to                      prepare these majors for study in highly competitive graduate                   programs.The laboratory improvements defined in this proposal                   is providing the capstone of our new emphasis on contemporary                   experimental methods.  We are taking advantage of the wide                      range of advanced experimental topics that can be investigated                  using moderate-cost lasers, and the high level of student                       interest in laser-based experiments.  A nitrogen-pumped dye-                    laser system, a Fabry-Perot spectrometer, and Macintosh                         computer systems are the major apparatus that have been                         purchased for the experiments. These equipment items are quite                  versatile; most are being used in more than one investigation.                  The laser-based experiments proposed here can thus serve as                     models for the next generation of upper-division physics                        laboratories.",
