 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the question of whether the ability                of a plant to develop leaves with different morphology and                      physiology in response to different growth temperatures promotes                survival and/or increased seed production.  I will conduct                      experiments under natural conditions and in controlled                          environments to compare the anatomy, morphology, and physiology                 of leaves that develop at different temperatures.  I will then                  determine whether plants that are better at changing leaf                       characteristics in response to temperature changes survive better               and/or produce more seeds.  The extent to which the ability to                  change leaf characteristics in response to temperature is a                     genetically determined trait that can be inherited will also be                 determined.                                                                          The results of this research will contribute to our basic                  understanding of how  organisms respond to changes in their                     environment.  This understanding, in turn, may help in predicting               the effects of natural disturbances and human impacts on the                    environment on plants and animals.",
