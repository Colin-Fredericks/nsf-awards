In February and March 1993, the Jason Project will sponsor a major              expedition to the Guaymas Basin in the Pacific.  An advanced ROV                system will be used to take high quality video images from the                  seafloor and relay them to the surface support ship, thence via                 satellite to select sites across the U.S. where scientists and                  students will be able to operate certain functions of the ROV while             it's on the bottom.  Two NSF-funded investigators will participate.             The high quality video capabilities will augment the collection of              data for their NSF research, but the collection of discrete                     biological samples in addition to the video will greatly enhance                it.  A conceptual design for a new deep-sea suction sampler for use             on the Jason ROV has been completed and preliminary tests have been             made.  This SGER funding will allow the construction and testing of             a full prototype sampler in time for use during the Jason Project               expedition.  If scientifically successful during the Jason                      expedition, the sampler will be useful on upcoming NSF-sponsored                cruises.",
