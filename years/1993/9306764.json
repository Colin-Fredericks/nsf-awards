 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is centered on studies of soil microorganisms growing              at relatively low temperatures (five degrees centigrade).  The                  properties of the enzyme betagalactosidase are being studied in                 these organism in order to understand how protein structure                     dictates the temperature optimum of an enzyme's activity.  The                  genes encoding these activities are being cloned from Arthrobacter              strains and compared with information found for other                           microorganisms with higher growth temperatures.  Creative selection             procedures are also being developed to isolate microorganisms with              other novel betagalactosidases.                                                 %%%                                                                             The dominant environment of the earth and its oceans is below                   twenty degrees centigrade, and there is a rich source of diverse                microorganisms which have evolved to grow in the cold.  Enzymes                 active at low temperatures could be used in food processing,                    bioremediation, and molecular biology.",
