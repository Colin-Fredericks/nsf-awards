 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue to study several topics in set                  theory, primarily concerning the core model and its applications.               The most important aim of this research will be to extend core                  model theory so that one can prove the existence of a core model                in the presence of a Woodin cardinal.  The probable structure of                this core model is already known; the main problem seems to be to               develop techniques which can be used to prove an extender is a                  member of the core model.  Other areas of study concern                         applications of the core model under the assumption that there is               no model with a Woodin cardinal. These potential applications                   include questions related to absoluteness, to the singular                      cardinal hypothesis, and to Jonson and Ramsey cardinals.                             The ultimate aim of this research is to chararcterize the                  structure of well-founded models of set theory.  As their name                  suggests, the 'core' of a universe of set theory, if it exists,                 provides a skeleton with a relatively well-defined structure and                thus gives a good deal of information about the form of the full                model.  Since set theory lies at the very foundation of                         mathematics, this enterprise has important consequences for the                 soundness of many accepted mathematical practices, although it is               customary for most working mathematicians to take this on faith.",
