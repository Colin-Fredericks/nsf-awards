Large programs confound any attempt at hand analysis, so  research has focused on tools that analyze programs  automatically. Broadly speaking, two kinds of tools have  been proposed: knowledge-based tools that can associate  properties of program components with notions from the  problem domain, and compilerlike tools that determine  relationships among components by calculating dependencies,  slices, module hierarchies, etc.    Each approach has disadvantages.  The knowledge-based tools,  because they only associate problem domain notions with  components informally, cannot provide rigorous analysis;  answers to queries tend to be more like hints than sound  inferences. The compiler-like tools are confined to low-  level analysis of the code, so the queries, and their  responses, must be formulated in terms of code constructs  alone.    This work combines some of the advantages of both  approaches. The key idea is contextual abstraction.  The  user specifies an abstraction relationship between program  components and problem domain notions.  A variety of  analyses then becomes possible by interpreting properties of  the code in problem domain terms.  And because the  abstraction relationship is formal, the analyses are  rigorous and can include, for example, partial verification.  ***",
