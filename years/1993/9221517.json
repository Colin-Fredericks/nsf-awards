 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing buildings which do not satisfy modern seismic                          design requirements may be strengthened by the addition of                      steel bracing or reinforced concrete shear walls.  This                         strengthening, however, can transfer more loads to the                          foundation.  This research will examine the seismic                             vulnerability of such structure-foundation systems.  The                        study will review the major methods of strengthening and                        rehabilitating buildings for seismic loading.  The demands                      of these rehabilitation methods on the foundation will be                       evaluated and typical deficiencies of commonly used                             foundation systems will be ascertained.  A range of                             foundation rehabilitation schemes including:  a) use of                         additional piles, b) provision of an additional footing                         around the perimeter of the building, c) reinforcement of                       existing footings and pile caps with additional concrete and                    steel, and d) improvement of structure-foundation                               connections will be considered.   The improved connections                      may include mechanisms for safely transmitting short                            duration overloads to the soil or may allow temporary                           separation of parts of the structure from the foundation to                     prevent damage to critical elements.  The study will involve                    analyses of a variety of structures and broad categories of                     foundation systems and soils.  Several earthquake induced                       acceleration records will be used as base excitations for                       analysis and evaluation.  The analytical studies will be                        correlated with past performance of buildings and                               foundations during earthquakes.  The emphasis will be on                        developing guidelines and recommendations for selecting the                     foundation rehabilitation techniques for buildings of                           intermediate height (approximately 4 to 20 stories).  The                       results will be summarized in a final report and                                professional publications.",
