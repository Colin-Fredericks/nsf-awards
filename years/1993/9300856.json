 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300856  Siscoe  This is a proposal to the NSF's GEM program.  The GEM program's  ultimate goal is to create a Geospace General Circulation Model  (GGCM).  A GGCM is a model that simulates the behavior of Earth's  magnetosphere like general circulation models (GCMs) simulate the  behavior of Earth's atmosphere.  As GCMs are the most advanced and  powerful computer codes designed to study global atmospheric  weather and climate, so a GGCM will be the most advanced and  powerful computer code to study global magnetospheric processes,  which might also be described as weather and climate.  The GEM  program uses a series of multi-year, foucused campaigns to provide  the information needed to assemble a GGCM.  But the assembly itself  becomes a topic of focus very late in the program.  The point of  this proposal is to begin the organization, planning, and research  leading to a GGCM now.  The total GGCM assembly effort at this time  can be relatively small, but its effect in terms of guiding the  major ongoing campaigns toward GEM's ultimate goal can be great.    The PI proposes to assume responsibility for that part of the GEM  program that is directly involved with assembling a GGCM out of GEM  campaign products.  He proposed to organize a GGCM Working Group  (GGCM-WG), to coordinate its activities, and to manage GEM's GGCM  Assembly Project (GGCM-AP).  He will thus function as the GGCM-AP  leader.  As such, he will coordinate the activities of the GGCM-WG  through arranging its meeting and setting its agendas (by  consensus) according to a regular calendar.  The PI will schedule  ad hoc meetings of GGCM-WG subgroups tasked with specific GGCM-WG  projects.  The PI will manage the GGCM Assembly Project by  conducting, through the GGCM-WG, a review of GGCM types and  prospects, followed by devising, with the GGCM-WG, a Project Plan,  followed by focusing the attention of the WG on the steps called  for in the Plan through the course of the Project.  This means  keeping the total Project in mind, und erstanding how the steps in  the Plan relate to the Project, and executing the steps.  In  practice, one executes the steps by selecting agenda topics, by  pacing the meetings, by working through e-mail between meetings,  and by taking on some GGCM-WG tasks.  Among the tasks are research  problems specifically related to the GGCM Assembly Project.  As the  PI's initial share of these, he proposes to work on two specific  problems:  one an interface problem between two essential modules  in a modularized GGCM, and one a system integration problem  involving the cooperative interaction of several modules.  ***",
