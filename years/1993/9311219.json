 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311219  Goldstein  The tradition of the \"amateur\" scientist has played a major role in  the history of science in the United States.  Famous \"amateurs\"  included founding fathers such as Benjamin Franklin (who presented  a major theory of electricity) and Thomas Jefferson.  These  traditions continue to the present day though most of contemporary  science is now done by \"professionals.\"  Dr. Goldstein is examining  the history of \"rank and file\" scientists and their characteristic  institutions, the state and local academies of science.  He argues  that the trend toward professionalization of the sciences which  other historians have documented as part of the coming of age of  science in America was complemented by the expansion of non-  professional science at the local level.  \"Grass-roots\" naturalists  engaged in research that was important to professional scientists  but which was shaped by local or regional concerns that were  independent of and occasionally conflicted with the goals of the  scientific elite.  Nevertheless, Dr. Goldstein has found that the  relations between \"professional\" and \"amateur\" scientists were  characterized by cooperation and interdependence rather than the   hostility that some historians have postulated.    Dr. Goldstein's research is organized around the membership and  activities of local academies of science.  He analyzes grass-roots  naturalists in terms of their significance in the rapidly changing  scientific community and also in the context of local society and  culture.  He explains how these local scientists responded to  changes in the structure and methodologies of the natural sciences-  -especially the professionalization of science and the rise of the  research universities in the 20th century.  Even after the  professionalization of science, these local academies continued to  survive by meeting local needs, remaining active in natural history  research and participating in the emerging conservation movement.   The sources for this research inclu de scientific texts, published  and manuscript proceedings of academy meetings, several  representative samples of various segments of the scientific  community, and private correspondence.  He is paying particular  attention to issues of gender and regionalism in his analysis.  ***",
