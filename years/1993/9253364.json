 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to produce a one hour television                     documentary and a series of video teaching modules which explore                a wide range of scientific disciplines in an exciting manner by                 presenting the story of how these disciplines are used in the                   preparation and racing of an Indianapolis race car.  This                       program will be distributed to a wide audience through its                      broadcast by PBS and cable sports networks; through                             dissemination to classrooms and museums nationwide; and through                 distribution via agencies that focus on bringing educational                    programs to youth and minorities across the country.  We expect                 to attract a new audience to science, the millions of Americans                 who are infatuated by automobiles.  This is an audience that                    cuts across age, ethnic and racial distinctions in America                      today.  This exciting story of applied science should also                      appeal to American youth in a way that more traditional science                 stories do not.                                                                                                                                                 The major scientific disciplines involved in the project are:                   basic engineering, mathematics and physics, aerodynamics,                       materials science, mechanics, telemetry and computer aided                      design.                                                                                                                                                         This project is submitted to the Informal Science Education                     Program.                                                                                                                                                        The specific content of this project will be aimed at an                        audience with little background in science.  High-school                        students and adults should be able to understand all the                        principles presented.  Younger audiences will gain insight into                 how a knowledge of science is fundamental to a sport that many                  of them find fascinating.",
