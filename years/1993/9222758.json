 "awd_abstract_narration": "Government officials commonly face the difficult problem of                     having to make important policy decisions in the absence of                     perfect information about the ultimate impact of their decisions.               Often, those affected most directly by government policy have                   better information than the government about the likely impact of               policy decisions.  However, those affected by public policy are                 often reluctant to share their superior information with the                    government, because doing so can jeopardize their financial                     interests.  The purpose of this research is to examine the                      optimal design of public policy in such settings, and to analyze                how government policy makers can best elicit and employ superior                information held by individuals and firms who will be affected by               government policy.                                                                                                                                              A number of specific settings will be examined.  First, the                     question of whether and how the government should identify and                  provide special treatment or protection for particular domestic                 industries in order to improve their international                              competitiveness will be explored.  Second, the optimal design of                government policy to enhance environmental quality will be                      examined.  The proper use of tradeable resource rights will                     receive special attention.  Third, optimal regulatory policy for                public utilities will be investigated.  Fourth, alternatives to                 traditional regulatory policy will be analyzed.",
