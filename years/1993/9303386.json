 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rieffel will continue his investigation of C*-algebraic                    quantization.  Topics to be studied include quantization and                    quantum groups, aspects of quantum topology and differential                    geometry, and harmonic analysis on Lie groups.  Attention will also             be given to relationships with applications in such areas as                    quantum mechanics and field theory, and signal processing and                   pattern recognition.                                                                 The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                 being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
