The  Center was established (1) to develop areas of research that will  contribute to solve the pipeline problem of minority access to  careers in science, and (2) to exploit and study the unique  tropical advantages available within Puerto Rico.  The objectives  of the Center are:  (1) to develop a research infrastructure to  promote collaboration between the strongest research groups on the  island, (2) to compete for funding from major funding sources, (3)  to strengthen the instrumentation base, (4) to promote  collaborations with other research entities on a national and  international level, (5) to provide collaborative research  opportunities for researchers at 4-year institutions, (6) to  provide educational improvement activities for faculty and  graduate, undergraduate and precollege students, and (7) to  contribute to the strengthening of a competitive research  environment in Puerto Rico.    The Center of Excellence for Tropical and Caribbean Research was  established in 1988 with funding from the National Science  Foundation under the Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE)  Program.  The Center of Excellence meets the goals of the MRCE  Program especially (1) to increase the minority presence in science  and engineering by making substantial resources available to  upgrade the research capabilities of strong and productive minority  institutions, (2) to allow the institution to continue use of  research as a tool to increase the effectiveness of related science  and engineering activities for minority groups in its region, (3)  to provide opportunities for minority faculty and students at  the University of Puerto Rico, and (4) to engage in meritorious  research that leads to publications in refereed journals.  ***",
