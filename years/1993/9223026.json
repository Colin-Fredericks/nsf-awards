The general use of four recently prepared                           fluorinated synthetic units will be investigated to determine                   their scope and applicability in the synthesis of fluorinated                   materials, including fluorinated nucleosides, fluorinated                       butenolides and furans, and fluorinated analogs of natural                      products. The synthesis of two new fluorinated units will be                    carried out: a chiral 1,3-oxazoline will be prepared for use in                 the synthesis of chiral 2-fluorocarboxylic acids, and two                       isomers of the 2-fluoromuconate system will be prepared for use                 in the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction.                            %%%                                                                             With this Renewal award, the Synthetic Organic Program is                       supporting the research of Dr. Timothy B. Patrick of the                        Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University at                      Edwardsville. Professor Patrick will focus his work on the                      development of new methodology for the synthesis of moderately                  complex monofluorinated organic compounds which are useful                      probes of chemical and biological properties.",
