 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Norman Allinger is supported by a grant from the                      Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue in                  his development of the MM3 empirical molecular mechanics force                  field.  This force field is parameterized on the basis of                       experimental data in the form of structures, vibrational                        frequencies, thermodynamic heats of formation, and when                         necessary supplemented with ab initio molecular orbital                         calculations.  The MM3 force field is widely used to perform                    molecular simulations of organic compounds including                            macromolecular species.  In this grant period, Professor                        Allinger will address a number of specific anomalies between                    current MM3 predictions and experimental observation which                      require special parameterization of the MM3 force field.  These                 anomalies include: the anomeric effect, the Bohlmann effect,                    and the electronegativity effect on bond shorthening.                           %%%                                                                             Molecular structure and thermodynamic properties including the                  relative energies of different conformations are frequently                     related to the overal physical properties of organic compounds.                 Chemists are constantly seeking links between molecular                         structure and physical properties which will assist them in                     directed synthesis of chemical species with desired physical                    properties and chemical activities.  Computer models of                         molecular structure have recently become a very important tool                  in the quantitative prediction of structure and properties.                     Although the more sophisticated molecular orbital theory is the                 preferred technique for smaller molecules, empirical models                     such as MM3 are absolutely necessary for most larger molecules                  which are of interest to academic and industrial organic                        chemists.  Allinger's MM3 force field is one of the most widely                 accepted empirical force fields which is used for this purpose.",
