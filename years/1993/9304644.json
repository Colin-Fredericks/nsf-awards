 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban planning has come under attack recently for failing to               improve urban society.  Although many facets of American cities                 now appear to be in worse condition than they were 30 or 40 years               ago when urban planning was actively embraced by most                           municipalities, it is not certain what impacts planning had on                  the shaping of urban society, which planning techniques worked                  and which failed, and the extent to which mistakes from the past                are being repeated today.  This doctoral dissertation project                   will systematically evaluate records from and contemporary                      patterns in dozens of American cities, many of which formulated                 Section 701 comprehensive plans from the late 1950s through the                 1970s.  Focusing on the distribution of parks and recreational                  facilities, this project will use accessibility measures to                     compare the planned locations of these facilities with the actual               geographic distributions that subsequently emerged.  Through                    analyses of these measures, the degree to which comprehensive                   plans helped ensure more equitable distributions of park and                    recreation facilities in cities will be assessed.                                    This project will provide solid empirical analyses of the                  influence of comprehensive planning on the locational                           distribution of urban services for a diverse range of cities.  In               addition to evaluating the success of comprehensive planning in                 meeting one of its goals, this project will provide valuable                    insights into the factors that contributed to the success and                   failure of planning efforts, and it will help assess the degree                 to which planners have learned from their past experiences.  As a               doctoral dissertation improvement award, this award also will                   provide support to enable a promising student to establish a                    strong independent research career.",
