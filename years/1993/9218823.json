 "awd_abstract_narration": "9218823  Gundersen    Recent reports describing in vivo phosphorylation of the guanine  nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) alpha subunits,  G alpha-i in hepatocytes, G alpha-z in platelets, and G alpha-2 in  Dictyostelium suggest that alpha subunit phosphorylation is an  important mechanism of G protein function.  The significance of  alpha subunit phosphorylation however remains unknown.   Dictyostelium offers a powerful system for analyzing this question  through the use of molecular biology and biochemical methodologies.   The goal of this research is to examine the role of G alpha-2  phosphorylation in Dictyostelium.  The site(s) of phosphorylation,  which occurs on serine in G alpha-2. will be identified using  peptide mapping, alpha subunit chimeral, and site-directed  mutagenesis.  The function of G alpha-2 phosphorylation will be  determined by transforming G alpha-2 sequences that can not be  phosphorylated into a cell line lacking the G alpha-2 gene.   Chemotaxis and differentiation in the transformants will be  compared to wild-type.  The G alpha-2 effectors adenylyl cyclase,  guanylyl cyclase and phospholipase C will be assayed to identify  changes resulting from the loss of G alpha-2 phosphorylation.   Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated G alpha-2 will be purified to  compare GTP binding affinity and GTPase.  Purified G alpha-2 will  also be used to produce a polyclonal antiserum.  The kinase that  phosphorylates G alpha-2 will be characterized by developing an in  vitro assay and purified using standard chromatographic approaches.   %%%  Guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) play an  essential role in the signal transducing pathways of numerous  extracellular stimuli which include hormones, neurotransmitters,  growth factors, odorants, and light.  Recent research has  identified a number of stimulus-response pathways in which G  proteins play a role, and a number of types of G protein subunits  have been identified.  Thus, the system for signal  transduction in  cells is very complex.  In fact, most stimuli probably do not  activate a single biochemical response pathway, but instead  activate a network of response pathways.  A key question is, how to  cells coordinate and regulate these diverse networks of responses  to come out with an appropriate response to an environmental or  internal stimulus?  G proteins play a key role in signal  transduction pathways and are likely to be important sites for  modulation.  The goal of this research is to understand the  mechanisms that modify G proteins by covalent attachment of  phosphate groups (phosphorylation) under some physiological  conditions.  The system to be used is the slime mold,  Dictyostelium.  This relatively simple organism offers important  experimental advantages for these studies.  The results of this  research should provide important new insights into the molecular  mechanisms that regulate the responses of cells to environmental  and internal signals.  ***",
