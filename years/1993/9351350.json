The new curriculum offers                   students a coherent, project oriented laboratory experience                     that allows them to participate in the selection and design of                  experiments. The laboratory curriculum is engaging students in                  the scientific process and thereby is facilitating the                          development of the reflective judgment and problem solving                      skills relied upon by scientists.  The students are being                       acquainted with the techniques of molecular biology and                         biochemistry most commonly used to address research questions.                  In the Molecular Biology course, both molecular cloning and                     polymerase chain reaction techniques are being introduced, and                  students then are applying these techniques, using the DNA                      thermocycler, and exploring a question of interest.  In the                     Biochemistry course, protein purification is being approached                   by using recombinant DNA technology rather than by relying upon                 classical tools. The Biochemistry course also is using high                     performance liquid chromatography to effect difficult                           separations of biomolecules.",
