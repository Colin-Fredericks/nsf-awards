 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354116  Buller    Although relatively slow to start, Native American  telecommunications has in recent years begun to flourish and  diversify.  By Native American telecommunications, we refer to the  use of computing and telecommunications technologies by Indian  people for any purpose related to education in the broadest sense  of the term, including the cultural, legal and educational  framework within which these technologies are employed.    There exist numerous independent, autonomous efforts by Native  Americans and others working with them to design and implement  telecommunications systems.  Disregarding for a moment the relative  merits of these efforts, and the cultural and social barriers to  their success, the fact remains that most of these projects are  being carried out in isolation and therefore their creators are not  taking full advantage of the power of integrative technologies.    This is unfortunate because some of this integration will be very  difficult to achieve later or done so only at comparatively great  expense and labor.  In addition, the opportunity is lost for  creative and culturally significant collaborative efforts, ones  which could promote telecommunications technologies as positive  forces with Native American culture.  Finally, in a time of more  restrictive national funding, cooperation rather than competition  will be viewed positively by political leaders.    To bridge some of these problems and draw attention to the  potential power resulting from the combination of collaboration and  technology, we propose to hold a two-day forum on Native American  telecommunications.  Forum participants would include recognized  leaders in Native American telecommunications and selected others  from the public and private sectors.  The forum would be small, on  the order of 25-30, and consist of both informational presentations  and small group sessions in which Native communities will share and  hopefully create technological partnerships which reflect the  soverei gnty of the tribes and other Indian bodies.",
