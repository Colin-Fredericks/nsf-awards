 "awd_abstract_narration": "9203842  Glasner       Propagation methods for the Schrodinger equation in quantum  mechanics, the Fresnel equation in guided-wave optics or the  paraxial equation in acoustics have been based on the  approximation of the exponential of the sum of two non-commuting  operators.  Recently a number of researchers have introduced a  variety of high order splittings of the exponential into products  of exponentials, leading to high order FFT based methods.  The  investigator and collaborators have established that the  exponentials can be replaced by Pade approximants  yielding finite-difference or finite-element methods and also  that high order splittings are possible in the time-dependent  case.  The first part of this proposal is to extend the  applicability of these methods.  The investigator and  collaborators have introduced Lanczos reduction techniques for  approximating the reflection coefficient associated with the  planar interface of two inhomogeneous refractive index media.   The second part of this proposal is to develop accurate and rapid  high order wide-angle approximations to the Helmholtz equation  base on Lanczos reduction, making it feasible to model highly  divergent beams in components such as reflectors and microprisms.   The investigator is also examining the possibility of using  propagation techniques to accurately generate soliton solutions  to a variety of nonlinear Schrodinger equations.       The investigator has, in collaboration with  electrical engineers, developed techniques for mathematically  modeling the propagation of light through electro-optical  devices, such as waveguides, filters, gratings, corner  reflectors, switches and modulators.  The ability to use  computers to simulate light passing through devices reduces the  time and cost involved in designing new devices by cutting the  number of actual physical models that are needed in the process.   The results of these collaborations are already in use at a  variety of research and development centers, inclu ding Hughes  Aircraft, Corning Glass, AMOCO Technology Center, Bell Northern  Research, NIST.  The range of applicability of the modeling  techniques and their efficiency must keep pace with the constant  introduction of new materials and the down-sizing of components.   It is anticipated that the proposed research will provide some of  these improved modeling techniques and thereby will have an  economic and strategic impact on technologies based on these  devices, including optical communications.  The research should  also affect other fields that deal with wave phenomena,  for example acoustics, seismology, quantum chemistry and physics.  ***",
