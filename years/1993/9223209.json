 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223209  Huebert         This project includes the study of the nitrogen and sulfur  cycles in the troposphere, as a way of understanding the impact of  nutrients and aerosols on climate.  This work can be divided into  three general areas:    (1) The ASTEX/MAGE field program has just been completed.  The PIs  group collected a month's worth of filter, impactor, and denuder  samples from three platforms:  the R/V Oceanus, Santa Maria Island,  and the NCAR Electra.  The sulfate and MSA measurements are  critical to valuating the marine sulfur budget, whose evolution was  studied during two Lagrangian experiments.  This proposal will  analyze the samples collected, interpret the data, test a large  number of hypotheses (related to aerosols, cloud, and climate), and  organize workshops and joint publications among the ASTEX/MAGE PIs.   The goal for this ASTEX/MAGE data is to understand the marine  aerosol production and removal systems well enough to include them  in predictive models of marine aerosols, CCN, clouds, atmospheric  radiative properties, and climate.    (2)  This proposal will continue a series of nitric acid  measurements at Mauna Loa.  The suggestion in data of a multi-year  cycle in nitric acid implies that the delivery of new fixed  nitrogen to the remote oceans may depend on long-term  climatological changes in precipitation and transport patterns.   The PIs long-term aerososl record will also help in understanding  the global impact of Pinatubo-derived sulfate aerosol.    (3) This proposal will continue an active role in IGAC activities,  including the planning and execution of a major international  southern-hemisphere aerosol experiment in 1994 or 1995.  ***",
