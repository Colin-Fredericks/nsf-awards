 "awd_abstract_narration": "In tropical forests, most colonization of small disturbed                  areas (e.g., treefall gaps) is from dormant seeds deposited by                  animals in intact forest some time before the disturbance                       occurs.  Such seeds become incorporated into the soil, and                      germinate in response to a later disturbance.  These \"soil seed                 banks\" have profound consequences for such \"pioneer\" plants and                 the communities in which they occur.  Species composition in                    regenerating patches is largely determined by the composition of                the seed bank at the time of disturbance, for example.                          Nevertheless, virtually nothing is known about the dynamics of                  seed banks, especially rates of seed removal by predators and                   pathogens, physiologically-imposed limits to longevity, etc..                   This study will make use of carefully replicated experiments to                 measure rates of seed arrival, transition from litter to soil,                  and removal in order to understand the dynamics of soil seed                    banks in detail.  I will then examine the consequences of seed                  demography for community structure in regenerating forest                       patches, as well as for the evolution of ripening phenologies and               plant-disperser relationships.  The data gathered in this project               is basic to understanding  natural forest regeneration , and to                 efforts to preserve or restore species-rich tropical forests.",
