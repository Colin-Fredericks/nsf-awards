As a holoenzyme, polIII hydrolyzes ATP to bind tightly  to DNA enabling highly processive DNA synthesis.  The holoenzyme  can be dissociated into subassemblies:  the 3-subunit core  polymerase  @ subunit (polymerase), @subunit (3'-5' exonuclease)  and 0 subunit , the 5-subunit y complex (y@@xy subunits); the B  subunit and the t subunit.  The function of the y complex is to  couple ATP to deliver the B subunit to DNA.  The B subunit is a  dimer shaped like a ring (X-ray analysis) and completely encircles  DNA.  The B ring then binds the core polymerase acting to tether it  to DNA for highly processive synthesis.  The t subunit dimer binds  two core polymerases together, presumably for simultaneous  synthesis of both leading and lagging strands of the duplex  chromosome.  Synthesis of the lagging strand is discontinuous,  being composed of approximately 300 fragments (Okazaki fragments).   Hence, each time polIII on the lagging strand completes an Okazaki  fragment it must be capable of rapidly recycling itself from the  end of the fragment to initiate synthesis of new fragment.   However, the polIII is bound to DNA so tightly by the B subunit  ring that it remains tightly bound to a completed product DNA  rather than cycling to new primed templates.  We have recently  discovered a mechanism whereby polIII rapidly cycles to new DNA  templates.  The mechanism entails a novel disaggregation of the  polIII structure followed by reassembly in which the polIII  disengages its B ring specifically upon completing the replication  of a DNA template and then it reassembles with a B ring on a new  DNA molecule.  This proposal aims to discover the detailed  molecular basis behind this polymerase transfer event.  New  reagents and technology important to the proposed work include  large amounts of pure preparations of each of the 10 subunits of  polIII an d the ability to reconstitute the entire holoenzyme from  these individual proteins.  Hence we propose to perform a series of  subunit omission studies to determine which subunits are  responsible for disengaging the B ring from polIII and which are  needed to transfer the polymerase to the next B ring on another DNA  molecule.  We will also investigate how the B rings that are left  on DNA as the polymerase cycles to multiple templates, are  themselves removed from the DNA for eventual reutilization.  Then  we will develop a replication fork system to investigate which  subunits of polIII are needed for efficient interaction with the  helicase and primase during ongoing synthesis of both strands of  duplex DNA.  %%%  The genetic material is in the form of two long interwound strands  of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.  These two DNA strands contain  the information needed to instruct the cell how to live (eg. eat  and divide) and therefore they must be duplicated prior to cell  division such that each new cell receives a copy of these  instructions.  This process of DNA duplication is called  \"replication\" and it is performed in a series of complicated steps  many of which have yet to be precisely defined.  Each step is  performed by a different protein molecule and therefore several  \"replication proteins\" are needed to duplicate DNA.  These several  replication proteins assemble together to form a multiprotein  complex in which each protein occupies a distinct position where it  can carry out its individual function in the overall process.  The  multiprotein complex is analogous to a machine in which each gear  performs a function, except here the gears are proteins and each  protein performs a function.  Recently this laboratory showed that  one of the gears of this \"replication machine\" of the bacterium,  Escherichia coli, is a protein shaped like a washer (ie. a ring)  and completely encircles the strands of DNA for the purpose of  tethering the replication machine down to DNA so it can eff iciently  perform its function.  Each of the replication proteins for this  bacterium are now available in separate test tubes and we have  learned how to assemble the machine from these separate gears.   With these individual protein reagents and the knowledge of how  they assemble into a machine, this proposal aims to determine what  the function is of other individual proteins, or gears, of this  replication machine as it duplicates the two strands of DNA.  ***",
