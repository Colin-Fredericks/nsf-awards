This course - essentially a materials-                   science course on the fabrication, examination, conservation                    and authentication ar artifacts - is an effective and                           attractive way of teaching science to non-scientists. At                        present two factors limit the course at Brandeis and its                        adaptation elsewhere, the lack of a suitable text and the                       difficulty of obtaining the necessary scientific data in a                      suitable form for teaching (e.g. the scientific data for                        assessing the restoration of the Sistine Chapel ceiling).  The                  proposal has four components: (i) to develop a scientific text,                 limited to relevant topics but treated nevertheless in some                     depth, (ii) to develop, as a pilot project, a teaching                          laserdisc holding all the scientific and conservation data                      needed to investigate a famous and problematic artwork The                      Feast of the Gods (we propose doing this in collaboration with                  the National Gallery of Art in Washington), (iii) the further                   development of the successful laboratory component of the                       course, by introducing chemical microscopy for pigment and                      fiber characterization, and (iv) the external evaluation of the                 educational effectiveness of the materials developed, by means                  of formative evaluation. The primary focus of the proposal is                   to promote the chemistry of art as a successful and appealing                   science course for non-scientists; and this may be achieved                     through the ready availability of a text, of visual material                    stored on laserdisc and of laboratory experiments developed for                 the purpose.***//",
