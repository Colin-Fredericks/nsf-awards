Our                                                                                                                                                                               previous work has shown these complex microbial communities to be                                                                                                                                                                               sites of significantly elevated microbial activity, including                   nutrient decomposition and cycling.                                                  One of the most persistent problems in microbial ecology has                                                                                                                                                                               been the gap between physiological traits observed in pure                      cultures and  observed or hypothesized activities in nature.                    Using ectomycorrhizal mat communities as discrete experimental                  systems, this research will attempt to define the specific role                                                                                                 of these ecologically important fungi in the EcM fungus-host tree                                                                                                                                                                               symbiosis through their capacity to exploit environmentally                     significant nitrogen and phosphorus resources in decaying soil                  organic matter.  The specific objectives of this research are to:                                                                                                                                                                               1) assess the ability of mat-forming EcM fungi to process soil                  organic matter by changes in substrate nitrogen and phosphorous                                                                                                 chemistry and the production of extracellular enzymes,                          2) determine how EcM fungi dissociate reactive polyphenol-protein                                                                                                                                                                               complexes using extracellular enzymes, siderophores or                          biosurfactants as possible mechanisms, and                                      3) measure the ectomycorrhizal contribution to soil enzyme                      activities using polyclonal antibodies raised against enzymes                   from pure cultures.                                                                  This research will lead to the understanding of important                  soil processes associated with soil microbial systems.  In                      particular, this study will elucidate the ability of soil biota                                                                                                 to release nutrients from decaying organic matter, and the                      proficiency of fungi to capture these resources and promote                     efficient nutrient cycling in ecosystems.",
