 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307994  Wang  The focus of this research is the development of new methods  for the synthesis of enediynes and enyne-allenes which provide  easy entries to a variety of carbon diradicals and mechanistic  studies of the subsequent radical processes. The first  objective is to develop the use of the condensation reaction of  sillylallenylboranes with acetylenic and allenic aldehydes for  the synthesis of enediynes and enyne-allenes having diverse  chemical structures. New synthetic routes to enediynes,  enyne-allenes, diene-allenes, enediallenes and other related  structures via the intramolecular migration reaction of  organoborate complexes will also be developed. The formation of  carbon diradicals from these unsaturated compounds will be  studied using the strategy of generating new types of  diradicals by intramolecularly capturing the initially formed  diradical with a properly situated carbon-carbon double or  triple bond. This will allow the radical centers to be moved  around the molecule and can lead to the formation of other  reactive species, such as o-quinodimethanes.  %%%  With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting  the research of Dr. Kung K. Wang of the Department of Chemistry  at West Virgina University. Professor Wang will focus his work  on synthetic methods generating new types of carbon diradicals  and the mechanistic studies of the subsequent radical processes  which have recently found their counterpart in biological  systems.  ***",
