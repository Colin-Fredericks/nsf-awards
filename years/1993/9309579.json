 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309579  Papastavrou       Real-world vehicle routing problems are characterized by  imprecise or unknown information about future customers and travel  times, constantly changing planning horizons, queuing  considerations, resequencing and reassignment decisions, and a  variety of performance criteria that include waiting time and  delivery costs.  However, classical vehicle routing models are  static, assume perfect knowledge of demands, ignore queuing effects  and typically only consider travel costs.  Only recently, have new  approaches been investigated, taking into consideration both the  dynamic and the stochastic aspects of the problems.  The  researchers will combine techniques from both areas of operations  research, stochastics and combinatorics, to analyze a variety of  stochastic and dynamic (mainly vehicle routing) problems; these  problems are more applicable than their traditional deterministic  counterparts.       Research results will demonstrate that the models will not  only be useful for transportation planning, but also for other  classes of problems where congestion effects dominate; these  include scheduling problems, bin-packing problems, facility  location problems, and a special class of information retrieval  problems in computer science.",
