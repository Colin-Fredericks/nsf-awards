 "awd_abstract_narration": "9218922  Bromwich  This project is a one-year continuation of a successful  investigation into the antarctic surface and boundary layer wind  field, with specific emphasis on the extremely strong down-slope  katabatic winds in the vicinity of Terra Nova Bay.  The outward  flowing surface air is an integral part of the meridional  circulation, together with inflow and convergence aloft, and  generally sinking motion over the continent.    The pattern of katabatic winds over the sloping ice sheet is highly  irregular, with air converging into several narrow coastal regions  to produce locally what are recognized as the strongest and most  persistent surface winds in the world.  Known examples are at Cape  Denison and Port Martin in Adelie Land (facing Australia), and in  Terra Nova Bay on the western coast of the Ross Sea.     Specific tasks to be undertaken as part of this project are to  complete the kinematic, dynamic, and climatological analysis of  specific katabatic events.  Automatic weather station observations  from the vicinity of Terra Nova Bay, satellite imagery collected at  McMurdo Station, and synoptic weather analyses from the Australian  Bureau of Meteorology will be examined for the period of 1988 to  1991 to determine the broadscale conditions associated with  variations in the katabatic wind regime at Terra Nova Bay.  ***",
