 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subsurface flow regime within wetlands is well understood only              in very few locations, despite the large areal importance of peaty,             water-saturated terrain on Earth's surface and the hydrologically               strategic location of wetlands in many catchments.  Ecologists have             long attributed key aspects of peatland development to the                      interactions of hydrology, chemical transport, and plant growth.                Wetlands can also play a critical, controlling role in the                      transport and fate of toxic chemicals.  The present project is                  focused on such a wetland, where a deep peat deposit interacts with             both a heavily contaminated river and a glacial outwash aquifer                 containing a former municipal wellfield.  In this setting the                   fundamental processes of subsurface water transport through a                   peatland will be studied, with a focus on peat characteristics at               several spatial scales and the processes that subsurface water flow             and chemical transport.  One working hypothesis is that, due to                 heterogeneity on the scale of the peat formation, rates of both                 water and pollutant movement through the wetland may significantly              exceed the low rates commonly attributed to peat formations.                    Accordingly, a variety of measurements and tests will be conducted              to define and assess the importance of these heterogeneities.                   Investigative techniques will include head and hydraulic                        conductivity measurements, a piezocone survey, aquifer                          stress/tracer tests, chemical analyses of soil and groundwater, and             speciation analysis and sequential extractions of certain toxic                 metals.",
