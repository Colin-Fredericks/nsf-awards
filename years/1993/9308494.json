A real-time system has specific time constraints for the processing  of a database query as well as consistency requirements for its  temporal data.  If it is not possible to produce an exact answer to  a database query by a specified deadline, approximate query  processing can be used to provide an approximate answer within the  time constraints, but it does not address the temporal dimension of  the data.  This project integrates the two areas of approximate  query processing and temporal data models in order to design an  approximate query processing system for temporal data.  A new  semantics of approximation is being developed to include the  different types of temporal data and consistency requirements of a  real-time database.  The approximate relational algebra operations  are extended to include new approximate temporal operations.  The  semantic information needed during approximate query processing to  incorporate the temporal dimension and maintain consistency is  being determined.  The result of this project will provide a design  for the implementation of an approximate query processing system  that can be used in environments where data consistency must be  maintained and deadlines must be met.   ***",
