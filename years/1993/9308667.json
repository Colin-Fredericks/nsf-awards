 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project implements a virtual-memory system for  data-parallel  computing by taking advantage of the technical advances   in algorithms for parallel disk systems.    Such a system will  benefit parallel computing in many scientific  and other application areas by  making it simpler and faster to  run code on objects that are several gigabytes  or even larger.  Typically, when the memory requirements of an application  exceed  the available random-access memory on parallel machines,  programmers  keep their data on a parallel disk system and perform  disk accesses in their  source code.  The resulting codes are  difficult to develop and often run  slowly.  The proposed system  will help avoid the additional software  development time and  complexity associated with such large problems.  Moreover,  because the system employs recent advances in algorithms for  planning  parallel disk accesses, it runs more efficiently.    The project entails  the design and implementation of an  appropriate set of primitive data-parallel  operations in a  virtual-memory context.  The implementation may include further  development of efficient algorithms for parallel disk systems.  In addition, the  project includes the development of one or  more compilers that compile  languages such as Fortran and C into  these primitives.",
