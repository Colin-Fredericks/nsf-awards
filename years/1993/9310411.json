In South Africa, race and gender have  been understood to constitute \"naturally\" different social and  legal subject positions.  Recent and pending re-definitions of  legal status, by race and gender, have destabilized these subject  positions and will have important psychological implications for  the restructuring of political identity.  The investigator will  focus on women's collective action as the context in which to  examine how women articulate their sense of identity in social and  legal practice.  At this vantage point, the investigator will  observe and document the ways in which categories of racial and  gender difference create attitudes and behaviors, and structure  social interactions.  The research will make an important  theoretical contribution to the scientific understanding of legal  and political psychology.    The project will employ both long term ethnographic fieldwork and  archival research of relevant court records.  Research will be  conducted in Durban, Natal (and to a limited extent in Ulundi,  KwaZulu), with two community organizations.  The investigator will  document the ways in which women represent themselves to each  other, and, as collectivities, how they represent themselves and  their interests to the state (via court hearings), political  organizations, and other agencies.  ***",
