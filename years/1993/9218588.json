 "awd_abstract_narration": "The establishment of the embryonic body plan during the development             of many animals results from the asymmetric distribution of                     molecules or organelles in the egg.  One particularly clear example             is the specification of anterior development in Drosophila embryos.             The messenger RNA of the bicoid gene is localized at the anterior               margin of the egg during oogenesis; following fertilization the                 bicoid protein activates the expression of anterior-specific                    zygotic genes.  Experiments in this proposal are directed toward                learning how bicoid RNA is localized during oogenesis, including                molecular associations of the RNA and the cellular mechanisms of                localization.  Proposed experiments include an investigation of                 molecular interactions that cause bicoid RNA to be associated with              the cytoskeleton or other large organelles, particularly the                    involvement of microtubules in this process.  The function of the               swallow gene in bicoid RNA localization during oogenesis will be                investigated in experiments to learn whether swallow protein is                 associated with bicoid RNA, and to identify functionally important              parts of the swallow protein.  A search of the group of maternal                effect genes with early arrest phenotypes will be made for other                genes whose products are involved in bicoid RNA localization.  The              time course of bicoid RNA localization will be monitored through                the construction and expression of an inducible RNA that is                     localized via the bicoid pathway, allowing tests of the idea that               bicoid RNA is transported to the oocyte by an active mechanism.",
