 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305860  Lindenfeld    This research will investigate the transition from the metallic,  superconducting state to the insulating, magnetically ordered state  in layered cuprate oxide materials, the high-Tc systems.  Thin  films from a few atom-layers to several unit cells in thickness  will be grown and characterized by a number of methods.  The  conducting properties will be changed by varying the composition of  the materials which are prepared by laser-ablation techniques.  The  evolution of spin fluctuations and magnetic order will be  investigated as the superconductivity disappears with compositional  changes.  In collaboration with colleagues, the materials will be  characterized by x-ray and neutron diffraction and electrical  transport measurements.  %%%  This project deals with the growth and characterization of high-Tc  films.  A major interest is how the superconducting properties  change or disappear as films of the materials are grown atom by  atom.  The authors will use structural and electrical techniques to  characterize the thin film materials and investigate the interplay  between magnetic and superconducting properties of the materials.   The results have importance for fundamental aspects of  superconductivity as well as technological relevance in the context  of preparing new superconducting layered structures.  ***",
