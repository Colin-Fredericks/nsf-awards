 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study algorithms and computational complexity of              combinatorial problems with an emphasis on parallel graph algorithms and        approximation algorithms.  Besides the more traditional area of                 polynomial time approximations to NP-complete problems, special                 attention will be given to efficient parallel approximations obtained by        NC algorithms.                                                                                                                                                  Such approximation algorithms are of interest to problems in P too.  The        P-completeness proof of the maximum flow problem shows that the least           significant digit of the flow is difficult to compute in parallel, but          it is open whether good approximations could be obtained in NC (i.e.,           for fast parallel algorithms).  This would imply a deterministic NC             algorithm for bipartite matching.  A seemingly fast candidate algorithm         based on least squares approximations is investigated, and its extension        to more general linear programming problems will be studied.                                                                                                    The work on the graph isomorphism problem will continue mainly by               investigating the performance of combinatorial algorithms involving only        elementary group theory; in particular, the performance of the k-tuple          coloring algorithm for selected parameterized classes of graphs.",
