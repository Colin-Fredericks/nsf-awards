 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314266  Lane  The extraordinary increase of joint ventures and small-firm  start-ups in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union suggests  that these mechanisms make an important contribution to long-run  economic transformation.  This Research Planning Grant (RPG)  develops an empirical research program that addresses the following  questions: What factors have contributed to the rapid increase in  joint ventures?  What can we learn about the formation and  management of joint ventures from this large sample? Have countries  and firms benefitted from cooperation and the capital, managerial  expertise, and production technology invested?  Finally, how does  the sectoral distribution of joint ventures compare to that of new  business starts?  The focus of the research is on joint ventures  because availability of data is better and the findings are more  generalizable to market economies.  The sectoral incidence of joint  ventures can be measured by the number of joint ventures or by the  amount of foreign capital invested.  Independent variables test the  relative importance of strategic factors, technological factors,  and specific Eastern European factors such as filling in the gaps  in industry distribution that are the legacy of central planning.   Though joint ventures have increased significantly in Western  economies, this increase is dwarfed by the increase in the joint  ventures between Western and Eastern European firms. The large  number and variety of joint ventures provides a unique opportunity  to test three important elements that influence the organizational  structure of a firm: technology (demand and cost  complementarities), limitations on contracts caused by  idiosyncratic assets, and incomplete contracts as a result of the  inability to contract for all contingencies.  The RPG will develop  further the survey data, initial analysis of the data, and  collaboration with Hungarian researchers to prepare a more  extensive proposal to evaluate the benefits to the firms of  und ertaking joint ventures.  Future research using actual case  studies will be a collaborative process between the principal  investigator and Hungarian researchers with contacts and expertise  in fieldwork.  ***",
