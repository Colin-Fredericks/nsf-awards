 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computer is revolutionizing the teaching of physics, both                   in the laboratory and in the classroom.   A computer-integrated                 approach in the classroom allows students to study in detail                    situations where analytic solutions are impossible.  It also                    frees them from tedious hand calculations, thus allowing more                   time for consideration of the essential aspects of the                          problem.The computer revolution has been under way for some                     time in the Furman Physics Department, where we have begun to                   use computer simulations as classroom demonstrations, to give                   course assignments involving computer-aided computation and                     graphing, to use computer-interfaced laboratory equipment for                   the collection and analysis of data, and to work with students                  on individual computer-related projects. This award is                          providing the computer hardware and software needed to expand                   our current usage of the computer to involve all students                       taking courses in three target areas: classical physics,                        quantum mechanics, and computational physics.  Specifically,                    the award has provided an eight station networked computer                      facility with a file server, compute server host, along with                    general-purpose and applications software.",
