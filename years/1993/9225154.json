 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large number of excellent strong ground motion and                            structural response accelerograms were recorded during                          the M 7.5 Landers earthquake of June 28, 1992, which                            was the largest to occur in California since 1952.  There                       was relatively little damage to engineered structures due                       to the remote location of the epicenter.  However the                           ground motion records obtained from this event are                              among the most significant measured to date, and                                especially the recording from a free-field instrument                           installed and maintained by the Southern California                             Edison Co. (SCE).  This instrument was located in                               Lucerne Valley within approximately one mile of the                             surface rupture, thus providing one of the closest near-                        field recordings of a major U.S. earthquake.  A                                 preliminary analysis of this record shows a very                                pronounced long-period pulse in the displacement with                           an amplitude of about 120 cm.  This type of ground                              motion could have a serious effect on the response of                           large structures.                                                                                                                                               The existence of significant long-period motion in the                          near-field of a large earthquake has been postulated for                        some years and analytical models have been proposed to                          characterize this near-field motion.  However there has                         been insufficient data with which to verify either the                          existence or the nature of this type of motion.  The                            evidence of significant strongly correlated long-period                         motion provided by a preliminary analysis of the                                Lucerne Valley (SCE) record is of very great interest                           and concern to earthquake engineers.                                                                                                                            The objective of this project is: (1) to undertake a                            thorough study of the site, the instrument, and the                             recorded data so as to determine the accuracy of the                            Lucerne Valley earthquake record, (2) to develop                                appropriate correction algorithms for this instrument                           and to apply these to the measured ground motion                                record, and (3) to study the characteristics of the                             Lucerne Valley record any available comparable data to                          obtain a better understanding of the possible effects of                        near-field earthquakes on structural response.",
