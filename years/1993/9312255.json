 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamical systems with random perturbations have been used  intensively in mechanics, physics, biology, and engineering.   Many of these problems concern the asymptotic behavior of  randomly perturbed dynamical systems under unbounded growth of  intensities of perturbation.  This research will investigate  boundedness in probability, ergodicity, boundedness with  probability 1, and stability for such systems.  This will allow  the investigator to develop the principle of random averaging for  systems in general spaces and types of perturbations and to  establish theorems on weak convergence of the distributions of a  perturbed system for large times to distributions of a diffusion  Markov process.  The methods of investigation are based on  martingale theory, stochastic differential equations for complex  systems, and limit theorems for stochastic differential  equations.  The investigator will consider new general limit  theorems for jump processes in extending phase spaces to study  the weak convergence of complex Markov processes to more simple  ones.  Dynamical systems with random perturbations have been used  intensively in mechanics, physics, biology, and engineering.   There are many unsolved problems which are connected with the  study of the asymptotic behavior of randomly perturbed dynamical  systems under conditions of unbounded growth on the intensities  of perturbation.  This research will investigate the main  properties of such systems.  The research will advance the  knowledge of the behavior of stochastically perturbed systems and  will provide significant applications to the engineering  sciences.",
