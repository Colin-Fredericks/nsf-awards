One popular method is                to create a global schema from the schemas of existing databases                and to allow the global schema to be queried. Each query against                the global schema needs to be decomposed into subqueries which                  are then translated to queries acceptable by the corresponding                  underlying database systems for data retrieval. The objective of                this project is to improve the processing speed of the global                   queries when using an object-oriented global schema. The speedup                is achieved by two types of optimization mechanisms. One is built               into the process of query decomposition and the other into query                translation.  The optimization in query decomposition evaluates                 different decomposition strategies and chooses the best strategy.               The optimization in query translation similarly evaluates                       different translation plans. The existence of different types of                databases requires that several translators be developed.                       Relational, object-oriented and textual database systems are used               as the underlying database systems in the project. The proposed                 optimizations of queries against the global schema are expected                 to significantly improve the overall performance of heterogeneous               database systems.",
