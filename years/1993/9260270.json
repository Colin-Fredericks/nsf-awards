 "awd_abstract_narration": "For imaging or position-sensitive detection (particle                      counting) of low-intensity electron, ion, or photon beams, a                    common approach is to use a microchannel plate (MCP)                            intensifier (with an appropriate emissive coating or                            photocathode if necessary) followed by a position-sensitive                     anode.  Of several possible anode designs, one which has                        proven to be rugged, inexpensive, and very useful,                              particularly when timing of individual particle arrivals is                     important, is the resistive anode encoder (RAE).                                     Present limitations of this device include limited                         maximum counting rate due to RC delays and electronic                           processing times, and the need to use high voltage vacuum                       feedthroughs and breakdown-prone standoff capacitors on the                     signal leads for in-situ vacuum applications where the anode                    must be biased to high voltages.  A fast new generation of                      RAE-type detectors will be developed.  Proposed new pulse                       processing electronics, applicable to existing RAE devices as                   well, should increase the signal rate over that of current                      detectors by a factor of ten.  The new detector would replace                   the resistive anode with its optical analog, using a                            scintillating lightguide to convert an electron burst into                      optical pulses, which can be transmitted over optical fiber                     signal leads.  The advantages include inherent high speed,                      noise immunity, and non-conducting signal leads that allow the                  detector to float at high voltage.",
