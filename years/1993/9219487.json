 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year project will demonstrate whether measuring cosmogenic             isotope abundances in sediment provides a useful and efficient way              to determine basin-scale denudation rates and sediment fluxes.  It              has three specific goals: 1) evaluate the simple model we have                  developed for interpreting the abundance of in-situ-produced                    cosmogenic nuclides in sediments; 2) use isotope abundance to                   characterize the variability in sediment production and routing in              mesoscale (1000km2) drainage basins in the Oregon Coast Range; 3)               measure isotope concentrations in sediments carried by some of the              world's largest rivers and compare \"cosmogenic\" denudation rates                with those calculated by other means.  At the conclusion, we will               have determined the applicability of our interpretive model and we              will understand better the dynamics of sediment production and                  transport in the Coast Range.                                                   The study will begin with collection of quartz-rich sediment                    samples from hillslopes and stream channels in the western Oregon               Coast Range.  We will sample along the drainages, beginning in                  first-order tributaries and continuing to the trunk streams.                    Quartz will be separated from these samples and the abundance of                in situ-produced cosmogenic isotopes (26Al and 14C) will be                     measured.  Isotope abundances will be interpreted using the                     mathematical model that we have developed and will be compared to               the rates of sediment production, transport, and storage which we               and others have quantified through prior field studies in the Coast             Range. In addition to Coast Range samples, we plan to analyze                   sediment collected by us and by others from rivers draining a                   variety of geomorphic and hydrologic provinces.  These sample sites             will be selected to represent areas which have significantly                    different denudation rates.  They will include sites in the Amazon              Basin, where we are currently studying sediment transport by more               traditional means, as well as sites on other large rivers where we              have experience or contacts resulting from the Amazon work",
