Significant advances have been made                        in recent years in the research and development of high-                        performance materials for technological needs using self-                       propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS).  SHS is a                         unique process based on solid-state combustion using                            internally generated chemical energy.  Recognized experts in                    the field in both Russia and the U.S. will (1) discuss state-of-                the-art research results, and (2) identify specific topic ares                  upon which collaboration(s) may be built.  This workshop                        will link the two research efforts that have essentially been                   conducted in parallel for more than fifteen years.  In                          addition, this workshop draws its participants from a variety                   of U.S. institutions, and includes several younger researchers                  (<40 years of age) from both sides.  The bulk of the                            published research on SHS is from the former Soviet Union                       \u0131FSU!, and particularly from Russia.  Much of the remaining                     work has been conducted in the U.S.  Recent political events                    have opened the door for a Russia/US collaboration in basic                     SHS research that would not have been possible three years                      ago.                                                                                                                                                            This workshop in SHS fulfills the program objectives of                         advancing science by enabling leading experts in the U.S. and                   Russia to combine complementary talents and pool research                       resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
