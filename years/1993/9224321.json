 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has shown that legal action by businesses against               other businesses has increased substantially in recent years,                   accompanied by the inevitable losses in productivity and                        significant increases in legal costs and court caseloads.  Yet,                 little is known about how business-to-business disputes emerge and              why some become lawsuits while others do not; about how businesses              vary in the way that they deal with problems in business                        relationships; and about how different approaches to disputing (for             example, the involvement of lawyers, the use of alternative dispute             resolution processes like mediation) affect the nature of business-             to-business disputes and shape their outcomes.  Past research and               existing theories focus on how and why individuals drop or pursue               grievances and on the ways that individual perceptions and actions              regarding grievances change as disputes develop and are processed.              This research will examine the disputing behavior of business                   organizations -- behavior that differs substantially from that of               individuals -- and thus will elaborate and extend existing theory               while adding to the limited empirical knowledge about business                  disputing.  In addition, the research should have practical                     application for the choices that businesses make in organizing                  themselves to deal with conflicts with other businesses.                                                                                                        This research will employ intensive case studies of the disputing               behavior of six corporations that differ in their formal dispute                resolution policies.  Through repeated interviews with and                      observation of the work of corporate counsel staff and business                 managers and executives, we will develop an inventory of recent and             on-going problems in business relationships for each firm.  For                 each problem, we will gather data about the characteristics of the              problem and the relationship as well as the perceptions of key                  actors, actions taken, and resources expended at each step as the               problem moves toward resolution or litigation.  Using techniques of             qualitative and quantitative analysis, we will examine the                      characteristics that distinguish disputes that are litigated from               those that are not, and describe the impact that differing                      approaches to resolving problems and disputes have on their                     definition, course, costs and outcome.  In addition, this research              will compare the disputing policies and practices of the six                    businesses and the ways that they influence corporate disputing                 behavior.",
