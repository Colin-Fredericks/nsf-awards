 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309651  Nee    This project will test theories of market transitions from state  socialism with data from a national social survey conducted in  rural China in 1989.  As markets replace socialist redistribution,  changes in the structure of opportunity and incentives give rise to  conditions more favorable to direct producers relative to  redistributive organizations, thus producing fundamental changes in  the dynamics of stratification.  This study will extend market  transition theory to empirical challenges posed by the growth of  rural industry, regional variation in the shift to markets, and  increasing income inequality.  A new institutionalist perspective  will also contribute to the empirical analysis, as hypotheses are  tested on the embeddedness of markets, expanding the current social  network perspective of economic sociology to include the  institutional framework of the economy.  %%%  The results will contibute significantly to the scientific  literature on social change, as well as to economic sociology.  The  knowledge gained will also be available to policy-makers and others  who need to understand the changes currently in progress in China.    ***",
