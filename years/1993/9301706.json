 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301706  Bohanon    This award is under the International  Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which enables  U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three  to twelve months of research at foreign centers  of proven excellence.  The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and  the use of unique or complementary facilities,  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.      This award will support a twelve-month  postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Thomas M.  Bohanon to work with Dr. Helmut Ringsdorf at  Johannes Gutenberg Universitaet in Mainz,  Germany.    Dr. Bohanon and Dr. Ringsdorf will  quantitatively study the specific recognition  of proteins with ligand lipids using a fiber  optic sensor.  An evanescent wave from the  optical fiber excites fluorescent molecules  only within tens of nanometers from the optical  fiber; the optical fiber collects a fraction of  this fluorescence.  This technique is highly  selective and very versatile.  They will study  the specific binding of streptavidin to biotin,  the effect of spacers on the binding, and the  possibility of docking a second protein layer  to streptavidin.  They also will study the  specific binding of antiflourescyl IgG and Fab  to fluorescein lipids, and the effects of  spacers on this binding and perform kinetic  measurements.  Finally, they will perform the  same experiments using a quartz crystal  microbalance; the combination of these two  techniques will provide insight into specific  binding that could not otherwise be achieved.  ***",
