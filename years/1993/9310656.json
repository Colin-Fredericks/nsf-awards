The efficacy of combining high resolution X-ray Absorption Near  Edge Spectroscopy and Mossbauer effect measurements to clarify  valence fluctuation behavior will be examined. Polarized Mossbauer  radiation sources will be used in the laboratory to delineate  anisotropic interactions near ferroelectric phase transitions.   Synchrotron-based Mossbauer measurements in the time-domain will be  made to study non-equilibrium behavior such as photon induced  states in ferroelectric materials.  %%%  The proposed research program is of an exploratory nature and may  have an important impact in providing new insights for the  understanding of ferroelectric materials and ferroelectric  behavior. The study of polarization phenomena is relevant to a  number of critical problems in ferroelectric thin films for non-  volatile memory applications. The dynamics of valence and  structural behavior in these materials and their analogues will be  explored by a combination of Mossbauer spectroscopy and synchrotron  radiation.  Polarized Mossbauer radiation sources will be used in  the laboratory to delineate anisotropic interactions near  ferroelectric phase transitions.  Synchrotron-based Mossbauer  measurements in the time-domain will be made to study non-  equilibrium behavior caused by radiation-induced states.  ***",
