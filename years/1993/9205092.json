 "awd_abstract_narration": "theories of the evolution of sex can be divided into those                      concerned with the origin of the sexual process and those concerned             with its maintenance once it has arisen.  Here we propose an                    experimental test of both types of the theory.  Maintenance                     theories that assume a role for recombination in generating rare                useful genotypes will be tested by competing diploid yeast strains              with each other, strains that differ only in their ability to                   undergo recombination.  The experimental design will permit two                 classes of these models to be examined, those that assume selection             coefficients are constant (the Fisher-Muller models of                          Felsenstein's classification (Felsenstein, 1988)) and those that                assume they are variable or cyclic (Felsenstein's Sturtevant-Mather             models).  Both processes are likely to be important; we will                    attempt to determine which is more powerful in our experimental                 system.  Asexual strains will be competed directly with isogenic                sexual one, to determine the range of conditions under which                    strains what are capable of recombining sexually prevail.  The type             of genetic variability that accumulates under these conditions, and             the rate at which it accumulates, will also be measured.  The                   origin of sex theory that will be tested is the DNA repair                      hypothesis of Bernstein and Michod.  We will test to see whether                the ability to recombine meiotically confers a competitive                      advantage upon sexual strains to ionizing radiation, which induces              double strands and breaks.  Double stranded breaks are essential to             the DNA repair hypothesis, which postulates that in early biotic                environments, double stranded breaks imposed sever selection                    pressures upon organisms.  The only way to repair such breaks was               in certain lineages.  We will also examine whether, and how                     quickly, increased rates of recombination can be selected for in                heavily mutagenized populations that either do or do not exhibit an             alternation of generations, and whether this selection can affect               both mitotic and meiotic recombination.",
