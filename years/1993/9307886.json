 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solovay will investigate various topics in Mathematical                    Logic.  A common theme of many of the questions to be explored is               the notion of the consistency strength of formal systems.  Among                the questions to be considered are the following:  Did Godel have               a proof of the independence of the axiom of choice from the                     axioms of type-theory prior to Cohen's discovery of forcing?  Is                the non-orthodox system of set-theory proposed by Quine                         consistent?  Can one get significantly more precise estimates on                the \"consistency strength\" of subsystems of second order number                 theory?                                                                              One of the important discoveries of twentieth century logic                is that the kinds of reasoning carried out by mathematicians can                be codified into axiom systems.  The most popular such system, by               far, is the axiom system proposed by Zermelo (and later modified                and corrected by Fraenkel and Skolem), but there are interesting                extensions that have been extensively studied by set theorists as               well as some significantly weaker ones beloved by the                           mathematically cautious.  It has become clear that the study                    of such weak subsystems of set-theory is intimately related to                  large cardinals (a research specialty of Solovay's).  Solovay                   hopes to apply his expertise in large cardinals to achieve a more               precise calibration of the strength of these weak subsystems.                   If successful, this will bring substantial progress to a                        research program of some fifty years duration, which excites                    renewed interest in the present era of computers.",
