As we look ahead to the 21st century, the United States faces significant challenges in its scientific and technological relations with Japan.  This study will develop a framework for maximizing U.S. interests in competing and cooperating with Japan as a technological superpower.  These interests include:  (1) improving global competitiveness of U.S. corporations and the United States as a place of high value added production; (2) maintaining the U.S. research and technology base; and (3) meeting defense requirements in a post cold war context.  The study will review current policies and context, highlight long term objectives, analyze obstacles to achieving them with detailed references to agency programs and missions, clarify alternative future scenarios and their implications for U.S. interests, and provide recommendations for steps that government, industry, and research institutions could take to maximize long term U.S. interests.",
