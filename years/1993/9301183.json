The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Claire                                       Komives of the University of Pittsburgh to work                                 with Professor Dr. J. E. Bailey at the Swiss                                    Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich,                                      Switzerland.                                                                                                                                                    The objective of this project is to elucidate                                   the mechanism of Vitreoscilla Hemoglobin (VHb)                                  in vitro, and to study its function in a                                        synthetic cell environment.  Two mechanisms for                                 the protein action have been suggested which                                    provide the basis of this study.  The capacity                                  of VHb for improving oxygen uptake to the cell,                                 and its potential role in affecting the                                         efficiency of oxygen utilization by specific                                    cell components will be explored.  Because VHb                                  both associates with the cell membrane and                                      resides within the cell, its function cannot be                                 properly understood by merely studying it in                                    solution.  Reversed micelles offer a novel                                      approach to creating a cell-like environment                                    for carrying out the in vitro mechanistic                                       studies.  The surfactant or phospholipid layer                                  encapsulating water pools within an apolar                                      solvent is analogous to a cell membrane.  Thus,                                 the action of VHb is to be studied in a well                                    characterized medium that mocks some important                                  features of cell make-up, but which lacks the                                   complexity of interconnected chemical pathways                                  necessary to the function of a living cell.                                                                                                                     The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel to Switzerland and a                                 stipend for twelve months.",
