Proposals  were solicited from institutions whose existing facilities and  staff could accommodate additional graduate students in Ph.D.  programs of high quality.  The program is also intended to  contribute to strengthening the Nation's human resource base across  all geographic sectors and among all under-represented groups.   Graduate Research Traineeship awards are packages of student  support.  The colleges and universities that receive the awards are  responsible for the selection of trainees, retention of trainees,  and administration of traineeships.       The University of Wisconsin will develop a program to train  doctoral level researchers working at the interface between the  mathematical and computational sciences and engineering. Trainees  will have the capability to employ \"state-of-the-art\" mathematical  and computational methodology in the study of engineering problems  as well as the capability to develop new methodology in response to  these problems.  The program will focus on the mathematical  modeling process including issues regarding the validity of  assumptions and computational feasibility.  Breadth of knowledge  and experience will be emphasized through a wide range of course  work and a variety of scientific interactions and experiences.",
