 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353804  Sullivan    Seattle University proposes an activity-based, team-focused model program for female eighth  grade students of color for academic year 1993-94.  The program will serve students who are  able and well motivated, but who might well lose interest in science and mathematics without  special attention.  The model program will extend and enhance a four-week NSF-supported  Summer Science Camp, which will serve the same girls in August 1993.  In that camp, called  \"Summer Science Splash:  The Mathematics and Physics of Water,\" students will use group  discussions, experimentation, and field work to learn about physical properties of water,  principles of waves, issues of water quality, and the role of water in the Northwest ecology.   In the model program, each student will build on knowledge and skills gained during the summer  by carrying out a challenging science project on a water-related issue of particular interest to  her.  It is our hypothesis that year-long reinforcement of the excitement generated by the  summer program will heighten many students' continuing interest in science.    Each student, or pair of students, will direct a project team consisting of a middle school  teacher, a Seattle university undergraduate science student, and a professional scientist who  works in the community.  Working closely together, each team will design and carry out a  project over a five month period.  Possible project areas include stream monitoring,  hydroelectric power, water in weather, avalanches, and marine biology.  Projects will involve  reading, field work, experimentation, team discussion, model-building, and writing.  A  curriculum designer will work with each team to design a project that is significant and  appropriate for the time frame.  The project will culminate with four spring events:  1) the  student's presentation of her project methods and results to her classmates; 2) participation in  \"Expanding Your Horizons,\" a career workshop for middle school girls; 3) a mar ine science and  environmental education camp experience in Washington's San Juan Islands; and 4) Science Day,  an on-campus colloquium and celebration in which each team presents its project to the entire  group.  In addition to the value of the science content and the time devoted to science, students  will gain leadership and project management skills, experience in cooperation and working as  part of a team, verbal presentation experience, and experience interacting with professional  scientists as friends and role models.  ***",
