 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides eight months of support for the U.S. PI to                  visit her Australian colleague, Dr. David Sandeman of the Zoology               Department at the University of New South Wales.  The                           investigators will concentrate on problems of connectivity and                  physiology in organized synaptic regions in the crustacean brain,               known as the accessory lobes.  The functional role of the                       accessory lobes, among the largest synaptic regions in many                     decapod brains, currently is not well understood.  No sensory                   neurons project to these regions, and no motor neurons have                     synaptic fields in the accessory lobes.  This situation has led                 to much speculation as to the function of the accessory lobes and               to the suggestions that these are \"associative\" regions.  It is                 interesting to note that accessory lobes are a unique feature of                those decapods that have adopted a benthic life style.                                                                                                          Electro-physiological and dye injection methods will be used to                 examine the imput-output relationships of the accessory lobe in                 the Australian fresh-water crayfish Cherax destructor.  The                     investigators expect that these studies will lead to a clearer                  understanding of the functional role of this area of the                        crustacean brain, which may serve as a model for understanding                  vertebrate brains.                                                                                                                                              Both investigators have been well funded for their work:                        Sandeman by the Australian Research Council and Beltz mostly by                 NIH.  Dr. Beltz has a Presidential Young Investigator award from                NSF's Neuroscience Program.",
