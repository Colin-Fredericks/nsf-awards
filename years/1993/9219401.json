 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the central dogma of molecular biology, the                        information contained in the hereditary material, DNA, is passed to             proteins via an intermediate molecule called RAN.  Proteins direct              the control of most cell functions.  While the overall process of               gene expression is understood, the details of the mechanisms                    involved in gene expression need clarification.  For example,                   intervening sequences (or introns) are extra pieces of information              inside genes that are not used to produce the final gene product.               The significance of introns inside genes remains to be determined.              This project is looking at requirements for splicing , in the                   bacterial virus T4, a process that removes introns from RNA during              gene expression.  RNA splicing mechanisms are varied, but in all                cases, the sequence of nucleotides (chemical subunits of RNA and                DNA) is important to the splicing process.                                      %%%                                                                             In this project, changes in the nucleotide sequence of the introns              will be generated by chemical mutagenesis and the effect of these               changes on splicing and gene expression will be evaluated.  The                 overall goal of this study is to use chemically induced changes in              the nucleotide sequences of introns to identify particular                      nucleotides in the introns important to splicing.  This information             will be used to enhance models for splicing mechanisms.",
