 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305027      Storer       This project is a study of high performance adaptive lossy  compression techniques. That is, techniques that are able to  achieve the best possible compression in a single pass over the  data (with no prior knowledge of the data) and which can be  implemented to run in real time at high data rates. Thus, the  research employs a combination of data compression theory,  experimental results, algorithms (serial and parallel) design, and  to some extent, hardware design. A new approach to image  compression has been developed that combines some of the most  successful techniques for dynamic lossless compression and some of  the most successful techniques for static lossy compression to  achieve a fully adaptive single-pass lossy compression algorithm  that needs only the fidelity criterion to be specified in advance.  This new algorithm is capable of achieving \"state of the art\" image  compression; in fact, in practice for a given fidelity it typically  equals or exceeds the amount of compression achieved by the best  methods previously available. A number of new directions of  research are identified  that include extensions of this approach,  applications of a similar approach to video compression (where,  arbitrarily shaped \"superblocks\" of pixels are tracked from frame  to frame), the design of parallel lossless compression algorithms  (that can be used as components in a complete data compression  system), the design of parallel data compression hardware, and new  techniques to suppress error propagation with adaptive algorithms.  The theme of this research is flexible adaptive techniques that can  be used for data compression applications ranging from lossless  text compression, to lossy image compression, to compression of  digitized high resolution video.  All of the techniques  considered  have efficient parallel implementations and ultimately, inexpensive  custom hardware implementations.   ***",
