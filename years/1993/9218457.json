 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Argentina Cooperative Science award                                     will support the collaboration of Eileen                                        Johnson of Texas Tech University and Gustavo                                    Politis of the National University of La Plata,                                 Argentina.  The project aims to explore the                                     taphonomy, technology, and paleoecology of                                      early Pampean sites, in an assessment of                                        whether there is evidence that Early Man kill-                                  sites occur in South America.                                                                                                                                   In the last 20 years, late Pleistocene and                                      early Holocene Early Man sites have been                                        discovered on the Pampas.  These sites are                                      critical to understanding the early peopling of                                 Argentina and South America.  This project will                                 conduct bone studies aimed at delineating                                       formation and disturbance processes at the                                      sites, the subsistence base and social                                          structure of the hunter-gatherers occupying                                     these early sites, the use of bone as a                                         resource, and the environmental and climatic                                    setting of these early occupations.  The                                        researchers will analyze bone material from                                     four sites in Argentina, which will provide a                                   broad view of the range of variation in                                         activities, topographic settings, space, and                                    time.  The Argentine side will contribute                                       access to the research sites, expertise in                                      local archaeology, and laboratory facilities.                                   The US side will contribute its expertise in US                                 grasslands models and training for several                                      Argentine students, including one who will                                      spend a half-year in Johnson's lab.",
