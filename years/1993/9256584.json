 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pennsylvania State University establishes a multidisciplinary               program that provides training in demography and statistics as well             as sociology with the specific objective of preparing sociology                 graduate students for basic research careers in family and the life             course.  Thematically, the program emphasizes the life course                   perspective and innovative methodological and statistical                       procedures employed by the investigators in their work on such                  topics as marriage, fertility, divorce, single and adolescent                   parenthood, child poverty, and intergenerational relations.                     Trainees undertake a five-year plan of study that requires                      completion of extensive coursework, candidacy and comprehensive                 examinations, a research apprenticeship, and a master's thesis and              doctoral dissertation.  Graduate Research Trainees also gain                    experience giving professional presentations and teaching.  Program             success is ensured through active recruitment measures, faculty and             peer mentoring, and material support of the trainees.",
