 "awd_abstract_narration": "About ten years ago, the ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi, first                   appeared in the Black Sea.  This ctenophore was previously found                only on the eastern seaboard of the Americas, so it was probably                transported to the Black Sea in the ballast water of ships.  Since              then, it has multiplied enormously, causing a drastic decline of                several important fisheries.  One possible reason for its profound              impact in the Black Sea is that the ctenophore has no predators                 there, since the fish fauna is extremely limited.  Therefore, in                collaboration with Russian and Ukrainian scientists, this Small                 Grant for Exploratory Research project will develop a plan to study             the feasibility of introducing fishes from the Americas that                    specifically feed on Mnemiopsis.  These scientists are ware of the              dangers of introducing exotic species, and recognize the need for               a general agreement as to the advisability of such a course from                all of the nations in the region.  However, before any such                     proposals can be put forward, basic information on the feeding                  behavior and environmental tolerances of such fishes is necessary.              This project represent the first step in the American part of this              research program.  Basic information on feeding preferences of                  fishes will be obtained by interviews with local fishermen along                the eastern seaboard of the Americas, and with laboratory studies               on feeding preference.  Methods will be developed for the mass                  culture of Mnemiopsis in the laboratory.  Dr. Harbison will also                determine the ability of these American ctenophore-eating fishes to             survive in the specialized environmental conditions of the Black                Sea.  This research will provide the first step in trying to solve              a major case of biological pollution, and will serve as a model                 program for international cooperation in dealing with other forms               of introduced marine species.",
