The project will also promote awareness of these issues among  high school students and their teachers.  The project parts are  an international conference in the summer of 1994, the production  of an issues guidebook for student and teachers, and follow-up  with chapter program initiatives on university, college and high  school campuses.  The project will begin in fall 1993 with  publicity about the coming summer conference and a call for issue  papers for the guidebook.  The papers will explore cutting-edge  science and technology issues and their social and ethical  ramifications.  The conference will unite selected college  students and eminent professionals to explore these issues and  develop the guidebook further.  The chapter program will follow  on the conference to continue efforts to expand student awareness  and discussion of these critical issues.  Oversight of all of  these activities is the responsibility of several boards of  advisors.  Evaluation involves statistical recordkeeping as well  as qualitative reports about project activities and products.  ***",
