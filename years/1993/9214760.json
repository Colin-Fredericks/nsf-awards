 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in computer vision.  The projects involves U.S. investigators,                  Gerard Medioni, University of Southern California, Eric                         Grimson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dan                             Huttenlocher, Cornell University, Jean Ponce, University of                     Illinois and French investigators, Nicolas Ayache and Olivier                   Faugeras of INRIA (French National Institute for Computer                       Science and Applied Mathematics).  The research addresses                       vision research concerning geometric reasoning in a three                       dimensional environment. Current research in computer vision                    has advanced from reasoning in two dimensions to reasoning                      about three dimensional objects in the physical world.  The                     objective of the research is to simultaneously investigate the                  themes of segmentation,  representation of visual information                   and matching models with real images and vice versa.                                                                                                            The collaboration takes advantage of complementary U.S. and                     French expertise.  The U.S. investigators have extensive                        experience in the computer vision. This is complemented by                      French investigators expertise in three-dimensional                             representation and their approach utilizing differential geometry               of surfaces and variational methods.  Geometric reasoning in a                  three dimensional environment will bring computer vision closer                 to reality.  It has broad applications in many fields such as                   navigation, automatic planning, assembly and inspection in                      manufacturing.",
