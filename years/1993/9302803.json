 "awd_abstract_narration": "On September 11, 1992, Hurricane Iniki, the most powerful                  hurricane to hit the State of Hawaii this century, struck the                   Island of Kauai with steady wind speeds of over 230 km/hr and                   gust over 280 km/hr.  Everything in the path of the hurricane was               profoundly transformed; homes, public building, hotels,                         agricultural crops, and the natural features of the island were                 severely damages or destroyed.  An aerial survey by the State                   Division of Forestry and Wildlife described the vegetation of the               mountains as being \"mowed by a giant weed-eater>\"  This event                   presents a once-in-a-century opportunity to study the                           consequences of such a phenomenon for the natural environment of                the Hawaiian Islands.  Prior research on Kauai will, in some                    cases, provide a baseline from which to measure changes wrought                 by the hurricane and track subsequent responses as t he                         ecosystems adjust to its short, medium and long-term                            consequences.                                                                        The research proposed her seeks to measure the immediate                   effects of the hurricane and to monitor the ongoing consequences                of this natural phenomenon.  Of particular interest are the                     genetic effects of a population flush of some organisms, e.g.                   some species in the insect family Drosophilidae, in response to a               huge but temporary increase in decaying organic mater.  The                     population explosion may followed by a long period of small                     population size as the decaying material diminish and since it                  may be months or even years before some of the vegetation is                    restored to pre-hurricane conditions.  Understand the genetics                  consequences of the sudden increase in population size followed                 by an extended period of small population size is important for                 understanding the ability of populations to survive catastrophic                environmental conditions.                                                            Dr. Kaneshiro will also monitor population levels of exotic                drosophilid species which have been shown to be a good indicator                for disturbed habitats.  As exotic fruit plants invade the now                  open forest, an increase is expected in exotic drosophilid                      species which are associate with the exotic plants.  As the                     native forest canopy recovers and is restored to pre-hurricane                  conditions, a decrease in populations size of endemic                           drosophilids should occur.  The results of the research here                    would therefore further document the significance of the                        drosophilids as an important indicator species group for                        monitoring the relative health of Hawaii native ecosystem.     //",
