 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has two stated objectives.  One was to examine the                microstructural development during solidification of a ceramic                  material in which more than one phase adopts a faceted morphology.              A four component silicate system of silica-magnesia-alumina-calcia              (SMAC) was selected for this study.  The second objective was to                gain a better understanding of the visual representation of                     multicomponent system with a previously developed computer aided                design (CAD) program.                                                           %%%%                                                                            This proposal studies the microstructural development during                    directional solidification.  The floating zone technique will be                employed.  A previously developed computer aided design (CAD)                   program will be modified to handle systems with components greater              than 4.  This study will bring better understandings of phase                   equlibria and the morphological development during the                          solidification.",
