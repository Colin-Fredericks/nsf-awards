 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310276  Blume    Traditional models of strategic interaction assume that a  population of highly rational players interacts with one another in  a non-cooperative fashion to determine a collective outcome.  While  these models improve our understanding of centralized socialized  interaction such as that seen in well-organized financial asset  markets, they do not address the kind of decentralized non-  cooperative competition that arises in labor markets, markets for  retail services, and many non-market social settings.    Such phenomena are best modeled as games with a spatial structure.   Players live at given locations.  Each player competes (or, more  generally, interacts) only with his near neighbors.  Nonetheless  the choice of distant players has an indirect effect through a  string of players who share neighbors who share neighbors, etc.   Social interaction through this decentralized spatial or geographic  structure stands in contrast to centralized social interaction  wherein everyone interacts directly with everyone else.    This research will investigate how strategic choice evolves over  time when interaction is decentralized.  Preliminary research has  shown that the sharp rationality hypotheses of traditional game  theory are not necessary to understand how competition evolves and  what outcomes are ultimately achieved.  Consequently the  investigation will study the consequences of abandoning the  traditional models of hyper-rationality in favor of looser  strictures on individual behavior, and study how the spatial  structure of the player population enhances or inhibits the  organization of play (e.g., the evolution of cooperation in so-  called \"coordination games\").  Another theme of the project is the  contrast between social outcomes that can be reached through  centralized social interaction and those that are achieved with  decentralized interaction.  Finally, the project will study the  ramifications of different \"interaction technologies,\" such as  random matching and  fixed partners, for the evolution of collective  choice.    ***",
