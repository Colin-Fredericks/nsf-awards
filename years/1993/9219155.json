 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this project is the furtherance of our               knowledge of the dsDNA virus life cycle by gaining an understanding             of the molecular mechanisms by which these viruses packaging DNA                and assembly progeny virions within infected cells.  The particular             virus chosen for this study, bacteriophage P22, serves as a model               for similar processes in less experimentally accessible, human                  pathogenic virus such as the Herpesviruses and Adenoviruses.  This              type of virus assembles protein shells first and then inserts the               dsDNA chromosomes into those shells.                                            Two bacteriophage P22 proteins appear to be critical in the DNA                 recognition process, but do not become part of the completed virus              particle.  The process of DNA entry into the preformed capsid is                thought to involve a special \"portal\" structure, built at a unique              vertex of the icosahedral capsid.  The function of the proteins                 involved in DNA recognition and DNA entry will be examined                      genetically and biochemically.  The findings will contribute to our             understanding of the molecular machine that causes packaging of                 dsDNA chromosomes by the dsDNA viruses.                                         %%%                                                                             Understanding the process of DNA packaging by these bacteriophage               will help  in understanding similar processes in less                           experimentally accessibly but medically important animal virus                  systems and in developing models for related transport processes                such as nuclear RNA transport and bacterial transformation and                  conjugation.",
