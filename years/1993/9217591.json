A key focus will be on future needs for research,                      i.e., a research agenda for the remaining decade of the 90s                     and beyond.  In advance of the conference, monographs will                      be developed addressing the state-of-the-art technology in                      five technical areas of hazard assessment, the built                            environment and research, preparedness, response and                            recovery, and social and economical losses.  In addition,                       paper and poster sessions will be held to address individual                    works and needs in these five areas, and a set of                               proceedings will be published containing approximately 150                      papers on the subjects.  The conference will be held in a                       manner that emphasizes discussion and interaction among                         seismologists, engineers, emergency managers, social                            scientists, and planners. The conference will be held in                        Memphis, Tennessee on May 2-5, 1993.",
