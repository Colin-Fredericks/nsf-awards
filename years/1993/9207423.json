Torres and Dr. Raymundo S. Punongbayan,                                      Philippine Institute of Volcanology and                                         Seismology (PHILVOCS), for 24 months, a program                                 of cooperative research on the history of                                       explosive volcanism and volcaniclastic                                          sedimentation around Taal Caldera and Mt.                                       Pinatubo, Philippines.  This project will                                       define the stratigraphy and extent of the major                                 volcaniclastic units and analyze their                                          textures, facies, and depositional                                              characteristics of the ignimbrites and related                                  surge and lahar deposits.  Combination of data                                  from the reworked and primary deposits will                                     allow interpretation of the history of                                          explosive volcanism and catastrophic                                            sedimentation, including pyroclastic flow-lahar                                 transitions.                                                                                                                                                    This research will yield data pertinent to                                      several unusual and important problems.  A by-                                  product of the information gained, and                                          collaboration with PHILVOCS, will be an                                         improved understanding of volcanic and related                                  hazards for the Greater Manila region.  Dr.                                     Self has an excellent reputation for research                                   in the field of this proposal.  Mr. Torres is                                   an intermediate level employee of PHILVOCS with                                 several years of experience in studying                                         volcanic phenomena in the Philippines.  The                                     proposed work will form the core of his                                         dissertation research at the University of                                      Hawaii.
