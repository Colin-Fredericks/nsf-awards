Work to be done includes  the upgrade of existing equipment to improve performance and  allow experiments and observations to be performed more  efficiently and purchase and construction of new equipment to  allow new kinds of observations on astrophysical masers and  neutron stars. The signal processing component of the course is  being strengthened considerably. Students are able to measure  neutral hydrogen from neighboring galaxies for comparison with  the rotation curve of our own galaxy. In pulsar observations,  students learn about time-transfer technology, dispersive  propagation in plasmas, and the rotations of neutron stars.  Maser observations teach students about coherent radiation  mechanisms. Students are taking part in some of the  construction of new equipment, interfacing of equipment to  computers, and writing of software.  ***",
