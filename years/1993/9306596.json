Muscle  contraction is dependent upon energy  supply  which in turn is dependent upon a number of metabolic and  physiological processes. In this proposal the investigators  will  use magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the  contractile  demand and oxidative potential of the rattlesnake tail-  shaker  muscle during continuous contractions. The tail shaker  muscles are  sustaining high frequencing for over 30 minutes continuously  and  thus have high oxidative capacity to supply ATP for these  contractions. The investigators will use a range of body  temperature from 5 - 35 o C for rattling to look for demand  under  maximal conditions. In vivo muscle energetics will be  determined  using a test which involves 31P magnetic resonance  spectroscopy  to measure ATP breakdown and recovery changes in  phosphocreatine  content  during muscle  activation. The hypothesis is that  energy  flux during rattling changes as a simple temperature effect  on  the underlying rates of demand supply. This a model system  for  non-invasive evaluation of rate processes and the  coordination of  metabolism in vivo.  ***",
