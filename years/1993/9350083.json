 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interfacial properties of copolymers contribute to increasing               the strength of polymer composites and controlling the behavior of              proteins at biological interfaces.  Dr. Balazs will isolate the                 factors that control the interfacial activity of copolymers at                  penetrable interfaces, such as the boundary between immiscible                  polymers and the surface of lipid membranes.  Using theoretical                 models and computer simulations, she will probe the effect of                   molecular architecture, solvent quality and temperature on the                  interfacial activity of synthetic and biological chains.  The                   results of the former studies will yield guidelines for fabricating             materials with enhanced mechanical properties.  Through studies of              protein-membrane interactions, she will isolate the features that               promote the formation of channels within the lipid bilayers.                                                                                                    In order to develop valid theoretical models, it is particularly                beneficial to have discussions with other theorists and, most                   importantly, to test the prediction through experiment.  In                     studying the behavior of polymers at blend interfaces, the Chemical             Engineering Department at the University of Texas is unique in                  providing both these opportunities.  In a similar manner, the                   Scripps Research Institute also provides an exceptional                         environment:  both theorists and experimentalists are currently                 exploring the behavior of proteins at interfaces at this center.                The collaborations will significantly enhance Dr. Balazs's ability              to pursue these topics.                                                                                                                                         Interactive activities at the host institution include:                         establishing an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program in the             Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Texas, since               the undergraduate years are critical in terms of influencing the                students' ultimate career choices, and active research experiences              are one of the most effective ways of encouraging students to                   pursue scientific careers; and at Scripps, delivering a series of               informal seminars to demonstrate how concepts in polymer physics                can be used to determine the behavior of biopolymers to facilitate              communication between biologists and physicists.                                                                                                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
