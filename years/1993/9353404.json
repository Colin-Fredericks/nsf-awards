During the summer of 1994 the sites would be at universities  on the West Coast.  In 1995 the four-sites would form a  cluster in the southeastern, midwestern or northeastern  United States.    At each site the first of two 5-day workshops will be led by  the author (LASE Project PI); the second, to give \"local  ownership\", will be led by a local Consultant.  The  workshops will cover laser surveying, beam scanning,  refractive index measurements, lenses, pattern recognition,  photodetectors, modulating beams, guiding lights with  fibers, absorption and reflecting, polarization and liquid  crystals, interference, diffraction, and holography.   Mathematics will be integrated into all activities.  At each  workshop twelve secondary school teachers will be trained to  present these topics, to other teachers,and as lab exercise  in their classrooms with opportunities for their students to  experiment further and publish their \"findings\" in the  project journal LASE LOG.  The Consultants will assist and  observe at the first meeting, but be in charge at the  second.  ***",
