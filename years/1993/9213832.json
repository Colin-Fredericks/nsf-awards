 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adsorption is under development worldwide as a chemical-                        engineering unit operation for the separation and purification                  of gaseous and liquid mixtures.  In addition to separation of                   air into its components and removal of pollutants from air and                  water streams, adsorption is being considered for a host of                     new applications, including separation of proteins from                         bioreactor product streams, recovery of carbon dioxide from                     combustion of fossil fuels, recovery of uranium from sea                        water, methane storage, and ultrapurification of water and raw                  materials for the electronics industry.                                                                                                                         Current research using molecular simulation by grand canonical                  Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics is providing new insights                    into the physics of adsorption.  Results from these                             fundamental investigations provide a solid foundation for the                   development of new theories to replace the classical                            thermodynamic methods.  The objective of this research is to                    bridge the gap between adsorption theory and practice by                        developing a molecular theory capable of predicting                             preferential adsorption from fluid mixtures.                                                                                                                    Adsorption isotherms of single gases and their binary                           mixtures, and isosteric heats of adsorption of single gases,                    will be measured.  Experimental data collected for four binary                  systems will serve to test theories for predicting mixed-gas                    adsorption equilibria from single component isotherms and                       heats of adsorption.",
