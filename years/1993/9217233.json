 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic matter degradation and carbonate dissolution in surficial               deep-sea sediments control benthic fluxes to sea water and the                  extent of organic carbon and calcium carbonate preservation in the              ocean.  These processes are studied using microelectrodes to                    measure gradients of conductivity, oxygen and pH across the                     sediment-water interface.  A modelling study of certain pH results              to date reveals that the rate the in situ of calcite dissolution is             pressure-dependent and the rate constant is several orders of                   magnitude less than laboratory-determined values.  A recent field               comparison between fluxes calculated from microelectrode oxygen and             pH data, was not observed in the lander fluxes.  This result                    departs from present perceptions about the mechanisms of CaCo3                  dissolution on the sea floor, is and will be tested by exploring                mechanisms that might explain the discrepancy.  The research will               focus on a transect of microelectrode profiles and lander fluxes                across the saturation horizon on the Ceara Rise in the eastern                  equatorial Atlantic Ocean.  The study is a collaborative experiment             with Dr. Richard Jahnke (OCE-9201896) who is carrying out a benthic             flux experiment in this area.  Diagenesis mechanisms and the                    integrity of pH determinations will be tested by measuring pCO2                 across the sediment-water interface using a fiber-optic sensor                  constructed during the past year.",
