This proposal focuses  on the biochemical and molecular description of a protein involved  in the repair of methylated bases in the model higher plant  Arabidopsis thaliana. A cDNA clone involved in the repair of  methylated bases in the plant has been inserted into a strain of E.  coli defective in the repair of 3-methyladenine whereupon the  bacterium becomes more resistant to the lethal effects of the  alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate suggesting that the cDNA  encodes a 3-methyladenine glycosylase. The objectives of this  proposal are to conclusively determine the nature of the repair  activity and to determine the role of this gene in resistance to  methylating agents in vivo and to study the regulation of the gene.  %%%  Genetic mutation is the source of diversity upon which selection  acts. Many mutations, including many naturally occurring mutations,  are produced as an indirect result of DNA damage. The spectrum of  such mutations is determined by the interaction of a variety of  repair mechanisms and the results of this study will give insight  into one such mechanism in plants.  ***",
