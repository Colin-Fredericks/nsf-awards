 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309006  Espinosa  The purpose of this Research Initiation Award is to develop a  constitutive model for brittle amorphous materials, such as  ceramics and glass, for dynamic loading.  In particular, pressure-  shear experiments on glass thin films, in which high shear  stresses, high strain rates and high pressure are imposed, offer  ideal conditions for the derivation and validation of a  constitutive model describing these amorphous materials.  Such a  model will be incorporated in micromechanical simulations of  alumina polycrystals under the conditions of plate impact  experiments.  The postulated model is expected to predict such  phenomena as damage-induced anisotrophy and shear localization.  Model validation will be accomplished by comparison of simulated  and interferometrically measured velocity histories in normal  impact and pressure-shear experiments conducted on alumina samples.",
