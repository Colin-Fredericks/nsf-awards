 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of modern computing power has greatly enlarged                  the notion of a practical statistical procedure.  On the other                  hand, important advances in statistical theory over the past                    decade (e.g. modern semiparametrics, empirical processes,                       bootstrap theory) offer extraordinary opportunity for creativity                in the invention of effective statistical methods.  This proposal               is based upon the fact that a strong theoretical approach,                      combined with creative use of computing, can be an effective dual               attack on a number of substantive problems.  Specific problems                  proposed here include: regression with random coefficients                      (Beran, Millar), random sets arising in statistics (Millar,                     Nolan), adaptation and model selection (Beran, Nolan),                          probability forecasting via martingale methods (Nolan), the local               stochastic search method (Millar), directional data (Beran).                    Collaboration is intended when more than one investigator is                    listed.  Other topics are discussed in the individual proposals.                Our apparently disparate statistical topics are related in part                 by means of the methods with which we intend to solve them.                     These methods include: iterated bootstraps, applied empirical                   process theory, semiparametrics, minimum distance methods,                      Hajek-LeCam asymptotics, and the theory of stochastic procedures.                    The team of investigators intends to provide useful                        statistical tools for several substantive fields.  For example,                 our proposed estimation procedures in the random coefficient                    regression model are intended for use in econometrics, the                      studies of directional data are intended for use in geophysics,                 several of our proposed procedures in stochastic distance                       statistics will be used in the reliability analysis of electrical               systems.  Our proposed non-linear variants of the random                        coefficient regression model apply to the analysis of patient                   response curves to new pharmaceuticals.  Our statistical                        applications of random set theory were motivated by problems in                 optics.  Several of our graduate students will participate in the               project; indeed, two of them will incorporate their work on the                 last two subjects in their forthcoming PhD theses.  The approach                taken in this proposal involves both a relatively abstract                      analysis and a computer-intensive implementation; consequently,                 these graduate students will receive a broad and sound training                 as young statistical scientists.",
