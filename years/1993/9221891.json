 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sense of taste involves chemosensory stimuli that usually              are complex mixtures rather than single pure substances.  It                    remains critical to know whether the taste system treats stimulus               mixtures differently from their individually presented components.              This work uses the relatively simple taste system of the catfish,               which is exquisitely sensitive to amino acid stimuli, to understand             how such neural information about mixtures is processed.                        Electrophysiology on single nerve cells in the peripheral taste                 system will be used to see what types of mixture interactions                   (suppression or enhancement) are present, whether different nerves              process a mixture differently, and whether the mixture interactions             are predictable based on responses to the individual components of              the mixture.  Responses of nerve cells in the brain will reveal                 how the inputs from different peripheral fiber types converge, and              whether mixture information is processed differently between                    periphery and brain.  Specific behaviors elicited by particular                 amino acids, such as feeding, will be used to determine how well                discrimination can be done by taste alone, and how mixtures affect              behavior.  This study using this unique model system will have an               impact on neuroscience in general, by increasing our understanding              of how complex sensory information in general is processed, by                  providing useful comparisons with other model chemosensory systems              in insects and crustaceans, and by providing useful analogies to                current work in visual and auditory analysis of complex signals.                It also is likely to have an impact on biotechnology, by providing              useful information on how mixtures affect flavor, and by offering               the potential for chemosensory modulation of feeding behavior in                aquaculture.",
