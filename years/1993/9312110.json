 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of seabirds as part of the marine ecosystem has                  only recently been recognized. In order to understand the                       dynamics of polar marine ecosystems, a focus on the interaction                 between the physical environment and the major biological                       components, including such apex predators as marine mammals and                 seabirds, is required. This workshop will focus on Southern Ocean               seabird species, but will include arctic and temperate species.                 The development of new instrumentation and sampling techniques                  for studying seabirds during the last decade has given valuable                 insights into their physiology, population biology and community                ecology. As new approaches have developed, concern has been                     raised about the introduction of bias into the data being                       obtained. This workshop will address the topic of research                      protocols used in seabird studies with the aim of understanding                 the effects on the population studied and the data collected.",
