However, people often express                  ambivalence on important social topics -- attitudes that contain                a mixture of both positive and negative sentiments.  For example,               research over the past 20 years has shown that many Americans are               ambivalent in their attitudes toward racial minorities and toward               physically disabled persons.  Ambivalence helps to explain why a                person might sometimes treat members of a stigmatized group in a                favorable or helpful way, and at other times in an unfavorable or               hurtful way.  The present research addresses two important but                  unresolved problems in research on attitude ambivalence.  The                   problem is that satisfactory methods do not yet exist for                       measuring ambivalence.  Thus, one part of this research focuses                 on developing a valid and reliable measurement procedure.  The                  new procedure will facilitate research progress and can be                      applied in ongoing efforts to document and archive public opinion               on important social concerns.  The second problem is that                       relatively little is known about the structure and function of                  ambivalent attitudes.  it is currently believed that ambivalence                is caused by a conflict in fundamental values, and that people                  truly adhere to both positive and negative sentiments at the same               time.  However, ambivalence may also reflect poorly developed                   social attitudes, or it may reflect deliberate efforts to present               whatever social image is most desired at the time.  This research               seeks to distinguish among the alternative explanations by                      studying cognitive processes associated with the storage and                    retrieval of ambivalent attitudes.  The studies will provide a                  deeper understanding of why people often hold ambivalent                        attitudes.  Ultimately, the research will provide a theoretical                 basis for developing interventions that promote interracial                     harmony, that encourage healthful lifestyles, and that mobilize                 the Nation's efforts to remove the social and physical barriers                 that often confront disabled persons.",
