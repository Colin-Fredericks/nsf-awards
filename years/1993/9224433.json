The                                   effort is part of a Global Oscillation Network                                  Group (GONG) research to make observations,                                     from different sites around the globe, of the                                   oscillations at the surface of the sun, the                                     earth's nearest star.  Helioseismology, the                                     study of these solar oscillations, has been                                     developed as a new powerful tool that can probe                                 the solar interior with great precision similar                                 to the way that terrestrial seismology reveals                                  information about the interior of the earth.                                    During this phase the U.S. side, led by Dr.                                     John Leibacher, will assist the Indian team,                                    led by Dr. Arvind Bhatnagar, in preparing the                                   site, setting up the equipment and testing the                                  instrumentation and beginning the observations.                                                                                                                 Scope:  Under the GONG program, NOAO will                                       operate four of the six planned stations, in                                    Australia, Chile, Hawaii, and California.  The                                  fifth station, in the Canary Islands, will be                                   operated by the Institute de Astrofisica de                                     Canarias, Tenerife under a US-Spain cooperative                                 program.  The staff of USO and of the Tata                                      Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) will                                   operate the station at Udaipur.  They have the                                  necessary scientific qualifications and the                                     experience in solar observations, as well as                                    the necessary backing of the Government of                                      India, an important element in ensuring the                                     success of this long term joint research.                                       Visits are planned by the U.S. scientists to                                    Udaipur, and by the Indian scientists to the                                    NOAO and to other observatories in the U.S. for                                 training and preparation for the planned                                        research.",
