 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses a five-day short course to present faculty                    members with an integrated methodology for teaching                             undergraduate control theory applicable to a wide range of                      mechanical, electrical, thermal, and fluid systems. The program                 combines the insight and understanding of classical control                     (frequency domain) theory with the computational power of                       modern control (time domain) theory. Often, the tools of these                  two domains are taught in separate sections of a course, or in                  separate courses. This need not be the case. Frequency domain                   analysis provides excellent insight into system stability,                      performance and robustness. Time domain methods are best suited                 for computer applications. Having exposure to both time and                     frequency domains, students may learn how to freely move                        between them.  Such a capability provides students with both an                 excellent intuitive understanding of control theory, as well as                 the ability to exploit computational tools.  Participants will                  leave the course with a powerful set of resources (bound                        lecture notes, software, syllabi, and worked problems) that are                 easy to use.  Contact will be maintained with participants                      after the conclusion of the short course; a meeting of the                      participants will be organized at a technical conference to                     share lessons learned and to evaluate the effectiveness of                      integrating the short course concepts into their curricula.",
