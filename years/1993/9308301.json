 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308301  Hamilton    There is currently no consensus whatever among macroeconomists on  the effect of monetary policy on the economy.  Keynesian models  suggest that faster monetary growth would lower the nominal  interest rate by expanding the supply of credit, whereas  classical models would predict that faster monetary growth could  well raise the nominal interest rate as a result of inflationary  expectations.  The confusion and disagreements among academic  economists notwithstanding, the people who work for the Federal  Reserve's trading desk have the daily responsibility for using  open market operations to keep the Federal funds rate trading  within a narrow range.  This project is designed to develop a  convincing scientific measure of the effects that anticipated and  unanticipated open market operations by the Federal Reserve have  on nominal interest rates and real economy activity at horizons  from one day to two years.      This project has five components, each of which would comprise a  separate and major research effort.  The first step is to develop  a statistical description of daily fluctuations in the Fed funds  rate that is consistent with profit maximization by banks.  The  second step uses this description of the daily Fed funds market  along with an analysis of banks' incentives for borrowing at the  discount window to arrive at a prediction of the dynamic effects  of open market operations on the Fed funds rate.  The third step  weeks independent verification of the predicted multipliers based  on a biweekly vector autoregression (VAR); if the VAR proves to  be inconsistent with the theoretical analysis, the framework will  need to be modified accordingly. The fourth step uses term  structure relations to predict the effects of open market   operations on interest rates other than the Fed funds rate.   Again it is possible to corroborate these predictions  independently with vector autoregressions.  The fifth step will  use these results to assess the dynamic conseque nces of open  market operations for unemployment, output, and inflation.  ***",
