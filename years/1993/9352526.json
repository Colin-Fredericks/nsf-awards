 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will greatly enhance our ability to teach about                    the importance of accurate chemistry reports and their use in                   manufacturing and quality engineering.  Accurate chemistry                      reports are needed for on-site alloy preparation, on-site heat                  treatment activities, stress/strain diagram interpretation,                     metallographic sample analysis, material removal and horsepower                 calculations, and quality assurance report preparation. These                   subjects are covered more than once in at least four of our                     courses. The courses identified are required for all                            Engineering and Industrial Technology majors in the department.                 Specifically, the project will use a 24 element capable Glow                    Discharge Emissions Spectrometer and a Carbon/Sulfur                            Determinator system to accurately determine all alloying                        elements in the aluminum, copper base, and ferrous based                        alloys. This will allow students to instantly analyze and                       mathematically adjust furnace heats in the foundry, select                      appropriate phase diagrams and time/temperature/ transformation                 diagrams for various heat treatment activities and obtain hard                  copy print-outs of chemistry reports that would typically be                    used for quality assurance reports.",
