 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Bartell will study the dynamics of                   homogeneous nucleation in phase changes in which he will use                    two new techniques which are relevant to studying solid-state                   transformations.  Experimentally he will probe clusters                         generated in a supersonic flow using electron diffraction at                    various times-of-flight to monitor changes in packing during                    molecular \"phase transitions.\"  He will also characterize the                   molecular behavior computationally using molecular dynamics                     simulations.  The formation of \"critical nuclei\" will be                        revealed by the simulations.  Many of the same phase                            transitions will be studied using both techniques.                              %%%                                                                             Studies of nucleation, such as the changes from one phase to                    another in solid- or liquid-state matter, are of crucial                        importance in many areas of science and technology, such as                     meteorology, materials engineering, petroleum catalysis, and                    earth sciences.  This research program aims at acquiring a                      better understanding of such homogeneous phase changes by                       examining the different ways that molecules are packed in                       arrays.  A special emphasis of this program is a comparison of                  theoretical prediction and experimental measurement of the rate                 of phase transitions.  New tests of nucleation theory will be                   made, resulting in insights into the molecular mechanisms of                    phase changes.",
