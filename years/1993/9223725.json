 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223725  Maling      This project explores the hypothesis that the syntactic cases form  a Case Tier which is mapped onto a hierarchy or grammatical  functions, consisting roughly of SUBJECT > OBJECT > ADVERB.  This  approach contrasts clearly with much current work on Case Theory,  which assumes that Nominative and Accusative are \"structural\" cases  (or Cases) assigned to particular configurational positions.  The  widespread occurrence of VP-internal nominatives and/or \"nominative  objects\" constitutes a serious problem for structural theories of  case assignment, but is entirely expected under the Case Tier  model.    The project will explore the limits of cross-linguistic variation  within the Case Tier model, focusing on the assignment of  nominative or absolutive case to verbal complements and various  kinds of adverbial adjuncts, and the casemarking of ditransitive  verbs.  Basic questions to be addressed include:         - What are the formal principles controlling the mapping, and         parameters that allow for variation?         - Is there a basic distinction between arguments and adjuncts?          What kinds of adverbials may participate in the hierarchy?         - How does syntactic case interact with oblique case assigned         structurally to particular configuration positions?         - How do predicate nominals get case-marked?         - How do expletives get case-marked?         - What are the implications of this approach for GB Case              Theory, particularly the Case Filter and Burzio's                  Generalization?  When are passive verbs accusative case             assigners?    Data will be drawn from a wide variety of case systems, including  Finnish, Greek, Icelandic, Korean, Quechua and various Australian,  Philippine, Slavic and South Asian languages.    ***",
