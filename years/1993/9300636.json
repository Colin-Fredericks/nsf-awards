 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan will operate R/V LAURENTIAN during 1993              as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research             projects.  The LAURENTIAN is a 80' general research vessel                      constructed in 1974.  It is owned by the University of Michigan.                The ship is scheduled for 84 operating days in 1993, of which 74                days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates               primarily in the Great Lakes.                                                                                                                                   This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that must              be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship much be               specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained             crew members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not               operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and             therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels                   specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels                are operated by universities and research institution around the                country.                                                                                                                                                        The R/V LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the work proposed.  The              program considers the ship important part of the fleet due to its               location.  The Laurentian is the only UNOLS vessel hat operates in              the Great Lakes, and the University of Michigan should be                       encouraged to improve usage of the vessel.",
