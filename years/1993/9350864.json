 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observational astronomy and planetary science are vital parts                   of the undergraduate science curriculum at MIT. There are two                   (one freshman, one upper level) laboratory courses which teach                  astronomical observing techniques using 8-, 14, 16- and 24-inch                 telescopes. Rapid advances in digital imaging have rendered                     most astronomical laboratory teaching out of date and in                        critical need of improvement. Further, planetary science                        courses can be substantially improved by providing hands on                     access to spacecraft imagery.                                                   The undergraduate astronomy laboratory curriculum is being                      fully modernized through the purchase of charge-coupled device                  (CCD) camera systems to be used on existing telescopes. High                    quality and low cost astronomical CCD cameras for small                         telescopes have become commercially available only within the                   last year. Thus it is now possible to bring the state-of-the                    art technology in astronomical instrumentation into the                         classroom for both freshman and upper level laboratories.                       The CCD camera systems require Macintosh II computers for their                 operation. As these computers will also be used for the                         subsequent manipulation of images, the curriculum is being                      further improved through the introduction and teaching of image                 processing to all laboratory students, including freshman. The                  overall science and technology impact for educating students                    will therefore become enormous as image processing now pervades                 all areas of science, engineering, and medicine.                                In addition, the scope of this project is being expanded beyond                 astronomy laboratories to at least two planetary science                        courses through the availability of Voyager and other planetary                 mission images on compact disks. Daytime use of the Macintosh                   computers gives hands-on experience with real digital images to                 a very broad cross section of students. In this way the project                 increases the educational impact in terms of the number of                      students, in addition to bringing the latest in science and                     technology into the classroom.",
