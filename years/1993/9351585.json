 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the growth in complexity of today's computer applications,                 there is a need for increased computing power, not only in                      supercomputers, but also for other types of computers,                          including personal computers. Scientists and researchers agree                  that parallel processing represents the only way to increase                    computer speeds dramatically. They also believe that parallel                   processing will be the architecture of choice for future high                   performance computers. To prepare for the future, new                           scientists and engineers need to learn the architecture and                     programming of parallel systems at the undergraduate level. The                 goal of this project is to teach undergraduate students in                      electrical engineering the fundamental concepts of architecture                 and programming of systems with parallel processing. In order                   to be most effective and provide the strongest learning                         experiences, lectures in parallel processing should be coupled                  with well-planned, coordinated laboratory studies and                           experimentation. This proposed project will enable students to                  understand and to have hands-on experience on systems with                      parallel architectures through integrated lectures and                          laboratory experiments.",
