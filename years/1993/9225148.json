This project provides                   scientific theoretical underpinnings to our understanding of the                recurrence of major international disputes.  The goal is to study               mathematical representations of dispute sequences or histories by               drawing together the work of the principal researchers in                       international relations and embedding them in a framework that                  emphasizes common ties, interests, interconnections, and                        relationships among nations..  By analytic and computer                         explorations, attempts will be made to predict, for a sequence of               disputes, who will be a party to each dispute, what will happen in              each dispute, and how the outcome and details of each dispute will              affect the relationships among the nations involved.  These                     predictions will then be used to examine a number of major                      questions current in the international relations literature and                 develop empirical tests using several of the datasets that have                 been compiled by the National Science Foundation's project on Data              Development for International Research.                                                                                                                         This project goes beyond previous studies of internation conflict               because it examines dispute sequences, allows different nations to              move in and out of disputes from one time period to the next, and               brings to the forefront the important influence of relationships                among nations.",
