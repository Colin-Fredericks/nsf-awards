 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354156  Compton    Texas A&I University seeks planning grant funding to develop a full  proposal under the Model Institution of Excellence (MIE) project.   Planning activities will explore, evaluate, and develop programs in  eight principal areas.  The fundamental objective will be to  dramatically increase the quantity and quality of the SEM graduates  of Texas A&I University, a major national producer of BS degrees to  Hispanic Americans.  Our institutional mission is to establish  within South Texas a large, first generation of college educated  Hispanic professionals in those SEM careers vital to bringing our  educational economic infrastructure into parity with the rest of  Texas and the nation.  The planning focus will be on a broad-based  institutional program of enhancement of the SEM disciplines at  Texas A&I.    Texas A&I University President, Dr. Manuel L. Ibanez, named a four  member Council of Principal Investigators led by Dr. Phil Compton,  Dean of Engineering, and including Dr. Mario Medina, Dr. Mauro  Castro, and Dr. John Perez, to develop the Phase I and Phase II MIE  activities.  Four to seven member Focus Groups were named to fully  explore the initial directions in eight principal areas, including:    1) Center for Innovation and Teaching Excellence.  The CITE will  explore SEM curricula integration; collaborative and team learning;  faculty incentives, development and rewards; university teaching  and monitoring; and undergraduate research; 2) Human Interface  Development.  HID will explore programs to bring about fundamental  cultural change in the SEM experience and enhance the climate for  the successful recruitment and retention of Hispanics, particularly  women, to SEM degree programs; 3) SEM Bridges and Orientations.   SEMBO will explore the development and programmatic structure of  three bridge programs (Jump-Start SEM, SEM and Parent's Bridge) and  two orientation programs (community college and second tier); 4)  Technology Enabled Learning.  TEL will explore MIE  needs in  laboratory equipment, student computational needs, and  telecommunications and electronic networking; 5) Community College  Collaboration.  CCC will explore faculty exchanges, engineering  core curriculum development, transfer and colleges; 6) Industry  Participation. Broad-based industry participation in the MIE will  be sought; 7) Evaluation, Assessment and Cost Effectiveness.   Continuous evaluation, assessment and cost effectiveness analysis  will be an integral part of the planning process; and 8)  Budget  Allocations.  The Council of Principal Investigators in  consultation with President Ibanez will determine the final budget  allocations during the development of the full proposal based on a  cost effectiveness model that will maximize the goal attainment o  increased quantity and quality of Hispanic SEM graduates.",
