 "awd_abstract_narration": "Douglas will study the connection between problems in operator             theory on one hand and algebraic and analytic geometry in the                   presence of a hermitian metric.  The goal is to understand multi-               variate phenomena and to provide techniques to study more general               cases.  He will also investigate various invariants for elliptic                operators on manifolds.  Starting from the case of elliptic                     operators on compact, smooth manifolds without boundary which is                now classical, one is seeking to understand what happens when these             hypothesis are relaxed.                                                              The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is currently                 being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
