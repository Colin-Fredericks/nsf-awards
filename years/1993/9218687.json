 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focusses on the structure and stability of DNA, RNA,              and mixed DNA/RNA triple helices.  These novel DNA structures are               of great current interest due to the large number of possible                   applications of targeting duplex DNA with a third strand as well as             the possible in vivo role of such structure in, for example, gene               regulation.  The long-term goals of this work include understanding             the role of nucleotide sequence and composition, cation and ionic               strength in determining the stability of both pyrimidine-purine-                pyrimidine and purine-purine-pyrimidine triplexes and establishing              a high resolution model for the molecular structure of                          intermolecular triplexes.  In particular, we propose to determine               the sequence and composition requirements for formation of purine-              purine-pyrimidine triplexes using capillary and slab gel                        electrophoresis, along with circular dichroism and imino proton                 NMR.  Evaluation of the thermodynamic stability of triplexes will               be carried out both by UV melting analysis and by calorimetry,                  thereby permitting assessment of the validity of the all-or-none                model for triplex formation.  Additional stability studies will                 consider the effects of RNA strands, mismatches and base                        modification on triplex stability.  Finally, high resolution 2D and             3D NMR methods will be applied to the problem of determining the                structure of triplexes at a molecular level.                                    %%%                                                                             These studies will provide fundamental data on the stability and                structure of nucleic acid triplexes, which will be of importance in             a large number of potential applications of this unusual nucleic                acid structure.",
