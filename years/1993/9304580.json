 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304580  Langlands       The School of Mathematics of the Institute for Advanced  Study (IAS) was formed in 1930 at the founding of the IAS.  The  initial goal of the School was to provide a haven for scholars  where scholars could work in an environment that was  exceptionally favorable for conducting research.  Over the years,  other roles have emerged and the School has tried to accomplish  two complementary purposes, to foster mathematical research and  to educate mathematicians who are at various levels of maturity  beyond the doctorate.  Although it has functioned in a clearly  international context, the main impact of the Institute has been  on the U.S. mathematical community, with a majority of its  visitors having come from or been absorbed by it.  The Institute  frequently conducts programs in special areas of mathematics.   Recent topics have included the theory of turbulence in fluid  dynamics, computational number theory, and differential geometry.       This project will support postdoctoral and other visiting  researchers at the School of Mathematics of the Institute for  Advanced Study with the goal of supporting a wide spectrum of  mathematical research at the highest level.  The primary  component of the project will support postdoctoral researchers  and the remainder will support mid-career mathematicians whose  presence at the Institute provides postdoctoral Members unique  opportunities for consultation and collaboration.",
