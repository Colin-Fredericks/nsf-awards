 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hirsh is examining the creation of a new consensus emerging                 between electric utilities and consumers that results in increased              energy efficiency, lower customer costs, greater corporate profits,             and enhanced environmental quality.  In contrast to the acrimonious             relationship between utilities and customers that existed in the                1970's, the new \"social contract\" has at its core the increasing                sophistication of so-called \"demand-side management\" (DSM)                      technologies.  A catch-all phrase that subsumes conservation                    measures and high-efficiency, end-use technologies, demand-side                 management curbs customer requirements for electricity and reduces              the need for utilities to construct power plants, with all the                  attendant environmental savings.  In a novel fashion that promises              universal rewards, activist groups, utilities, and other players in             the late 1980's seized upon DSM technologies to reach a new                     consensus.                                                                                                                                                      Dr. Hirsh's study is focusing on technological, regulatory,                     political, and managerial events that have coalesced to create a                new social contract within the utility community.  Employing oral               history and documentary sources, his work extends research that                 deals with the restructuring of the utility industry that resulted              from technological and regulatory innovations in the 1970's and                 1980's.  Dr. Hirsh's goal is to interpret the utility industry's                transformation since the 1970's as the result of a process in which             various players negotiated their contractual roles and                          responsibilities.  The study promises to become not just a history              of these events but a useful planning tool for policy makers and                utility managers.",
