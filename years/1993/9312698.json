In  analyzing robust design experiments, Taguchi (1986) proposed a two-  step procedure to identify the \"optimal\" factor settings that  minimize the average quadratic loss.  His two-step procedure  becomes very effective in practice since it reduces the dimension  of the design optimization problem and it does not require re-  optimization for future changes of the target value.          This research will develop improved statistical methods for  analyzing robust design experiments.  The researchers develop a  multi-step analysis procedure for a variety of robust design  problems.  Their new procedure substantially reduces the dimension  of the design optimization problem and does not require  reoptimizaton for future changes of design requirements.  This  produces savings in the development time of product and  manufacturing process design and allows for flexible manufacturing.   The procedure also helps engineers better understand the physical  mechanism of the product and process and allows the designer to  make tradeoffs among the off-target bias and the individual process  variances contributed by different noise factors.       The research also identifies the appropriate robust design  objectives and establishes their relationships with the quality   loss functions for various robust design problems.  They will  strategies for implementing the multi-step procedure for smaller-  the-better and larger-the-better problems as well as for the  problems with several responses.",
