The conference will be held on               March 25-28 at the UCLA Conference Center at Lake Arrowhead,                    California.  The program includes 24 speakers, who were chosen both             for their scientific excellence and to provide a full mix of                    gender, race, and degree of professional advancement, as well as to             provide information of interest in both animal and plant                        development.  The topics to be addressed in the five formal                     sessions are:  \u01311! Asymmetric Cell Divisions in Differentiation,                \u01312! Control of Pattern Formation,  \u01313! Steroid Hormone Action on                the Developing Nervous System,  \u01314! Influences of Bacteria on the               Development of Higher Plants and Animals, and \u01315! Determinants of               Cell Fate.  The conference will also include a keynote address to               be given by Dr. Mark Konishi on the development of bird song, and               all attendees will be encouraged to present their own work at a                 formal poster session.",
