 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is the design, implementation, and  realistic application of a functional programming language  supporting the  development of scientific codes.  Functional  languages and scientific computing  appear to be singularly  mismatched.  The problem is not with the expressiveness  of these  languages, which is excellent, but their efficiency, which is  poor.  Recent research in functional languages suggests that assignment  may in fact be  consistent with referential transparency, if care  is taken in the overall  language design.  This research uses one  such language, the Imperative Lambda  Calculus (ILC), to develop  programs in the domain of random process modelling.  Although  inefficiency on sequential processors has long been a drawback of  functional languages, their efficiency on parallel processors has  been a strong  attraction.  An important goal of this research is  to obtain an efficient  parallel implementation of ILC.  The  potential for success in this endeavor is  high because the  presence of assignment in ILC obviates the transformation to  imperative form, leaving the compiler to handle only the (well  understood)  problems of higher-order functions and lazy  evaluation themselves.  To fully  exploit modern parallel  architectures, especially non-uniform memory access  machines,  control over the placement of data and scheduling of tasks needs  to  be provided by way of parallel language extensions to ILC.",
