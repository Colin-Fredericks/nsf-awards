 "awd_abstract_narration": "All living cells are constantly exposed to chemical and physical                agents that have the ability to alter the primary structure of DNA.             Thus, it should be expected that all organisms appears to have                  mechanisms for the removal or repair of this damage.  During the                last thirty years, a great of effort has been placed on trying to               elucidate the various DNA repair mechanisms that exist as well as               the relationship of these repair systems to cell survival,                      mutagenesis, genetic recombination, DNA replication,                            carcinogenesis, toxicology, differentiation and development.  The               Gram positive spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis a model for             the study of the interactions of DNA repair with differentiation.               Specifically, aspects of this SOS system are spontaneously                      activated when B. subtilis differentiates into its competent state.             The present study concentrates on the molecular mechanisms that                 regulate the damage induction and the competence specific induction             of din(DNA damage inducible) genes and of the recA gene.                        Operator/promoter regions from these genes have been isolated and               sequenced.  Regulatory elements, transcription start sites have                 been tentatively identified.  The preliminary data suggest the                  existence of complex regulatory networks involved in the regulation             of some of these genes, especially the recA promoter.  Using the                appropriate techniques of molecular biology and genetics, such as               S1 nuclease protection, gel mobility shift assays, Western Blots,               DNA sequencing, cloning mutational analysis, polymerase chain                   reaction, transposon inactivation, etc, the following questions                 will be addressed: 1) What DNA sequences are essential for the                  damage inducible expression of the recA gene; and 2) what DNA                   sequences are essential for the competence specific induction of                the recA gene?                                                                  %%%                                                                             This award should provide detailed insight into how bacterial cells             regulate an important aspect of their response to environmental                 stress.",
