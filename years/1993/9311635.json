Specifically, the investigators wish to examine the role of genetic connections between small newly established colonies and the correlated rate of population increase.  By studying both the genetic and demographic factors that influence the process of colonization in a common species, they will gain information useful for understanding the population dynamics of species made rare by habitat fragmentation.  %%%  The process of colonization in Silene alba will be studied experimentally three ways.  First the investigators will establish founder colonies planted in an array with graded spacing intervals between colonies.  Measurements of gene exchange between colonies will then be correlated with demographic attributes such as rates of colony growth.  Secondly, they will investigate the effects of the relatedness of the founders and the role of isolation on colonization establishment by comparing artificial colonies established with genetically variable outcrossed colonists to colonies established with genetically inbred (sib-mated) colonists.  Thirdly, the investigators will investigate the demographic effects of varying the number of individuals that found a colony.  Finally, they will conduct demographic genetic studies of natural colonization episodes as they occur in a previously censused metapopulation of Silene alba to provide a natural backdrop against which to interpret the experimental results.  ***    tonovics    This study will focus on the parameters that affects the colonization process in plants .
