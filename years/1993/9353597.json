Today, enrollment is 95% black.  A generation ago it was 80% white. student  performance by most measures is fair to poor, with most nationally normed test revealing most  Normandy students as \"below average.\"  Recently, however, the district has made important  strides toward improvement.  A strategic planning process helped residents and staff focus on  critical areas.  Partnerships with local businesses and the University of Missouri-St. Louis have  resulted in significant improvements and nationally recognized programs.  The percent of  graduating students going on to further education has increased.  Today, as the district prepares  to mark its centennial, it is proposing the Environments for Excellence program as the platform  for fundamental science and mathematics curriculum change that will result in substantially more  minority students completing a four year science/mathematics high school curriculum to prepare  for higher education and careers in science, engineering and mathematics.    The goals of Environments for Excellence are: 1) to have more than half of all students enter  9th grade having successfully completed algebra at the end of the fourth and fifth years of the  project; 2) to double the number of high school students enrolling in a four-year science and/or  mathematics sequence by the end of the third program year and to achieve a further fifty percent  increase by the end of the fifth year; 3) to develop, implement and assess a \"major investigation\"  exit competency for students.  Specific intervention strategies include curriculum reform, teacher  enhancement and student enrichment programs.  Objectives include: 1) extensive staff  development for hands -on lessons and action research teams, 2) expanded enrichment activities,  3) a new middle school experiential transition unit, 4) a new K-12 science/math Buddy System  which links students at all levels including the university, 5) new Independent Study curriculum  modules for high school students leading to an exit competency based on Project 2061 concepts,  and 6) and Essential Friends volunteer corps of community and university guest teachers who  can demonstrate practical applications of schooling.    The project is a teacher-driven, staff development oriented model.  In partnership with the  Network for Educational Development and the university, summer workshops and collaborative  action research teams will provide on-going development opportunities to Normandy teachers  with a focus on improved teaching strategies and methodologies.  The staff will implement a  thematic, \"beyond the classroom\" 2-week transition experience at the start of each school year  for all middle school students to improve science and mathematics learning readiness.  This will  be accomplished in partnership with Camp Wyman, a respected local outdoor education  program, and University.  The present award-winning science/math enhancement programs  (University partnership) will be expanded to all schools in the district.  A new link between the  middle and high school enhancement components will be implemented.     The five year program is designed to reach directly over 800 minority middle and high school  students each year - and through teaching strategies and methods for hands-on science, over  3000 minority elementary students.  Evaluation will be designed and guided by the University  of Missouri - St. Louis.",
