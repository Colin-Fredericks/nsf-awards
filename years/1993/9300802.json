The research will examine the                   occupational culture of municipal firefighters and the relationship             of that culture to racial, ethnic and gender diversity in the                   workforce.  The investigators will employ a range of qualitative                techniques of data collection, notably interviews and participant               observation, in a number of branches of the fire department in                  Oakland, California.  The study will focus on the aspects of                    occupational culture that resist the influx of workers from                     previously excluded minority groups and on variations in the                    process of occupational socialization that may reflect the race,                ethnicity or gender of the newcomer.                                                                                                                                 This research will contribute to the sociology of occupations,             race and ethnic relations, and gender, as well as increasing the                knowledge base for municipal and national policies concerning                   occupational integration of minority groups and women.  In addition             to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research, this award              will materially assist a highly promising student in completing                 research for the Ph.D. dissertation.  Thus it contributes to future             scientific manpower and the thorough training of the next                       generation of sociologists.",
