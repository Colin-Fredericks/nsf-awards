The  curriculum will provide the students with knowledge and skills  which can help them identify ethical issues in human subjects  research, consider moral ambiguities which arise within various  experimental contexts and generate resolutions sensitive to  alternative ethical approaches to specific research designs.   Classwork wiill expose students to cases illustrating research  methodologies of increasing ethical complexity, in major areas of  scientific inquiry in the field of psychology.  The case studies  will provide students with experience in evaluating the  applicability of scientific norms and the Ethical Principles of the  American Psychological Association to a broad range of research  problems.  During the first year of funding, instructional  materials and evaluation techniques will be developed and piloted,  followed by a 2-day summer faculty workshop.  During the second  year, the ethics education curriculum will be incorporated into  introductory psychology courses at Fordham and Loyola Universities.   Evaluation of the project will focus on faculty and student  satisfaction with the clarity, difficulty level, and relevance of  the curriculum as well as knowledge and skills in ethical reasoning  gained by students.  ***",
