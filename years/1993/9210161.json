 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research investigates the importance of international financial             market linkages for macroeconomic activity.  It is divided into                 three related topics, each part very cruical in improving our                   understanding concerning financial markets and fiscal policies in               an international setting.                                                                                                                                       (1) Financial Markets and Macroeconomic Linkages.  This part                    explores the effect of closing international markets in contingent              securities on the character of international business cycles and                asset prices.  Specifically, whether imposing plausible asset                   market restrictions improves the predictive power of international              real business cycle models will be explored.                                                                                                                    (2) The International Transmission of Fiscal Policy.  This part                 studies the international transmission of shifts in domestic tax                and expenditure policies, under alternative assumptions concerning              the extent of financial market linkages.  Initial research suggests             that asset market restrictions are likely to be very important for              the transmission of fiscal shocks.                                                                                                                              (3) Incomplete Asset Markets and Optimal Portfolio Choice.  This                part reopens the well known, but little understood, \"international              diversification puzzle\" (individuals tend to hold portfolios in                 which their country's assets represent a disproportionately large               share, relative to their share in the world market).  When labor                income risk is non-insurable, the optimal portfolio is shown to                 involve a short position in securities of national origin, in order             to optimally hedge this risk.  In this part of the project, the                 welfare effects of the observed deviations from the optimal                     portfolio under incomplete markets will be investigated.",
