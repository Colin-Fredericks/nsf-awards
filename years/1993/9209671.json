 "awd_abstract_narration": "A trend in the chemical industry is the design of smaller                       flexible multiproduct plants that are located close to the                      markets of consumption.  The motivation in building such                        plants lies not only in the reduction of transportation and                     inventory costs, but also for increasing the capability to                      provide a steady supply of products, and for responding more                    quickly to demand changes in each market.  Thus, flexible                       multiproduct plants offer the possibility of improving the                      competitiveness of chemical companies.                                                                                                                          Multiproduct plants can operate in batch or continuous mode,                    or with a combination of the two.  Typical examples of the                      former include plants for manufacturing pharmaceuticals, food                   and specialty chemicals; examples of the latter include plants                  for manufacturing a number of polymer products, paper mills                     and petroleum refineries.  The main difference that arises in                   multiproduct plants compared to large scale dedicated                           continuous plants is that scheduling and production planning                    play a major role in the operation of these plants.  Another                    issue is that uncertainties and fluctuations in the product                     demands tend to be much greater in multiproduct plants.                                                                                                         This research deals with the development of systematic methods                  for the design and scheduling of various types of flexible                      multiproduct chemical processes that operate in the continuous                  mode.  The work involves the development of models and                          solution techniques for the simultaneous design and scheduling                  of plants that consist of a sequence of stages and that are                     interconnected by intermediate inventory tanks.  The basic                      objective is to determine optimal trade-offs arising from the                   selection of design variables, operating conditions,                            sequencing of operations, length of production cycles and                       inventory levels.  Both rigorous and simplified models will be                  investigated, as well as methods for assessing and optimizing                   the flexibility of the designs in the face of uncertain                         demands.",
