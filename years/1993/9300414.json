The program will be conducted during a 12 week period in the                    summer.  Six participants will be chosen, with at least four from               schools other than Syracuse University.  A strong commitment will               be made to recruit students from groups that have traditionally                 been underrepresented in engineering.  Six faculty are involved in              the proposed work; their research expertise ranges from the                     generation of parallel algorithms for boundary layer calculations               to measurements in supersonic flows.  Before starting individual                projects each student will attend an intensive one week training                program that will address basic research techniques.  In addition               to one-on-one interaction with a faculty mentor, a complementary                program of activities is planned to enhance the professional                    development of each participant.  Among scheduled activities are                a workshop on professional writing, a discussion of ethics and                  professional responsibility, a lecture on public speaking, and                  presentations on the role of fluid dynamics research in industry                by invited speakers.  Participants also will prepare a written                  research proposal, a final written report and make oral                         presentations of proposed work and final results.",
