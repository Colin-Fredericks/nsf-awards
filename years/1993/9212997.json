The new research will address                                                   spatial propagation of quantum                                                  light fields in traveling-wave                                                  semiconductor amplifiers and                                                    superluminescent sources.                                                       Experiments will be designed to                                                 probe questions concerning quantum                                              noise in situations that are not                                                equivalent to cavity lasers, and                                                that will challenge theorists to go                                             beyond the typical photon rate-                                                 equation models now being applied                                               to similar problems. The broad goal                                             of the proposed research is to                                                  understand from a fundamental                                                   viewpoint some of the intrinsic                                                 interactions and mechanisms                                                     responsible for the quantum                                                     fluctuations of devices using                                                   semiconductor gain media, and to                                                learn the implications of these                                                 fluctuations for amplifier and SLD                                              operation.  Traveling-wave                                                      amplifiers will be studied which                                                have long (5-10mm) active regions,                                              defined by either a single long                                                 contact or multiple (segmented)                                                 contacts on a single wafer.                                                     By using long amplifier structures                                              attempts will be made to observe                                                the effects of gain saturation and                                              amplitude-to-phase coupling on the                                              optical spectrum and intensity                                                  fluctuations of these sources. The                                              studies will also focus on whether                                              saturation of a properly designed                                               amplifier can lead to intensity                                                 stabilization of the output of a                                                SLD.                                                                            The OSU group will provide                                                      expertise in fabrication and                                                    characterization of semiconductor                                               amplifiers and the UO                                                           group will carry out noise                                                      measurements and theoretical                                                    modeling.",
