 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313302  Sharpe  The same processes used to make integrated circuits have been  adapted to fabricate microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) from  ceramics and metals.  The resulting device has planar dimensions on  the order of tens to hundreds of micrometers and thicknesses on the  order of micrometers.  Engineers are now able to design a component  and predict its overall elastic response with confidence.  However,  they cannot yet predict the allowable static load or the life of a  component subjected to cyclic loading because those properties of  the materials are not available.  Furthermore, it is not at all  certain that standard design practices will scale to such a small  size because the microstructural features become increasingly  important.  The first objective of this research project is to  measure the strength and fatigue properties of thin specimens of  materials such as single- and poly- crystalline silicon and silicon  nitride that are commonly used in MEMS.  The testing required to  ascertain these properties will be performed on microsamples 200  micrometers wide by 200 micrometers thick in a tiny stainless steel  load frame with an external actuator and load cell.  The  significant feature of this method is that strain is measured  directly on the specimen over a gage length of 200 micrometers with  laser interferometry; this avoids the uncertainties that arise when  the overall elongation of the specimen is used to compute strain.   The second objective of the project is to use the strength and  fatigue data to design a prototype device that can be evaluated and  tested.  The device is a micro-scissors capable of cutting 10  micrometers diameter objects and having an overall length of 150  micrometers.  Scissors like these have potential for use in  minimally invasive microvascular surgery.  ***",
