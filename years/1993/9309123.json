 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309123  Bamieh  The design of robust controllers has progressed significantly in  the past decade, resulting in sophisticated design theories and  algorithms that produce high performance controllers in the  presence of uncertainty, and enabling the designer to probe the  fundamental limits of performance of control systems  configurations.  However, theoretical design problems ignore some  important implementations issues and constraints, and thus robust  control designs tend to be currently used for investigating  limits of performance rather than actually producing the  controllers.  The proposed research is centered around the idea of  incorporating general implementation constraints and requirements  in the theory of robust controller design.  An example is the  design of sampled-data controllers with continuous-time  performance objectives, which arise from the consideration that  sampled-data controllers.  Controller design with implementation  constraints give rise to theoretically challenging problems, and  their solution will greatly enhance the applicability of robust  control theory to control practice.  ***",
