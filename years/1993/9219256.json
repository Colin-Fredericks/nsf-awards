 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blue light photoreception plays an important role in the regulation             of higher plant development.  Blue light photoreceptors mediate                 directional growth toward the light on the one hand (phototropism)              and the extremely rapid inhibition of growth of stem elongation                 that is a part of the early de-etiolation response of emerging                  seedlings on the other.  There is strong evidence that these two                processes proceed through separate and independent signal                       transduction pathways.  The goals of this research are: (1) to                  isolate, characterize, and obtain sequence information on a plasma              membrane protein that is phosphorylated as a consequence of blue                light irradiation, and that appears to be involved at an early                  stage in phototropism, and (2) to isolate, characterize, and obtain             sequence information on a protein cross-reactive with several                   antibodies directed against animal intermediate filament proteins,              a protein that may be involved in the rapid inhibition of growth.               Arabidopsis thaliana mutants are available in both pathways, making             Arabidopsis the organism of choice for these studies.  It is                    expected that complete sequence information will be obtained on                 these two A. thaliana proteins involved respectively in two                     different blue light-induced signal transduction pathways.                      %%%                                                                             Blue light is an important environmental signal in plant growth and             development.  It stimulates plants to grow toward light and                     regulates the elongation of young seedlings as they emerge from the             soil.  This research will take advantage of the power of molecular              genetics to study the structure and role of two specific proteins               involved in early stages of the response of plants to blue light.               The results will be important contributions to our understanding of             the molecular basis of plant responses to the environment.",
