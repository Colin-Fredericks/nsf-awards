 "awd_abstract_narration": "High chlorophyll flourescent (hcf) mutants of higher plants                represent a class of nuclear genes required for the development of              photosynthetically active chloroplasts.  Their products may include             nuclear-encoded components of the photosynthetic apparatus, as well             as enzymes and regulatory genes required for co-factor biosynthesis             and plastid gene expression.  Some hcf mutants have pleiotropic                 effects on membrane protein assembly and thylakoid organization.                hcf106 is an example of such a mutation in maize:  The Hcf106 gene              has been cloned by transposon tagging, and the gene product shown               to be an integral chloroplast membrane protein.  It has a single                transmembrane domain, a potential nucleotide binding site, but no               other homology to known proteins.  Thylakoid membranes from mutant              chloroplasts have lost their characteristic lateral heterogeneity,              and fail to accumulate a subset of thylakoid membrane proteins.                 Analysis of derivative alleles, hypoploids and double mutants will              be used to genetically define the hcf106 lesion.                                Immunolocalization by suborganellar fractionation and immuno-                   electron microscopy will be used to investigate the possible roles              of this protein in thylakoid assembly.                                          %%%                                                                             Photosynthesis is the basis of life on the planet Earth and a                   complete understanding of the process as well as chloroplast                    biogenesis is one of the most important goals of biological                     research.",
