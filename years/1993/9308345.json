 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308345  Bourgain       Work on this project will focus on classical problems of  harmonic analysis in one and several variables. It continues  earlier studies of trigonometric series and their applications to  the harmonic analysis of higher dimensional oscillatory  integrals, and to exponential sums.  In the latter work, special  emphasis on periodic partial differential equations and estimates  of Dirichlet sums will be carried out.  Oscillatory integrals  enter into mathematical analysis in many ways.  They are  recognized as transforms identical in form to the Fourier  transform except that the phase, which is linear, is replaced by  a function of two variables, space and phase.  Work will also be  done on the so-called lambda-p sets which relate the norms of  functions constructed by subsets of orthogonal families with the  norms of the coefficients.  In the Hilbert space setting the  questions are trivial, but once one goes over to other norms,  even using simple trigonometric functions, the problems become  very difficult.  A new thrust involves studies of the Cauchy  problem in partial differential equations involving nonsmooth  boundary conditions.  Of concern is whether or not certain of the  fundamental partial differential equations of current interest  (nonlinear Schrodinger, for example) are well-posed in the  presence of rough boundaries.       The questions under investigation have direct bearing on  some of the fundamental issues facing researchers in harmonic  analysis and partial differential equations.  Not so obvious are  applications to such diverse areas as analytic number theory and  geometry measure theory.  ***",
