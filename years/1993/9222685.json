A full understanding of these                       phenomena is thus prerequisite to advance in many areas of                      linguistic research and technology.  This understanding requires                access to large labeled speech corpora.  Over the last year, a                  diverse group of researchers, from Electrical Engineers and                     Computer Scientists to Psychologists and Linguists, have                        cooperated in devising and testing a proposed standard prosodic                 transcription system for the purpose of annotating large multi-                 site shared corpora.  The next step in this cooperative effort is               to hold a workshop (1) to develop training materials for new                    transcribers and to plan tools for automating aspects of the                    transcription, (2) to investigate the full range of needs for                   prosodically annotated speech databases in the speech and natural               language research communities while coordinating plans for                      annotating existing data bases and for designing new ones in view               of these needs, and (3) to extend the standard to other dialects                of English.  The tangible products of the conference will be an                 online training course and a volume of Conference Notes edited                  from the reports and discussion at the conference.",
