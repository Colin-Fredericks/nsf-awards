It is a project                    to   study  the  changing  shape  of  voluntary  association                    activism in America in recent decades.  The researcher  will                    examine   Internal   Revenue  Service  data   on   voluntary                    associations in order to select a representative  sample  of                    such   associations  and  identify  their  founders.    Also                    supported would be work to develop an interview schedule and                    pilot   interviews  with  selected  founders  of   voluntary                    associations  in order to learn their what their  strategies                    were  in launching their organizations and how they saw  the                    environment for activism at that time.                                                This award will initiate research which should provide                    important  new  perspectives  on  the  social  climate   and                    political  dynamics  of  post-World  War  II  America.    In                    addition  to  the  scientific gains to be  achieved  by  the                    research,  this  award will materially  assist  a  promising                    young  researcher  to prepare for a larger project,  thereby                    contributing  to  the stengthening of the national  base  of                    women scientists and engineers.",
