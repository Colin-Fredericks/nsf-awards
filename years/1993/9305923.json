 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305923  Cattolico  Two enzymes, Rubisco (ribulose 1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase) and  PRK (phosphoribulose kinase) are exclusively limited to Calvin  cycle function.  The structure of PRK differs among organisms. For  example, Purple and Cyanobacteria have a PRK holoenzyme containing  6-8 subunits of 240,000 mwt.  Chlorophytes display a dimeric,  90,000 mwt kinase.  These organisms also significantly differ in  the mechanisms by which PRK is regulated.  To date, no published  paper exists concerning the biochemistry or genetics of PRK in a  marine plant.  The laboratory had no success, after extensive  study, using either chlorophytic or purple bacterial PRK  hybridization probes in localizing PRK in a chromophytic alga.   These data suggests that additional evolutionary signature(s) might  exist for PRK.  The primary goal of this project is to identify and  characterize the PRK gene in a marine chromophytic plant.  To this  end investigators will isolate and purify PRK to homogeneity using  the unicellular alga Heterosigma carterae as a model system.   Microsequencing of the purified kinase should allow construction of  appropriate oligonucleotide probes which can then be used to locate  the organellar coding site of PRK.  This site, once identified,  will allow the gene to be cloned and sequenced.  Putative domains  of PRK gene function will be assessed, and phylogenies will be  constructed in which the 9 known bacterial and chlorophytic plant  sequences will be compared.  The long term goals of this research  will address questions concerning the effect of light on PRK  protein (using antibodies) and gene (hybridization) regulation in  this golden-brown alga.  %%%  The process by which all plants and some bacteria convert CO2  (a\"greenhouse\" gas) into more complex organic molecules is known as  autotrophy.  The Calvin cycle ranks as the most universal mechanism  by which autotrophs fix CO2.  Although 1/2 of the total carbon  fixed on earth is processed by marine autotrophs that live in the  l ighted strata of the ocean, information on Calvin cycle function  in eukaryotes has been derived almost exclusively from terrestrial  plants and green algae (Chlorophyta).  The research presented in  this proposal on the analysis of the Calvin cycle enzyme,  phosphoribulose kinase represents a continued aggressive attempt to  address biological questions of survival by ocean dwelling  organisms at the molecular level.  The lack of centers emphasizing  molecular biotechnology transfer and student education in the ocean  sciences is well recognized.  ***",
