 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this study are (1) expression of individual histone H1             variants, (2) quantitation of their interactions with DNA of                    defined sequence, (3) determination of the effects of histone                   binding on the conformation of DNA utilizing CD spectroscopy, and               (4) determination of the roles of various H1 domain structures in               the interaction with DNA.  The results of this work will help                   clarify the nature of the interactions of relatively non-specific               DNA-binding proteins with DNA.  These studies will provide a                    preliminary indication of the nature of structure-function                      correlations in histone:DNA interactions.                                       %%%                                                                             The complexity of eucariotic organisms dictates a requirement for               large DNA structures which can only be accomodated in the limited               volume of the living cell by means of interactions with proteins                such as the histones which wrap the DNA into tightly packed                     structures which nonetheless permit access of the cell's                        biosynthetic machinery to the DNA.  The studies proposed                        investigate the interaction of naturally occurring variants of                  histone H1.  The histones are extremely difficult to purify.  This              study involves the novel use of pure histones produced by molecular             biological methods.  The affinity of the histones with a variety of             DNA structures will be examined and to some extent the structures               of the histones and DNA in the complexes will be determined.                    Comparison of the affinity of the various histone variants with DNA             structures will establish the relationship between the structures               of histones and their affinity for DNA.  The interaction of                     histones with DNA structures is an important subject for study                  because of the potential importance of DNA:histone complexes in                 controlling the function, development, and maturation of living                 cells.",
