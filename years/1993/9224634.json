 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Advanced Materials and Processing                     Program of the Chemistry Division in support of the research of                 Prof. Thomas Katz. The focus of this research is the rational                   development of ways to make a variety of helicenes, to obtain                   them optically active, and to link them together to produce                     ones much larger than available before.The Diels-Alder                          reactions of enol ethers of bis-acetophenones and related                       nitrogen and sulfur compounds will be studied as routes to the                  helicenes. A number of ways will be evaluated to obtain the                     helicenes optically active, including a new method using amine                  adducts of quinones. The methods to be studied for linking                      helicenes will include one using the Diels-Alder reaction, a                    second using photocondensations, a third involving a unique                     trimerization, a fourth using charge-transfer complexes, and a                  fifth using coordination complexation. The synthetic approaches                 will allow helicenes to be made in large quantities which has                   not been possible before. The synthesized helicenes should have                 novel optical properties, including very large rotational                       strengths, electronic absorptions at very low wavelengths, and                  nonlinear optical coefficients, which may impart unique                         material properties to these compounds.                                         %%%                                                                             Professor Katz will focus his work on the rational development                  of ways to make a variety of helicenes, which are helical                       molecules with unbroken chains of conjugated electrons that                     wind in one direction. The synthetic approaches will allow                      helicenes to be made in large quantities which has not been                     possible before. The novel optical properties of these                          helicenes may impart unique material properties to these                        compounds allowing them to be used to make high-density optical                 storage devices and new liquid-crystalline phases.",
