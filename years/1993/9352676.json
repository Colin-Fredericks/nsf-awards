 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352676  Gilliam     Texax Tech University is creating a computerized classroom-  laboratory that will have a major impact on undergraduate  science and mathematics education. First, it is providing a  classroom environment in which to teach the course \"Computa-  tional Techniques for Mathematics and Science\" (CTMS) for  prospective mathematics and science teachers as well as honors  calculus using Maple. This allows for both demonstration and  guidance while students gain hands-on experience during class.  This equipment is also being used as a laboratory in which  students can complete assignments and projects utilizing the  same computing format they deal with in class.Enrollment in  CTMS consists primarily of post-calculus students who are  mathematics majors or students seeking secondary mathematics  teacher certification. This course includes topics that develop  skills in programming, numerical computation, and symbolic  manipulation using primarily MATLAB and Maple. It also provides  training needed by a growing number of secondary teachers who  use computers in their classrooms. In particular, the Lubbock  Independent School District has recently implemented the use of  computer algebra systems into the secondary curriculum. The  Department of Mathematics offers a special summer workshop  modeled after the CTMS course for the purpose of introducing  secondary teachers to the uses of modern computer systems.  Since many high school graduates from the Lubbock area attend  Texas Tech, the CTMS course and the Summer Workshop for  secondary teachers are having an important influence on the  undergraduate program in mathematics and science at Texas Tech  and the high school mathematics curricula.            ***",
