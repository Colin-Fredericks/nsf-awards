 "awd_abstract_narration": "The orientation in philosophy to ethical questions has                          traditionally been to those that arise between individuals.  This               project seeks to shift away from the individualistic model of the               isolated professional struggling to decide what is right.  The                  emphasis in it is to consider questions about the ethical                       responsibilities of professionals in groups and organizations.                  To be undertaken by a philosopher who has already done extensive                work in the theory of collective resp9onsibility and in                         professional ethics, the project seeks to provide a group                       oriented picture of professional ethics.  It recognizes that                    professionals work increasingly for large corporations or                       institutions, and that they are members of communities that have                created expectations on the part of the public.  Generally,                     professionals are not isolated practitioners nor their own                      bosses; they must contend with various groups that have a                       significant impact on their professional lives.  Issues of                      collective and shared responsibility need to be integrated more                 fully into the educational and theoretical discussions of                       professional ethics.  This project will explore the theoretical                 and practical significance of reorienting the discussion of                     ethics in the professions to include attention to its                           institutional context.  It will produce a book focused on the                   professions of engineering and law, with significant application                to the various sciences.  This project will interest scholars as                well as profesionals from a wide spectrum of the population, most               importantly those who are currently writing or revising codes of                professional conduct.",
