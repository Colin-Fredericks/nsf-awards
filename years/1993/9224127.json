Hall, Jr. and two postdoctoral  research associates from the University of Arizona to collaborate in  polymer chemistry research with  Dr. H. G. Korth and Professor R.  Sustmann of the Institute for Organic Chemistry of the University of  Essen, Germany.  They are interested in the mechanism of initiation  of spontaneous polymerizations that occur when electron-rich and  electron-poor olefins are mixed.  Theoretical work and kinetic  studies on polymers by the U.S. group suggest that there is an  intermediate form which may be a diradical.  This in turn initiates  the formation of bonds and produces the polymer.  The missing link to  confirm the theory is the direct observation of the initiating  diradicals; this would be possible with electron-spin resonance (ESR)  spectroscopy.  The German participants in the project contribute  substantial expertise in ESR that will make it possible to observe  and identify these elusive diradical species.    This research addresses a fundamental question in polymers research.   The U.S. investigator has made important and ground-breaking  contributions toward understanding what initiates certain types of  polymerization reactions.  The proposed collaboration with German  investigators will produce new information on this complex process  and enhance his productive and innovative research program.  ***",
