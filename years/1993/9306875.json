 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanism of protein transport across specific intracellular              membranes is a central issue in cell biology.  This project focuses             on the hydrophobic signal sequences which direct the transfer of                secretory proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane,              the first step in the secretion of proteins from the cell.  The                 importance of signal sequences has been well-established, but their             fate, once removed from precursor proteins by the action of the ER              membrane protein signal peptidase, is unknown.  The objective of                the experiments to be carried out is to investigate the proteolysis             of different polypeptides containing functional signal sequences in             an effort to define a proposed signal peptide hydrolase activity in             Xenopus laevis oocytes.  The intracellular fates of both engineered             and unmodified cleaved signal peptides will be observed, and the                properties of their degradation will be characterized.  The results             of these investigations will be used to develop a working assay for             signal peptide hydrolases in Xenopus oocytes.  Such an assay is                 essential to efforts to identify and purify the proteins which                  specifically metabolize cleaved signal sequences.  These proteins               may be important not only for clearance of signal sequences from                cells, but also in the actual mechanism of translocation across the             ER membrane.  The technique which will be employed to follow the                fate of cleaved signal peptides in Xenopus oocytes may provide a                powerful tool for the dissection of discrete steps in the transfer              of proteins across the ER membrane in living cells.                             %%%                                                                             The transfer of proteins across the ER membrane as they are                     synthesized in eukaryotic cells is a critical first step in the                 trafficking of proteins to a variety of destinations, including                 lysosomes and the extracellular space (secretion).  Advances in our             understanding of this fundamental process are important not only                for general understanding of how cells function, but also for                   biotechnology.  This project addresses the question of the fate of              the cleaved signal sequence, that is, the piece of the newly-                   synthesized protein which is required for transport across the ER               membrane, but which is not part of the \"finished\" protein product               and is therefore enzymatically cleaved from the rest of the protein             very soon after the transfer is effected.  This is an area of cell              biology which has received very little attention, despite the high              level of research activity on other aspects of the secretory                    process.  There is a good likelihood that unforeseen new and                    potentially important insights will emerge from the work.",
