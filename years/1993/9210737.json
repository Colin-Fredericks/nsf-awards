 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with a topic of great importance in many                      industrial separation and purification operations, i.e., the                    transport of materials across surfactant-laden interfaces                       separating two macroscopic fluid phases.  At the colloidal                      level, an understanding of the dynamic processes in                             microemulsions systems as affected by the interfacial                           structure of the surfactant layer can lead to better                            mechanistic descriptions of such diverse phenomena as e.g.,                     phase transitions, emulsion stability, transport in cells and                   membrane mimetic media, and biocatalysis in reversed micellar                   systems.  To better understand the factors influencing these                    and other interfacial transport processes, the PIs plan to (i)                                                                                                  investigate the role of compressible and incompressible                         surfactant layers in retarding the transport of solutes across                                                                                                  interfaces separating two bulk phase, (ii) examine the                          kinetics of formation and coalescence of reversed micelles at                   such interfaces, and (iii) study experimentally the rate of                     association of probe molecules with their transport through,                    highly curved surfactant interfaces in water-in-oil                             microemulsion, (iv) develop a theoretical model for the                         interaction of solute molecules with the surfactant interface,                                                                                                  and of the formation and destruction rates of micelles at the                                                                                                   interface.  The thermal and structural relaxation behavior of                                                                                                   microemulsion systems will also be addressed.  To these ends,                                                                                                   the PIs will employ two complementary experimental techniques.                                                                                                  A unique diffusion cell has been designed which enables the                     introduction of a step change in concentration of the                           transferring solute very close to the interface without                         causing any disturbance of the interface itself.                                                                                                                The Iodine Laser Temperature Jump (ILTJ) method, a relaxation                                                                                                   technique, will be used to identify and quantify the                            interfacial diffusion time scales characteristic of the                         microemulsion systems.",
