 "awd_abstract_narration": "Athanas         A new processing platform and high-level compiler are being  developed that will significantly improve program execution  times.  Typical computationally intensive programs tend to spend  nearly all of their execution time within a small fraction of the  compiled executable code.  Efforts to improve the performance of  these tasks are best rewarded when focused on these frequently  accessed portions.  The new hardware and software will allow the  configuration and fundamental operations of a core processing  platform to adapt to the computationally intensive portions of a  targeted application.  The high-level language compiler is  responsible for identifying the computationally dominant portions  of an application, and for synthesizing hardware structures that  can be dynamically loaded into the processing platform for  subsequent execution.  A general-purpose platform embracing these  principles can reap the performance benefits of application-  specific processors, and also retain a general purpose nature by  accommodating a wide variety of tasks.  Furthermore, computer  architectures that adopt these techniques may become a cost-  effective alternative to conventional high-performance computing  platforms.",
