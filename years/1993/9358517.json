 "awd_abstract_narration": "9358517  Philipp    knowledge for teaching has been an area of much research in the  past decade.  Today some of the domains of knowledge identified  include knowledge of subject matter, pedagogical content  knowledge, knowledge of the curriculum, and knowledge of  learners.  Research has shown that experimental teachers who have  had access to research about students' thinking within well-  defined mathematical content domains listen to children explain  their mental processes used when solving problems and accept a  larger variety of strategies than control teachers.  These  experimental teachers also spend less time during class on drill  activities and more time on problem solving.  The research  extending this work to preservice teachers is just emerging, and  one area that has not yet been investigated is the relationship  between teachers' content knowledge, pedagogical content  knowledge, conceptions of mathematics, and understanding of  students' mathematical thinking.  This project will research the  relationship between preservice teachers' mathematics content  knowledge, their pedagogical content knowledge, their conceptions  of mathematics, and their understanding of students' mathematical  thinking at different points during their teacher preparation.   These findings will be compared to the relationship between these  forms of knowledge possessed by inservice teachers.  This  knowledge/belief will be operationalized through videotapes of  preservice and inservice teachers interviewing and tutoring  children.",
