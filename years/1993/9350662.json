 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350662  Benenson    The equipment is for an integrated lab-lecture elementary  physics course (enrollment about 180) for Lyman Briggs School,  which is a part of the College of Natural Science at Michigan  State University. The course serves as a model for future  physics courses with much larger enrollment in the Department  of Physics and Astronomy. The course contains several  innovative features: 1) full integration of lecture and  laboratory by team teaching with a single syllabus, 2) maximum  use of personal computers with existing general-use,  commercially available applications, 3) employment of video  frame grabbing techniques as a general purpose tool, and 4) an  open laboratory structure. The first three items have already  been tested on a limited basis. In the first lecture of the  week, the lecturer describes the laboratory experiment and does  one case. For example the lecturer could video tape an air  table with pucks colliding. By reading back the video frame by  frame, the lecturer can analyze the puck positions and show  that momentum and energy are conserved. Preliminary experiments  have been shown to give very good data. During the week, the  students schedule use of the camcorder and air table to do  their own experiment. After producing a few events on video  tape, the students then analyze them on the available  computers. For this purpose, plotting, spreadsheet, drawing,  etc. applications are available. The course begins by training  the students in the use of these programs. A very large amount  of extensive data is easily produced. Analysis on a spreadsheet  program and curve fitting with plotting packages produces very  professional looking results and introduces the students to the  modern ways in which research is actually performed. Data  reduction includes extensive error analysis via spreadsheets.     ***",
