The purpose of this project is to team university faculty and  students with industry researchers  who will work  closely together on a research project with real  technology transfer possibilities.   The industries will provide substantial matching funds for the  projects.    In 1990 the Governor of Montana ordered that the State develop a  Science and Technology  Policy and Plan for Montana.  Following the completion of this  Plan, over 200 citizens from  diverse backgrounds, occupations and regions of the State were  mobilized to create the Montana  Science and Technology Action Agenda.  This Agenda outlines  mechanisms by which Montana   can fully capitalize on its present resources, develop its  infrastructure in science and technology  and be prepared to move competitively into the 21st century.      The Action Plan cites technology transfer as critical to the growth  and health of Montana   companies.  The University System possesses a wealth of new ideas,  products and technologies   which can spin-off new businesses and be instrumental in the growth  of existing businesses.  It  is recognized that in building science and engineering  infrastructure the private sector must grow   and build concurrent with the universities so that the two will  nurture each other.    The state-wide EPSCoR Committee has chosen four research projects  which join the resources   and efforts of the university and the private sector.  These are  priorities of the Science Action  Agenda and of EPSCoR in that they involve industries which are  critical to the technological  future of the State in research cluster areas of the NSF EPSCoR  Program.  Two of the projects  fit into the cluster area of  Biotechnology.  The other two projects  fit with the Advanced  Materials Center.  These efforts will be coordinated with the NSF  EPSCoR Systemic  Improvement Initiative.",
