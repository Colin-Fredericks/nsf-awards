 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project will address several questions                        concerning subelliptic partial differential equations, especially               aspects of analytic hypoellipticity.  Related work on the                       representations of nilpotent Lie groups and harmonic analysis                   will also be carried out.  A differential operator is said to be                hypoelliptic if the smoothness of a solution of the corresponding               inhomogeneous equation is related to that of the inhomgeneous                   term (often referred to simply as the right-hand-side of the                    equation).  By analytic, one means that analytic solutions are                  guaranteed when the inhomogeneous term is analytic.  A few cases                where analytic hypoellipticity for elliptic operators occurs are                known and a few where it fails are also known.  The vast middle                 ground is untouched and represents the main theme of this                       research.  Additionally, in those cases where hypoellipticity                   fails, it remains to determine exactly what order of smoothness                 one can expect to possess and to relate it to underlying                        geometric invariants of the domain on which the operator is                     defined.  The work begins in three-dimensional Euclidean space,                 but has natural extensions to similar question on nilpotent                     groups like the Heisenberg group, as well as to compact manifolds               with boundary.                                                                       This research has many deep connections with the foundations               of partial differential equations.  On the surface it appears                   highly abstract and distant from the physical world.  In                        practice, the fundamental results derive from the study of                      specific examples which occur in various applications.  To give,                a priori, information about the solution of a complex partial                   differential equation can be of immense value to any user of                    mathematics.",
