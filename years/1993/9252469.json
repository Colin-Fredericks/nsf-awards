 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project aims at preparing high school                           mathematics teachers nationwide to integrate the use of                         graphing calculators and symbolic manipulation software into                    their teaching of calculus.  At the same time, the project                      also serves to disseminate instructional materials that                         integrate the use of such technology into the teaching of                       calculus (Oregon State University Calculus Project).                            Participating teachers will attend intensive two-week summer                    workshops offered at several sites around the country.                          During the following academic year these teachers will                          implement the new calculus program in their respective                          schools.  In this endeavor, they will be supported by a                         variety of communication networks (including electronic                         ones), as well as periodic two-day regional follow-up                           meetings.  The cognitive and affective factors involved in                      learning and teaching calculus with technology will be                          studied.  The evaluation component will focus on student and                    teacher outcomes, with special emphasis on student                              participation and performance in subsequent college                             mathematics courses.  A \"leadership\" component of the                           program will provide special training to 25 teachers aimed                      at preparing them to initiate in-service efforts around the                     country that involve calculus and technology.  The percentage of                matching funds is 67%",
