Cluster-M provides an environment for  efficiently designing highly parallel machine independent  software.  Using this tool a single parallel program can be  ported, mapped and executed on various multiprocessor  systems, therefore, significantly reducing the cost of  software development.  Also designing parallel algorithms  using Cluster-M is simple and need not be done by an expert.  The main components of this paradigm are the Cluster-M  specifications and representations. Cluster-M specification  is a highly parallel program which specifies the  communication and computation requirements of a solution to  a given problem by exploiting and emphasizing all the  concurrent tasks at every step of an algorithm.  On the  other hand, Cluster-M representation represents the  processor interconnection topology of the underlying  architectures.  The specification can be mapped onto  different Cluster-M representations, using the mapping  methodologies, which are proposed to be implemented.  ***",
