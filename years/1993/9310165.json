 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the renewal of a study of the rates of deposition,              seabed regeneration, and sediment accumulation of biogenic silica               and organic carbon in the Ross Sea, and is part of a coordinated                study of the biogenic silica and organic carbon cycling in the                  water column and the sediments of the Ross Sea.  The antarctic deep             sea and continental shelf environment is the major repository for               silica accumulation in the global ocean, and dominates the global               silica budget.  The Ross Sea is a particularly anomalous area in                which large amounts of biogenic silica are accumulating in modern               sediments, while the surface production rates are generally below               the global average.  Moreover the usual similarity between the                  oceanic silicon and carbon cycle does not appear to hold around                 Antarctica, and the two cycles are decoupled in that the rate of                particulate carbon deposition in the modern sediment is very low.               The overall project is an integrated study of the production,                   vertical transport, dissolution, and deposition processes, using                moored instrumentation and direct observations in a series of                   transects in the Ross Sea by R/V POLAR DUKE, carried out between                1989 and 1991.                                                                                                                                                  In this project, box cores, piston cores, and kasten cores were                 collected along specific transects in the Ross Sea that included                both silica-rich and silica-poor sediments.  Based on carbon-14                 chronologies and seabed analyses of biogenic silica and organic                 carbon content, three sites with accumulation rates differing by                several orders of magnitude have been identified.  At these sites               large differences in seabed preservation efficiency exist for both              biogenic silica and organic carbon.  This renewed effort will be                concerned with further analysis of data from the two cruises,                   including seabed regeneration rates, carbon-14 sediment                         chronologies, and horizontal transportation rates for biogenic                  material in the water column, and to integrate these results with               production and vertical transport studies being completed by other              cooperating investigators.",
