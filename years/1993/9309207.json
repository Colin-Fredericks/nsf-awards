 "awd_abstract_narration": "The task-level robot programming with computations of language             processing, kinematics, dynamics, path planning, control, collision             avoidance, and sensory fusion for multiple robot manipulators will              be achieved in real time via coarse-grain vectorization and                     parallelization using an industrial standard VMEbus-based                       distributed computing system consisting of multiple scalar and                  vector processors.  This computer system is assembled with off-                 the-shelf commercial VME boards.  The results of the project can,               therefore, be easily transferred for practical industrial                       applications and should thus make a meaningful and significant                  contribution towards the development of task-level multi-robot                  manipulation systems.  Since the programming environment is C/Unix              compatible, the robot programming can draw on the large existing                body of skilled C programmers and Unix users.                                        This research investigates task-level programming for                      manipulation of multiple robots, and studies its underlying                     principles and algorithms for force and motion coordinations,                   collision detection and collision avoidance, and sensor fusion.                 The research developes a theory for sensor-based multi-robot                    manipulation and force coordination with extensive information                  sharing among different robots, algorithms for collision detection              and collision avoidance of moving objects, and techniques for force             and vision sensor integration with robot motions.  A set of                     standard task-level functions are developed.  Through these task-               level functions, a complicated robot task can be conveniently                   accomplished.  The theory, algorithms, and task-level robot                     programming are validated through computer simulations as well as               physical experimentations.",
