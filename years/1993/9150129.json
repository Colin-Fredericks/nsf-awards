During Phase I, national experts in genetics problem                  solving and genetics education, problem solving in other sciences               and mathematics, and genetics will participate with exemplary high              school teachers in a convergence entitled \"Teaching Genetics:                   Recommendations and Research.\"  The conference will develop (a) a               consensus of recommendations/alternatives for teaching genetics in              high school so as to enhance student understanding of genetics and              enhance the development of student skills for solving genetics                  problems, (b) a listing of the current research support for each                recommendation, (c) a research agenda for testing the effect of                 implementing these recommendations in the classroom, and (d) a                  commitment from interested participants to cooperate in conducting              experimental studies that judge the value and practical                         effectiveness of the teaching recommendations.",
