 "awd_abstract_narration": "A summer research program for undergraduate  students will be                   carried out at the Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) for the                  summers of 1994, 1995, and 1996.  The program will be available to              undergraduates throughout the nation and a strong consideration                 will be made for women, under-represented minorities, and sophomore             students.  This program is a continuation of the Wyoming Infrared               Observatory's Summer Undergraduate Research Assistantship Program               (SURAP).                                                                                                                                                        A concurrent seminar/laboratory course will accompany this program              to provide direction and a coherent focus on the role this research             experience plays toward the student's formal undergraduate                      education.  All participants will be required to participate in a               group observational project, assist their advisors at the 2.3 meter             telescope, encouraged to complete their research within the summer,             and participate in the program's objectives to produce publishable              results.  A science ethics course will also be required of all                  participants.  The Principal Investigator plans to gradually expand             SURAP with an \"astronomy semester at Wyoming\" program to further                enhance the total research experience.  The WIRO tutorial in                    research has met these goals over the past six years and intends                to continue our standard of excellence in the Research Experience               for Undergraduates (REU) program.",
