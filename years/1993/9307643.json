 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307643  Fogelson       The investigator extends earlier analytical and  computational work on a microscopic-scale model of aggregation of  blood platelets in small diameter blood vessels, and on a  continuum model of aggregation in large diameter vessels.  Both  models involve interactions between the blood's fluid dynamics  and the mechanics and chemistry of developing aggregates.  For  the microscopic-scale model, the project involves: 1) completing  the development of the numerical tools needed to extend  simulations to three dimensions; 2) exploring and implementing  strategies for performing computationally intensive  three-dimensional calculations on high-performance parallel  computers; 3) constructing a computational analogue of the  experimental flow chamber of his collaborator J. Hubbell  (Chemical Engineering, University of Texas) and comparing  simulations with it to Hubbell's data on the dynamics of  aggregate growth; 4) modifying aspects of the model that concern  a platelet's response to pro-aggregating agents and the  efficiency of platelet-platelet cohesion; and 5) exploring the  range of behavior of the model and its sensitivity to parameter  variations.  For the continuum model, the project requires: 1)  developing numerical methods to study forms of the model that  allow strain-dependent aggregate breakup; 2) developing  techniques for incorporating into this model platelet  interactions with the blood vessel's wall or the reactive surface  of a prosthetic cardiac valve; and 3) studying the behavior of  the model when aggregation is initiated by exogenous stimuli in  bulk flow, or by contact with a reactive wall of  a coronary-artery-sized vessel.  In the latter context, it is  of particular interest to study how the interaction between flow  and vessel geometry affects aggregate formation.       Platelet aggregates form on blood vessel walls in response  to vascular injury; they are also major constituents of  the life-threatening blood clots associated with vascular diseas e  and with the use of cardiovascular prostheses.  The modeling and  simulations carried out in this project complement  traditional laboratory experimentation.  They provide detailed  information, of a type that is generally not attainable in the  laboratory, about the dynamic interactions among the components  of the aggregation response.  This additional information will  increase our insight into the physical and chemical controls on  the aggregation process.  These studies also lay the foundations  for further development of aggregation models and for their  application to clinically interesting questions, including how  flow and vessel geometry interact to influence aggregation within  natural vessels, such as the coronary arteries, or prosthetic  devices, such as vascular grafts or artificial hearts.  The  numerical tools developed in this project should also be valuable  in solving a broad range of biofluid dynamics and engineering  problems.  ***",
