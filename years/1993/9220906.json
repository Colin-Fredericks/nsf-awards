 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inbreeding depression has been the subject of considerable                 attention for over 100 years.  Although many researchers have                   quantified how progeny generated by self-matings perform poorly                 relative to progeny generated from matings between two different                individuals, few empirical studies have focused on the differences              in inbreeding depression in populations that differ in their                    natural outcrossing rates.  The main goal of the proposed research              is to determine the underlying genetic basis of the expression of               inbreeding depression in two closely related native species from                northern California, the self-pollinating Mimulas micranthus and                the insect dependent (thus outcrossing) M. guttatus. The objectives             are three-fold.  First, to quantify the degree of inbreeding                    depression in terms of both male and female function in two                     populations of both the selfing and outcrossing species.  The                   effects of inbreeding on female reproductive function are well                  documented, but he effects on male function, such as pollen                     production are largely unknown.  Second, the genetic basis of                   inbreeding depression will be quantified by two greenhouse breeding             experiments.  Third, among-family level variation in inbreeding                 depression will be quantified in the outcrossing M. guttatus as a               function of the observed floral variation.  This two-species                    comparison will examine the relationship between the mating system              and the genetic basis of the observed inbreeding depression, thus               providing baseline information on the genetics driving changes in               mating systems in natural plant populations.  The results generated             from the research on these two related species will provide                     insights into preserving both crop gene pool diversity and rare                 species genetic diversity.***                                                    //",
