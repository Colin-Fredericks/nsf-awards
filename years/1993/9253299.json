 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three-year program to establish a                             partnership of five universities, fifteen community                             colleges, the State Department of Education, and school                         districts from throughout the state of Mississippi to                           improve high school biology education.  In order to                             accomplish this goal, ten five-member teams from throughout                     the state (three high school teachers and two community                         college instructors per team) will be prepared as master                        teachers at two summer institutes in the content areas of                       molecular biology, genetics and evolution.  The institutes                      will be hosted by The University of Southern Mississippi.                                                                                                       The teams will collaborate with the State Department of                         Education in the revision of the high school biology                            curriculum and will conduct 52 hour workshops at local sites                    throughout the state that will update an additional 470 high                    school biology teachers in the content area focus and                           appropriate pedagogy.  An equipment lending program will                        support the equipment needs of the teachers in the                              implementation of new laboratory explorations.                                                                                                                  The specific objectives of the project are to help teachers                     1) integrate the processes of science skills to the teaching                    of biology concepts, 2) build students' conceptual                              understanding of biology rather than the recall of isolated                     facts, 3) acquire laboratory and field skills appropriate                       for teaching these contemporary topics, and 4) to develop                       strategies to teach decision-making on biological and                           controversial issues.                                                                                                                                           Cost sharing equals 51.9% of the NSF award.",
