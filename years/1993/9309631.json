 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309631  Benjaafar       Although the issue of flexibility has become increasingly  important to the design and operation of manufacturing systems, it  has remained to a large degree ambiguous and poorly understood.   The objective of the research is to address some of these  limitations.  In particular, the focus of efforts will be on (1)  developing a generic modeling framework capable of capturing the  various dimensions of flexibility in manufacturing, (2) providing  robust and useful measure(s) of flexibility that reflect these  various dimensions, and (3) establishing clear relationships  between the degree of flexibility in a manufacturing system and the  system's level of performance.  More specifically they will address  the following questions:   (1) What constitutes flexibility and to which physical and logical  characteristics in a manufacturing system can it be traced?   (2) How can these characteristics be modeled so that flexibility  can be easily measured and analyzed?     (3) Which system performances measures, if any, are positively  correlated to flexibility and what are the characteristics of such  correlations?    (4) What are the conditions under which flexibility may be of value  and what are the operation requirements necessary for realizing  this value?    (5) How can the costs and benefits of flexibility be traded-off and  optimal, and/or affordable, levels of flexibility be determined?         The impact of the research results will be in increased  useability of modeling and analysis tools and better measures of  industrial system flexibility and performance.",
