 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamics of plant communities have long been of interest               to ecologists, yet these dynamics are poorly understood.  Direct,               long-term observations of populations and communities are                       difficult, forcing the use of indirect methods to study community               stability and dynamics.  Given the potential anthropogenic                      changes in climate, the need for long-term, baseline data on                    forest community dynamics increases.  However, there are few                    areas with large, intact stands of old-growth forest available                  for long-term inventory and monitoring.       This research will                use existing data bases from two old-growth stands in northern                  Michigan to address hypotheses concerning the long-term stability               and dynamics of northern hardwood forests.                                      These data bases were initially collected by Forest Service                     personnel starting in 1934 for one stand, and 1961 in the other                 stand.  These data will be combined with newly collected data                   sets on species growth rates, seedling establishment, sapling                   growth, and gap dynamics to test several hypotheses concerning                  the dynamics of old-growth forest communities.                                       The participation of undergraduate students is a fundamental                component of the research program.  This research will involve                 up to 20 undergraduate students over a four year period.                        Students will be involved with all components of the study form                 project design and data collection, to data analysis and                        publication.  Overall, this project will provide and opportunity                to involve undergraduates in scientific research, as well as                    gather important long- and short-term data on the effects of                    climate change on old- growth forest dynamics.",
