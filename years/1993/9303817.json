Two lines of research will be pursued.  The first study will compare the rotational reorientation of  Coumarin 102 dye in non-polar decalin with the reorientation  lifetime in fluorinated alcohols to see what the effects of  hydrogen bonding are on the reorientation times.  The second  study will examine the photoinduced double proton transfer  reaction of hydrogen bonded 1-azacarbazole : alcohol complexes  in alcohol solutions and in dilute aprotic solvents.  Most of  the work will employ time resolved fluorescence measurements.  %%%  The physical and chemical properties of solutes are profoundly  influenced by the solution environment.  The influence of  solvent on chemical reactions and the dynamical processes which  occur in solution have been widely investigated.  This research  has shown that, rather than providing an inert and static  medium in which physical and chemical processes occur, the  solvent often plays an active and crucial role in these  processes.  The investigvations to be performed by Moog will be  specifically directed at understanding the role which  intermolecular hydrogen bonding plays in solute reactivity and  dynamics in solution.  ***",
