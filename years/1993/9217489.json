 "awd_abstract_narration": "9217489  Griliches    This three-year award supports ongoing U.S.-France cooperative  research on the topic of industrial productivity.  The project's  investigators are Zvi Griliches, the National Bureau of Economic  Research (NBER), Bronwyn Hall, University of California,  Berkeley, and Jacques Mairesse, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en  Sciences Sociales and Institute National de la Statistique et des  Etudes Economiques.  The National Bureau of Economic Research,  under the direction of Dr. Griliches, has been conducting a major  study in this area for the last several years with support from  NSF.    Joint research to date between the U.S. and French investigators  has concentrated on three major topics:  comparative studies of  productivity growth; econometric issues in the analysis of panel  data; and the effect of output-input factor decisions on the  sources of productivity growth at the firm and industry level,  particularly in the service sector.  The investigators will  continue their work on econometric methods on panel data,  emphasizing those which allow for unbalanced panels.  Their  comparative studies of productivity growth will also be extended  in several directions and include factors for capacity  utilization, product-line diversification and the development of  firm-level price indices.  They also plan more detailed studies  of the contribution of research and development to productivity  and growth, using newly available French data on innovation and  patents.  Both French and U.S. investigators are highly regarded  experts in this field.  The project addresses important questions  for national economic policy in both countries.  It takes  advantage of U.S. and French complementary expertise and provides  access to large data sets in France.  Results will advance our  understanding of the influence of technological change and other  factors on productivity growth.  ***",
