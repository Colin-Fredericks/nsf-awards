 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will compare reading processes in three different                  writing systems:  English, Chinese, and Hebrew.  Because these                  three writing systems differ in structure, they may also differ in              how they are read.  The key difference concerns how the sounds of               the language are connected to the writing.  In English, which is an             alphabetic system, sounds and letters can be connected.  In                     Chinese, since there are no letters, the only speech sounds                     involved in reading should derive from whole words.  Hebrew is an               intermediate case, having letters, but omitting vowels.  The                    research method will employ experiments on word identification in               the three systems.  As a result of these comparisons, the research              will identify both the universal role of phonology across different             writing systems and the specific character each system provides to              reading.  In the long run, the insights derived from this research              can help us devise strategies to overcome reading disabilities in               English and other languages.",
