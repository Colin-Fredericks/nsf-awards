 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two objectives: (1) to develop a theoretical                   framework that integrates and extends existing models of capital                investment; and (2) to apply this framework to data on capital                  investment by firms and by industries.  The theoretical framework               emphasizes the costs of adjusting the size of the capital stock                 and includes the facts that firms may pay a higher price for                    capital when they buy than when they sell capital, that it may                  cost more per unit to adjust the capital stock quickly rather                   than slowly, and that adjusting the capital stock may involve                   fixed costs.  Rather than explore the role of a single adjustment               technology in isolation, this model specification allows the                    nesting of possible adjustment costs, resale market                             imperfections, and acquisition costs, while further allowing for                fixed adjustment costs and irreversible investment.  Also, the                  resulting investment function is simple enough to admit direct                  empirical examination, and the tractability of aggregation                      problems  allows estimation in both firm-level and industry level               data.  This research is important because it holds the prospect                 of making an important break through in better understanding the                investment behavior of firms and industries.",
