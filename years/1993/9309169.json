 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309169  Dayhoff  This Career Advancement Award is made to Judith Dayhoff to study  neural computations on ensembles and intercellular signaling.   Extracellular multiunit signals contain significant temporal  structure, such as multiunit synchronies, and the PI plans to  extend and apply methods for identification of timing  relationships in multiunit recordings.  On identification of  timing relationships in multiunit recording, the PI plans to  implement and characterize a new analysis technique that detects  synchronous activity in ensembles of neurons.  This will focus on  nerve impulse trains and the temporal placement of nerve impulses  with respect to one another.  The time relationships to be  identified are important because synchronously firing groups are  candidate mechanisms for neural coding, representation, and  processing.  The project includes the implementation of a new  fast calculation method for the detection of synchronous firing  in simultaneous nerve impulse trains, and validation of the new  computation methods and characterization of its sensitivity to  temporal structure in simulated data.  The techniques will then  be exported to laboratories actively engaged in mulitunit neural  recording.  As follow-on work, this project will stimulate  collaborations between the PI and experimental laboratories where  mulitunit recording is taking place.  ***",
