 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wang will continue his research on K-homology of smooth                    algebras, investigating its striking application in operator                    theory, its deep connection with geometry and dynamical systems,                and with quantization theories.  The machineries developed in                   noncommutative differential geometry in the last decade, and the                techniques and concepts in quantized functional analysis are the                key tolls in this investigation.                                                     The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
