 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to develop and implement a new \"track-based\"                 advanced physics laboratory course, where students undertake a                  series of related experiments in a single area of physics.  The                 experiments in a given track begin simply, and expand into                      greater levels of sophistication as the course progresses.                      Although the experiments themselves cover only one area, the                    experimental techniques used apply to many other areas of                       physics.  A comprehensive tutorial is to accompany and describe                 the experiments, providing the necessary background and                         motivation for the laboratory investigations.  It is believed                   that such a track-based lab course is more effective than                       traditional physics laboratory courses at teaching students                     experimental physics, and at instilling in students a higher                    level of confidence and competence in the laboratory.Two tracks                 will be created: 1) laser-based atomic/molecular/optical                        physics, and 2) acoustics.  The first track makes use of new                    and significant advances in semiconductor diode laser                           technology.  Applying recently-developed techniques, visible                    670-nm diode lasers are being made into tunable narrow-                         linewidth laser light sources, which emit at the wavelength of                  the D-lines of lithium.  Using these laser tools, fundamental                   phenomena in atomic and optical physics are being demonstrated.                 The second track explores several aspects of classical and                      modern acoustics, with special attention paid to recent                         advances in quantum and non-linear acoustics.",
