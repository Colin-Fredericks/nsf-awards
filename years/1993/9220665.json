 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory experiments using Protists will test two alternate              ideas about the limits to food chain length:  dynamic fragility of              longer chains versus interactions between productivity and the                  efficiency of energy transfer between trophic levels.  A second                 series of experiments will test the contributions of environmental              variation and storage effects to the maintenance of high ciliate                diversity in ephemeral rain pools and their laboratory                          counterparts.  A third set of experiments will explore the role of              coevolution in producing observed temporal patterns of population               dynamics, and will examine whether the presence or absence of                   sexual reproduction affects rates of coevolution.  Other                        experiments will continue our ongoing investigations of the effects             of omnivores and species richness on web dynamics.  These                       experiments assemble replicated food webs of protozoans that differ             in the number of trophic levels, productivity, omnivory, or species             richness, and then evaluate the persistence and temporal                        variability in the abundance of each species in unmanipulated                   control communities and similar communities and similar communities             subjected to small perturbations in nutrient levels.                            %%%                                                                             This research will test food web theory which predicts relations                between the structure of food webs and the dynamics of their                    component populations.  Such information is valuable for                        understanding and predicting human impacts on complex aquatic                   communities.",
