Yet the collision rate and the distribution of slip among tectonic  units in Asia remains to be measured directly.  The PI has  established a network of control points in India, Nepal and China  whose remeasurement and analysis will provide velocity estimates  of the large scale processes of north-south convergence and east-  west extension.  These numbers will constrain the kinematics of  the Tibetan Plateau, and the rate of strain development responsible  for great earthquakes in the Himalaya.  In 1993/4 he plans to  measure a small geodetic network across the Altyn Tagh fault, the  largest on-land strike slop fault outside California, which will  further constrain deformation rates in Tibet and the Kun Lun  Mountains.  Elsewhere, by operating GPS receivers in Nepal and  inviting colleagues in India and China to operate receivers  simultaneously on key tectonic units in their countries he is able  to undertake cost effective measurements of large scale Asian  tectonics.  ***",
