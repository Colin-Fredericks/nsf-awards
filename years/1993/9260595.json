 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many organizations, users of desktop personal computers and                  workstations depend on a network for shared access to files                     and other resources.  Recent improvements in hardware                           technology have made portable computers the fastest growing                     segment in personal computing.  However, standard system                        software has changed little in response to the new machines.                    Network access and stand-alone usage are supported, but there                   is no assistance for networked portable machines when they are                  disconnected.  This deficiency significantly limits the                         productivity enhancement achievable with portable machines.                     Research techniques suggest that a much higher level of                         disconnected service is possible.                                                                                                                               This award supports development of new concepts and techniques                  for supporting network users when their systems are                             disconnected from the network.  Disconnection must be treated                   as a normal, desirable mode of operation rather than an error                   condition.  For days at a time, disconnected machines should                    be able to deliver most of the rich functionality associated                    with the network environment.  This includes access to                          (pseudo) shared network files and other resources.  Providing                   this rich collaborative work capability around the clock,                       irrespective of geographic location, could alter the way                        individuals approach their work and significantly increase                      productivity.  The research will develop and validate the                       underlying technology for a system software product for                         networked portable computers.",
