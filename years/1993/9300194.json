 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project.  The             project investigates the feasibility of using knowledge from the                steady and sporadic background noise sources that occur in                      arbitrary environments not conditioned for speech recognition to                isolate them from speaker-independent articulation of telephone                 numbers in a recognition task.  The environmental noisy background              could be found in home, offices, and automobiles; the types of                  steady-state noise include those originating from an air                        conditioner or from a car engine, while the sporadic noise sources              are discrete events such as a person walking, a door slammed, a                 ringing telephone, or an appliance being switched on.  The problem              is addressed on the basis of a signal-understanding architecture                with context-dependent reconfiguration for the feature extraction               process.  The results from an initial round of feature extraction               are analyzed for time-frequency regions consistent with the                     system's knowledge regarding the correlates of various speech and               non-speech sources.  Those regions of higher certainty - or islands             of certainty - are considered in the prediction of potentially                  masked speech by non-speech sources that may occur in other parts               of the utterance.  Those regions are used also as a basis in the                reconfiguration of the feature-extraction process which is used in              analyzing the masked region as well as in verifying, pruning, and               refining hypotheses in all regions.  In summary, while the goal of              the system is to recognize speech, it must also perform the                     recognition on non-speech sounds to help the speech recognition                 process.                                                                         //",
