 "awd_abstract_narration": "The socialization of lawyers is an important factor in shaping the              legal profession, both with respect to the behavior patterns that               characterize legal practice and with respect to the attitudes that              underlie the role of lawyers in society.  Since lawyers have a                  powerful and pervasive influence on the social fabric, it is                    important to understand their professional development.  It is well             known that the techniques used by law schools in training students              to \"think like lawyers\" have a formative effect on the ways in                  which law school graduates then approach their professional tasks               and obligations.  The socializing effects of different kinds of law             firms have received far less scholarly attention, in part because               of the difficulty of gaining access to firms in order to observe                and interview attorneys at work.  Since law firms, like all                     organizations, develop their own occupational cultures, it is                   argued that cultural expectations and pressures will vary depending             on how different professional perspectives dominate from firm to                firm.  It is also likely that these perspectives fall into a few                distinct patterns that will lead to a systematic way to categorize              the socialization of lawyers in firms.                                                                                                                          This doctoral dissertation will be based on interviews with 25-30               first- through third-year associates at each of the 30 largest law              firms in New York City, where structural variables such as size,                rates of growth, span of control and type of work done are similar.             The study hypothesizes that these firms will exhibit one of two                 distinct types of organizational culture, termed collegial-driven               and market-driven.  Six measures of differences in organizational               culture will be employed:  date of formation, external and internal             spacial relations, professional hierarchy, recruitment and                      promotion styles, division of professional labor, and command and               control regimes.  Additional interviews will include partners                   responsible for hiring, junior associate oversight and training,                practice administration, and firm mamagement, as well as former                 associates of each firm.                                                                                                                                        The research will make important theoretical contributions to our               understanding of the processes affecting professionalization in                 general, and specifically of the development of professional                    identity and values among lawyers.  The latter has important                    implications for the design of legal practice and organization, as              well.",
