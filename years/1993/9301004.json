 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variety of x-ray diffraction studies are proposed for improving               our knowledge of the structures of quasicrystals.  Multiple Bragg               scattering will be used to measure phases of structure factors,                 and, in particular, to address the question whether or not certain              quasicrystals have a center of inversion.  It is proposed to                    measure intensity of Bragg reflection using synchrotron high energy             x-rays, in order to circumvent the extinction and the absorption                problems.  Absolute measurements will be performed by measuring                 Compton scattering.  The possibility for dynamical diffraction                  effects in quasicrystals will be explored.  Standing waves                      experiments are proposed for the purpose of gaining some knowledge              about the reciprocal positions in real space of the various atomic              planes.  The general purpose of the proposed research is to provide             experimental information useful for a determination of the atomic               sites in Al-Cu-Fe and Al-Pd-Mn quasicrystals.                                   %%%                                                                             Quasicrystals are metallic alloys that have many properties in                  common with ordinary crystals, yet their symmetry properties are                not compatible with the laws of crystallography.  The goal of this              proposal is to determine the locations of the atomic sites.                     Besides their interest from the point of view of basic science,                 their exceptional resistance to oxidation, high temperature and                 alkaline corrosion makes then interesting as new materials.",
