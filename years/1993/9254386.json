 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project would bring together 35 outstanding teachers                        from Nebraska identifying them as 'Fellows'.  These teachers                    would, over the course of the next three years, pursue a                        masters degree in economics.  The courses for the program                       are all regular catalog courses.  Special sections of each                      of the courses will have entry restricted to the institute                      Fellows.  Each of the Fellows will also be required to do a                     research project.  The selection of the Fellows will be                         based on regional considerations as well as population in                       order to have an appropriate number of people associated                        with each of the several Economic Educational Centers                           strategically located throughout the state.  Twenty five of                     the Fellows will ultimately be named as Center Associates                       where they will be required to set up other workshops and                       assist in other in service projects for the teachers of                         economics in their region.  Most, if not all, of the                            teachers of economics in Nebraska are expected to be                            impacted by this institute through the secondary effects.                       The cost share is 22.4% of the amount being requested from                      the Foundation.",
