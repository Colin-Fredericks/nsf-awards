 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308895  Korel  This project will investigate dynamic program slicing and its  application in the debugging of large programs.  Slicing has been  shown to be useful in program debugging.  The major idea behind  slicing is to identify that part of the program that might  potentially contain the fault.  It has been shown that by taking  a particular program execution into account, dynamic slicing may  significantly reduce the size of the slice as compared to static  slicing.  As a result, dynamic slicing is better suited for the  purpose of debugging than static slicing.  Our objective in this  project is to continue our earlier research on dynamic slicing  and algorithmic debugging.  The investigation will involve  constructing a dynamic slicing environment, extending the theory  of dynamic slicing, development of new methods of dynamic slice  derivation, and evaluating the effectiveness of dynamic slicing  in the process of debugging of large programs.  ***",
