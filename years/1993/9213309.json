 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is no doubt that the pace of species extinction caused by                 human activity is brisk and alarming.  While this process cannot                reasonably be expected to stop completely, one can still have the               goal to at least preserve the most valuable species. In order to                do this, there must be some idea in the minds of citizens about                 the determinants of a specie's value.  For example, to what                     extent are the attributes of a specie such as location,                         uniqueness, and intelligence important?  Can people make                        tradeoffs among different species that vary on a number of                      important attributes?  Are they willing to do so?  Can people's                 preferences for species be translated into dollar values that can               be used to inform public policy?  The purpose of this research is               to address these questions.                                                                                                                                     Since the perceived importance of biodiversity and species                      preservation is substantially driven by non-use values,                         observation of market behavior is precluded and survey research                 methods are required.  The first phase of the study uses in-depth               interviews and laboratory experiments to thoroughly study                       people's mental models of the species domain.  The survey                       instrument will be refined in the second phase and the survey                   will be administered to a national sample in the third and final                phase of the research.  Whereas the first phase will provide                    valuable insights into the cognitive processes underlying the                   construction of preferences in an important and unfamiliar                      domain, the survey results will provide policy makers with                      quantitative and defensible estimates of the public's values for                ecosystems and species preservation.",
