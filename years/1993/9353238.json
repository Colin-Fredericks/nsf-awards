 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a four-year program to enhance the teaching of life             and environmental science to deaf middle school and high school                 students nationwide.  To accomplish this purpose, a four-week                   summer Institute will be held at Gallaudet University each summer               for four years, for a total of eighty-two middle and high school                teachers of the deaf.  The Institute will integrate the expertise               and facilities of the University science faculties and the Genetics             Services Center at the University as well as the Fish and Wildlife              Service and the Marine Science Consortium, of which Gallaudet                   University is a member.                                                                                                                                         The Institute will concentrate on the content areas of genetics,                physiology and environmental science with the major focus on hands-             on laboratory and field experiences.  Other topics to be covered                include:  teaching critical thinking, career information,                       techniques to improve teaching, and the use of educational                      technology.  Participants will be provided with a series of \"take               home\" lesson plans and will be expected to transfer relevant                    information and pedagogical skills to their peers.  Participants                will also be linked with faculty and staff and each other via a                 computer conferencing system.                                                                                                                                   Cost-sharing equals 5.0% of the NSF award.",
