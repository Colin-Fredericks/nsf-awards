 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an accomplishment based renewal of a project that has                   made important contributions to macroeconomics, financial                       economics, economic growth and labor economics.  This grant                     permits the investigator to continue research in two broad                      categories: (1) theories of price rigidity and economic                         fluctuations and (2) theories of economic growth.                                                                                                               One of the fundamental questions of macroeconomics is: What                     determines the rate of inflation?  Most macroeconomists agree                   that in the long run, the primary determinant of inflation is                   growth in the money supply.  The short-run behavior of inflation,               however, is more controversial.  Certainly monetary policy and                  other determinants of aggregate demand have important roles.  Yet               since the 1970s, many economists have also emphasized the role of               \"supply\" or \"price\" shocks.  The contribution of this project                   comes from developing a rigorous theory on the way shifts in                    relative prices can affect the rate of inflation and conducting                 further empirical research on the fraction of the variation in                  inflation in the postwar United States that is explained by price               shocks.  Special emphasis is placed on the OPEC energy shocks:                  large increases in the prices of oil-intensive goods generated                  price shocks and aggregate inflation rose.  This research is                    clearly relevant to understanding the economic implications of                  carbon taxes and other global environmental change policies or                  economic implications of future price shocks caused by global                   environmental catastrophes.                                                                                                                                     The other part of the project continues research on the gap                     between standard growth theory and the evidence on convergence in               standard of living.  Researchers examining a wide variety of                    datasets have concluded that economies tend to converge--that is,               poor economies tend to grow faster than rich economies.  Yet                    standard models of economic growth cannot easily explain this                   fact.  The project develops a model of economic growth that                     explains gradual convergence in output per person while allowing                the real interest rate to be equal across economies at all times.               The key to the model is that borrowing is possible to finance                   accumulation of physical capital but not accumulation of human                  capital.  More generally, this project studies the restrictions                 that facts about poor and rich countries place on the form of the               production function, such as complementarity among labor, human                 capital, and physical capital.",
