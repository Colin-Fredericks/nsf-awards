 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352167  Harnack  Traditional weather laboratory materials consist of data  printouts which the student decodes, plots, and analyzes.  Available interactive software performs these and a number of  other important tasks on microcomputers thereby increasing  student understanding of the complex three dimensional motion  of the atmosphere.  Experience gained with the McIDAS (Man-  computer Interactive Data Access System) software operating on  two stand-alone PC workstations makes it clear that the new  technology can be brought into the classroom for use in  completing laboratory assignments with real-time data.  This project is setting up a local area network in the weather  laboratory classroom so that McIDAS and other similar software  is accessible by students during the two required senior level  laboratory courses, and by sophomores in an introductory lab  course, offered by the Department of Meteorology and Physical  Oceanography.  The affected courses' lab assignments are being  changed so that the students are gaining extensive experience  in the use of graphical weather analysis and display systems.  The equipment being used to accomplish this objective includes  a SUN SPARCsystem 10 (acting as file server) together with four  Gateway 2000 486/DX2-50 microcomputers (acting as student  workstations) in an Ethernet local area network.  ***",
