 "awd_abstract_narration": "The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases of L. mesenteroides and Z.               mobilis exhibit dual coenzyme specificities, utilizing either NAD               or NADP.  The long-range goal of these studies is to develop an                 understanding of the structural features of these enzymes which                 permit this dual specificity.  Site-directed mutagenesis will be                utilized in order to identify those residues involved in                        specificity for each coenzyme and perhaps to switch specificities.              Chemical modification studies will be utilized to identify coenzyme             binding sites.  Kinetic studies will be employed to characterize                the enzyme in the presence of different coenzymes.  The                         conformation change induced by the coenzymes will be characterized.             These studies will provide new insights into the relationship                   between structure and function in the more common NAD- or NADP-                 specific glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases.                                    %%%                                                                             Enzymes involved in metabolic pathways exhibit high specificity for             coenzymes.  In fact, this dependence on the presence of specific                coenzymes is often utilized in the general control of metabolic                 pathways.  What structural aspects of the glucose-6-phosphate                   dehydrogenases (G6PDs) determine their requirement for NAD or NADP              coenzymes is an interesting and important question.  The proposed               research utilizes two interesting G6PDs which show dual coenzyme                specificity.  Binding of either NAD or NADP induces structural                  changes in the enzyme which result in quite distinct catalytic                  properties.  Site-directed mutagenesis will be utilized to probe                the structure of the enzyme as it relates to coenzyme binding.  The             results will provide insights into the functional behavior of the               more common NAD- or NADP-specific G6PDs.",
