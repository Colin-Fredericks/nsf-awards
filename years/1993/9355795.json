National leaders who are advocates for educational change in science and mathematics will be convened to meet with leaders at MSU to discuss the active involvement of scientists and mathematicians in designing an educational change initiative for MSU.  Native Americans will be involved to assure that the focus on improving education includes knowledgeable expertise and representation of Montana's largest minority group.  Participants will develop a working \"blueprint\" to guide implementation of the University's efforts to coordinate and enhance the reforms funded by Education and Human Resources (EHR).  The recommendations resulting from the conference will guide MSU and will be shared with the various NSF initiatives and projects across the state and those who may benefit from them outside Montana. ***",
