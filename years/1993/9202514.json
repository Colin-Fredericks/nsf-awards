 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knox College requests funding for a new scanning electron                       microscope (SEM) to replace our 14-year-old model that does not                 meet the current research needs of the faculty, and for which                   parts are getting scarce. L. Dybas, principal investigator, will                use the SEM for her studies on sipunculan immunology, focussing                 on the structure and function of sipunculan coelomocytes; on the                responses of sipunculans to                                                     elevated temperature (heat shock), wounding and regeneration; and               for taxonomic and morphologic studies in her research on ptiliid                beetles. M. Brodl, in his studies on                                            the heat shock response in barley aleurone layers, will use the                 SEM to characterize the response of the endoplasmic reticulum                   during heat shock, recovery, and thermotolerance.  The response                 in barley is a model system for comparing                                       responses in other plants, invertebrates and higher animals.  B.                Kooser will use the SEM in his spin label investigations sing                   chemically modified silica. EPR spectra display                                 behavioral changes as the silica surface is modified. SEM                       observations of the altered silica are essential to confirm the                 surface modification. The SEM will also be integral to                          an introductory project-based course in electron microscopy.  A                 research-level SEM will permit students to obtain publication-                  quality data either on their own or as co-                                      researchers with faculty.",
