 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at Penn State               directly addresses the challenge of increasing enrollment of women              and minorities in graduate engineering study.  The key aspects of               the program are:  1) the active recruitment of minorities and women             by visiting selected target schools, and , 2) a student oriented                research program that contains social as well as instructional                  aspects designed for successful integration of the participants                 into an exciting research environment.  Faculty members from the                Department of Chemical Engineering at Penn State have volunteered               to support recruitment, instruction, and research supervision.                  The projects offered span a wide range of research, from plant                  tissue culture, to thermodynamics - held together by common                     chemical engineering principles.  REU participants will be matched              with projects prior to selection to maximize mutual interests and               capabilities.  The participants enroll for three credits of                     Chemical Engineering Undergraduate Research during the summer                   semester.  An instructional program is integrated throughout the                summer which initially focuses on logistics such as the library                 system and laboratory safety to give the students a quick start on              research.  Subsequent instruction covers research practice such as              experimental design, statistics, and \"keeping a laboratory                      notebook\".  To stress the importance of communication, an                       introductory and final oral presentation, as well as a final                    written report will be required of each student.",
