 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program will investigate why some materials exhibit               nonmetallic behavior when deposited on metallic substrates.  This               unusual behavior has been confirmed recently by several different               spectroscopies including experimental band structure mapping,                   resonant photoemission, core level spectroscopy and electron energy             loss.  Nonmetallic overlayers undergo a nonmetal to metal                       transition with increasing coverage and the nonmetal to metal                   transition is typically accompanied by a structural transition                  indicative of a first order transition.                                                                                                                         University-industry collaborations will assist in characterizing                nonmetallic overlayers which exhibit an excitonic insulating                    behavior.  Microscopic probes of structure will be correlated with              the more conventional photoemission and resonant photoemission                  techniques for studying electronic transitions.  The similarities               between the nonmetal to metal transition in free clusters and at                metal surfaces are remarkable, particularly for the metal mercury.              The fundamental reasons for the similar variations in metallicity               with coordination number, and cluster size (film coverage or                    thickness) can only be established with further electronic and                  structural studies.  Divalent metal overlayers such as Mg, Ba, and              Hg will be investigated and compared with other overlayers                      exhibiting no nonmetal to metal transition.                                     %%%                                                                             This research program addresses a very basic and fundamental                    question:  are the surfaces of metals metallic?  Conventional                   measurements to determine metallic character, such as conductivity              measurements for example, are difficult to apply to a thin film of              material one or two atoms thick deposited on a metal substrate.                 New approaches to establishing what it means for a metal to be a                metal have been developed and can now be applied to materials                   normally considered metals.  There is a need to explore why the                 sufaces of some material have such fundamentally different                      properties form those normally associated with that material.                   Increasing number of examples of this phenomenon of nonmetallic                 behavior at metal surfaces or on metal substrates have been                     observed; however, general rules or principles to quide our                     understanding remain elusive.",
