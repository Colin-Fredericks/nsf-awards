 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a nine month long-term visit by Professor               Gregory Kasza, Department of Political Science, Indiana                         University, Bloomington, to Japan for a cooperative research                    project with Professor Michio Muramatsu, Professor of Political                 Science, Faculty of Law, Kyoto University.  The researchers plan                to undertake a study of administrered mass organizations (AMOs)                 in nondemocratic Japanese regimes.  This research identifies a                  major problem in Japanese political life that has gone relatively               unstudied.  Many nondemocratic regimes have created official mass               organizations to control patterns of participation, mobilize for                war, and effect ambitious programs of socioeconomic change.  This               research project examines ten systems of administered mass                      organizations in detail, particularly that of interwar Japan.                   Along with the Soviet Union and Fascist Italy, Japan was one of                 the originators of the AMO.  AMOs were Japan's main tools of mass               mobilization during World War II, and the Japanese spread this                  form of organization to many parts of their Asian empire.                                                                                                       The research will be helpful in distinguishing these state-                     controlled, mobilizational mass organizations from political                    parties and interest groups.  The research should have                          significant theoretical payoffs regarding the nature of AMOs, the               ways they differ from other kinds of mass organizations and, the                range and variations among AMOs in terms of their characteristics               and patterns of operation.  Professor Kasza is also receiving                   partial support for this research under a Fulbright Scholarship.                Professor Muramatsu is one of Japan's most accomplished political               scientists.  Kyoto University's library is an excellent facility                in which to carry out this research.  It is anticipated that this               research will result in a fruitful collaboration that will                      continue many years after this project is completed.",
