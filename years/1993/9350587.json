 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9350587  Cross, Dolores  Chicago State University    The Chicago Alliance for Minority Participation (CHAMP) is a  consortium of six Chicago area universities supported by a network  of local businesses, national laboratories, and local school  districts.  The six universities are: Chicago State University,  DePaul University, the Illinois Institute of Technology, Loyola  University, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois  at Chicago.  These institutions enroll over 2,000 minorities a year  in science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) fields.  The mission  of the Alliance is to significantly increase the quantity and  quality of minority students receiving SEM baccalaureate degrees  and to increase the pool of minority students entering graduate  school.  The Alliance will accomplish this goal by replicating  successful programs at new schools, by allowing students to  participate in bridge programs or research experiences outside  their own schools, by using the consortium to test new programs,  and by hosting consortium-wide activities such as an Alliance  Student Research Conference.  The Alliance partners believe that  such interactive and cooperative activities will give the  consortium a synergy that would not exist if these programs  operated in isolation.  The Alliance proposes two bold objectives:   (1) to quadruple the output of SEM baccalaureate degrees awarded to  minorities in Chicago so that a minimum of 1,000 minority students  per year will receive baccalaureate degrees in SEM fields by the  year 2000; and (2) to place at least 200 minority students per year  in SEM graduate programs by the year 2000.",
