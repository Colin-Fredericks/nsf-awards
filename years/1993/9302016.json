The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Donald Estep                                 of the Georgia Institute of Technology to work                                  with Professor Claes Johnson at Chalmers                                        University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.                                                                                                                 This project involves the development of a                                      mathematical theory for adaptive finite element                                 methods for systems of singularly-perturbed                                     reaction-diffusion equations.  These equations                                  offer many technical challenges to                                              mathematicians while representing many                                          important models in applied science.  Because                                   solutions of such problems typically have                                       multiply-scaled behavior and because accurate                                   results are needed for a range of parameter                                     values, standard numeric techniques and                                         analysis are inadequate.  Dr. Estep and                                         Professor Johnson hope to overcome these                                        difficulties by developing an error control                                     based on a posteriori and a priori error bounds                                 that will indicate how to control the error as                                  well as give a measure of robustness to the                                     computations.  The ultimate goal is the public                                  release of a code that can solve general                                        problems with minimum user interface.                                                                                                                           The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel, a stipend for                                       twelve months and administrative costs for                                      Georgia Tech.",
