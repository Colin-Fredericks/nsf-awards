 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University  of Hawaii will operate the R/V MOANA WAVE in               1993 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded                 research projects.  The MOANA WAVE is a 210' general research                   vessel owned by the U.S. Navy and operated as a UNOLS vessel in                 support of academic research. In early 1993 MOANA WAVE will support             the global change project TOGA-CORE. In late April the vessel will              support a 40 day ODP cruise, which will map an area of the seafloor             where undersea rift system are converging with continental crust                off the southeast tip of New Guinea (Woodlark Basin).  The vessel               will then support Navy cruises between Guam and Japan. Following                the cruise off Japan the MOANA WAVE will enter an extensive                     shipyard period.  On returning to service the vessel will support               a physical oceanography cruise that will take the vessel back to                Honolulu. For the remainder of the Year, MOANA WAVE will support                short cruise out of Hawaii including the Hawaii Time Series                     project.                                                                                                                                                             The MOANA WAVE is part of the academic fleet used by NSF to                support oceanographic research.  Most oceanographic research                    requires highly specialized equipment that must be permanently                  installed on a ship for which the ship must be specifically                     designed. This equipment also requires highly trained crew members              for maintenance and operation. These vessels do not operate in the              same manner as  general cargo or fishing vessels, therefore, NSF                supports the operation of a variety of vessels specifically                     dedicated to oceanographic research that are operated by                        universities and research institutions around the country.",
