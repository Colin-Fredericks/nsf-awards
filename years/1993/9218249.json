 "awd_abstract_narration": "Techniques for x-ray diffraction studies (using Cornell High Energy             Synchroton Service) and optical studies which will extend the                   static pressure range higher than the 560 GPa attained will be                  developed.  To do this requires further miniaturization of diamond              tips, of sample size and of x-ray apertures and optical beam                    diameters.  The crystal structure of oxygen and sulfur will be                  found \u0131materials which have previously been metallized (they have               60% reflectivity at the diamond sample interface at high pressure)!             since this should induce theorists to work on these materials.                  Superconductive bahavior will be looked for in them.  Hydrogen,                 nitrogen (including high temperature) and LiH will be pressurized               to pressures in excess of 4 Mbars and higher with the intent of                 reaching meatllization.  The metallization of alkali hydrides as an             analogous series with hydrogen hydride as the highest member of the             series will be studied.                                                         %%%                                                                             Ultrapressures cause enormous changes in solids.  Solid xenon has               its volume decreased by 72% at 1.5 Mbars while silicon has its                  volume decreased by 34% at 2.5 Mbars (the pressure at the earth's               core is 3.6 Mbars and at the deepest spot in the ocean only 1kbar).             These enormous changes cause changes in crystal structure, and                  changes in electronic structure resulting in important changes in               physical properties.  Theorists, using quantum mechanics with                   approximatims (necessary to make the problem soluble) attempt to                calculate these structural changes.  Results provide an exacting                test of their theories and set the stage for doing computer based               solid state physics.  Interest is also in developing new materials              with possible exotic properties.  It has been predicted that                    hydrogen will become metallic at high pressure and that it will be              a high temperature superconductor.  Metallic xenon and metallic                 oxygen have been made and work is being done to make metallic                   hydrogen to see if it indeed is a high temperature superconductor.              High pressure is viewed as a tool for making and processing new                 materials with unusual properties.",
