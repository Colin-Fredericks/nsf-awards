 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr. Andrew                    Rukhin of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Dr.                  Igor Wajda of the Institute of Information Theory & Automation,                 Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, will focus on two problems                    relative to information theory and statistical decision theory: (1)             Change-point estimation problem; and (2) Adaptive classification                problems for stochastic process.  The first problem deals with the              classical estimation problem of change-point between two different              distributions.  A notion of asymptotic efficiency is introduced                 despite there being no consistent estimator of the change-point.                The researchers will investigate the new optimality measure and                 study the existence of adaptive estimators which are fully                      asymptotic efficient, when a nuisance parameter is present.  A                  version of this problem for stochastic processes in which consistent            estimators exist will also be addressed.  In the second problem,                Drs. Rukhin and Wajda will classify a realization of a stochastic               process into a family of given distributions (time can be discrete or           continuous).  They have to derive a new inequality for the error                probability of any classification rule.  This inequality leads to a             notion of asymptotic optimality more general than the classical one.            They will obtain conditions for the existence of adaptive                       classification procedures.                                                                                                                                      This project in statistics and probability fulfills the program                 objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                 experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                      complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual              interest and competence.",
