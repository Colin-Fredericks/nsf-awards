 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 3-year project from the Educational Service Center,                        Region 16, Belleville, IL, plans to enhance elementary                          science teaching for the region by combining efforts of                         teachers, administrators, and parents in 15 elementary                          schools with the resources of a local institution of higher                     learning and the technical assistance of the Educational                        Service Center.  Project activities will span 3 years with 5                    weeks of course work for leaders each summer and extensive                      implementation and follow up activities during the school                       year.  The LITES (lead teachers) will be trained in the use                     of several validated activity-based science curricula, will                     select course options to improve their science knowledge,                       and will learn leadership skills to assist other teachers in                    implementing activity-based science.  School teams will be                      comprised of an administrator, primary, and intermediate                        teacher.  Schools with significant populations of minority                      students will be given priority.                                                                                                                                This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher                             enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science                       knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills of                        teams of teachers from participating schools, and because it                    targets teachers of a needy population.                                                                                                                         Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 39% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
