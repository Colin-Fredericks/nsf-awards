 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv.tomato(Pst) in tomato is                  conferred by a single dominant locus, Pto. Tools necessary for                  cloning the locus were developed during the tenure of the Plant                 Postdoctoral Fellowship Award.  Near Isogenic lines of tomato were              used to identify RFLP and RAPD markers tightly linked to the gene               and a large F2 population was used to create a high resolution                  linkage map that allowed precise placement of Pto in relation to                the molecular markers. A tomato YAC library was constructed and a               screen identified a candidate for the Pto locus. The project will               be continued and the putative Pto gene isolated and characterized.              %%%                                                                             This work should significantly increase our understanding and                   ability to control disease in plants.",
