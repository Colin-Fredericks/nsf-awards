 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of a 200 MHz (protons) NMR spectrometer operating                   in the pulsed FT mode, with variable temperature and two-                       dimensional (2-D) spectroscopy capability will improve the                      educational experience in the undergraduate chemistry teaching                  laboratories. The new instrument will be used by undergraduate                  students in three of the four core laboratory courses in the                    chemistry program of CMU. The new spectrometer will provide                     undergraduate students the opportunity to carry out modern NMR                  spectroscopy to elucidate the molecular structure of organic                    and inorganic compounds, to do studies of chemical kinetics                     including rapid exchange reactions, and will permit variable                    temperature 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR spectroscopy. The                             undergraduates will become familiar with more sophisticated FT                  techniques and modern NMR data processing by computer. An off-                  line PC will be interfaced with the spectrometer to increase                    the throughput of the system and to enhance the familiarization                 of students with the application of a PC in the laboratory. A                   hands-on approach will be pursued throughout the three                          undergraduate courses. During summer the spectrometer will be                   used by students participating in the Pennsylvania Governor's                   School for the Sciences.  A strong dissemination plan will be                   developed using publication in the appropriate journals, and by                 distribution of packets with comprehensive descriptions of                      selected experiments, containing sections on feedback from                      students and on pedagogical results.",
