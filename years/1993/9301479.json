 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benjamin J. Schwartz has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                   Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Schwartz's doctoral degree was                     from the University of California/Berkeley under the                            supervision of Professor Charles Harris. Dr. Schwartz intends                   to continue research at the University of Texas/Austin under                    the sponsorship of Professor Peter Rossky. Dr. Schwartz's                       postdoctoral training will provide him with experience in                       theoretical techniques such as high quality molecular dynamics                  simulations which will allow him to simulate the observables in                 femtosecond laser experiments. Longer term he plans to employ                   new theoretical algorithms and emerging femtosecond                             technologies to probe details of the microscopic physics                        underlying condensed phase reactivity of polyatomic molecules.                  %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract them into                    meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
