 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Friedlander's recent research involves the study of certain                 problems related to the equation of hydrodynamics (the Euler                    equations and the Navier-Strokes equations) and to the extended                 system of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics.  The mathematics               employed includes techniques from partial differential equations,               asymptotic methods and dynamical systems.  The problems studied are             motivated by questions that arise in geophysical and astrophysical              fluid dynamics.  This research project will involve joint work with             M.M. Vishik.  Dr. Friedlander will continue her investigation of                several facets of these problems.  The research is described under              four headings:  (I)The \"fast\" dynamo problem; (II) Instability                  criteria for the Euler equations; (III) The existence of a complete             system of Floquet root vectors in time periodic of fluid dynamics;              (IV) Magnetohydrodynamic stability.                                                                                                                             Interactive activities at the host institution include:  (1)                    teaching a graduate course on mathematical topics in fluid                      dynamics; (2) mentoring and counseling women students and postdocs              in the mathematical sciences; and (3) organizing a two-day workshop             of colloquium style lectures given by distinguished women                       mathematicians.                                                                                                                                                 This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future significantly.",
