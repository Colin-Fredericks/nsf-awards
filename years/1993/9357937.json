 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357937  GREEN  This award provides support to Dr. Donald Green under the National  Science Foundation's Young Investigator Awards program.  The  objective of this program is to recognize outstanding young faculty  in science and engineering, to enhance the academic career of  recent PhD recipients by providing flexible support for research  and educational activities, and to foster contact and cooperation  between academia, industry, and institutions that support research  and education.  Dr. Green has already made significant research  contributions to the field of political science, and he has the  potential to become a leader in academic research and education.     This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research  interests in the social psychology of intergroup conflict.   Specifically, he proposes to develop a statistical model of the  incidence of overt manifestations of intolerance, or \"bias crime.\"   He will examine the over-time dynamics of bias incidents as well  as the cross-sectional relationship between incidents and economic  performance, demographic composition, intra-and interracial crime  rates, and survey measures of attitudinal intolerance.  This  research has important theoretical and policy implications.    Dr. Green also plans to continue his work on campaign finance,  party affiliation, the consequences of measurement error in survey  data, and the role of tangible self-interest in democratic  politics.  This work uses survey and experimental data to formulate  a theory about the conditions under which self-interest manifests  itself in political attitudes and behavior.  ***",
