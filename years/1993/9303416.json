The goal of this project is to investigate issues related to both  mandatory and discretionary security in object-oriented database  systems.  The database security model, called the message filter  model, proposed recently by Jajodia and Kogan is used as a  departure point for this research.  The chief advantages of the  message filter model are its compatibility with the object-oriented  data model and the simplicity with which security policies can be  stated and enforced.  Topics that are being investigated include:  (1) how multilevel entities can be modeled in the message filter  model, operational semantics of update operations, and  implementation of a secure garbage collection mechanism that does  not have to be trusted; (2) how the conflict between integrity and  secrecy requirements can be overcome using the object-oriented  approach; and (3) how the message filter model can be extended to  incorporate discretionary controls.  Access control is a crucial  functionality for any data management system.  This research will  lead to a security model specifically targeted to object-oriented  database systems, without compromising the advantages provided by  the object-oriented approach over conventional approaches.   ***",
