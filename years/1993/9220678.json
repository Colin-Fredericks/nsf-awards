 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manner and rate of deformation of the Earth's major ice                     sheets depend on a complex interplay of their geographical and                  climatic setting, as well as their internal dynamics.  In the West              Antarctic Ice Sheet, it is known that rapidly moving ice streams                alternate with large areas of stagnant ice, and that the transition             between streaming and non-streaming flow can be be quite narrow.                In these lateral shear margins it is thought that the physical                  controls on ice stream dynamics must show significant differences.                                                                                              This study will examine the geophysical differences between an                  ice stream and a stagnant ridge along the Siple Coast in West                   Antarctica.  The ice will be probed with electromagnetic and                    seismic waves to infer the internal temperature and the crystalline             structure of the ice, as well as the proportion of old (Wisconsin               Ice Age) ice, since it is known that ice flow laws depend                       exponentially on temperature, that ice crystals are much less                   resistant to deformation in the plane of their hexagonal faces than             in other directions, and that old ice may deform much more readily              than ice of more recent geological age.  Measurement of radar                   diffraction patterns and the analysis of the records of micro-                  earthquakes can be used to show whether the base of the ice sheet               is frozen to the underlying bedrock.",
