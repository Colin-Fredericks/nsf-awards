 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at testing the hypotheses that impairing                  glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in roots of nitrate fed and N2-              fixing alfalfa plants perform better than normal plants.  The                   working hypothesis for the NO3-fed, root GS impaired plants is that             the NO3-taken up by the root instead of being distributed between               the root and leaves for assimilation is now exclusively assimilated             in the leaves.  Being energetically more efficient to assimilate                NO3-in the photosynthetic tissue, the result is more efficient                  usage of nitrogen.  In the case of the nodulated alfalfa plants, it             is postulated that all the photosynthate normally distributed                   between the roots and the nodules is now directed primarily to the              nodules.  The increased flow of photosynthate to the nodules                    provides more energy substrate for the bacteroides to fix N2 and                more C-skeleton for assimilating the fixed N2, resulting in                     increased N2-fixation rates and ammonia assimilation.  The                      experimental approach to impair root GS activity is to use the                  antisense RNA technology.  To specifically target the root GS,                  antisense gene constructs consisting of either the constitutive 35S             promoter and a root GS specific sequence or a root                              specific/enhanced promoter and a GS coding sequence in antisense                orientation have been introduced into alfalfa via Agrobacterium                 tumefaciens mediated transformation of leaf discs.  To ensure that              GS activity in nodules is not impaired, root GS impaired alfalfa                transformants will be transformed with GS gene sense contructs                  behind the leghemoglobin gene promoter or the nodule-specific GS                gene promoter.  Since the effects of increased GS activity is not               known, alfalfa plants have also been transformed with GS sense                  constructs under the control of constitutive and root                           specific/enhanced promoters.  Both molecular and biochemical                    analysis of the different tissues will be performed to test for                 changes in expression of genes encoding key enzymes in N- and C-                metabolism.  Besides allowing us to understand why root GS impaired             plants perform better, this analyses will allow us to determine if              changes in N-metabolism has any effect on C-metabolism.                         Availability of root GS impaired plants will provide us with the                necessary tools to test our hypothesis with and eventually allow us             to manipulate plants for better usage of N and C.",
