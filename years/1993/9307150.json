 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ectomycorrhizal fungi are symbiotic associates of most                     temperature forest trees.  Their association with the roots of                  trees such as pines and oaks is necessary for normal growth and                 reproduction of the trees.  These fungi exhibit a high level of                 species diversity even at a single sit.  Yet little is currently                known about the functional significance of this diversity.                      %%%                                                                             In this study researchers will use molecular identification methods             in combination with soil core sampling, mushroom mapping, and                   experimental manipulations to dissect the community structure of                these fungi in coastal pine forests.  The sampling schemes used are             designed to reveal the variation of fungal species composition in               space and time at several scales, and will ultimately yield the                 first picture of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in any single               forest type on a regional scale.  Methods for molecular                         identification of mycorrhizae will be further refined to facilitate             widespread use and they will be adapted for the identification of               fungal individuals.  The latter level of identification will enable             us to investigate clonal size and dissect the genetic strategies                employed by selected fungal species.  This work will result in a                better understanding of the basic ecology of these fungi and will               provide a basis for future management of pinc ecosystems.",
