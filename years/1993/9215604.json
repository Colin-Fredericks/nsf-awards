 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research studies, theoretically and experimentally, the                    process of equilibrium physical adsorption onto porous solids,                  particularly focusing on the effect of polydispersity of the                    adsorbent pores.                                                                Theoretically, Monte Carlo simulations in the Grand Canonical                   Ensemble will be undertaken to study the adsorption process of                  multicomponent fluid mixtures at a molecular level, in slit shaped              pores within a solid phase of carbon. In the simulation,                        interactions among fluid molecules will be represented by a                     Lennard-Jones potential, and interactions among the fluid molecules             and the adsorbent will be accounted for using a 9-3 potential. For              the interactions between like fluid molecules, interaction                      parameters will be obtained by matching the predictions of pure                 component simulations for the liquid density and vapor pressure                 with experimental values. A set of combining rules will be used to              obtain the unlike fluid interaction parameters from those of the                like interactions. The simulations will establish pure and mixed                component isotherms as a function of temperature and pressure. In               addition to the Monte-Carlo simulations, an adsorption theory will              be developed which will be based on the Ideal Adsorbed Solution                 theory (IAS).                                                                   Experimentally, equilibrium adsorption measurements will be                     undertaken using graphitized carbon and small molecules such as                 methane, ethane, ethylene, carbon dioxide and propylene in an open              flow apparatus. In this apparatus, a gas mixture of desired                     composition is passed over the adsorbent, and the effluent gas is               monitored until its composition is identical to that of the feed.               At that  point, the system is closed, the pressure is measured,                 and desorption is initiated by heating the adsorbent and allowing               the desorbed material to flow to a previously evacuated desorbate               tank. The pressure and composition in the desorbate tank is                     measured, and from these measurements the amount of material which              had been adsorbed onto the adsorbent, and its composition, can be               calculated. In addition to the adsorption measurements, pore size               distributions will be measured by nitrogen adsorption. The                      interpretation of the adsorption results will utilize a new                     statistical mechanical model for nitrogen adsorption in a pore                  which is based on density functional theory and which is valid for              micropores (20 A and smaller) as well as mesopores (20-5000 A).                 The pore size distribution will be factored into the theory, and                theoretical predictions will be compared with experiments.",
