 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310347  Daniel Friedman    This research examines how people learn in nondeterministic tasks  (such as medical diagnosis).  Learning is difficult such tasks  because occasionally a decision maker can be right for the wrong  reason or (like an expert doctor with an inconclusive chart) wrong  for the right reason.  In experimental settings we will vary the  complexity of the task, the type of decision required, and the  learning environment in order to see when people are able learn  effectively and when they do not.    An example of the type of task would be medical decision making.   A doctor examining a medical chart mentally combines the  information from each separate symptom and makes a diagnosis.   Doctors' diagnostic abilities increase over time as they learn more  about the informativeness of each symptom and how best to combine  the information.  Often the chart information is inconclusive, so  even the best doctor sometimes makes an incorrect diagnosis.  This  kind of task appears frequently in other decision domains.    Economists and some other social scientists use equilibrium models  that in effect assume instantaneous learning, and results of this  study should be useful in showing where these models are likely to  be accurate or inaccurate.  The results also should be directly  useful to cognitive scientists and decision makers (including  medical diagnosticians) who wish to improve the learning process in  nondeterministic tasks.    ***",
