 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Biology department of                          Temple University to support as an REU site for a combined                      academic year and summer program of undergraduate research.                     This program will draw on the department's extensive                            experience with undergraduate research as part of the                           academic year research program, and also incorporate                            elements of the Temple University Basic Science Summer                          Minority Program which has been in effect for the past two                      years.  The goal of this program is to provide a rich                           research environment and a sense of community among                             promising students in order to encourage them to enter                          careers in the biological sciences.                                                                                                                             To achieve this goal, the program will have two major                           components.  The first of these is continued academic year                      participation in research projects by students enrolled at                      Temple.  The second is an intensive Summer research program                     which will reach out to students beyond Temple.  Academic                       year students will have the opportunity to participate in                       the Summer program.  In both components, special effort will                    be made to attract underrepresented minority students.",
