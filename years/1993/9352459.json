 "awd_abstract_narration": "Valencia is in the process of implementing a Computer                       Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) Training Facility to provide                     students with the opportunity to enhance their skills and to                    participate in applied research projects. The implementation                    includes acquisition, installation and testing of additional                    electronics equipment used in manufacturing and supported by                    curriculum revision.  As a result of the additional equipment,                  students study a fully automated Surface Mount Technology (SMT)                 assembly process. The process can simulate almost any automated                 assembly or test requirement. Electronics Engineering                           Technology (EET) and CIM students at Valencia will, as a result                 of the additional equipment, be more independent in their                       critical thinking and decision-making in electronics                            engineering. Pre-engineering students on a professional career                  track will be able to enroll in courses that will teach the                     application of sophisticated instrumentation that will assist                   them in performing applied research and expand their vision for                 design potential, manufacturing potential and quality                           potential.",
