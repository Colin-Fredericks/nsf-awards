Honig of Purdue University and Dr.                                     Jozef Spalek of the University of Warsaw.  The                                  researchers plan a strongly interactive                                         collaboration both in experiment and in theory                                  for a thorough investigation of electron                                        correlation effects and interaction-driven                                      phase transitions in the (V1-xMx)2O3 system, with                               M = Cr, Ti, and cation vacancies and related                                    systems.  They will emphasize: (1) the proper                                   preparation and characterization of single                                      crystals grown by skull melting techniques; (2)                                 measurements of heat capacity, magnetic                                         susceptibility, and transport properties (with                                  and without magnetic fields) in the cryogenic                                   temperature range where lattice effects are                                     negligible, to study their dependence on                                        temperature, composition, and externally                                        applied pressure; (3) the proper theoretical                                    interpretation of the results in systems where                                  both strong electron correlation and disorder                                   effects determine the physical properties.  The                                 PI's involved in this project have had                                          considerable experience in the area of                                          materials preparation, physical measurements,                                   and theoretical analysis, and have engaged in                                   informal collaboration in the past.  A                                          principal result of the cooperation so far is                                   the theoretical construction of an overall                                      phase diagram for the (V1-xCrx)2O3 and V2(1-.)O3                                systems, as well as the experimental discovery                                  of a new boundary of V2(1-.)O3 terminating the                                  antiferromagnetic metallic phase.  They also                                    plan as a follow-up to initiate a theoretical                                   investigation of real space interactions                                        involving hybrid pairing induced by Kondo-type                                  interactions in various correlated electron                                     systems.                                                                                                                                                        This research in condensed matter physics                                       fulfills the program objectives of advancing                                    science by enabling leading expert in the U.S.                                  and Poland to combine complementary talents and                                 pool research resources in areas of strong                                      mutual interest and competence.",
