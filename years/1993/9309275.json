 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309275  OBERHAUSER       In areas like the Appalachian states where manufacturing and  mining employment has declined in recent decades, households have  placed greater reliance on women to generate income.  Increasing  numbers of women have become active members of the workforce,  although many continue to engage in income-generating activities  like telephone solicitation, child care, computer-related work,  and housecleaning while based at their homes.  Because of the  informal character of women's housework, relatively little  attention has been devoted by scholars to its nature and its role  in both social and economic spheres.  This research project will  constitute a case study of household economic strategies during  economic restructuring over the last few decades by examining the  nature and role of women's housework in three economically  diverse regions of West Virginia.  The study will consist of two  related parts.  In the first part, aggregate data on socio-  economic variables like employment, labor-force participation,  household composition, and income will be gathered and analyzed  to identify general trends and to distinguish among patterns in  the different regions.  In the second part of the project, 75  women houseworkers will be interviewed at length to provide  information about gender relations in the household and women's  home-based economic strategies.       This project will provide valuable new information about  this understudied form of work, and it will expand general  understandings of the complex interactions between social and  economic requirements and the ways that women simultaneously  respond to both sets of requirements.  In addition to its  contributions to basic knowledge, the results of this project  will benefit regional development efforts and community  development programs by making them more aware of the potentials  for and needs of women working at home.  ***",
