 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353746  Holland    The purpose of this project is to develop an Intervention Model Program that will enhance the  probability that girls will eventually choose careers in science, engineering, and math (SEM).   The program is to be developed jointly between Texas A&M University (TAMU) and the  University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA).  UTSA is a subcontractor to TAMU.  The  developed program will be replicated at junior colleges across the state.    This project is designed to place 120 girls entering the seventh grade in a university residence  setting (TAMU) and allow them the opportunity to have a successful \"hands-on\" laboratory  experience with complex (to them) scientific equipment.  The program is designed to enhance  their self confidence at a crucial transition period between elementary and middle school.  The  laboratory activities include introductions to microscopy, electronics, strain, material testing,  computer-aided design, chromatography, and chemical reactions.  A field trip to the TAMU  School of Veterinary Medicine is planned since many of the girls at this age express a desire to  be a veterinarian.  This experience has proven to be a motivator in the past.    The participants will be selected from the Expanding Your Horizons (EYH) Conferences held  at TAMU and UTSA.  Participation in the EYH Conference demonstrates an initial interest in  SEM.  The UTSA participants are for the most part Hispanic with several physically disabled.   The TAMU participants are well distributed.    The participants will be evaluated before and after the summer session to determine if their  interests and perceptions of themselves having careers in SEM have changed or increased.  The  girls will be followed through high school by the TAMU Center for Academic Enhancement to  evaluate the long term effectiveness of the program.    In addition to publications and presentations, a workshop will be held for primary and secondary  teachers and junior college professors to introduce the model and enc ourage them to spread the  program across the state using the materials provided at the workshop.",
