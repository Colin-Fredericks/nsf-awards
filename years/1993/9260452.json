 "awd_abstract_narration": "The black-lip pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera, is the source               of rare, valuable black pearls.  Culture of this species has                    proven highly lucrative in French Polynesia, with strengthening                 worldwide demand.                                                                                                                                               The Hawaiian sub-species, P. margaritifera galtsoffi, is on the                 Hawaii State endangered species list.  Stocks are scarce due to                 both natural recruitment limitations and the history of                         overfishing for pearl shell.  The development of black pearl                    culture in Hawaii appears limited only by this scarcity.  This                  sub-species attains a large maximum size, and has excellent nacre               color, and should therefore produce excellent black pearls.                                                                                                     We propose to develop a hatchery for P. margaritifera galtsoffi,                in Kona, Hawaii.  Standard bivalve culture methods will be                      adapted to this species.  We are familiar with methods used in                  hatchery culture of other pearl oysters, and have confirmed the                 availability of local broodstocks.                                                                                                                              Experiments will test methods of spawning induction, water                      quality, larval handling, algal rations, preferred substrates and               cues for settlement.  if successful settlement is achieved,                     subsequent trials will determine the feasibility of commercial-                 scale spat production.                                                                                                                                          We must acquire our own pearl oyster hatchery technology if                     America is to compete with Japan, Australia, and other countries                for a stake in this lucrative market.",
