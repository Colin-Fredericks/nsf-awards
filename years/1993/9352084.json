 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department is reshaping its analytical chemistry                  laboratory courses such that students are studying and learning                 analytical chemistry in the same way it is practiced by                         professional chemists.  A computer is being provided at every                   work station, where the computer is being used in conjunction                   with an interface and various sensors to control experiments                    and collect and analyze data.  This frees the student from much                 of the drudgery of data acquisition and allows more time for                    thought-intensive activities such as decisions on optimal                       experiment design and the most appropriate way to treat data                    resulting from the measurements made.  In addition, because the                 computer gathers large amounts of data rapidly and accurately,                  students are being exposed to experiments which are more                        complex and interesting than those previously possible.  The                    changes are bringing a new and exciting vitality to the                         analytical chemistry courses.  The equipment being used to                      achieve these goals includes 16 computers, 16 interfaces and                    associated sensors, and four printers to serve a total of 32                    students at a given time.",
