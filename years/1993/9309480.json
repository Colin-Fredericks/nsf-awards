A novel class of kainate receptors from nonmammalian vertebrate brain that has structural homologies to ion channels activated by glutamate and kainate but which interacts with GTP binding proteins (G proteins) is being studied.  Dr. Oswald's working hypothesis is that this receptor or class of receptors has a dual function.  That is, the signal transduction mechanism consists of both a rapid opening of an ion channel and a slower response mediated by G proteins.  The cDNAs coding for several kainate recept ors have been cloned and several additional partial sequences have been obtained using the polymerase chain reaction.  The purposes of the studies described in this proposal are to determine which kainate receptors and combination of kainate receptors can form functional ion channels and to investigate the structural basis of ion channel activity, kainate binding, and possibly G protein activation.  The results of these experiments should provide important information on the function and diversity of this abundant excitatory amino acid receptor family. ***",
