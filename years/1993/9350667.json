 "awd_abstract_narration": "For several years, many of the intermediate courses for                     undergraduate physics majors at Lawrence University have                        included components that nurture skills to use sophisticated                    computational resources creatively and independently.  In this                  project we are take thing the next natural step by adding                       computational components to two advanced courses (Mathematical                  Methods of Physics and Advanced Electromagnetic Theory),                        thereby broadening the spectrum of feasible senior-level                        independent studies and introducing tools that become daily                     more crucial to the practicing scientist and engineer.                          Specifically, we are incorporating numerical treatment of 2D                    and 3D problems in wave propagation, fluid dynamics,                            elasticity, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetic theory.  To                  support this curricular development, we have added two 3D                       graphics workstations and a color printer to our existing local                 area network.  This hardware allows fast, thorough, graphical                   examination of large data files resulting from numerical                        simulations carried out locally or, more often, remotely via                    network access to one of the national supercomputer centers.",
