 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many anthropologists have suggested that carnivores played                 an important role in human evolution, as predators, competitors,                and carcass providers.  However, the details of these                           relationships remain fuzzy, largely because of a dearth of                      quantitative work on the ecological adaptations of the extinct                  carnivores.                                                                                                                                                          This research in the functional morphology and guild                       structure  of large bodied carnivores  will greatly improve the                 quality of our inferences concerning hominid-carnivore                          interactions in the African Plio-Pleistocene.  The graduate                     student will test hypotheses concerning critical behaviors of the               predators, such as their ability to cache prey in trees, kill                   large prey, and scavenge from kills.  It is significant to                      hominid evolutionary studies because it will fill in significant                information on the paleoecology of our ancestors.",
