Long-term  field settlement data are very and difficult to  collect and consequently are very scarce.  Such  data have been collected in connection with the  construction of Alibey Dam in Turkey since 1969.   The objective of this project is to use the  Alibey Dam data in analyzing long-term settlement  of soft ground.  Project funding will enable Dr.  K. Ozaydin and Mr. S. Ozcoban of Yildiz  University to work with Dr. T. Edil at the  University of Wisconsin-Madison.   Additionally,  Dr. Edil will visit Dr. Ozaydin's laboratory and  work with his team at the dam site.  Successful  completion of this effort is expected to verify  the validity of certain new concepts of soft  ground compression and contribute to the world  literature on the subject.     This project in civil engineering fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  United States and Turkey to combine complementary  talents and pool research resources in areas of  strong mutual interest and competence.  ***",
