 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on urban emergency services,                          particularly police and emergency medical services (EMS).  Private              emergency repair services and, to some extent, urban fire                       protection services are also relevant to the research.  The goal                is to undertake a set of research steps to make the \"Hypercube                  Queueing Model,\" truly useful for emergency services decision                   makers.  In particular, this research will incorporate into the                 Hypercube model the most recent trends in police and EMS dispatch               operations, such as those emerging from community-oriented                      policing.  Four public agencies, in four states, have agreed to                 serve as test sites and to provide data to the researchers for this             project.                                                                             The Hypercube model will undergo a set of enhancements that                will make it compatible with community-oriented policing, the EMS               dispatch environment and other important emergency response                     systems.  The results could be of significant value to municipal                emergency services agencies in improving the productivity of their              response units.",
