 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306199  Phillips       This project studies differential equations from two  different areas, the calculus of variations related to nonlinear  elasticity and the evolution of defects for nonlinear systems.   Continuing work on the regularity of solutions to problems from  nonlinear elasticity builds on recently established results  showing that certain boundary value problems from two dimensional  elasticity have solutions which are locally Lipschitz continuous  homeomorphisms.  Efforts will now be made to derive estimates for  these solutions and to use them to address regularity questions  for general boundary value problems. A particular class of  elliptic variational problems called polyconvex will also be  studied to determine gradient estimates for solutions to this  type of problem and to investigate the possibility of isolated  singularities in their solutions.  The second line of work  concerns smooth solutions to the parabolic Ginzburg-Landau  system.  For each fixed moment of time, the solution is viewed as  a vector field over the spacial domain.  A defect is defined as  place where the field is null.  The evolution of the  defect pattern and how it depends on the nonlinear structure of  the system is to be investigated.  In particular the phenomena  of creations, mutual annihilation and stable pattern formation  of defects are to be studied.       Partial differential equations form a basis for  mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of  mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as  it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about  the solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for approximation of solutions and  estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
