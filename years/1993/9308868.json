 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the issue of automated hypothesization             of situation models that are needed as contexts for reasoning and               decision making.  The three different but related aspects that are              addressed by this research are:  1.  Learning from domain data the              qualitative relationships among domain attribute and their                      associated probabilistic uncertainty knowledge; 2.  Integration of              uncertainty knowledge and other known causal qualitative                        relationships of the domain into a single graphical knowledge                   structure; and 3.  Hypothesization of small and interesting                     situation models from the intermediate representation of domain                 knowledge acquired in the preceding step.  The learning of                      qualitative relationships from databases is extended to include                 acquisition of temporal dependencies among attributes, and also to              the cases when the available data is in the form of multi-                      databases.  This learning method is also sought to be applied to                the problem of incomplete databases.  The knowledge based dynamic               hypothesization of situation models is sought to be extended to                 apply to path planning and temporal modeling problems.  The issue               of specifying a situation model at varying levels of precision and              certainty are also examined.//",
