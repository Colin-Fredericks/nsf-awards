 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historical information that dates back to a time before                    endangered populations were affected by human disturbance could be              used to design specific conservation strategies.  However direct                observation of changes in the population structure are difficult                because they necessitate long-term surveillance and sampling.  The              advent of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) makes it possible to              extract genetic information from museum specimens.  Thus, the time              range that is accessible for the study of genetic parameters in                 endangered species is substantially extended.  The potential of                 this approach for its application in conservation genetics by                   addressing concrete management problems involving the endangered                tiger beetle, Cicindela dorsalis will be examined.                              %%%                                                                             The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be used to examine                     variation in mtDNA of specimens from museum collections.  Changes               in genetic structured over time will be assessed by comparing data              from the historical specimens to an extensive data base on mtDNA                variation in extant populations.  Three main conservation questions             will be addressed concerning (a) the choice of a source population              for reintroduction into historical habitat, (b) the importance of               the metapopulation for the management of the species, and (c) the               loss of genetic variation after bottlenecks.",
