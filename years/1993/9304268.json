The objective is to find numerical  algorithms suitable for large parallel computers that can much  more efficiently model the dynamics of macromolecules such as  proteins, DNA, and lipids.  Emphasis is on the use of integration  schemes, notably symplectic schemes, that can use large time  steps to produce qualitatively correct simulations for long-time  integrations.  The goal is to obtain the desired information with  the least computational effort, and the methodology is to  use mathematical analysis and computational experiments on  model problems.  The techniques developed are to be tested on  realistic molecular models as part of a different, complementary  research project involving software development.  Among the  techniques to be considered, the better known ones are multiple  time steps, constraint dynamics, and fast Coulomb solvers.       Mathematical formulas and computer programs are being  devised that can predict typical motions of large molecules such  as proteins and DNA.  The aim is find shortcuts that enable very  fast calculations on large computers.  These ideas are tested  for accuracy and speed, and the more useful ones are put into  the software that biologists and other scientists use to study  the action of molecules.  Computer simulations can help the  scientist to understand how molecules perform biological  functions, which can be very difficult to observe experimentally.   Such studies are also useful in the design of molecules for  agricultural and medical purposes.  ***",
