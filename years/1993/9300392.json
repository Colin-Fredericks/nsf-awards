The Division                     supervises Ph.D. training programs of the Graduate School of                    Arts and Sciences for students who are engaged in biological                    research in laboratories on the Medical School campus. This                     10 week summer research program will support 10                                 undergraduate students working in the fields of microbial                       biochemistry and genetic regulation.  A research-related                        course, a student-faculty research seminar series that will                     include discussions of ethical issues related to the project                    focus, and a career development discussion series will                          accompany the laboratory research.  Students will be                            recruited from a nation-wide pool, with a particular                            emphasis on recruiting qualified minority students and                          women. They will have the opportunity to carry out projects                     in the laboratories of any of 17 Division faculty who are                       participating in this program. The undergraduates will also                     be provided with opportunities to meet other majority and                       minority research faculty and graduate students, in both                        academic and social settings.",
