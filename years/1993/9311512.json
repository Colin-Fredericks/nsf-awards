This project will use theory from the  study of political institutions and political  culture to examine the potential for  democratization in Uganda.  The study will assess  democratization in Uganda through two mechanisms:  first, by the appraisal of a novel institutional  framework, the Ugandan Resistance Council system;  and second, by surveying Ugandans for the  presence of democratic attitudes.  Project  funding will enable Mr. Ottemoeller to spend six  months in Uganda collecting data and coordinating  surveys.  Information gathered during this study  will provide a valuable description of the  Ugandan polity.    This project in political science fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling a scientist early in his  career to conduct fieldwork and collect data in  an international setting in order to enhance his  dissertation and develop collaborative linkages  with African counterparts.  ***",
