 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microlithography Chemical Company plans to conduct a synthetic                  research program to explore a new synthetic and manufacturing                   approach for the development of advanced novolak resins for                     microelectronic, printed circuit board, and LCD applications.  More             precisely, an evaluation of scientifically designed novolak resins              with superior properties and reproducibility, specifically                      applicable for use in positive photoresists will be undertaken.                 These resins would be designed based on recently published work on              the hydrogen bonding interactions between novolaks and                          photosensitive components of the resist.  They would also be                    designed to give higher dissolution rates, improved thermal                     stability, better batch-to-batch reproducibility, and very low                  metal ion contamination.                                                                                                                                        We plan to undertake an experimental program and develop a new                  synthetic approach, prepare discrete low MW oligomeric components,              and to convert these oligomers into a series of block copolymer                 resins to be evaluated for relevant performance.  MCC will carry                out a program which could lead to the development of solid novolak              resins with less than 100 ppb metal ion and \u001a 10% batch-to-batch                reproducibility, and which are capable of providing resists with                better than 0.5 \u001am resolution, approximately 100 mJ/cm2 threshold               energy, and at least 130\u001aC thermal stability.",
