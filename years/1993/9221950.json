 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trace elements are those not found in large abundance in the                    atmosphere, hydrosphere or geosphere, yet they are important                    tracers of biogeochemical processes, and many are required for                  life, particularly in the marine environment.  Pioneers such as                 Clair C. Patterson were among the first to obtain the accurate data             necessary for proper interpretation of these elements.  In honor of             Professor Patterson's achievements in this field, and on the event              of his retirement, a symposium is hereby proposed which will focus              on trace element biogeochemistry in the global environment.  The                symposium will take place on December 3-4, 1992, at California                  Institute of Technology.  Approximately 24 distinguished                        biogeochemists will be invited to present keynote talks.  These                 talks will be supplemented by a research poster session which will              be open the scientific community.  The symposium format will allow              ample time for discussion of the progress and future in trace                   element biogeochemistry, and proceedings will be published in a                 peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the symposium.  The symposium                will be unique in its comprehensive view of trace element                       biogeochemistry and its cycles among the major spheres of the                   earth.",
