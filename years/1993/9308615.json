 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308615  Backus    Two of the outstanding issues in international macroeconomics  concern the variability of relative prices (why are real exchange  rats so volatile?) and the absence of international capital  mobility (why is there so little international borrowing and  lending?).  Neither of these features of international economies  is predicted by standard dynamic general equilibrium theory.  The  purpose of this project is to look more closely at the evidence  and assess four extensions of the theory designed to explain  these two features of the world economy, with particular emphasis  on price variability.  The extensions of the theory are  especially valuable because they improve measures of the welfare  consequences of government policies that influence relative price  flexibility and international capital mobility.     The extensions incorporate, respectively, incomplete markets,  limited enforceability of foreign loans, fixed costs of changing  export capacity, and wage/price inertia into a general  equilibrium setting, where prices and quantities are both  explained.  The theory is developed in a form that makes  comparison with data relatively straightforward.  Each  theoretical extension will be evaluated with regard to its  ability to mimic observed fluctuations in relative prices and  international capital flows.   ***",
