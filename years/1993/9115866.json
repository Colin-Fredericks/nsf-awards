 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forest trees have the potential to serve as substantial sinks for               rising atmospheric CO2 levels if nutrient limitations                           characteristic of most forest soils can be overcome.  Increased                 carbon availability may stimulate a symbioltic relationship that                exists between tree roots and soil fungi with enhanced nutrient                 acquisitions by trees as a result. My work investigates the                     possibility that physiological differencces between the two major               types if symbiotic soil fungi may lead to differential                          responses of tree species to CO2 enrichment.  Two of the major                  differences hypothesized to exist between the symbioses lie in 1)               the amount of carbon acquired by the tree that must be allocated                towards support of the fungal partner, and 2) the amount of                     nutrients taken up from the soil by the fungus and released to the              host tree.  Radiotracer techniqueswill be used to measure                       carbon allocation and phosphorus uptake in tree species engaging in             the two types of symbioses and growing at three levels of CO2                   enrichment. An understanding of mechanisms underlying the responses             of forest trees to environmental change will improve our ability to             predict forest ecosystems behavior in a CO2-enriched world.",
