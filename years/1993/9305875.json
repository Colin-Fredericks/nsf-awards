 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305875  Packard    Embryonic turtles survive to hatching in some nests but not in  others.  Moreover, hatchlings from some of the successful nests  are large and robust whereas neonates from other successful nests  are small and weakly.  Why does survival by embryos vary?  Why do  hatchlings differ so much in size and vigor?  Does the variation  in vigor of hatchlings affect their ability to survive once they  have emerged from the nest cavity?  Research outlined in this  proposal first will test the hypothesis that survival by  embryonic turtles is affected by the physical environment in  their nests (as well as by maternity).  The contents of natural  nests of both snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) and painted  turtles (Chrysemys picta) will be manipulated so that effects of  the environment on hatching success can be clearly distinguished  from genetic and nongenetic effects related to maternity.  The  physical environment will be measured in these same nests so that  strong inferences can be made concerning the specific causes of  embryonic mortality.  The program next will test the hypothesis  that substantial variation in size and vigor of hatchlings is  induced by the environment during incubation, and that this  environmentally-induced variation affects the survival by turtles  during the neonatal period.  The program of study will document  critical links between the environment encountered by developing  embryos, survival by embryos to hatching, phenotypic variation in  hatchlings, and survival by hatchlings during the neonatal  period.  The findings consequently will have important bearing on  conservation programs that entail captive propagation and \"head-  starting\" for several kinds of sea turtles.  ***",
