 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental issues of the methodology, convex modelling of                      uncertainty, dedicated to unified treatment of geometric and                    material characteristics, are put forward in this research.                     Instead of classical probabilistic methods, no probabilistic                    treatment is utilized, but the new set-theoretical description of               the uncertain variables and functions is presented.  In addition,               instead of usual optimization problems, where the minimum possible              responses or least favorable shapes of the structures are sought,               here an uncertainty modelling is developed as an anti-optimization              problem of finding the least favorable responses due to shape or                material uncertainty.  Special emphases are placed on vibration and             dynamic buckling of viscoelastic structures.  The novel dynamic                 stability criterion based on Lyapunov exponents is introduced for               viscoelastic structures.  New treatment of uncertainty is                       especially attractive from the design point of view-since extrenal              responses can be used for valid design of structures, with scant                experimental data needed for their substantiation.",
