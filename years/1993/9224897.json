The students will be doing research focusing on                          polymer synthesis, surface and interface science,                               fabrication and processing of composite and adhesive                            materials, testing and characterization of materials systems                    and final constituents, and computer modeling and simulation                    to understand and predict performance of advanced polymeric                     adhesives and composites.                                                       %%%                                                                             The interdisciplinary nature of this program provides a                         realistic exposure to large scale research on complex                           problems wherein many lines of attack involving different                       scientific and engineering disciplines must be brought to                       bear on key issues in order to make progress.  Students have                    an opportunity to work closely with faculty and other                           graduate students and to utilize state-of-the-art equipment                     and instrumentation in their work.  They also receive                           professional development training through technical                             presentations of their work at a technology symposium held                      at the end of the summer, and through preparation of a final                    written report.",
