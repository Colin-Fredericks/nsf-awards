 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to integrate real-world applications and                     mathematical modeling into the secondary mathematics                            curriculum.  To these ends, 30 well-prepared high school                        mathematics teachers from around the State of New York will                     participate in two successive summer, residential four-week                     institutes to be held at SUNY in Brockton.  In these                            institutes participates will: (1) survey and examine                            available, exemplary classroom materials on applications and                    modeling; (2) study the underlying mathematical ideas and                       principles; (3) learn directly from industrial users of                         mathematics; and (4) explore appropriate uses of graphing                       calculators and microcomputers.  Participants will be chosen                    in five \"teams\" of six -- each team representing a region of                    New York State.  During the first summer -- in addition to                      their academic studies -- these teams of teachers will also                     prepare their own lessons and units involving applications                      and modeling, which they will pilot in their own classrooms                     during the succeeding academic year.  The institutes will                       also include sessions on staff development to help prepare                      the participating teachers to conduct in-service workshops                      in their local schools and, in the second academic year,                        throughout their respective regions.  Support by project                        staff for all these activities will include at least two                        site visits to each teacher's classroom, as well as to                          periodic regional meetings of the teams.  Cost sharing                          represents 58% of the total NSF contribution.",
