 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. David O'Connor, Mr Stephen Harvey will               collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Working at the site                 of Abydos in Southern Egypt, he will examine the large funerary                 cult complex established by the pharaoh Ahmose to determine how                 it developed and changed over time. The underlying goal of the                  work is to examine the economic and political relationships                     between a state level of government and and local level                         communities and to understand how state level goals are                         translated and adapted to often different local needs. It is                    known from recovered texts that Ahmose originally established a                 cult complex at Abydos to commemorate himself and his lineage.                  During the ca. 300 year course of its history, the function and                 direction of the complex was dramatically redirected towards more               local ends.                                                                                                                                                     Mr. Harvey will conduct a three stage field project. He will                    first survey portions of the site which have not yet been                       carefully examined. This is possible because remains of                         structures are still visible. He will then collect surface                      ceramics and use these to date different areas and structures. On               the basis of this information he will carry out controlled                      excavations. These data should allow him to examine how the                     nature of the site changed over time and gain insight into the                  underlying social processes responsible.                                                                                                                        This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists. It will shed light on                  the long term relationships between state authorities and local                 communities. Finally it will assing in the training of a                        promising scientist.",
