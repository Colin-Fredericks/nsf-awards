 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312160  Peacock-Lopez  Dr. Enrique Peacock-Lopez is supported by a grant from the  Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his  research in the theoretical treatment of biochemical reactions  in solution and on surfaces.  He has recently developed  theoretical methods for studying rapid biomolecular processes  on spherical surfaces,and has developed methodologies to  analyze open systems far from equilibrium.  Using these  methods, he plans to study chemical and biochemical processes  occurring on spherical surfaces such as those which occur in  the the early steps of internalization of large macromolecules  across the cell membrane via interaction with surface proteins.  %%%  After binding to a receptor at the surface of the cell, many  proteins such as hormones trigger a cascade of chemical  reactions which amplify this surface recognition signal and  perform important biological functions within the cell.  This  cascade of events can be very complex, involving feedback and  activation loops.  Enrique-Lopez is interested in expanding  upon an original minimal model of the activation pathway which  he will use in conjunction with experimental results to  elucidate a molecular level explanation of these amplification  processes.  ***",
