 "awd_abstract_narration": "Questions about the ethical responsibilities of professional                    archaeologists are more pressing than ever, given the                           accelerating degradation of archaeological resources and the                    pressures brought to bear on their disposition by an increasingly               diverse range of interest groups.  In response to this, the                     Society for American Archaeology has initiated a process of                     review of its existing policies on professional responsibility                  and ethics.  This project consists of a focused working                         conference that will bring together participants from a wide                    spectrum of archaeology and museum studies, who have been active                on ethical issues in a range of contexts.  The aim of the meeting               is to set the framework for a process of wide consultation with                 members of this society and other interested and involved                       organizations and groups.  The ultimate goal of this process is                 to formulate an updated and integrated set of ethics guidelines                 and a program of action that will help archaeologists fulfill                   responsibilities that they bear, not only to the discipline of                  archaeology and its scientific ideals, but also to non-                         archaeological interest groups and to the conservation of                       cultural resources.",
