 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is concerned with the representation theory and                 cohomology of finite groups over fields of prime characteristic.                Of particular interest are the homological properties of                        representations which underlie the basic module theory and the                  structure of the cohomology ring of the group which acts on the                 fundamental homological constructions.  The principal                           investigator plans to study the prime ideals which are the                      annihilators of cohomology elements and their relations to                      transfers from and restrictions to subgroups of the group.                      Categorical techniques, as well as hypercohomology spectral                     sequences associated to certain duality complexes and actions of                the Steenrod algebra, will be used for this investigation.  Other               questions on the structure of modules in the more general                       categorical setting will also be examined.  In addition, the                    principal investigator will continue work on the homological                    algebra of Hilbert modules and on computer methods for the                      computation of cohomology.                                                           The research supported concerns the representation theory of               finite groups.  A group is an algebraic object used to study                    transformations.  Because of this, groups are a fundamental tool                in physics, chemistry and computer science as well as                           mathematics.  Representation theory is an important method for                  determining the structure of groups.",
