 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308563  Gambhir  The Principal Investigator's research focuses on the network  management technologies needed to enable mobile communicators to  use wireless LANs.  Two areas are addressed:  1) techniques and  protocols for mobile wireless workstation LAN connection and 2)  management databases supporting mobile wireless workstations.  In  the first area, the emphasis is on design of protocols to ease  network management as opposed to providing maximum bandwidth.   The work also considers support for \"swarms\", which are mobile  users previously unconnected with the wireless LAN who wish to  communicate with each other.  In the second area, the work on  management databases emphasizes methods by which user  workstations can dynamically add and delete MIB information on  themselves from management databases, and on the use of  framebased databases optimized for real-time update.  Validation  procedures for the user-added data include the use of maybe  algebras and inference procedures.  The award provides support  for three years.",
