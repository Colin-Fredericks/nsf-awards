To understand how plants respond appropriately to the  different environmental stimuli that employ calcium as a common  second messenger, it is necessary to characterize the intracellular  calcium receptors, their functions, and their distribution in  various plant cells, organs, and tissues.  This laboratory has  cloned a gene for a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) that  has its own calcium receptor in the form of a C-terminal  calmodulin-like domain with 4 EF-hand motifs.  CDPK appears to be  the plant homologue of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein  kinases in animals.  A CDPK related kinase (CRK), whose C-terminal  domain has diverged, with nonconservative substitutions in the EF-  hand motifs has also been cloned.  Other features in the CRK  sequence predict that CRK may be myristoylated, possibly for  membrane localization, and that CRK may be phosphorylated by CDPK  and/or cell-cycle kinases.  Distinct homologues of CRK and CDPK  appear to be present and in both monocotyledonous and  dicotyledonous species, implying that both have conserved  functions.  This research will use a variety of molecular and  biochemical approaches to characterize further the structure and  function of these enzymes and to test the hypothesis that CDPK and  CRK are involved in transduction of intracellular calcium signals.   It will be determined whether CDPK and CRK are differentially  expressed in plant tissues and organs that respond to stimuli that  evoke calcium fluxes, and whether the levels and specific  activities of CDPK and CRK respond to changes in intracellular  calcium levels.  The significance of CRK sequence features will be  tested by determining whether they are conserved in Arabidopsis CRK  homologues and by direct biochemical characterization.  This  research will examine whether CDPK and CRK are involved in  intracellu lar calcium signaling, and provide insights into how  their roles may differ.  %%%  A variety of environmental signals that influence plant growth,  such as light, gravity, and wind, cause transient calcium fluxes in  plant cells.  To understand how plants respond appropriately to the  different environmental stimuli that employ calcium as a common  second messenger, it is necessary to characterize the intracellular  calcium receptors, their functions, and their distribution in  various plant cells, organs, and tissues.  This laboratory has  cloned genes for two calcium-dependent enzymes that are likely  important in the signal transduction pathways involving calcium.   The goals of this project are to characterize these enzymes further  and study their function in plants.  The results of this research  will increase our understanding of cellular calcium receptors and  how plant cells respond to changes in their environment.  ***",
