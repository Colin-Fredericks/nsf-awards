 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ecological Society of America (ESA) has taken an active                     leadership role in creating regional alliances of ecologists                    and educators.  ESA has held a highly successful conference                     on K-12 ecological education in conjunction with a meeting                      of the Association of Southeastern Biologists.  This                            conference was attended by a team from each state,                              consisting of one or two ecological researchers, teachers,                      science education administrators, and education faculty                         members.  Team members heard presentations on recent                            developments in pre-college ecological education, and they                      collaborated on an action plan for their respective states.                     The action plans and meeting proceedings were subsequently                      published in an ESA bulletin.  The Society has planned a                        similar conference for the Rocky Mountain region. Ecological                    education in this region is made more difficult by the high                     level of ecological diversity in the area, and the                              difficulties of travel for parts of the year.                                                                                                                   The proposed Rocky Mountain conference will create benefits                     throughout the region and beyond.  Once established,                            regional alliances such as this will be pivotal in                              implementing a national approach to ecological education.                       Conferences such as these capture the active participation                      of scientists in pre-college science education, create                          action plans for implementation, and solidify partnerships                      for educational improvement.                                                                                                                                    Cost sharing represents 26% of the NSF contribution.",
