 "awd_abstract_narration": "A line of cleavage divides social science thinking on \"ethnicity,\"              defined as the genetic and cultural features such as skin color,                language, religion, and homeland by which a person tends to anchor              his or her sense of self.  On the one hand are scholars who stress              the utility of ethnic identifications in achieving political goals              (the instrumentalists); on the other are those who view ethnicity               much more as an inherent part of individual identity (the                       primordialists).  The primordialist view would suggest that people              join ethnically based political parties largely for psychological               reasons while, for instrumentalists, the decision to join turns on              how efficiently the organization appears to pursue its economic or              political objectives.                                                                                                                                           Employing a mailed questionnaire, this doctoral dissertation                    research project tests hypotheses issuing from the theory of social             identity, a theory that promises to provide a superior grasp of                 ethnicity's primordial aspect and its relationship to ethnically                based political participation in Germany, Britain and France.  If               the hypotheses are borne out, this research will offer empirical                evidence in favor of the primordialist perspective, suggesting that             instrumentalists might have to revise their accounts of the rise                and decline of ethnically based political parties and of ethnic                 group behavior in general.  The research will indicate the value of             the theory of social identity for explaining why people join                    ethnically based political parties.",
