 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Donald Andrews of Yale University to              collaborate in economics research with Professor Werner Ploberger of            the Institute of Econometrics and Operations Research of the                    Technical University of Vienna, Austria.  These investigators began             joint studies in the econometrics of structural change during a 1991            visit to Yale University by Dr. Ploberger.  They produced two papers            establishing new optimal tests for situations with an unknown                   changepoint and for testing problems when a nuisance parameter                  appears only under the alternative.  Now that Dr. Ploberger has                 returned to Vienna, they propose to continue their collaborative                research focusing on several related topics.  These include: 1)                 further analysis of the properties of the optimal tests; 2)                     treatment of tests of multiple structural changes; 3) estimation of             breakpoints; and 4) inadmissibility of likelihood ratio tests in                this context.  This joint effort links one of the leading young                 econometricians of the U.S. with a highly regarded European                     colleague to pursue state of the art research in theoretical and                applied economics.                                                                                                                                              This collaborative research is likely to advance both econometric               theory and practice.  Among the methods which will be developed are             some especially useful for applied economics research when the basic            relationships being analyzed change dramatically.  One such area is             the important research being done on the economic implications of               global climate change.",
