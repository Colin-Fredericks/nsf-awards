 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile genetics sequences, or transposable elements, are                   ubiquitous features of mammalian genomes.  They cause mutations by              inactivation of genes, by changing the regulation of gene                       expressions, and by acting as sites for recombination which leads               to chromosomal rearrangement.  To understand the ways in which                  transposable elements affect the organisms, we need a more accurate             assessment of transposition rates, and an understanding of the                  mechanisms by which elements within the genome interact.  In this               regard, it has been observed that elements compared from within a               single species are generally more similar to each other than                    elements from two related species.  This phenomenon, known as                   concerted evolution, suggests that elements are rapidly homogenized             by some force(s) acting within a species.  Concerted evolution is               a common feature of transposable elements families, but is usually              observed at the species level or above.                                              This project examines a unique example of concerted evolution              of transposable elements at the population level.  Concerted                    evolution has been shown to occur in hundreds of copies of the mys              retrotransposon in a single geographic population of the white-                 footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, near Orono, Maine.  Although                 concerted evolution of mammalian transposable elements is generally             believed to result from transposition by one or a few \"molecular                drivers\", data from this population suggest that biased gene                    conversion may be the mechanism operating here.  Furthermore, this              gene conversion appears to effect only part of the mys element.                 The specific objectives of this project are:  i) to determine the               proportion of mys elements in the Maine population which have                   undergone concerted evolution; ii) to test the hypothesis that                  concerted evolution of mys within this  population is due to biased             gene conversion; and iii) to formulate hypotheses to explain the                apparently limited region of the element undergoing gene                        conversion.  Methods employed will include radioanalytic imaging of             genomic Southern blots and DNA sequence comparisons of elements                 from the population of interest and orthologous elements from                   control populations.  This study will be one of the first to                    examine the population biology of a mammalian transposable element.             Concerted evolution in this population may well provide insight in              to some previously unrecognized process by which transposable                   elements interact within the genome and influence the genetic basis             of population adaptation to changing conditions.//",
