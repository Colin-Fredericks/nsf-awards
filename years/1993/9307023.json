 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problems that are to be addressed in this project lie in               the general area of spectral theory and number theory, with                     particular interest in trace formulae, explicit formulae and                    prime number theorems, and various analytic and arithmetic                      aspects of Arakelov theory.  The proposed research is very broad,               involving analysis, number theory, and algebraic geometry.                           This research uses the techniques of algebraic geometry, one               of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had                a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                   origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                        robotics.",
