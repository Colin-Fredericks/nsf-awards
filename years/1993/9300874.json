These fungi play a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling in forest communities.  Only 100 species out of an estimated diversity of 250 species have been reported from Hawaii.  The primary product will be a complete database of all specimens (including distribution, plant associates, plant community types), which will contribute to an Agaricales flora of the Hawaiian Islands.  The results of the flora will allow the testing of hypotheses of island biogeography, vicariance, dispersal and fungal endemism, and will contribute to a reconstruction of the biotic history of the Hawaiian Islands and the maintenance of its biodiversity.  The degree of urbanization in Hawaii makes this project extremely urgent and extremely important to conservation planning by land managers.  The fungal collections will be used for research and for training students. .%%% This three year project will survey, describe and illustrate the diversity and geographic distribution of the Agaricales fungi (mushrooms and allies) of the Hawaiian Islands.  These fungi play a vital ecological role in nutrient cycling in forest communities, yet only 100 species out of an estimated diversity of 250 species have been reported from Hawaii.  The primary product of this study will be a complete database of all specimens of fungi, their distribution on the islands, their particular association with specific plants and their membership in specific plant communities.  This database will be issued as a complete, illustrated manual.  The results of the survey will also help investigators to reconstruct of the biotic history of the Hawaiian Islands and to plan the  maintenance of its biodiversity.  The degree of urbanization in Hawaii makes this project extremely urgent and extremely important to conservation planning by land managers.  The plant collections will be used for research and for training students. ***       `     h     p     x   (#                                                                              `     h     p     x   (#",
