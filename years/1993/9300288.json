 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to establish an NSF-REU Sites                         project in the Department of Biology at Boston University                       for ten students.  Past experience has shown that NSF awards                    for undergraduate research have stimulated many previous                        participants to become productive scholars.  Six cross-                         disciplinary, team-oriented projects will provide each group                    of two students with the opportunity to work closely with                       two experienced faculty mentors on a common project.  The                       emphasis on the REU site project is to promote research                         interactions between students and research biologists whose                     disciplines are traditionally focused on different sub-                         disciplines in Biology.  Collaborative research topics                          include:  the effects of heavy metal uptake on reproduction                     in dogfish shark, regulation of neurotransmitters during                        development, intensity of selection in environmentally                          induced mutations, establishment of cell lines from                             endangered species, adrenocortical activity in captive bats,                    and mechanisms of gene induction in retinal cells.  Faculty                     mentors have been carefully selected on the basis of their                      experience in the classroom, research contacts with                             undergraduates, and their own research contributions.  The                      participating faculty mentors have a broad spectrum of                          research interests and are represented by both beginning and                    establish investigators.                                                                                                                                        Qualified undergraduates will be recruited mostly form                          regional four-year colleges that do not provide significant                     opportunities for research and from Boston University.  The                     Program will recruit five students from local and regional                      colleges and five from Boston University.  Recruitment                          efforts will specifically target minority, women, and                           physically challenged students.  Selection procedures will                      be based on scholarly aptitude, research potential, and                         previous experience.  Students will be expected to live on                      the university campus and to participate in the full range                      of research opportunities, weekly discussions, and social                       gatherings to foster a sense of community among students and                    faculty mentors.  A special ethics component will focus on                      issues such as standards of scientific integrity, authorship                    responsibility, information privacy and protection, ethical                     treatment of animals, alternative animal models, conflict of                    interest, and plagiarism.",
