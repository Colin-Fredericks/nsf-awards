The Association for Women in Mathematics would administer a program  of mini-grants for these activities which would be known as Sonya Kovalevsky Days.  Each  Sonya Kovalevsky day will have 100-500 female high school students and 10 to 100 high school  teachers as participants.  They are designed to encourage young women to continue their study  of mathematics, to assist them with the sometimes awkward transition between high school and  college mathematics, to assist the teachers of these students, and to encourage colleges and  universities to develop more extensive cooperation with high schools in their respective areas.   Follow-up studies will be done to discover whether the participants go to college, what they  major in, and what they do upon graduation.  Also, an evaluation will be done of the host  institutions' subsequent activities, including more Sonya Kovalevsky Days and/or other activities  designed to enhance the participation and success of women and girls in mathematics.    It is to bridge the difficult transition between high school and college mathematics that this  project is designed.  By letting capable young women get together with their peers, by  introducing them to interesting substantive mathematics, by showing them what mathematicians  do and how others use mathematics in their jobs, it is expected that more will go on to major  in mathematics in college, and eventually some of those young women will become  mathematicians or scientists.  Efforts to give them a sense of participation, but also a feel for  problems solving and a love, not a loathing, for competition are imbedded in the project design.   Although not a specific goal of this project, opportunities for talented and interested students--  and sometimes for their teachers--to secure  scholarships at the host or other institutions, and to  obtain internships and part-time employment at government agencies, and at businesses, have  grown out of similar experiences.  The project is also designed to assist teachers by affording  them the opportunity to see what sorts of activities and support for their female students can  prove useful, especially through ideas garnered from workshop speakers and their peer  participants.  It will also provide them with a liaison with a college or university and the ability  to call on its resources, as well as those of women mathematicians in the community, for advice  and for future college and employment placements for their women students.  ***",
