The objective of the proposed project is  to provide the opportunity for the Principal Investigator and two  graduate students to closely work with the OTIS Elevator Company,  in order to develop and test several dynamic dispatching schemes  for elevator systems.  These are novel schemes based on research  carried out by the PI and his students in the broader context of  Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS).  In particular, the  solution to some dispatching control problems is of a form which  ultimately depends on a set of discrete \"threshold\" parameters.   Some of the proposed schemes are based on \"learning\" the optimal  values of these parameters, based on readily observed data from  an elevator system and by applying techniques recently developed  for the on-line control of stochastic DEDS.  Thus, this is an  opportunity to put some theory developed for DEDS control and  performance optimization to the test, as well as to gain a better  understanding of a class of DEDS and related problems of design,  analysis, control, and performance optimization.  In accordance  with the guidelines of this Initiative, the OTIS Elevator Company  has already made a commitment of $30,000 (non-federal funds) to  support this effort and has assigned a co-investigator for the  project.   ***",
