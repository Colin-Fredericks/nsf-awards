 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the U.S. PI, Dr. Kenneth Golden of the                   Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Department,                         University of Vermont, to travel to Australia for a six-month                   stay to work with Dr. Jagadishwar Mahanty at the Australian                     National University's, Department of Theoretical Physics.  The                  work constitutes an extension of the U.S. PI's current research,                funded by NSF's Theoretical Physics Program (PHY 91-15695).  The                method to be used in conducting this theoretical work is the                    Quasi-Localized Charge approximation.                                                                                                                           It is expected that this joint effort will advance the state of                 knowledge about the dynamical properties of strongly coupled                    Coulomb liquids, substantially improving our understanding of how               correlation effects modify the collective mode structures in                    superlattices.  The Theoretical Physics group at ANU has an                     outstanding reputation and Dr. Mahanty is renowned for his work                 in solid state physics, specifically lattice dynamics and                       electron band theory.  The benefit to be derived is the joining                 of the complementary skills of the investigators working in                     liquid-state plasma and solid state physics.  This research                     extends Dr. Golden's current NSF supported research on strongly                 coupled Coulomb systems.",
