 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Price and his colleages at the University of Wisconsin's                    Laboratory for Archaeological Chemistry will develop and test a                 number of methods for reconstructing past human activities which                are reflected in living surfaces from excavated archaeological                  sites. They will apply a series of physical and chemical analyses               on materials collected from a present day settlement in Oaxaca                  Mexico. A large series of soil samples were excavated under                     controlled conditions in earthern floor houses where the actual                 activities carried out were directly observed. The team will now                conduct physical analysis to determine micromorphology and particle             size. They will also search for phytoliths and other organic                    inclusions. On a chemical level they will determine element                     concentrations and and attempt to identify organic materials,                   especially fatty acids. They will use this situation to determine               the relationship between specific human behavior and the subtle                 physical and chemical indications left on the ground. The results               will then be evaluated through application in a series of \"true\"                archaeological contexts.                                                                                                                                        Unfortunately many activities which take place at a simple                      technological level leave little if any evident archaeological                  debris. Many others leave traces which rapidly disintegrate and                 thus escape archaeological attention. By studying archaeological                sites at a chemical and fine scale physical level, Dr. Price and                his colleagues hope to develop techniques which will help in the                reconstruction of prehistoric behavior. If successful these                     approaches can be employed by archaeologists in many parts of the               world and serve to increase our understanding of the past.",
