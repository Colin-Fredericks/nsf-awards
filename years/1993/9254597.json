 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just as the preparedness of a classroom teacher directly                        effects the achievement/attitude of students in the school                      classroom, so can the same be said for the preparedness of                      university mathematics educators.  POEMT is a two-year program                  to develop a model preservice elementary teacher preparation                    program.  It offers professors and adjuncts an opportunity to                   participate in two summer sessions and corresponding academic                   years emulating the NCTM Standards.  Three weeks of intensive                   summer \"coursework\" at FIU including one week of actual                         clinical experiences are scheduled each year with follow-up                     activities each academic year.  Participants will be expected                   to deliver the fruits of their program participation each                       following academic year through trialling activities and                        revising their pragram/syllabus.  Forty participants will be                    carefully selected from across the country.  An outstanding                     staff of respected mathematics educators, including current                     NCTM President, has committed to lead instructional sessions                    and visit sites.  Funding support has also been pledged by                      Delta Airlines, Cuisenaire Company, and Longman Publishers.                     The proposal makes a strong case for the need to provide                        opportunities for professors to upgrade their knowledge and                     skills to guide the restructuring of preservice teachers, and                   to interact with colleagues over extended periods of time.",
