 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research involves participation in the 1993 Intergovernmental               Oceanographic Commission Open-Ocean Baseline Survey for Trace                   Metals: Atlantic Ocean expedition, scheduled aboard the Canadian                ship CSS Hudson between July and August, 1993. The IOC Open-Ocean               Baseline program is organized t evaluate the current concentrations             of a variety of trace metals and other anthropogenic pollutants in              the major water masses of the world oceans.  This will stand as a               \"baseline\" against which future anthropogenic impacts can be                    compared.  The proposed cruise track and station locations will                 allow sampling of deep, source water masses to the North Atlantic               in the overflow and formation regions.  In between deep profiling               stations, near-surface samples will be collected in transects                   (every 3-4 hours) using a clean, towed \"fish\"/pumping system.                                                                                                   Samples will be collected by the PI under \"contamination-free\"                  conditions for a number of U.S. and international participating                 laboratories.  Samples from the deep profiling stations will be                 filtered under clean-lab conditions for particulate (>0.4 um) and               total dissolved (<0.4 um) trace elements. Samples from the surface              transect will be processed for particulate (>0.4 um), total                     dissolved (0.4 um), colloidal (3,000 MW to 0.4 um), and truly                   dissolved (<3,000 MW) metals and analyzed by the PI for Cr(VI), Mn,             Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb. Samples for dissolved DOC and DON               fractions (as described for metals above) will also be collected                along with the colloidal trace metal samples and analyzed by the                high temperature catalytic oxidation technique to address the                   unresolved questions regarding the importance of high MW DOC/DON in             seawater.",
