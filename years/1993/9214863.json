 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award  will assist the College  of Chemistry at                    the University  of California Berkeley in  the purchase of a                    triple quadrupole  mass spectrometer equipped  with electro-                    spray   ionization   capabilities   and   interfaced  liquid                    chromatograph. The  instrument is needed  by members of  the                    Department   of  Chemistry   and  will   also  provide  mass                    spectroscopic  services  for  the  Department  of  Molecular                    Biology. Research areas supported by the acquisition of this                    instrument are:                                                                 1)  Structure determination of protein-bound pigments.                          2)  Analysis  of  charged  high  molecular  weight fullerene                    derivatives.                                                                    3)  Design  and  synthesis   of  new  classes of  synthetic                     biopolymers.                                                                    4)  Linkage  position   determination  of  metal-coordinated                    oligosaccharides.                                                               5) Site specific incorporation  of unnatural amino acids in                     proteins.                                                                       6)  Analysis of densely charged poly-onium compounds.                           7)  Preparation of peptides with defined secondary structure.                   8)  Structure determination of transcription factors.                           9)  Structure determination of RNA molecules.                                                                                                                   %%%                                                                                     A mass spectrometer is an instrument used to measure                    the precise molecular weight of a molecule. The electrospray                    device is a  way to volatilize the sample so  that it may be                    introduced into  the mass spectrometer.  This information is                    needed so that the  chemical composition and, sometimes, the                    molecular  structure of  newly synthesized  compounds may be                    determined. An instrument of this description is required in                    the Berkeley facility because  the current user needs cannot                    be meet with the existing equipment.",
