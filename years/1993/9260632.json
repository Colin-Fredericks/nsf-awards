 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the need for faster processing, a growing  number of newer               computing models are increasing speed with intriguing physical                  designs.  Massive parallelism, for example, exploits unique                     physical arrangements in order to increase computer performance.                Seemingly, the signal itself is becoming less important.  One can               extrapolate further and envision a computer concept, where the only             role of the signals is to establish a stable structure, which in                turn would imply solution.                                                                                                                                      The objective of this research is to examine a working hypothesis               that certain high performance computing can be done by negotiating              equilibria of appropriate anti-symmetric digital circuits through               random noise.  The experimental circuits to be used will be                     embodiments of particular algorithms.  If the partial inputs and                outputs keep well defined values, then we believe that it is                    possible to superimpose chaotic perturbations in such a way that                the processor will settle to its stable state if and only if it                 attains a solution of the algorithm.  Such an asynchronous                      resonance processor can be a high performance platform for a                    variety of applications, primarily in the area of computer                      intelligence.",
