 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, engineering programs have developed courses                    that teach sketching and computer applications to design as                     separate concepts. The next step is needed in the development                   of these programs - that of integrating the sketching and                       computer aided design into a unified course with clearly                        defined purposes and goals. Courses are still taught by using                   the manual drafting lab for half of the course and using a                      computer laboratory for computer experience. The time has                       arrived to admit that the computer is the design tool of the                    present. There is a need to teach sketching skills that                         encourage problem solving and planning and then using the                       computer for the practical computer applications of design and                  analysis. It is essential to integrate the sketching process                    into the instruction of computer aided design. This method of                   instruction will enhance the correlation between sketching and                  the computer. The complete integration of the computer in the                   first course of the design sequence will accelerate the                         students' progress toward its applications in the areas of                      solid modeling, finite element analysis, computer aided                         manufacturing, computer integrated manufacturing, and computer                  numerical control. The concept of solid modeling and how it                     relates to the field of manufacturing has become an important                   issue and must be addressed. This issue will be addressed and                   the development of curriculum materials will be enhanced with                   the equipment requested in this proposal.",
