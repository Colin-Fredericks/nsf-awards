 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial machine vision was introduced in the 1970's.  To this                point it has not been used widely for automation in manufacturing               due to performance, complexity, and cost issues.  Most commercial               vision systems are based on video technology with separate                      cameras, frame grabbers, digitizers and processors.  Reliance on                video technology limits performance and requires expensive,                     complete architectures.  The maximum video frame rate is 30 per                 second and the average complete system costs over $20,000.                                                                                                      In 1991 DVT introduced the first commercial Integrated Vision                   System.  The new gray scale vision technology is simple, compact,               and inexpensive.  Priced under $2,000., this technology packages                the functionality of commercial gray scale vision systems into                  one device, the size of a book, weighing less than 2 pounds.  The               improvements offered by this new technology are changing the                    market for vision as many more applications have become                         economically feasible.                                                                                                                                          This research will develop a color integrated vision system.                    Based on currently available CCDs, the research will result in                  development of a new technology for directly digitizing and                     processing color optical information.  Devices based on this                    technology will provide the ability to perform low cost, high                   speed quality control and verification for automated                            manufacturing.",
