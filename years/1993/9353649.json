This initiative,  which is a component of Maine's Science and Technology Strategic Plan, would take advantage  of the state's Centers for Innovation in aquaculture, biomedical technology, and metals and  electronics.    The program would encourage Maine firms to work with academic-based researchers to address  industry challenges.  The collaborations would not only produce short-term benefits for  businesses at the heart of Maine's economy, but they would position the  participants, as  individuals and as cohesive research groups, to expand their research capacities.    Maine EPSCoR is requesting $75,000 to pilot test this program.  The Maine Science and  Technology Commission, as fiscal agent, will provide additional funding totaling $77,158.",
