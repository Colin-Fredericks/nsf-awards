 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to capitalize on the recent developments in                 RNA biochemistry to prepare purified RNA from a diverse range of                systems in quantities sufficient for crystallographic studies.                  It focuses on three RNAs that span a broad range of sizes and                   structural motifs:  dodecamer with non-canonical UU base pairs, a               30 nucleotide autolytic RNA, and a 160 nucleotide domain of the                 Tetrahymena intron.  These RNAs will be examined with X-ray                     crystallography and several biochemical methods.  Thermal                       denaturation, kinetic, and chemical protection studies will be                  used to refine understanding of the crystallographic structure.                 By integrating structural and biochemical results, Dr. Kundrot                  expects to obtain a better understanding of these RNA structures                and how they function.                                                          %%%                                                                             It has become increasingly apparent in the last decade that RNAs                play many roles in a cell that are important in human health and                biotechnology.  The structures RNAs adopt are of manifest                       importance because they play central roles in the regulation of                 gene expression ranging from protein recognition sites to self-                 splicing active sites.  The three-dimensional structure of RNA                  molecules must be determined if we are to understand how RNA can                adopt stable folds and perform functions such as catalysis.  Dr.                Kundrot proposes to determine the structure of three RNA                        molecules:  a self-cleaving RNA, an RNA with unusual base pairs,                and a RNA folding domain that is more than twice as large as the                largest RNA structure known today.  These structures will provide               with new insights into how RNA functions in cells and these                     insights will help in the development of drugs to improve human                 health and will open up new areas in biotechnology.",
