This novel  reaction-type is involved in the biosynthesis of numerous  bacterial and fungal metabolites, as well as in the action of  vitamin K. The specific aims propose: (1) to harvest larger  quantities of the proteins through a sequence involving  microsequencing, cloning, and overexpression; (2) to identify  the native metal(s); (3) to determine the location of exogenous  oxygen by the use of oxygen-18; (4) to probe the latitude of  the enzyme active sites in substance acceptance; and (5) to  examine the use of modified substrates with the capacity to  covalently modify the active sites.  %%%  With this award, the Synthtic Organic Program is supporting the  research of Dr. Steven J. Gould of the Department of Chemistry  at Oregon State University. Professor Gould will focus his work  on the study of a recently recognized class of enzymes,  hydroquinone epoxidases.The project uses a multi-faceted  approach that blends synthesis, biosynthesis, enzymology, and  molecular genetics in order to better understand which  reactions are available in Nature and how they are linked to  produce complex structures.  ***",
