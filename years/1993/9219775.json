 "awd_abstract_narration": "Telomeres are defined as the ends of chromosomal DNA and are                    essential for the faithful inheritance and stability of                         chromosomes.  The enzyme telomerase is necessary for telomere                   maintenance, thus the mechanisms of DNA recognition and synthesis               by telomerase, and the cellular patterns of telomerase expression               and regulation are essential for a complete understanding of                    telomere biology.  The structure and length of telomeres,                       parameters which may determine the proliferative lifespan of cells,             is regulated by controlling the activity and expression of                      telomerase.  By identifying telomerase components and using them as             markers to track telomerase expression, the relationships between               cell division and telomere function can be defined.  Human                      telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein, its essential RNA moiety will be             identified with polymerase chain reaction amplification techniques.             The RNA sequence is critical to understanding the telomerase                    reaction mechanism, since it is believed to contain a sequence that             templates telomeric repeat synthesis.  Conserved features of the                RNA will be elucidated by comparing the gene sequence from a                    variety of vertebrates, the importance of RNA structures and                    sequences will be tested by expressing altered telomerase RNA genes             in cell lines.                                                                  %%%                                                                             Chromosomes carry the genetic blueprint that is used by all                     multicellular organisms from worms to humans to make organs,                    muscles, skin, etc.  An enzyme in these organisms is responsible                for adding special nucleic acid sequences at the end of each of the             chromosomes that is necessary for their stability.  This is                     important for chromosomes in sperm and egg cells but also for cells             of the body.  These sequences may be important in the development               of cells into tissues and whether the cells live or die during the              life of the organism.  The structure of the enzyme which contains               both nucleic acid and amino acids is not understood; the gene for               the enzyme has not as yet been found.  These two aims will be                   investigated by the laboratory.",
