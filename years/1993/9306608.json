 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306608  Robertson  Phloem-specific protein (p-protein) is a major protein in sieve  tube elements, yet the function of this protein is not known.   Functions commonly ascribed to p-protein are that it plugs sieve  pore plates following wounding and/or that it maintains sterility  in phloem by binding microorganisms.  However, the synthesis and  turnover of p-protein are very high, characteristics not normally  associated with proteins that are primarily structural in nature.  In the electroosmotic flow theory of phloem translocation, p-  protein has been hypothesized to have an active role in the  transport of photosynthetic assimilates.   Antisense technology to  phenocopy null mutations for p-protein isoforms can help to  clarify the role of p-protein in translocation.  As the first step  towards this goal, the PI proposes to isolate p-protein genes from  tobacco, Arabidopsis and pumpkin.  %%%  A long term goal is to monitor changes in translocation flow and in  the plant's response to wounding in plants transformed with  antisense p-protein mRNA.  These experiments will increase our  understanding of the mechanism of phloem translocation and will  help elucidate the function and importance of p-protein in normal  plant growth.  The knowledge gained from such studies will increase  our basic understanding of phloem tissues and may have important  consequences for agriculture.  ***",
