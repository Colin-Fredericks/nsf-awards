 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal pertains to the development of a novel, cost                      effective, compact sensor for time resolved fluorescence                        spectroscopy of biological samples.  The sensor will have high                  time resolution (sub-nanosecond) for accurate fluorescence decay                time measurements with high sensitivity.  The sensor is based on                the pseudo random code modulated (PRM) cw lidar technique whereby               the fluorescence signal from the PRM laser excitation is detected               by a receiver system, and processed using cross correlators to                  determine the decay profile in real time.  The time resolution of               the measurement is enhance beyond the quantization precision of                 the digitizer using a proprietary resolution enhancement                        technique.  The spectral information of the fluorescence signal                 is obtained using a set of interference filters.  Unlike in the                 pulsed laser fluorescence technique, the detectable signal is not               limited by the background noise level due to the inherent                       characteristic of the PRM phase sensitive technique.  In Phase I,               we will carry out a proof of concept experiment, critical system                analysis, and conceptual system design.  This sensor can be used                for the in vivo as well as remote measurement of the fluorescence               signal from samples in realtime.",
