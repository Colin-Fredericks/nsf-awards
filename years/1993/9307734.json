 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307734  Plummer       The project is for the acquisition of a variable-temperature  scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy system that will operate  in the range of 25K->~1500K.  The essential component of this  package will be the JEOL JSTM-4500VT Scanning Tunneling Microscope.   This commercial STM has demonstrated atomic resolution from room  temperature up to 1475K.  Also, JEOL is in the process of  engineering a low-temperature sample stage, compatible with JSTM-  4500VT, and capable of allowing atomic resolution imaging on  samples as low as 25K.  The participants in this proposal will be  working with JEOL to explore the capabilities of the low-  temperature stage.       A broad range of materials problems will be investigated with  the variable-temperature STM, utilizing its ability to do atomic  scale microscopy and spectroscopy.  The interplay between atomic  and electronic structure in thin film nommetal-to-metal transitions  will be studied.  The detailed nature of Mott, Wilson, and Peierls-  like transitions can be probed in atomic detail as a function of  adsorbate density and substrate temperature.  The low temperature  STM will be used to monitor growth conditions for pulsed-laser  ablation epitaxial growth of high Tc superconducting films, to  directly measure the modulation of superconducting properties at  isolated growth steps, and to identify flux pinning sites  associated with surface morphology; to investigate the interaction  of hydrogen with simple, noble, and carbon surfaces and thin films,  concentrating on temperature-dependent changes in the structure and  bonding; and to investigate the physical and chemical properties of  alloy surfaces at elevated temperatures, combining the short-range  real-space capabilities of the STM with the long-range-order  capabilities of x-ray scattering.  Finally, experiments will be  aimed at nanofabrication, where selected organometallic complexes  will be physisorbed and subsequently decomposed by the electron  impact from the t unneling current to form \"metal wires\".  ***",
