 "awd_abstract_narration": "How science develops is a major subject of investigation for                    science and technology studies both because of its intrinsic                    interest and because of its obvious policy relevance.  A major                  aspect of studying scientific development is understanding not only             why a scientific theory is accepted but also why scientists resist              accepting a theory.  Dr. Oreskes study of American scientists'                  resistance to the theory of continental drift promises greatly to               enrich our understanding of factors blocking acceptance of a                    scientific theory.                                                                                                                                              In the early 20th century, American earth scientists vociferously               opposed the notion of continental mobility.  Yet less than 50 years             later, the same idea was hearlded as a major conceptual                         breakthough, and today continental mobility is considered a                     scientific \"fact.\"  Dr. Oreskes is studying why American geologists             adamently rejected an idea that is now considered true.  Why did                they react so much more negatively than their British or European               counterparts?                                                                                                                                                   The standard explanation given for the rejection of continental                 drift before 1960 was that there was no mechanism to explain how                enormous blocks of land could slide over the surface of the globe.              Dr. Oreskes rejects this explanation.  She has found that                       continental drift was rejected in spite of the availability of                  several explanations of continental mobility--including the                     explanation generally accepted today--and suggests instead that                 drift was rejected because the implications of the theory were                  perceived as a challenge to underlying methodological principles                and standards of practice in American earth science.  Dr. Oreskes               is attempting to place this drift debate within the context of                  existing American geological research traditions, and to relate                 attitudes about theory to patterns of scientific practice in                    American geology.  This work will thus contribute to an                         understanding of the relationshsip between scientific theory and                practices, the cultural origins of those practices, and suggest                 some philosophical issues that may arise when standards of practice             change.",
