 "awd_abstract_narration": "In supercritical polymerization processes, polymer chains grow                  to molecular weights determined by their solubility under the                   prevailing density (or pressure and temperature) conditions of                  the solvent.  Further growth in the chain length results in                     phase separation and leads to precipitation.  In this project,                  polymerizations will be conducted under isopycnic conditions                    by adjusting the density of the solvent environment to be                       identical to the density of the polymer formed.  This iso-                      density operation is expected to insure levitation by buoyancy                  and prevent precipitation of the phase-separated polymer.                       Density adjustments are readily achievable for supercritical                    solvents through manipulation of either the pressure of the                     temperature, of the solvent composition (if mixtures are                        used), and isopycnic conditions for a variety of polymers and                   polymerization systems are possible.  This is a way to                          simulate the micro gravity environment of space-based                           processes on earth.                                                                                                                                             The objective of the research project is to make polymeric                      materials of precise geometries and morphologies by                             synthesizing them in a supercritical fluid of precisely the                     same density as the product polymer.  This would prevent                        precipitation of the polymer and permit polymerization of                       molecules of any desired structure to be fabricated.  The                       research will focus on testing his hypothesis by synthesizing                   polystyrene and crystallizing polyethylene in isopycnic                         supercritical fluid solvents.  He will explore using mixtures                   of fluids such as carbon dioxide or butane with fluids of                       higher density such as xenon or sulfur hexafloride.",
