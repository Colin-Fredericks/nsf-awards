 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support four workshops to encourage and                  support young women mathematicians.  The first and third                        workshops will be held immediately prior to the Joint Meetings of               the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Mathematical                    Association of America (MAA) in January 1993 in San Antonio and                 January 1994 in Cincinnati, respectively.  The second and fourth                workshops will be held immediately prior to the national meeting                of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) in                 July 1993 in Philadelphia and July 1994 in San Diego,                           respectively.                                                                        These workshops will bring together women who are recent                   doctoral recipients or graduate students in mathematics, and                    several established mathematicians.  Each workshop will involve                 approximately ten recent doctoral recipients who will present                   thirty minute talks on their research, aimed at a general                       mathematics audience.  The graduate students will present their                 research projects in a less formal poster session.  The workshop                participants will be selected by a panel of mathematicians on the               basis of a competitive application process,  It is expected that                the opportunity to meet and interact with one another, as well as               with a few established mathematicians, will enable the                          participants to promote their own research, to increase their                   professional contacts, and to increase their commitment to                      research.",
