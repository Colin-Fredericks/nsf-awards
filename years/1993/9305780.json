 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the application of nuclear magnetic                      resonance (NMR) to the study of specific classes of defects in                  semiconducting materials. Studies of hydrogen complexed with                    dopants will be carried out in collaboration with industrial                    partners concerned about the effects of hydrogen introduced into                semiconductors during processing and device fabrication. The                    program will focus on three specific goals: The location and                    dynamics of hydrogen complexed with dopants in gallium arsenide and             silicon semiconductors will be determined using double resonance                techniques to selectively probe the complex. The identification and             characterization of thermally generated paramagnetic defects in                 gallium arsenide and related materials will be undertaken using in              situ high temperature NMR techniques. The sites occupied by indium              impurities and characterization of vacancy-impurity complexes in                II-VI materials, including correlation of the results with                      concurrent studies of these defects using perturbed angular                     correlation techniques, will be studied.                                        %%%                                                                                                                                                             The performance of semiconducting materials used in electronic                  devices is dominated by the effects of impurities and crystalline               defects.  These effects can be constructive, as in the case of                  \"doping,\" where specific impurities can be used to obtain desired               electrical properties. On the other hand, the incidental                        introduction of hydrogen into semiconductors from organic materials             used during material processing can be highly deleterious. Hydrogen             can \"passivate,\" or neutralize dopant impurities, rendering them                electrically inactive.  Undesired and poorly characterized defects              in semiconducting materials lead to poor yields and device                      failures. Exploitation of well-understood defects holds the                     potential for development of advanced semiconducting materials with             improved characteristics. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) will be              used to characterize the location and motional properties of                    defects on the atomic scale in various materials of technological               importance including silicon, gallium arsenide, and cadmium                     telluride. This technique is highly selective and is capable of                 probing individual chemical species in specific locations in a                  crystalline semiconductor. Recent improvements in NMR techniques                and the use of high field superconducting magnets make it possible              to investigate certain defect species at concentrations as low as               a few tens of parts per million.",
