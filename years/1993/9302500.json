Hanif Chaudhry, at the Albrook                                      Hydraulics Laboratory at Washington State                                       University.  Dr. Bhuiyan will participate in                                    the development and verification of a                                           mathematical model for the unsteady two-                                        dimensional free-surface flow with shocks and                                   bores.  The model will be based on finite-                                      element method.  Experimental data will be                                      obtained on an existing test facility.                                                                                                                          Scope:  This project provides for participation                                 of a highly qualified young scientist from a                                    developing country in multi-faceted research in                                 a well established, modern, U.S. laboratory in                                  the area of hydraulics.  His expertise in                                       finite element analysis of unsteady flows will                                  benefit the U.S. research effort, while he                                      gains experimental skills and knowledge in this                                 important field.  It is hoped that this will                                    lead to further substantial joint research                                      involving scientists from the two institutes in                                 the area of fluid flow, and especially in flood                                 research and management.",
