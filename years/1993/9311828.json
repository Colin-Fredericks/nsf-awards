 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photochemical and photophysical properties of molecules                         which react from delocalized and/or multiple excited states                     will be studied, with a particular emphasis on evaluating                       the relative roles of through-bond and through-space                            interactions. In solution, polyfunctional substrates will be                    studied, utilizing antenna chromophores or delocalized                          excitation to activate distal groups which are transparent                      or weakly absorbent in the ultraviolet or are absorbent but                     may be selectively activated through the antenna. Special                       attention will be given to: (1) charge transfer transmission                    through the steroid frame-work, (2) energy transfer in                          trifunctional steroids, and (3) the potential role of sigma                     bonded relay mechanisms to facilitate virtual orbital                           mixing. In the gas-phase, studies will emphasize the newly                      discovered Norrish Type II chemistry of thioketones.                            %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Morrison at Purdue University.                     Functional groups in molecules will be excited by light                         absorption and the mechanism by which this energy is                            transferred to other functional groups in molecules will be                     studied. A particular concern will be to determine if the                       energy is transferred through bonds or through space. In                        another phase of the research, unique photochemical and                         photophysical properties sulfur containing compounds will be                    investigated.",
