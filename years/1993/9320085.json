The workshop will use problems having to do with  tort litigation as a point of departure for considering a larger  set of empirical questions about the role of the civil justice  system in our society.  Current controversies over tort litigation  stem from claims that tort liability is a barrier to technological  innovation, that malpractice suits are a major cause of increased  costs in the health care system, and that lawyers are simply lining  their pockets at the expense of insurance companies, consumers, and  the overall economy rather than serving the interests of justice.   Counter claims hold that the system serves the powerless and the  ordinary citizen who has suffered harm.  This side of the debate  argues that the critics have no empirical grounds for their  complaints.   Knowledgeable social scientists are concerned that  the debate is not based on valid empirical data, but rather on  numbers generated by junk science.  This workshop will focus on  policy issues, data sources, methodological problems, and broader  theoretical questions.  Its product will be a research agenda on  civil justice for the Law and Social Science Program.  ***",
