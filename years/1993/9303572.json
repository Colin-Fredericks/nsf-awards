 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prolactin (PRL) is a single-chain polypeptide hormone that elicits              a wide variety of physiologial responses in vertebrates; in mammals             these include growth and development of the mammary gland and                   lactation.  In recent years it has also become evident that PRL                 exerts marked effects on the immune system and several types of                 immune cells possess PRL receptors: for example the hormone is a                powerful, lactogen receptor-mediated mitogen for rat Nb2 pre-T                  lymphoma cells.  PRL is considered to be a member of a hormone                  famioly which includes growth hormone and placental lactogen, and               these hormones are believed to share a similar three-dimensional                structure.  There is considerable interest in determining which                 regions of these polypeptides are functionally important.  The                  principal objective of the proposed research is to define the amino             acid residues in PRL which are responsible for its biological                   activities, particlarly its mitogenic action on Nb2 cells.  The                 availability of these cells makes possible a detailed structure-                function analysis of PRL with regard to its action as a growth-                 stimulating factor.  The Nb2 cell will be used as tools in these                studies of how the structure of PRL affects its biological                      activity.                                                                       %%%                                                                             The study of prolactin and growth hormone has wide application,                 since these hormones regulate numerous physiological processes for              normal and disease states in humans, and for the reproduction,                  development, and productivity of economically valuable livestock.               Althugh these studies are basis, by concentrating on bovine                     prolactin and growth hormone, and on the bovine mammary gland                   prolactin receptor, the   //",
