The UTEP Materials  Research Center of Excellence is emphasizing interdisciplinary  research on the structure, composition, properties, synthesis,  processing, and performance of materials.  The center's goals are:   (1) to establish a nationally competitive, crossdisciplinary  university research center in materials science and engineering,  supported by faculty with high levels of expertise and state-of-  the-art equipment and facilities, (2) to develop the university's  capabilities as a doctoral granting institution, and (3) to  increase the number of underrepresented minority scientists and  engineers available to the nation in the field materials science  and engineering.    The Materials Research Center of Excellence was established in 1988  with funding from The National Science Foundation under the  Minority Research Centers of Excellence (MRCE) Program.  The Center  of Excellence is the University's capstone program to attract  minority students to study in science, mathematics, and  engineering.  The Materials Research Center of Excellence meets the  goals of the MRCE Program especially (1) to increase the minority  presence in science and engineering by making substantial resources  available to upgrade the research capabilities of strong and  productive minority institutions, (2) to allow the institution to  continue the effectiveness of related science and engineering  activities for minority groups in its region, and (3) to provide  opportunities for minority faculty and students at UTEP and nearby  institutions to engage in meritorious research that leads to the  publications of refereed journals.  ***",
