A  photon electron rejecting alpha liquid scintillation (PERALS)  spectrometer provides a fast, accurate, and efficient method to  quantify alpha activity free from the interferences caused by beta  and gamma emissions generally present in environmental samples.   Students are using this spectrometer in a number of new experiments  in Radiochemistry and Environmental Chemistry and in projects in an  undergraduate research course.  Students enrolled in these courses  include not only chemistry majors, but students from civil and  chemical engineering, geology, biology, and secondary education  science. The PERALS system is giving these students hands-on  experience with the most modern counting equipment, and is allowing  them to gain insight into the procedures for and the difficulties  in the assay of alpha emitters in the environment.  ***",
