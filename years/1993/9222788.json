 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mr. Timothy LeCain, under the direction of Drs. David Hounshell and             Reed Geiger, is probing the complex relationships among society,                technology and the environment.  The dangers of environmental                   degradation have become all too apparent in recent years.  Yet for              a society that is highly industrialized and reliant on advanced                 technology, the precise role of technological change in                         environmental destruction is poorly understood.                                                                                                                 At the turn of the century, copper mining in the western United                 States entered a new era of corporate domination.  Large                        corporations like Anaconda Company and Kennecott used an array of               new technologies to dig immense amounts of ore from the earth and               process it.  Mr. LeCain raises these questions:  What were the                  environmental consequences of this copper mining?  How was it                   changed by the evolution of mining technology and management?  Was              technology a causal factor of the change or simply a tool?  How did             technology relate tot he wider process of rationalizing the human               and natural world during the 20th century?  What role did the                   methods and beliefs of engineers and scientists play in the                     development of mining and how were these experts trained?  What was             the source of technological innovation of mining machinery and how              important were machinery manufacturers in this process?                                                                                                         In order to address these questions, Mr. LeCain is examining                    archives in the West (Colorado, Montana, Utah, California and                   Arizona) as well as university and government archives in the East.             This study promises a significant contribution to debates within                the history of technology, environmental history, western history,              and business history.",
