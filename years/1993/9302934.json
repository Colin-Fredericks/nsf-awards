 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Ruth Tringham, Mr. Christopher Hoffman               will collect data for his doctoral thesis. He will study copper                 artifacts from a series of archaeological sites which are located               on the Spanish island of Mallorca and which date to the Copper Age              (from approximately 2500 to 1800 BC). Through a series of analyses              he will attempt to determine where the metal producing ore was                  mined, whether it was smelted locally, how the wide range of                    objects were fabricated, how they were used, and how and why they               were disposed of. To accomplish this he will conduct chemical and               lead isotope analyses of copper bearing ores from local deposits,               attempt to define chemical signatures and then match these                      signatures to those of the artifacts themselves. Metallurgical                  analysis will shed light on manufacturing techniques and                        microscopic examination for traces of wear will provide insight                 into how the objects were used.                                                                                                                                 Mr. Hoffman wishes to understand the relationship between                       technological and social change. Metallurgy did not originate on                Mallorca but diffused to the region from the Eastern Mediterranean.             While it is known approximately when copper tools first appeared on             the island much less is understood about the effects which this                 very basic technological change had on social organization. This                particular situation is interesting because archaeologists have                 argued that Mallorcan and much of Spanish society was basically                 unaffected. Because however of the wide variety of artifact types               found on the island and because of the varied archaeological                    contexts in which they were recovered, Mr. Hoffman believes                     otherwise and he wishes to reconstruct how these objects were                   manufactured and used.                                                                                                                                          This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 data of interest to many archaeologists and increase our                        understanding of Mallorcan prehistory. It will also shed light on               the complex relationships between societal and technological change             and will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
