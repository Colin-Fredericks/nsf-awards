 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study will build upon two data bases of DNA                   sequences \u0131nuclear encoded small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA)               and B-subunit of vacuolar ATPase (vATPase)!.  Cladistic analysis                of sequences from taxa selected in a current study to reconstruct               the phylogeny of ascomycetes with features enhancing arthropod                  dispersal supports the hypothesis that these features (including                long-necked ascomata and evanescent asci) are examples of                       convergence and parallelism in fungi.  The research proposed here               includes 1) field studies to provide fungal life history details                within the complex arthropod assemblages and to obtain specimens                for 2) expansion of the molecular data sets.  Taxon sampling is                 based upon the hypothesis that phoretic symbioses of fungi and                  arthropods provide opportunities for obligate mutualisms between                the organism.  Taxa for sequencing (yeasts, pleomorphic                         ascomycetes with yeast stages, and some apothecial forms) include               many species that have mutualistic associations with arthropods.                Due to the sampling design, an additional outcome of the study                  may be answers to age-old questions of fungal phylogeny.  These                 questions include the relationships of yeasts to other fungi                    (reduced and non-monophyletic as currently suggested?) and the                  relative position of perithecial and apothecial ascomycetes to                  each other and to yeasts (also involving questions of monophyly).               Established field and culture techniques as well as DNA                         sequencing will be used to obtain data.  Cladistic analysis will                be performed on the independent rDNA and vATPase data sets, and                 congruence (or non-congruence) will be used as a measure of                     support of the hypotheses.",
