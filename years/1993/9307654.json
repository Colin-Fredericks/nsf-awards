 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to obtain MR images in evolving                     physiological states, using the properties of hyperpolarized 129Xe              in (a) cell and tissue compartmentalization, (b) dramatically                   time-dependent distribution, and (c) response of NMR chemical                   shift, T1, and T2 to environment, O2, and exchange kinetics, to                 obtain detailed anatomical images mapped with functional                        information.                                                                    %%%                                                                             Magnetic resonance imaging is important to basic as well as                     applied research in the biological sciences.  Current imaging                   methods depend on subtle differences in the magnetic properties                 of water molecules in biological materials.  The available                      contrast is quite low and the ubiquitous presence of water                      prohibits its use, except in some flowing systems, to measure                   diffusion and compartmentalization.  The proposed research makes                use of the extreme ease of magnetic resonance detection of                      hyperpolarized Xe atoms and the fact that Xe distributes rapidly                in biological systems and similarly washes out rapidly.  If                     successful, these studies could lead to substantial changes in                  how magnetic resonance imaging experiments are organized and add                considerably to the method's informational content.",
