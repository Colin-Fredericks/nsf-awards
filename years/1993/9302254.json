 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) will                 operate the R/V PELICAN during 1993 as a general oceanographic                  vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects.  The PELICAN is              a 105' general research vessel constructed and operated by LUMCON.              The vessel is scheduled for 228 operating days in 1993, of which 49             days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates               primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.                                                                                                                                     This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that must              be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be               specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained             crew members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not               operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and             therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels                   specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels                are operated by universities and research institutions around the               country.",
