 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most compelling reasons students want to study                       applied optics is because it is a visual science. Even though                   students can easily visualize the physical phenomena of                         interest during a particular laboratory experiment they often                   find it difficult to record and quantify their experimental                     results. Recording optical images and subtle changes in optical                 images using standard photography can sometimes be difficult                    and time consuming. Fortunately, computer hardware and software                 along with cameras of sufficient resolution are now available                   to assist in this image acquisition process.The acquisition and                 processing of images has grown into a routine tool used in                      research and industry today. Digital image processing tools and                 optical techniques have come together to form a powerful                        processing environment, optical image processing. Students in                   physics and applied optics need to be well versed in the use of                 these modern image acquisition tools, observe the benefits of                   optical processing techniques as well as understand the basic                   science of the phenomena that they are studying.The equipment                   requested in this proposal will be used to upgrade and enhance                  the undergraduate physics and applied optics program at Rose-                   Hulman Institute of Technology. We will: (1). develop a                         standard \"Image Acquisition and Analysis Experimental Lab                       Station\" for general use in optics labs, (2). expand and                        upgrade the laboratory component of our Principles of Image                     Processing course to include experiments on optical image                       processing, image acquisition and analysis of infrared images,                  and (3). enrich several of the experiments in other applied                     optics laboratories by introducing computer-based acquisition                   of images.",
