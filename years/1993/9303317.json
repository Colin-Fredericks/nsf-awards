 "awd_abstract_narration": "Comparative studies of variation in nuclear DNA and                        chloroplast DNA have helped elucidate the pattern of evolutionary               relationships in many plant groups.  A phylogenetic framework is                particularly important in groups of organisms used as model                     systems, to correctly interpret biological phenomena and apply                  valuable data.  This research is a molecular phylogenetic                       investigation of a lineage of flowering plants, tribe Antirrhineae              (Scrophulariaceae) that includes a model system in genetic and                  developmental studies, the cultivated snapdragon.  To provide a                 broad molecular database that will insure rigorous tests of                     hypotheses, a broad experimental and analytical approach based on               comparative DNA sequencing in nuclear and chloroplast genomes and               restriction site variation of five chloroplast genes has been                   designed.  The objectives here are to evaluate: (a) the evolution               of floral morphological characters, (b) the origin and evolution of             \"Tam\" transposable elements, and (c) how floral homeotic genes have             evolved and whether their evolution has been influenced by \"Tam\"                elements.                                                                       %%%                                                                             This research presents unusual opportunities for studying basic                 patterns and processes of molecular evolution, floral morphology,               and developmental genetics using Antirrhinum majus and its                      relatives as model organisms.  A phylogenetic context offers the                chance to develop optimal application, extrapolation, and                       interpretation of biological results and this study, when                       completed, will constitute a robust demonstration of such a piece               of research.",
