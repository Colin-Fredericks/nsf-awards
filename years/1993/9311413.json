 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the information on the geochemical evolution of groundwater             has been conducted in relatively deep aquifer systems.  Many of the             biogeochemical reactions that influence nutrient cycling,                       concentrations of greenhouse gases, and degradation of                          contaminants, however, are redox reactions that occur in near-                  surface groundwaters.                                                           Redox boundaries can be either diffuse and extremely sharp under                various situations.  The nature of these redox boundaries are                   influenced by sediment chemistry, the kinetics of the redox                     reaction (including mediation of the reactions by bacteria),                    groundwater flow paths and mixing of groundwater, or combinations               of these factors.  In most studies of nitrate concentrations or                 other solutes involved in redox reactions, the possible physical                and chemical systems have not been examined simultaneously or in                sufficient detail to identify major influences on groundwater                   oxidation-reduction reactions.  We propose to use extensive field               monitoring to physical and chemical characteristics of the aquifers             and water at sites with different physical characteristics and                  sediment chemistry.  Nested piezometers and tensiometers will be                used to monitor groundwater flow paths, multi-level samplers will               be used to determine water chemistry.  Groundwater ages will be                 determined by measuring concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons                   (CFC's) dissolved in the water.  Measurements of nitrogen and other             biologically fractionated isotopes will be made to determine                    whether reductions in solute concentrations are due to biologically             mediated processes or due to dilution via groundwater mixing.",
