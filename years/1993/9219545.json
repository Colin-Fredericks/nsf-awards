 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hormonal modulation of gene expression is a complex series             of events starting with hormone binding to receptor and ending with             transcription factor bound to specific DNA elements interacting                 with the transcription machinery.  Transcription of the gene                    encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carbonxykinase (PEPCK) is stimulated               by glucocorticoids and glucagon (via cAMP) and inhibited by insulin             in the liver-derived H4 cells.  DNA elements mediating the hormonal             affects on PEPCK gene expression have been identified.  It has been             demonstrated that transcription of the PEPCK gene continues to be               hormonally regulated after lysolecithin permeabilization of H4                  cells.  This treatment allows chemicals, including macromolecules,              to enter cells when normally they would be excluded.  This proposal             describes the refinement of the permeable cell transcription system             and its use to investigate the mechanism of hormonal regulation of              gene expression.  In vivo footprinting of the endogenous PEPCK gene             in lysolecithin permeabilized H4 cells will be used to determine if             hormone causes induction, replacement, or no change in factor                   binding to hormone response elements.  In vivo footprinting in the              transcriptionally active permeable cell system as well as of the                transcription initiation complex and to assess if hormone affects               the stability of any of these protein-DNA complexes.  This proposal             attempts to bridge the gap between the intact cell which is                     difficult to probe biochemically and cell extracts made by                      destroying the cell, but which are easily probed with biochemical               approaches.  This new method allows the cell to become permeable to             biochemical probes without destroying the overall survival of the               cell.  We wish to begin to determine some of the properties of the              chromosome using these cells.                                                   %%%                                                                             The proposed work investigates the molecular mechanisms involved in             regulation of expression of specific genes within cells.  As part               of the research, the investigator will develop experimental methods             to make possible experiments which are not currently feasible given             existing methods.",
