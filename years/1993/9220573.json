 "awd_abstract_narration": "The tobacco, human and two Arabidopsis genes for a highly conserved             eukaryotic ribosomal protein (CEP52) contain introns.  In each                  gene, one intron contains open reading frame which would allow the              production of an altered form of the CEp52 protein (ALT52) from                 unspliced message.  Based on immunoblots probed with CEP52 specific             antiserum, it is proposed that translation of unspliced mRNA                    occurs.  A putative ALT52 is expressed at high levels in rat                    tissues, but the protein is not ribosomally associated.  ALT52                  synthesis appears to be tissue specific and inversely related to                the level of CEP52 present.  Since CEP52 levels correspond to the               amount of ribosomes present in rat tissues, the production of ALT52             may function to limit ribosomes production.  These preliminary                  results suggests that CEP52 splicing may be a novel regulatory                  mechanism involved in controlling the levels of cytoplasmic                     ribosomes. The investigators  will investigate these observations               by characterizing the rat proteins that react with the CEP52                    antibody and by sequencing a rat CEP52 genomic clone to determine               if the gene contains introns as do the other characterized CEP52                genes.  Additional antibodies will be generated to examine the                  possible production of ALT52 in the plant Arabidopsis.                          %%%                                                                             Cellular ribosome levels are controlled by the need for the                     proteins that they synthesize.  Rapidly growing cells, whether                  normal or cancerous, require elevated amounts of ribosomes compared             to cells that are not as metabolically active.  Despite significant             advances, gaps remain in our understanding of how the assembly of               two ribosomes from more that  80 proteins and four nucleic acids is             coordinated and regulated.  Two ribosomal proteins discovered in                1989 may have important roles in the regulation of ribosome                     assembly, since, an insufficient amount of either protein results               in the decreased production of functional ribosomes.  Recent                    studies suggest that one of these proteins may be regulated by                  editing the RNA copy of the genetic information once it is                      transcribed from DNA.  This editing process occurs for many                     proteins, however, this case is unusual in that both the edited and             unedited form of the RNA could be used to produce a protein.  The               proteins would be identical in some parts of their structure, but               would significantly differ in size and probably function                        Preliminary evidence indicates that two forms of this protein are               produced.  The large version that would be produced from the                    unedited RNA is not found on ribosomes, and it is produced in the               largest amounts by tissues that have few ribosomes.  These studies              will determine if the detected proteins are produced as the result              of RNA editing of a common RNA precursor and if the editing process             represents a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that controls              ribosome levels.",
