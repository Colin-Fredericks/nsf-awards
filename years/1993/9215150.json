 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is for the PI to strengthen skills               related to proposal preparation for NSF.  A preliminary                         investigation of multi-layered pulsed photocathodes will be the                 scientific thrust of the proposals written during the planning                  grant period.  Laser driven photoelectron sources can be pulsed                 at very high rates and are capable of simultaneously achieving                  high brightness, long lifetime, and resistance to poor vacuum                   conditions.  Lanthanum Hexaboride is a low work function material               that can be used to make efficient photoemitters.  At present,                  most of the work on these photoemitters has been centered on the                large area, bulk, surface photoemission properties.  The details                of the photoemission process for multi-layered, transmission mode               Lanthanum Hexaboride photocathodes and photo-assisted                           microelectronic field emission cathodes will be investigated as a               long term goal.  The long term activities of proposed                           investigation involves fabricating and measuring the                            electrical and material properties of a variety of vertical and                 lateral cathode structures.",
