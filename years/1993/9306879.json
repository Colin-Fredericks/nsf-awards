 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand the molecular and               biochemical mechanisms of bioluminescence in bacteria and                       dinoflagellates, including the genes coding for the proteins                    involved and their evolutionary origins.  In dinoflagellates, the               luciferin, a tetrapyrrole probably derived from chlorophyll, is                 oxidized enzymatically to produce light.  The mechanism of this                 reaction, the enzymatic intermediates, and the identity of the                  emitter, will be studied using proteins produced by recombinant                 techniques from cloned genes and synthetic substrate(s).  The                   structures, sequences and organization of these genes will be                   determined, and their evolutionary origins will be investigated.                In bacteria, luciferase is a flavoprotein monooxygenase which                   catalyzes the oxidation of aliphatic aldehydes to the corresponding             acids.  Luciferase-bound intermediates along with accessory                     \"emitter\" proteins will be characterized using photophysical and                enzymological techniques to investigate the nature of the primary               excited state and how it is formed.  Possible alternative functions             of luciferase, such as protection against cellular damage by oxygen             radicals, will also be studied using bacteria which grow in 100%                oxygen and were isolated from a human wound.                                    %%%                                                                             Although the emission of visible light by living organisms is a                 rare, curiosity of nature, it is also a unique tool for exploring               unusual biological energetic processes.  The objective of the                   research is to understand the molecular and biochemical mechanisms              of bioluminescence, and to examine the control and evolutionary                 origin of the genes involved.  We will principally use simple                   marine unicellular organisms in this study; bacteria and                        dinoflagellates.  The bacteria emit blue-green light. These cells               often live in association with higher organisms in the gut tract or             in specialized light emitting organs.  Dinoflagellates have a very              different bioluminescence system which seems to have evolved                    independently, and makes use of a substance related to chlorophyll.                                                                                             The dinoflagellates are responsible for the blooms (called red                  tides) in the ocean, where they produce potent neurotoxins which                accumulate in the shellfish that ingest them, thus making the                   shellfish poisonous for man.  The phosphorescence of the ocean seen             at night is also due to dinoflagellate bioluminescence.  Our                    studies are learn about the biochemistry for this peculiar light                emission reaction.",
