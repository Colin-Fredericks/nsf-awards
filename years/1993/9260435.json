 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of the proposed research is to develop patentable              materials and methodology that would greatly facilitate the                     difficult, slow and frequently expensive process of obtaining high              quality protein crystals suitable for protein x-ray                             crystallography.  The approach to be used involves attaching                    protein molecules, in a site-specific manner, to a synthetic core               containing four sites of attachment arranged tetrahedrally.  The                complex, which now possesses structural symmetry, will be more                  prone to crystallization than the individual, inherently                        unsymmetrical protein molecules.  The method also has the added                 advantage of providing for a general appproach to isomorphous                   replacement, a frequently necessary but sometimes difficult step in             protein crystallography.                                                        %%%                                                                             Three dimensional protein structures, obtained mostly through x-ray             diffraction studies, are extremely valuable in computer-aided                   design studies, especially in the fields of protein engineering,                pesticide design and drug design and development.  An ancillary                 benefit of this study includes a possible deepening of our                      understanding of life processes in general at the molecular level.",
