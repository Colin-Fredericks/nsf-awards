 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302182  Dawson    This award supports the Peromyscus (Deer Mouse) Genetic  Stock Center.  The Stock Center contains thirty well-  characterized mutant lines and six stocks of  \"wild-type\"  animals representing five species.  Two highly inbred  strains of deer mouse are also maintained.  Live and  preserved animals, fresh and frozen tissues, molecular  libraries and probes, and other materials derived from  Peromyscus are provided to the scientific community as a  resource.  Utilization of the Stock Center has nearly  quadrupled since 1986.  A total of 3230 animals and  specimens were supplied to external researchers in 27 states  during the past 5 1/2 years.  Expansion of the Center will  include two additional species, P. truei, P. boylii, and one  or more inbred strains of white-footed mouse (P. leucopus).  Enhancement of the electronic interface capacity with  genetic data bases for other species requires installation  of a highspeed computer workstation.  Improved organization  of the reference collection of reprints, photographs and  other reference materials will be accomplished.  Completion  of a Peromyscus gene catalog and its entry into an  electronic database is projected.  The peromyscus Molecular  Bank will accelerate its acquisition of a wide variety of  peromyscine unique sequence probes and diversity of DNA  libraries and promote their utilization.  Current services  and activities of the Stock Center, including publication of  PEROMYSCUS NEWSLETTER, will continue.  ***",
