 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310068  Abreu    The activities of trade and exchange are fundamental to economics,  yet, until very recently, there was little research on perhaps the  most pure form of trading, i.e., bilateral bargaining.  A research  breakthrough, about a decade ago, led to a flood of papers on this  topic, all of which emphasized in myriad variations, the role of  the relative slight impatience of bargainers to come to agreement,  and the precise protocol of the bargaining process.  This theory  has been widely and usefully applied in a variety of fields,  including industrial organization, international trade and finance,  political economy, macroeconomics, and so on.    This project readdresses this basic question from a new perspective  and replaces the slight impatience between offers of the old theory  with slight uncertainty about the strategic posture of one's  opponent.  That is, with small probability the other player may be  one of many \"irrational\" types.  The message very crudely put is  this: Bargaining isn't so much about slight impatience and the  exact protocol of offers and counteroffers; rather, it is driven by  such factors as bluffing and posturing of various sorts.  In this  spirit, the model developed stresses reputational effects which  both causal empiricism and personal introspection suggest are  important in bargaining.    So far this approach seems very promising, and some simple cases  have been completely analyzed.  This project will extend these  preliminary results to more general settings.  As noted, the  earlier bargaining models have been fruitfully applied in many  areas; a reputation-based bargaining paradigm will be potentially  as useful.    ***",
