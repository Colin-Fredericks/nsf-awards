 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium on Molecular Evolution of Physiological Processes will              be held in September, 1993 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in               Woods Hole, Massachusetts, under the auspices of the Society of                 General Physiologists.  This Symposium will bring together                      scientists who study cytoskeletal and membrane functions with                   scientists whose research is focused upon molecular evolution or on             mechanisms that generate genetic diversity.  Four lecture sessions              will set the intellectual framework of the symposium: (1)                       approaches to analyzing nucleic acid and protein sequences and                  applications to phylogenetic problems; (2) recently appreciated                 genetic mechanisms that may underlie the evolution of increasingly              complex biological systems; (3) proteins of the actin/myosin                    cytoskeleton: the variety of isoforms and the correlated functions              these play in cell structure and behavior; and (4) structure,                   function and evolution of plasma membrane proteins.  Sessions 3 and             4 emphasize that molecular-level studies of physiological processes             are very profitably informed by ideas developed in the fields of                molecular evolution and genetics, and that conserved structural                 motifs characterize superfamilies of proteins that may function                 through homologous mechanisms.  There will also be poster sessions              and open discussion/workshops on key topics.  Keynote addresses                 will highlight perspectives from immunology and integrative                     biology.                                                                        %%%                                                                             A symposium on Molecular Evolution of Physiological Processes will              be held in September, 1993 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in               Woods Hole, Massachusetts, under the auspices of the Society of                 General Physiologists.  This Symposium will bring together                      scientists who study cytoskeletal and membrane functions with                   scientists whose research is focused upon molecular evolution or on             mechanisms that generate genetic diversity.  A major emphasis of                the conference is that molecular-level studies of physiological                 processes can be illuminated by ideas developed in the fields of                molecular evolution and genetics.",
