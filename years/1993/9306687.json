 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metapopulation models are important tools for understanding                distribution and abundance of organisms at large spatial scales.                Because these models attempt to integrate local population dynamics             with immigration and extinction events occurring between sites,                 they form a bridge between the traditionally separate domains of                population ecology (local abundance) and biogeography (regional                 occurrence).  Freshwater mussel communities in rivers provide an                exemplary system in which to assess metapopulation models across                different regional scales: within a stream itself (small drainages)             and within a network of streams (major river drainage).  Mussel                 communities are naturally distributed in patches because they only              occur on appropriate substrate within a river.  Local populations               are prone to frequent extinction because of the shifting course of              rivers which redeposits sediment and eradicates mussel beds.  Dr.               Vaughn will take advantage of historical (near-fossil) data on                  mussel assemblages in the Red River drainage along with SCUBA-                  facilitated inventory of current mussel communities in order to                 quantify colonization and extinction rates through time and over                spatial scales from local to regional.                                          %%%                                                                                  Rudimentary metapopulation models have been evaluated with                 datasets that emphasize current assemblages of species.  Data on                temporal fluxes are needed to begin to quantify rates and patterns              of colonization and extinction over regional spatial scales.  Dr.               Vaughn in a research planning grant is beginning to assemble such               datasets by concentrating on mussel communities in the Red River                drainage.  The work takes on added urgency in light of the recent               introduction of an alien asian clam that may prove an aggressive                competitor in the region.",
