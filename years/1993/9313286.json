 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313286  Tits       Generalized use of numerical optimization techniques in design  has  been hindered by (i) the difficulty to translate in a faithful  manner the actual engineering design problem into any kind of rigid  mathematical optimization problem, (ii) the inability of classical  optimization tools to efficiently take into account the many  distinctive features of optimization problems arising in a design  context, and (iii) the unavailability of software tools offering to  the designer a powerful as well as congenial environment supporting  such capabilities. Previous research developed an interactive  optimization-based design methodology that accommodates the  inherent trade-off driven character of most design problems.  This  has included the development implementation and testing of the  first optimization algorithms that achieve a superlinear rate of  convergence while forcing feasibility of all the successive  iterates (a crucial property in several engineering contexts) as  well as developed, implemented and tested an extension to problems  involving a continuum of constraints such as constraints on the  frequency or time response of a control system.  A window-based,  distributed computation environment for interactively exploring  tradeoffs arising in optimal design applications (Console) was  developed concurrently.  The research will concentrate on:  (1) the  development and analysis of new schemes to enhance the efficiency  of the feasible iteration algorithms, with special attention paid  to problems with large numbers of constraints; (2) the production  of a quality implementation of these schemes and extensive testing;  (3) the further development of the interactive optimization-based  system (Console).       Numerical optimization is used in the context of almost every  engineering activity.  Available methods and software are often  inadequate or techniques are not always relevant to realistic  situations.  The project addresses this need.  Special attention  will be p aid to issues such as those of efficiently handling  problems with large numbers of inequality constraints, or problems  involving functional specifications.  The ongoing research  continues to make significant educational and industrial  contributions.  ***",
