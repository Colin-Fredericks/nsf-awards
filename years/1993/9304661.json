 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will undertake isotopic, elemental chemistry, and                       petrographic studies of the massive dolomites and host reef                     carbonates in the Neogene section at Niue, a raised coral atoll in              the South Pacific.  Recent studies in the Bahamas and Barbados have             suggested that dolomitization may be mediated by sea water and/or               sea water derived fluids, may be episodic, and may be related to                eustatic fluctuations.  Cores recently drilled at Niue have                     extended the known section there from the Upper Pliocene to                     probably the Lower Miocene and have revealed stratigraphically and              temporary discrete dolomites coexisting with multiple and distinct              imprints of sea level falls and rises.  Niue's pre-Pleistocene                  tectonic history of simple subsidence, a groundwater system limited             to marine and meteoric waters, and a lithologic system limited to               clean carbonates offers minimal tectonic and chemical interference              to the study of how and when massive dolomites form.  The                       objectives of this proposed investigation are to determine with                 higher confidence than previously achieved (1) the exact nature of              the fluids involved in the replacive dolomitization; (2) the degree             of water-rock interaction during the dolomitization; (3) the                    stratigraphic position of the dolomites with respect to the fossil              water table; (4) the timing and duration of dolomitization vis-a-               vis deposition, and (5) whether there is a relation between                     dolomitization episodes and eustatic fluctuations.  18O/16O, 13C/12C,           and 87Sr86Sr ratios, Ca, Mg, Sr, and trace element concentrations,              XRD crystal chemistry analysis, and petrographic and SEM studies of             the dolomites, the host carbonates, co-existing calcite-dolomite                pairs, and coeval dolomites and phreatic calcite cements will be                the chief techniques used in this study.                                             The results emerging from this investigation will provide a                closely dated section of Neogene dolmites and host carbonates which             have an important bearing on the more fundamental problem of the                origin of synsedimentary dolomitization and implications concerning             the relation between periodic sea level changes and dolomite                    episodicity.  It will also evaluate to what degree synsedimentary               dolomites preserve the geochemical imprint of the fluids involved               in dolomitization vis-a-vis the imprint of the host carbonates and              therefore contribute to the question of dolomites' utility as                   monitors of past surficial processes.  In addition, the sea level               imprints documented on this mid-oceanic carbonate platform will                 allow a detailed reconstruction of the sea level record during the              Mio-Pliocene time, thus providing additional constraints to the                 Vail-Haq sea level record obtained rom onlap/offlap imprints on                 continental margins.",
