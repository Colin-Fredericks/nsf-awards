 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past six years, the Biology Department at the College                  of Charleston has strengthened the quality of instruction in                    the area of Cellular and Molecular Biology. This initiative has                 included the procurement of modern equipment, the hiring of new                 faculty, and an expansion of course offerings. Consistent with                  this ongoing effort to modernize our Cell and Molecular Biology                 curriculum, this proposal focuses on a request for microscopic                  and tissue culture equipment which would be used to enhance the                 quality of laboratory instruction at the whole cell level. This                 equipment will be used in several new or restructured courses                   including Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental                        Biology and Plant Physiology. The incubators and sterile                        transfer hoods requested in this proposal, make possible the                    culture of a wide variety of plant and animal cells and                         tissues. The light microscopic, video, and image analysis                       equipment will be used to investigate cell proliferation,                       migration, and adhesion, as well as to perform chromosomal                      analysis, and tumor induction studies on cultured cells and                     tissues. The laboratories incorporating these techniques are                    research-oriented, and are designed to help students develop                    critical thinking and data analysis skills, as well as to give                  students hands on experience with research quality equipment.",
