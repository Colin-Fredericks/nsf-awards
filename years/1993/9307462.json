 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational graph theory has emerged as a powerful medium  for the development of algorithmic techniques (e.g., for  dynamic algorithms, on-line algorithms, parallel algorithms,  approximation algorithms, data structure design, etc.).  Graph theory provides an excellent way to model problems  related to transportation, network design, optimization,  VLSI and many other fields.  This allows one to both develop  and illustrate the power of different algorithmic tools.  This project studies two aspects of efficient algorithm  design.  The first aspect is the study of intractable  problems (many optimization problems fall under this  category), and the design of efficient algorithms to obtain  approximate solutions. The second aspect is the study of  problems that are known to be solvable exactly in polynomial  time, but there is a wide gap between the known upper and  lower bounds.  The specific problems studied are problems   that are becoming important in the design of efficient and   reliable communication networks.  They address issues that are  relevant for higher reliability of communication at low  cost, and are of interest in network design and in the  implementation of broadcast protocols.  Some of the tools  and ideas that are used in the solutions for these problems  will have applications to solving other problems as well.",
