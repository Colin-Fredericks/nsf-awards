 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growth of Government is the most dramatic, yet least                        understood, change in the American economy in the last century.                 While most studies have focused on the growth of the federal                    government, state governments also expanded rapidly and often                   experimented with programs that were later introduced at the                    federal level.  The purpose of this research is to better                       understand the role of the states in the growth of government by                analyzing the adoption of workers' compensation, America's first                major social insurance program.  The research will combine both                 macro analysis of the timing of adoption of workers' compensation               with detailed and quantitative case studies of the passage of the               laws in several important states.  The extent to which workers'                 compensation benefitted or harmed various groups will be                        estimated, including workers of various skill levels, unionized                 workers, employers of different sizes and different accident                    experience, insurance companies, taxpayers, and state officials.                Based on these empirical estimates, how groups and individuals                  translated their expected economic returns into political action                will be analyzed.  This research is important because it will                   provide a better understanding of the interaction of the economic               and political systems in the development of the American economy.",
