 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species proliferation must occur through the evolution                          of reproductive isolation.  However, few studies of                             evolutionary radiation explore the mechanisms by which                          biological innovations may facilitate speciation.  The                          high diversities of the relatively few herbivorous                              insect taxa suggest that herbivory represents an                                innovation fostering radiation.  Host-plant                                     specialization, furthermore, may plausibly promote                              reproductive isolation, as host plants: 1) are patchily                         distributed, yielding geographic isolation, and 2)                              exert strong selection pressures, yielding adaptive                             divergence.  The student will investigate speciation in                         the leaf-feeding beetle genus Neochlamisus.                                                                                                                     Three geographically isolated populations of N.                                 bebbianae, two sharing the same host, will be the focus                         of microevolutionary study.  The degree of reproductive                         isolation exhibited by the same-host population pair                            will be compared to that for a different-host pair for                          a variety of potential components of isolation.                                 Greater observed isolation between the different-host                           populations would support the hypothesis that                                   speciation is driven by selection rather than by random                         genetic drift.  A DNA sequence-based phylogenetic study                         will be performed and use to infer host-associations of                         ancestral ferns.",
