 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue an REU Site at the Population             Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin.  Demography is              a technical field within sociology in which minorities are                      underrepresented.  This underrepresentation may stem from                       weaknesses in the typical undergraduate curriculum, combined with               low enrollment of minority students at colleges with strong                     demography programs.  The University of Texas, Austin supports a                strong, active research program in minority group demography, which             has had notable success in training minority demographers,                      especially Mexican-Americans.  In the past four years, the REU Site             summer training program has brought these skills to a mix of                    undergraduate students from the University and other smaller, non-              research oriented schools in the Southwest.                                                                                                                     As before, this REU Site has three specific objectives: (1) to                  provide undergraduate sociology students with more intense                      technical demographic training than is currently available in most              undergraduate sociology curricula; (2) to provide \"hands-on\"                    experience with faculty-led research teams conducting externally-               funded research projects on topics related to minority-group                    demography; and (3) to encourage undergraduate participants to                  develop a scholarly paper based on their summer research experience             and to present it at a regional demography group meeting after                  their summer program.  Although issues regarding the ethics of the              scientific research enterprise have been routinely covered in                   previous years, they will be incorporated in a more deliberate                  manner in the upcoming years.  The ethics component will include:               (a) issues regarding the use of human subjects, confidentiality of              data, and privacy in the execution of social-demographic research;              (b) issues regarding the publication of scientific research; and                (c) issues involved in grant applications and grant reviewing                   procedures.                                                                                                                                                     This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to                attract talented students into careers in science through active                undergraduate research experiences.",
