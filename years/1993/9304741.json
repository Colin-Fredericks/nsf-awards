 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the problem of determining the                          hydrochemical response of a groundwater-fed lake to climate change              over Holocene time.  We intend to determine the relative importance             of ground water and surface water input to Elk Lake, Grant Co.,                 Minnesota.  We will examine and compare information obtained from               ostracode (Crustacea) species distributions, ostracode shell                    chemistry, and models that describe hydrochemical reactions and                 groundwater flow.  The proposed research will provide an                        independent means of determining how a lake interacted with                     groundwater during specific times of past climate change, as well               as insight into how lake-groundwater systems can react to future                climate change.  Our approach will be 1) define the ground water                source(s) flowing into Elk Lake at present; 2) recover a complete               Holocene core from the lake; 3) reconstruct the solute history                  using ostracode species distributions, trace-elements, and stable               isotope analyses; and 4) test two hypotheses concerning the                     groundwater input and resultant lake chemistry through Holocene                 time.  This study will provide a new way of reconstructing regional             changes in surface hydrology as it responds to climate change and               has wide application to the field of hydrology and climatology.                 The results should be of practical value to hydrologists concerned              with surface water-groundwater interactions, and to climatologists              interested in climate model validation and forecasting of climate-              induced hydrologic changes.",
