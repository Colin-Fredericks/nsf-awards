 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: 9357099  PI: Mirkin    Coordination chemistry will be the subject of  investigation for Professor Mirkin of Northwestern  University; he will conduct this research with support in  the form of an NSF Young Investigator Award from the  Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry  Program.  One area of his research will be in the  synthesis and properties of \"hemilabile\" complexes.   These are complexes of ligands that bear a redox-active  site, are tetradentate in the reduced state and bidentate  in the oxidized state.  When the central metal ion is  Rh(I) it is thus expected to be inert when the ligand is  in the reduced state, but when in the oxidized state it  should be an effective catalyst for olefin hydrogenation.   This scheme provides an entree into redox-switchable  catalysis.  Another area of research deals with self-  assembled monolayers (SAMS).  Specific plans include  using derivatized metalloporphyrazines as the surface  layer, and, in particular, where the ligand design leads  to the plane of the ligand being perpendicular to the  surface; this will lead to a parallel orientation of the  ligand planes, which is expected to confer unusual  electrocatalytic properties on these SAMS.  %%%  The nascent concept of \"molcular devices\" poses many  opportunities in chemistry.  One approach is based on  traditional coordination chemistry, where a metal ion is  bound to another molecule (called a ligand) at several  sites.  An interesting development is to build into the  ligand the ability to donate an electron, for when this  is done the binding of the ligand to the metal ion can  change radically.  This change can make the difference  between a metal ion that is catalytic and one that is  not, and thus one has the elements of a method to switch  catalytic activity one and off.  Another development is  to design ligands that will cause themselves to adsorb to  a surface to form a highly oriented monolayer.  If the  surface is an electrode, then such a monolayer could  c onfer unique reactivity to the electrode.  Experiments  to test and develop these ideas form the core of the  research to be conducted in this project.",
