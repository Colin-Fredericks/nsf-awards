 "awd_abstract_narration": "Horizontal gene transfer has been proposed to account for                       patterns of expression of mobile genetic elements among non-                    interbreeding species.  Until recently no multi-celled organism                 could be targeted as a potential agent of such transfer.  There                 is now, however, biochemical evidence that implicates the mite                  Proctolaelaps regalis DeLeon as such a transfer agent for one                   class of mobile elements (P elements) among species of                          Drosophila.  Little is known about the evolution of P elements,                 and empirical evidence is completely lacking concerning the                     frequency of horizontal transfer of any mobile element. The                     Drosophila-Proctolaelaps interaction is the first system in which               such questions can be experimentally addressed.                                 %%%                                                                             The overall objective of this proposal is to experimentally verify              that this interspecific transfer can indeed occur in an observable              manner under laboratory conditions, using the polymerase chain                  reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis.  If successful, this initially              high-risk endeavor will open the door to a research program                     involving controlled laboratory manipulation of a previously                    intractable area of valuable research which has far-reaching                    implications for understanding novel mechanisms of inheritance, the             phylogeny of Drosophila, the innovation of new species, and the                 evolution of host-parasite and predator-prey interactions.",
