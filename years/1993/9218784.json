 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental principle of many developing systems is the mutually              exclusive nature of cell growth and cellular differentiation.                   Dictyostelium discoideum provides a model for investigating this                reciprocal relationship in that in the vegetative state the amoebae             have an unlimited capacity for self renewal through growth and                  mitotic divisions while initiation of the developmental program                 results in a cessation of growth and division and leads to cellular             differentiation. During the past granting period, the regulatory                mechanisms underlying the switch from growth to development have                been investigated primarily be examining the resulting differential             expression of a variety of genes. It is proposed to continue this               approach by investigating the molecular mechanisms bringing about               the deactivation of transcription of one of these genes, V4, in                 response to cessation of growth and activation of the developmental             program. This will be done by examining the protein factors                     involved in the expression of the V4 gene, and how the activity of              these factors is coupled to the transition from growth to                       development. V4 gene expression is highly sensitive to levels and               types of nutrients present in the environment. In addition, the                 encoded product of the V4 gene has been shown to be required for                the transition from growth to development, and it is involved in                the deactivation of expression of all growth specific genes                     examined and in the induction of expression of most \"early                      developmental specific\" genes. The role of this gene product in                 bringing about a cessation of growth and in initiating the                      developmental program and how it is involved in regulating the                  expression of the above mentioned genes will be examined. This will             require production and purification of the encoded protein,                     examining any activity associated with it, and determining its                  cellular location, its modification state(s), and identifying other             proteins which may interact with it. The possible interplay between             the V4 gene product and several other factors postulated to be                  involved in the early regulatory events of the developmental                    program will be investigated.",
