 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperation between US and Chinese                          investigators on a study of political behavior in China, which is               undergoing a rapid socio-economic transformation.  Using data                   already collected in China in 1990, combined with new data                      scheduled to be acquired in the summer of 1993, the research team               hopes to explore issues of political participation in a non-                    democratic regime which is in transition, and to develop a                      scientifically credible database from which to test hypotheses                  about political culture which have been largely constructed from                study of liberal democracies.                                                                                                                                   Political participation, defined in this study as voluntary                     citizen activity directed at influencing government policies or                 personnel,  has largely been unexamined in countries such as                    China.  This study will provide a crucial building block in                     understanding any contemporary political system.  Additionally,                 the study should shed light on one of the looming questions about               the twentyfirst century, the prospects for political change in                  the remaining communist power, the People's Republic of China.                  The research will be conducted by U.S. researchers from the                     University of Iowa, Columbia University, and Chinese researchers                from People's University in Beijing, China.",
