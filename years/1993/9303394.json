 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theorem prover Rewrite Rule Laboratory, RRL, and   the proof  management system Tecton are enhanced to make them useful    for applications,  especially where analysis of specifications and  well-founded   ordering play a crucial  role in these  applications, and large complex proofs often   have to be  constructed.  RRL is a theorem prover based on rewriting    techniques and  completion which provides support for  equational and   inductive reasoning.  Tecton is a management  system, and it provides a menu-driven   interface  to the theorem prover and emphasized visualization   of proofs.  Tecton is extended to support a proof command language  which   a user control over proof construction and  structuring.    Tecton is useful  for instructional purposes,  for teaching theorem proving,   methods for  constructing proofs  and verification.    RRL is extended to   enhance its  theorem proving  capabilities for proving properties by   induction.  The cover  set induction method which has proved quite effective in    automating proofs by  induction, is further refined.   Semantic methods for showing   of rewrite systems of  recursively defined functions,   especially those arising  in the  specification of algorithms and data structures, are   studied and  further developed.  Heuristics for checking the  completeness   of a cover set  designed from a function  definition are investigated.    Heuristics for  automatic  lemma generation in RRL are expanded.",
