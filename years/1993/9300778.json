 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in three areas of mathematical analysis will be                   supported by this award.  The theme of the work revolves around                 partial differential equations defined on domains with nonsmooth                boundaries and inverse problems related to such equations.  The                 first areas concerns computational algorithms for approximating                 the inverse of classical layer potentials on nonsmooth domains.                 One is interested in determining mathematically justified                       numerical schemes for approximating inverses of boundary integral               operators arising from layer potentials.  These potentials are                  associated with boundary value problems for second order                        partial differential equations and systems.  A second line of                   study concerns Fatou theory and potential theory for nonlinear                  elliptic equations and linear parabolic equations with                          nonsmooth coefficients.  The goal is to determine exactly how                   solutions, defined on the interior of a domain, change as the                   boundary is approached in a nontangential direction.  The final                 goal is to establish sharp boundedness estimates for classes of                 functions on nonsmooth domains in the form of multiplicative norm               inequalities involving a second or higher order elliptic operator               on the functions of involving the Stokes operator in the case of                a vector=valued function.The analysis of partial differential                   equations on nonsmooth domains is an subject of intense recent                  activity in mathematical research.  It has been possible to make                steady headway on problems once thought to be out of reach. Aside               from their intellectual challenge, these problems have a                        practical side -most phenomena in the physical world which can be               modeled by differential equations are burdened with rough                       boundary conditions.  This type of research validates information               only obtained intuitively or through computation.",
