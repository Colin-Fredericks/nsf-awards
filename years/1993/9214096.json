Wilkens and a graduate  student from the University of Hawaii for international  collaboration with Dr. Jurgen Mienert and others of GEOMAR, a  marine geological institute in Kiel, Germany.   These two  groups share an interest in the measurement and interpretation  of acoustic properties and the acoustic stratigraphy of the  seafloor under the deep ocean.  They plan to investigate in  great detail the variations in several physical properties in  the upper zone of these seafloor sediments.  The German  research group has been developing geophysical instrumentation  complementary to some being developed at the University of  Hawaii.  Professor Wilkens and his student have been invited  to join in the planning for and accompany the Germans on at  least one cruise aboard a German research vessel.  Both U. S.  and German scientific programs will benefit greatly from the  proposed combination of measuring techniques and oceanographic  expertise.    The upper ten meters of the seafloor contain the largest  gradients in physical and acoustic proerties in the sediment-  seawater system.  Within this zone, porosity may change by 20-  30% and density may vary by as much as 50%  Modern geophysical  instrumentation such as that being developed by the  participating research groups is making it possible to locate  precisely and sample the discontinuities where sediment  composition or microstructure changes.  Examining such samples  reveals the nature of the changes in the sediment and can  provide evidence of changes in paleo-environmental conditions.   Such data are extremely valuable in studies of local and  global climate change.  ***",
