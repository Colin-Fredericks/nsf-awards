 "awd_abstract_narration": "9218859  Guyden    Thymic nurse cells (TNCs) are specialized epithelial components  that contain T cells completely enclosed in intra-cytoplasmic  vacuoles.  Very little information about their function has been  reported because of the lack of pure TNC populations in quantities  necessary for their thorough analyses.  Recently, this laboratory  has been able to immortalize TNCs with SV40 virus.  Cells from  these TNC lines have been shown to maintain the ability to   internalize thymocytes in vitro.  Further, it has been shown that  the only cells bound by an internalized into TNCs are CD4-  positive, CD8-positive thymocytes.  These cell lines will be used  to study TNC function.  The goals of this research are to determine  the molecular components involved in TNC binding and  internalization of thymocytes, and to determine the specific  function of TNC internalization of double positive thymocytes in T  cell development.  Two strategies will be employed:  (1) TNC-  specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) will be generated in an  attempt to identify the receptor/ligand involved in binding and  internalization.  (2) Antibody preparations shown to block binding  of thymocytes to TNCs will be used to clone the gene(s) expressing  the protein(s) involved.  These studies are designed to determine  the function of thymocyte binding and internalization by TNCs.    %%%  Thymic nurse cells are specialized epithelial cells of the thymus  in which T-lymphocytes are regularly found completely enclosed in  intra-cytoplasmic vacuoles.  This is a very unusual phenomenon in  physiology.  Very little information about the function of thymic  nurse cells is known because of the lack of pure TNC populations in  quantities necessary for their thorough analyses.  However, they  are believed to play an important role in the development of T-  lymphocytes of the immune system.  With prior NSF support, this  laboratory has been able to grow pure populations of thymic nurse  cells in culture.  The goals of this project a re to study the  interaction of thymic nurse cells with T-lymphocytes at the  molecular level.  The results of this research should provide  unique new information on how thymic nurse cells function.  ***",
