 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xenoliths from the southwestern U.S. will be analyzed to                        study the compositional and thermal evolution of mantle                         lithosphere and the relationships between mantle properties                     and crustal tectonics.  Characterization of textures and                        compositional gradients will be combined with electron                          microprobe and PIXE analysis of thin sections and with                          isotopic analysis of mineral separates.  Xenoliths from the                     Grand Canyon field on the Colorado Plateau will be studied                      in most detail.  Compositions and thermal histories of the                      samples will be compared to those of xenoliths from the                         Basin and Range province, to learn how crustal uplift and                       extension are related to mantle dynamics.  Textures and Sr-                     Nd systematics in the Grand Canyon xenoliths are unusual,                       and they will be characterized to understand metasomatic                        processes that may be subduction-related.  A large                              collection from the Navajo field in the central Plateau has                     been recently acquired, and choice samples will be analyzed                     to determine depth and timing of mantle hydration and                           eclogite-facies recrystallization.  In all parts of the                         study, particular effort will be made to elucidate transport                    processes and rates of mineral equilibration in the mantle,                     by careful analyses of gradients and by numerical                               simulations.",
