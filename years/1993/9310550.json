 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Chemistry Program supports research on alkane functionalization                 by Dr. Dean M. Roddick of the Chemistry Department, University                  of Wyoming.  Iridium complexes of (fluoroalkyl)phospine ligands                 will be surveyed for catalytic cycloalkane dehydrogenation                      activity and, in some cases, the mechanism of the reaction will                 be determined.  New iridum   complexes containing weakly                        coordinating ligands and new ruthenium hydride compounds will                   by synthesized and examined for alkane activation reactivity.                   Because of the stability of (fluoroalkyl)phospine ligands in                    acidic and in oxidizing conditions, the possibility of C-H                      activation followed by hydrogen scavenging, olefin oxidation or                 direct metal-alkyl oxidations will be investigated.  The                        suitability of this class of compounds for catalytic aldehyde                   and alcohol decarbonylation will also be tested.                                %%%                                                                             The fluoronated alkylphosphine group which is attached to the                   metal withdraws electronic charge from the vicinity of the                      metal but, unlike other groups which can also accomplish this,                  is resistant to thermal or oxidative degradation.  Because of                   this stability, the compounds synthesized have potential for                    practical use in the design of reagents and catalysts to                        functionalize alkanes.  Petroleum and natural gas technology                    would be influenced by a successful outcome.",
