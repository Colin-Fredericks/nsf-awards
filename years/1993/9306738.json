 "awd_abstract_narration": "My research focuses on the construction  of  likelihood                    functions for estimating equations.  The need for such functions                arises when the estimating equations do not integrate to                        potential functions.  The likelihood functions can be either                    obtained from the projection of the true score function  onto a                 class of  conservative estimating equations or from the                         projection of a pair of centered likelihood ratios.   The                       projections are developed for the quasi-likelihood method, and                  for the generalized estimating equations, as well as some other                 classes of estimating equations.  They can be applied to both                   independent and dependent situations.  These functions will be                  used to construct invariant confidence intervals, to distinguish                between consistent and inconsistent solutions to estimating                     equations, and to test statistical hypotheses.  I also have                     introduced a notion of the information contained in a testing                   function,  and will use it to study some commonly used testing                  functions. In relation to this, a property of the first order                   ancillarity is obtained.                                                             The  key issue in statistics is to establish a relation                    between the truth and the data, and to use the relation to make                 inference about the truth  based  on the  data.  This  is  often                achieved by what we call the likelihood methods.  Sometimes the                 traditional likelihood method faces difficulties:  it may need to               make assumptions that are difficult to satisfy; it may be                       computationally difficult to realize; it may not be rich enough                 to accommodate certain applications. Meeting these challenges,                  the theories and methods of quasi-likelihood and estimating                     equations have been developed and widely used during recent                     years.  Extending  and  enriching the likelihood method, the new                methods can be applied under more realistic assumptions, more                   conveniently, and in wider situations.   My research is on                      certain aspects of  quasi-likelihood  and estimating equations,                 and in particular the construction of  likelihood functions for                 estimating equations and their use in statistical inference.",
