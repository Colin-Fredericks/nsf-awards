 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cittadino is continuing his investigation into the formative                period in the development of ecology as a science, i.e. the period              between World Wars I & II.  He is undertaking this study from an                international perspective and with every effort to interrelate                  intellectual, cultural, social, and institutional themes.  The                  research involves examining primary and secondary source material               and visiting selected archival sites.  The interwar period                      witnessed the intellectual and institutional maturation of ecology,             the emergence of methodologies and concepts usually associated with             the postwar period, the emergence of identifiable schools, and the              initial encounters between this new science and a variety of social             and ideological views and practices.  This study represents a                   substantial contribution to the historical understanding of                     ecological science and offers a unique perspective of a multi-                  dimensional study carried out from an international point of view.",
