 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this project                                              is to develop a procedure to                                                    balance the structure's actual                                                  strength and the required ductility                                             requirements for steel frame                                                    design.  Steel moment frames are                                                popularly used for low-to medium-                                               rise buildings in all seismic                                                   zones.  Unlike reinforced concrete                                              frames, member sizes of steel                                                   moment frames are quite often                                                   governed by drift limits; therefore                                             the structure's actual strength may                                             be significantly higher than that                                               required by seismic codes.                                                      Unfortunately, this unique feature                                              of steel design is not recognized                                               by seismic codes, and stringent                                                 ductility requirements as specified                                             in these codes may be too                                                       conservative.  Furthermore, since                                               the stringent ductility                                                         requirements are developed                                                      primarily for high seismic zones,                                               its application to moderate or low                                              seismic zones has been questioned.                                                                                                                              The proposed design procedure                                                   considers explicitly the beneficial                                             structural overstrength resulting                                               from drift limitations; the                                                     required ductility is balanced by                                               this overstrength.  In addition to                                              two ductility classes (Special and                                              Ordinary Moment Frames) which have                                              been adopted in seismic provisions,                                             a third class (Intermediate Moment                                              Frame) will be developed in the                                                 project.  Thus an economic design                                               which provides a more consistent                                                safely level for all seismic                                                    regions can be achieved.                                                                                                                                        An efficient computer program will                                              be developed to compute structural                                              overstrength.  Several moment                                                   frames located in different seismic                                             zones will be designed by both the                                              conventional and proposed design                                                methods.  Feasibility study will be                                             conducted and cost savings                                                      resulting from the proposed design                                              method will be noted.  Safety level                                             of steel moment frames designed by                                              both methods will also be compared                                              by performing nonlinear dynamic                                                 analysis.",
