 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate wavelength                          stabilization of a laser diode for use in a distance measuring                  interferometer or related device.  The long range benefits of this              program will be a low cost linear distance measuring interferometer             for use in precision machine tools, semiconductor manufacturing                 equipment, precision metrology and laboratory measurements.  A                  stabilization technique based upon temperature control of the laser             diode will be researched.  The temperature is controlled either by              an attached thermoelectric (TE) cooler, varying the injection                   current to the laser diode or both.  This approach requires an                  external interferometer to develop a control signal based upon                  wavelength drift if more than crude wavelength stability is to be               obtained.  In a distance measuring interferometer, this control                 signal can be obtained with little additional effort.                                Successful completion of this research program will result in              a wavelength stabilized source for use in a compact and low cost                linear distance measuring interferometer which can compete in the               same markets as glass scales as well as many markets currently                  served by helium-neon based linear distance measuring                           interferometer.",
