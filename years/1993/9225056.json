 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the damage and destruction caused by earthquakes is                       that to historic architecture which, unlike other kinds of                      losses, often represent a permanent loss of the historic                        record and cultural identity of communities.  The series of                     earthquakes on April 25 and 26, 1992, in Humboldt County,                       California, that measured 7.1, 6.6, and 6.7 on the Richter                      scale damaged or destroyed approximately 1,000 buildings, a                     number of which were of significant architectural and                           historic interest dating from the period between 1870 and                       1900.  The proposed project would describe the event,                           briefly review the history of the area, indicate the damage                     and destruction to historic buildings, point out mitigation                     measures which could have prevented much of the damage at                       minimal cost, describe the disaster response process, and                       suggest methods to improve the treatment of historic                            buildings in relief and reconstruction efforts by government                    agencies.  Requested support would cover costs for a                            graduate student to visit the impacted area, physically                         survey damage, interview informed respondents in public                         agencies, preservation organizations, and consulting and                        construction firms, and cover other supplementary costs of                      the project.",
