The primary goal of this research is                                  in the application of high resolution molecular                                 spectroscopy to short wavelength                                                photoabsorption by atomic and molecular systems                                 of atmospheric, astrophysical and theoretical                                   importance. Extracting molecular                                                parameters from measured line shapes will                                       provide information needed to model temperature                                 dependencies for atmospheric extinction                                         measurements; temperature dependent models are                                  very sensitive to the molecular line shape.                                                                                                                     This project will combine the expertise                                         represented by the U.S. participants with                                       similar expertise in Australia in the                                           development and application of the highest                                      monochromaticity short-wavelength research.                                     The research has relevance both in its                                          application to absorption processes in the                                      earth's atmosphere, and associated                                              environmental questions, and to                                                 fundamentals of our knowledge of line                                           shapes and molecular potentials. The                                            reciprocal visits by the Australian team                                        members to the U.S. is supported through the                                    Australian Department of Industry, Technology                                   and Commerce (DITAC).",
