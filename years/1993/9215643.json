 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports one trip per year, over a two year period,                  to Australia by Dr. Peeples of the Rush-Presbyterian -                          St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago to conduct collaborative                   research with Dr. Jeffrey Gorman, Head for Protein Chemistry at                 the Biomolecular Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria.                       Drs. Peeples and Gorman share an interest in understanding the                  structure and function of the paramyxovirus fusion protein. This                glycoprotein, in its active, cleaved form, enables the membrane                 in which it resides to fuse with an opposing membrane. The                      structural elements of this protein required for its proper                     folding, disulfide bond formation, oligomerization, transport                   and cleavage are not known. Recent genetic, immunologic and                     peptide chemistry information generated in the laboratories of                  these investigators has led to new insights.                                                                                                                    The investigators will work in each other's laboratories for one                month each year over the duration of the award. In this way, they               will be able to share their diverse expertise, techniques                       and reagents. Both investigators are using the Newcastle disease                virus F protein as a model and each has developed unique antibody               probes which will facilitate their studies. Their first target                  will be to identify the disulfide bond which links the F1 and F2                peptides generated by cleavage in the trans Golgi and to                        determine its role in folding, transport and cleavage.",
