 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose a project designed to increase the scientific literacy               of undergraduate non-majors at Northern Arizona University and                  community colleges in Arizona with predominantly ethnic minority                populations, Navajo Community College, Pima Community College, and              Cochise Community College.                                                      The project has four major foci:  (1) We intend to restructure an               introductory biology course for non-majors so that it enhances                  students' scientific literacy and their understanding of                        multidisciplinary approaches to real-world problems.  The                       laboratory component for the course will provide students the                   opportunity to do inquiry-based and research-oriented science.  (2)             We would effect systemic change at NAU and the three community                  colleges by developing and implementing professional development                seminars and practical workshops for graduate teaching assistants               and faculty.  These workshops would explore new approaches to                   developing relevant and substantive curricular frameworks for                   introductory biology for non-majors.  3) We would test the                      restructuring of introductory biology through an experimental                   design that will enable us to  determine what is the most effective             design for two kinds of academic communities, state comprehensive               university and a sample of community colleges in Arizona.  4) We                would follow faculty and their students in a longitudinal study of              the course's impacts.  Our project -- A Slice of Life: An                       Introductory Biology Course -- represents an experimental approach              to curriculum development that will determine \"what works\" in non-              majors biology courses.",
