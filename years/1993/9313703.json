 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313703  Conkey    With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Margaret Conkey and  her collaborators will conduct a survey to locate Magdalenian  archaeological sites in the Pyrenee Mountains of the Ariege region  of France. The group has selected a 45 km. stretch between 600 and  900 meters above sea level and will walk this region in a  systematic manner to look both for potential caves and rock  shelters which may contain archaeological remains and also to  examine fields and other open areas where materials may be exposed  on the surface. They will make collect exposed material and, if  permission can be obtained, excavate small test trenches to  determine if in situ deposits are present. The project will be  conducted in collaboration with a French geomorphologist with the  goal of setting the cultural component into a broader environmental  context. Samples for palynological (pollen) and sedimentological  analysis will be collected. On this basis one can determine when  these upland areas first became ice-free at the end of the  Pleistocene (Ice Age) and how vegetation communities developed.     The term \"Magdalenian\" refers to a culture which flourished in  Western Europe at the end of the Pleistocene ca 14,000 years ago.  The level of Magdalenian achievement is marked by painted caves  such as Lascaux and Altimera, by highly developed bone industry and  by a intensive subsistence specializations on minor highly seasonal  resources such as migrating salmon. It is likely that the stage was  set during this period of the domestication of plants and animals.  The research proposed by Dr. Conkey is important because it  examines the level of Magdalenian technical competence. While  several caves with paintings are known from the Pyrenees region, it  is unclear whether Magdalenian peoples had the ability to occupy  this difficult mountainous terrain on a long term basis. Very  little is known about the archaeology of the region and this  project will provide the groundwork for future resear ch.    This work is important for several reasons. It will provide data of  interest to many archaeologists. It will also shed new light on  human-environmental interactions and the development of human  competence. Finally, the knowledge gained will provide the base for  a larger long term research project.",
