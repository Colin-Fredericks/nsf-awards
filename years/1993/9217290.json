 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out on               a model liquid crystal system to study a variety of non-equilibrium             phenomena.  The phase ordering dynamics of a quenched nematic                   liquid crystal will be investigated with a special emphasis on the              role of the topological defects in the equilibration process.  A                very rapid quench of a nematic below its crystallization point will             be undertaken in an effort to create and study an anisotropic                   glassy system.  Algorithms will be developed so that the                        simulations can run efficiently on massively parallel machines.  If             successful, this work will further the understanding of non-                    equilibrium phenomena in complex fluids and anisotropic systems, as             well as providing the first numerical simulations of topological                defects in fluid systems.  It will also further develop the                     computational approach required to efficiently run molecular                    dynamics simulations on massively parallel machines.  This research             is jointly supported by the Divisions of Materials Research and                 Advanced Scientific Computing as part of the Computational                      Approaches to Real Materials Initiative which is a component of the             High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative.                       %%%                                                                             This computational research will focus on understanding the                     properties of liquid crystals, such as are used in video displays,              when they are rapidly cooled.  During the cooling process various               defects are frozen into the liquid crystal and affect its                       properties.  This cooling process is too complex to be modeled                  analytically and is only amenable to computational analysis.  Thus,             this project, which is jointly funded by the Divisions of Materials             Research and Advancd Scientific Computing, involves both condensed              matter physicists and computer scientists.  The computational work              will be implemented on the emerging parallel computers.  The                    research is supported through the Computational Approaches to Real              Materials program within the High Performance Computing and                     Communication Initiative.",
