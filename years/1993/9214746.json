 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand how initiation of DNA                 replication is coupled to growth rate.  To understand how the                   frequency of the initiation event is determined, the mechanisms                 that regulate the expression of the DnaA protein must be                        understood.  Both genetics and biochemistry are being used to                   elucidate the regulatory circuits controlling expression of the                 dnaA operon promoters.  The growth rate regulator and alarmone,                 guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), inhibits transcription from the               dnaA P2 promoter.  The molecular basis of this inhibition is being              characterized in vitro. Mutants defective in the inhibitory                     response to ppGpp will be examined for growth rate regulation and               precise timing of initiation of DNA replication in the cell cycle.              We will determine whether the dnaA gene is still under growth rate              control in cells that lack ppGpp - is there a growth rate                       regulation mechanism other than ppGpp that controls the expression              of DnaA protein?  We will investigate DnaA protein-DNA interactions             by isolation and characterization of DnaA mutant proteins with                  altered DNA-binding specificities.  We will construct a chromosomal             mutation with genes on either side of oriC deleted, and the                     resulting mutant will be examined for loss of precise timing in the             cell cycle.                                                                     %%%                                                                             This research studies the control of a key step in cell divison and             should provide significant insights into a basic question in                    biology, as well as abberant conditions suchs as uncontrolled cell              mutiplication.",
