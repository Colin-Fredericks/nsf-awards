 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the interaction of cumulus convection with                   larger-scale circulations has been and remains a problem of great               importance in atmospheric science.  Currently there are two schools             of thought regarding this interaction.  The first (known as CISK)               holds that the tropical atmosphere is conditionally unstable and                that the large scale circulation determines where and when the                  associated available potential energy is released.  The second                  purports that convection is in a state of quasi-equilibrium with                the large-scale circulation and is responsible for redistributing               heat and moisture, but does not constitute an energy source for                 those circulations.  Theories to explain, among other things, the               genesis of tropical cyclones depend on understanding the nature of              the interaction between cumulus clouds and the large-scale                      environment.                                                                         In 1991, a field experiment known as the Tropical Experiment               in Mexico (TEXMEX) was conducted to explore tropical cyclone                    genesis in the eastern Pacific.  The unique data collected as part              of that experiment will allow Dr. Emanuel, the PI, to explore                   fundamental aspects of the genesis problem as well as to gain                   insights into the broader question of cumulus and large-scale                   circulation interaction.  In addition, the PI will investigate the              dynamics of spiral rainbands and concentric eyewalls of tropical                cyclones.",
