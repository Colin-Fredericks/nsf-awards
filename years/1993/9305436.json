 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fire is a major form of disturbance that influences the                    composition, structure, and distribution of vegetation.  Fire                   frequency is affected by climate, and as climates change, so does               the way that fires shape and maintain spatial patterns of                       vegetation.  Past changes in fire frequency have been shown to                  accelerate and amplify effects of climate change, thereby                       producing more rapid shifts in vegetation composition and                       distribution than would have otherwise occurred.  The specific                  links among long-term changes in climate, vegetation, and fire                  regimes are not well understood, however.  This doctoral                        dissertation research project will analyze charcoal, magnetic                   susceptibility, and pollen from sediment cores taken from lakes                 in three different biogeographic provinces in Yellowstone                       National Park in order to reconstruct the fire history of the                   area over the last 14,000 years.  These analyses will elucidate                 fire regimes for different kinds of vegetation and will address                 the role of regional climatic change as an influence on fire                    frequency.                                                                           This project will provide information and insights of value                from a number of different perspectives.  Although focusing on                  change in Yellowstone National Park, the data gathered through                  analyses in this project will complement data gathered from                     numerous other sites in the northwestern U.S. thereby advancing                 knowledge of regional climate and vegetation change since the                   last glacial advance.  The study also will contribute to deeper                 understandings of the complex involvement of fires in climatic                  and vegetational processes.  This type of knowledge may have                    increasingly significant utility for resource managers in the                   park and in other environments if climatic changes forecast for                 future decades occur.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement                   award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising               student to establish a strong independent research career.",
