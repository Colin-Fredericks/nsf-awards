 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forest degradation is one of the most serious environmental                     problems afflicting Honduras and much of Latin America.                         Despite considerable deforestation in one region of Honduras                    local Lenca Indians have apparently managed their communal                      forests well.  A new agrarian law and a recently created a                      national park in the area that will influence the future of                     these woodlands.  These events appear related to a                              resurgence in Lenca ethnic identity and community members'                      efforts to gain title to their communal forests by                              organizing politically.  This project will investigate how                      communal forests are being managed and how a resurgence in                      ethnic identity help the Lenca to maintain communal forest                      lands. The research will focus on co-heads of households,                       community leaders, grassroots organization members,                             government officials, and development professionals.  The                       resulting doctoral dissertation will increase our knowledge                     of communal forest management and the social, ethnic, and                       political processes which can reduce the degradation of                         forest ecosystems.  The research findings will also assist                      in planning policy to promote sustainable management of                         forests in Honduras and other Latin American nations.",
