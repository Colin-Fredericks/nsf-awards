 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laboratory software modules, linked to a videodisc of still,                    motion, and animation sequences, will be used in a new                          undergraduate plant science lab. We will link the laboratory                    computers in a local area network so that groups of students                    can communicate with other groups (and with the teaching                        assistant) in order to work on open-ended, thought-provoking                    exercises in a cooperative, collaborative learning environment                  of scientific discourse and debate.  We further propose to test                 the new and existing modules and exercises to assess the                        changes in the teaching/learning process that occur upon                        adoption of this new educational technology.                                    A core of 15 multimedia lab modules has been produced through                   collaboration of VPI Learning Research Center and the                           Department of Biology.  This core material lacks self-help                      tutorials to guide students through its complex new format,                     which shifts the traditional lab goal of demonstration to one                   of understanding causal relations and interconnectedness.  We                   use ecology and evolution as major themes to interpret plant                    construction, growth, and development, reproduction,and                         grouping.                                                                       With NSF support we will develop the self-help tutorials and                    cooperative learning exercises for the 15 core modules, produce                 alternatives for several of them, implement the local area                      network, and design and implement assessment instruments to                     analyze our software modules and the changes in                                 teaching/learning that this new educational technology brings                   to the life sciences.",
