 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one-year award supports U.S.-Sweden-Norway cooperative                     research between James Davis of the Smithsonian's Astrophysics                  Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Bernt O. Ronnang                    of the Onsala Space Observatory, Chalmers University of                         Technology, Onsala, Sweden.  The objective of the research is to                take measurements of three-dimensional crustal motion at                        locations in Sweden and Norway (Fennoscandia).  The estimates                   of crustal velocity will be used to determine viscosity of the                  Earth's mantle beneath Fennoscandia and to correct estimates of                 sea-level change associated with local vertical crustal motion.                 Knowledge of the mantle's viscosity is required for understanding               mantle convection, the driving force of plate tectonic motion.                  The estimates of sea-level change for crustal motion is required                for determining global sea-level change, an important gauge of                  global warming.  Satellite surveying techniques are to be                       employed for estimating crustal velocity.                                                                                                                       The project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the                   U.S. and Swedish research groups and Swedish coordination with                  the Nordic Council funding agencies.  The U.S. investigators have               extensive experience in the processing of space geodetic data and               using this data to estimate geophysical parameters.  This is                    complemented by the Swedish group's knowledge of the region.                    They will plan the surveys, the site reconnaissance and coordinate              the effort with the Nordic Council.",
