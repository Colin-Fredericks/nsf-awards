 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Goff of the University of Iowa will attempt to                        catalyze the dioxygenation of aromatic compounds with support                   from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic program.                   The attempt is motivated by the existence of metalloenzymes                     that perform this feat.  Goff will investigate hemes, manganese                 porphyrins, and non-porphyrin iron and manganese compounds for                  their ability to catalyze the introduction of both atoms of an                  oxygen molecule across adjacent atoms of aromatic rings.  He                    will use porphyrin compounds that are known to coordinate                       peroxide in a side-on configuration, and he will tune the                       reactivity by altering the substituents on the porphyrin                        periphery.  Paramagnetic NMR will play an important role in                     assessing the effects of these substituents.  Success in this                   endeavor would add a major new dimension to abiological                         oxidation chemistry.                                                            %%%                                                                             Dioxygenases are naturally-occurring enzymes that catalyze                      reactions of molecular oxygen with aromatic organic compounds                   such that both oxygen atoms become bound to the organic                         product.  Reactions of this type are unknown in synthetic                       chemistry, but are potentially of great value.  A concerted                     effort to develop such reactivity will be conducted, and it                     will be guided by current insight regarding the bonding of O2                   to certain metal-containing compounds.  It is considered that                   by bonding to the metal center, the properties of O2 will be                    sufficiently altered that it will react as though a dioxygenase                 enzyme were present.",
