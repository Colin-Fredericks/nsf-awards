 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iron and steel making have traditionally formed the backbone of                 industrial strength.  As early as 1770, Americans built up their                iron industry to the third largest in the world.  They produced                 increasing amounts of iron through the 19th century.  By the 20th               century Americans led the world in iron and steel production.  Dr.              Gordon is tracing the development of the American iron industry.                                                                                                Three research questions shape his study.  The first concerns                   innovation and the transfer of technology.  Dr. Gordon is seeking               to demonstrate that while most of the techniques that Americans had             used for making and shaping iron and its alloys originated in                   Europe, few of these techniques were useful until local artisans                substantially modified them and raised them to higher levels of                 technological development than were ever attained in Europe.  The               second question concerns the growth of competence among American                artisans.   Third, he is exploring the changing attitudes towards               the use of natural resources and the environment in the development             of techniques in this energy-intensive industry.                                                                                                                In order to carry out this study, Dr. Gordon is using                           archaeological data and archaeometric methods to supplement the                 historical records.  Laboratory data are particularly important for             this study in dealing with questions about the quality of products              made in the past and metallurgical processes that were poorly                   recorded.  Metallographic studies and microprobe analyses of slags              and metal artifacts allow Dr. Gordon and his assistants to                      determine how processes worked and the reasons for technological                success or failure.  He is using field observations to locate                   sources of artifacts for laboratory study and to examine the long-              term environmental consequences of ironmaking.",
