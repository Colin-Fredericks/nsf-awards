 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California                    at Berkeley will be the site of a three-year Primary                            Leadership Institute in Science and Mathematics (PRISM) for                     teams of K-3 teachers and teacher educators nationwide.                         PRISM is based on a previously NSF-funded program, and will                     provide education in both content and instructional                             strategies, as well as preparing teachers to serve as                           specialists and providers of inservice.  A 4-week summer                        institute providing 120 hours of educational enhancement to                     30 teachers and specialists will be offered each year (90                       teachers/3 years).  During the academic year, participants                      will receive a regular newsletter, mini-grants to support                       school-year leadership activities, and will attend                              leadership conferences.  A new facet of this project is the                     involvement of 20 teacher educators (60 total) each project                     year from institutions nationwide.  These teacher educators                     will attend the PRISM Institute for one week to receive                         inservice specific to adapting the PRISM model for use with                     teachers in their areas.                                                                                                                                        This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher                             enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science                       knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills and                       efforts of teachers of grades K-3, and because it will also                     provide a 1-week workshop for science educators who will be                     teamed with teacher participants when possible; thus the                        project will have far-reaching impact, not only through the                     efforts of teacher participants, but also through the pre-                      service and classroom teachers reached by participating                         teacher educators.                                                                                                                                              Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 28% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
