 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to improve the mathematical and                      scientific competence of elementary school students through                     the development of teacher enhancement models based in                          professional development schools.                                                                                                                               A professional development school is defined as a partnership                   wherein university and school personnel work together as a                      team to share what they know, discover new knowledge about                      schooling and explore new models of teaching and learning.                                                                                                      The participants will consist of cohorts of 6 leadership                        teachers from each of 4 school districts. One new cohort will                   be added in each of the four years.  Two \"bridge\" teachers                      will co-ordinate the activities between districts.  These 26                    teachers will participate in weekly 2 hour seminars during 30                   weeks of the academic year to enhance their subject field and                   pedagogical knowledge and learn appropriate modes of working                    with adult learners. During each of 4 summers the leadership                    teachers will conduct workshops with teachers within their                      schools.  The \"bridge\" teachers will link the 4 project                         schools with the University, each other and eventually other                    schools in the district.  Administrators and parents will be                    included in the activities to help accomplish change.                                                                                                           Cost sharing is 18% of the NSF request.",
