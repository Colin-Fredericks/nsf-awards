 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER deals with a fundamental problem in polymer science,                  namely how do giant molecules move with respect to each other?  A               widely held view, espoused by de Gennes and others, is that                     macromolecules move in a snakelike fashion, i.e., by reptation.                 Reptation seems to hold under some conditions, but not under                    others.  In the absence of decisive experiments, the theory has,                therefore, become controversial.  This research aims to provide a               decive test.  It will consist of careful preparation of a series of             polymers with deuteration either at the ends or in the center of                the chains.  The diffusion of the molecules will then be studied                under a variety of conditions, using neutron reflectivity and other             means.                                                                                                                                                          This careful test of polymer dynamics is needed.  If successful,                the experiments will either be a decisive test of the theory or at              least point the way to other experiments that should settle this                issue.  In either case, rheology of polymers will be put on a more              scientific basis.",
