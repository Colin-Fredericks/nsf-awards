 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Stephen Plog, Ms. Mary Metcalf will                  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will visit a                    number of archaeological repositories in the United States and                  study the notes and drawings of archaeologists who excavated                    prehistoric Anasazi sites in the U.S. Southwest. The goal of this               work is to understand the political and social organization of                  these prehistoric peoples and the extent to which their society                 was organized along egalitarian or hierarchical lines. To do                    this, Ms. Metcalf will work primarily with site plans and                       descriptions of site architecture. She will calculate the areal                 extent and number of buildings devoted to public as opposed to                  family activities. She will also look at methods of construction                and amount of labor which were devoted to each. Finally she will                examine the location of public areas to determine the extent                    their access was restricted. A large number of sites covering                   three geographical areas and spanning several hundred years will                be examined and by means of comparison Ms. Metcalf will determine               how political organization changed over time.                                                                                                                   Without writing and with a relatively simple technology the                     prehistoric Anasazi peoples of the U.S. Southwest constructed                   large multistory stone and adobe structures consisting of                       hundreds of rooms. Their society integrated thousands of peoples                and constructed roads to move goods over long distances. They                   accomplished this in arid and unpredictable environmental                       conditions. Archaeologists wish to understand the political and                 social system which made this achievement possible. To date they                do not know the extent to which centralized political                           organization existed. While some reseachers believe that this                   level of development can take place in a relatively \"egalitarian\"               context, others believe that accomplishments of this kind are not               possible in such a situation. Ms. Metcalf's research should help                to answer this question.                                                                                                                                        This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of how complex societies arise. It will provide               data of interest to many archaeologists and shed new light on one               of the highpoints of Native American culture. It will also assist               in the training of a promising young scientist.",
