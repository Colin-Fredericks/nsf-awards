Applying first the instrument to advanced  ceramic studies, we will monitor the distribution of additives  during heating and cooling that determines the properties of the  final product.  In order to develop appropriate models, it is  essential to image during the early phase of sintering the  additive particles of nanometer size, and their distribution on  the surface of the ceramic powder.  Secondly, in our studies of  the morphology and yield of carbon nanotubes, it is essential to  examine the  carbonaceous deposits on the cathode of the  arcdischarge with the purpose of optimizing the processing  conditions for the production of a desired shape and size of the  carbon clusters.   A third project examines biomimetic composites  with the same architecture as natural materials such as bones and  teeth.  The study aims at the development of methods to grow  various minerals into a polymer matrix of the dimensional  characteristics of particle sizes, shapes and orientation that  resembles the natural material in the nanometer range.  A fourth  project investigates the scattering losses in planar waveguides  used in optical data storage devices through the use of  controlled crystal nucleation at the surfaces, detecting and  identifying thus scattering centers in the interior of these  materials.  Copper contamination on silicon wafers will be  studied as the fifth project area.  The deposits, once again in  the nanometer range, will be directly observed and identified  under various processing conditions.   Examining the copper  crystals and their associated substrate corrosion and dissolution  patterns will facilitate strategies that eliminate metal  contamination during chemical processing of semiconductor  devices.    The five projects will serve as examples for the wide range of  fundamental issues in which the availabi lity of the FE-SEM will  advance related materials research.  Additional projects will  rapidly join these five, taken from medical research,  biochemistry, biotechnology, geoscience, optical orders of  magnitudes smaller than before, is of vital issue, especially in  the early phases of related fundamental processes.  Areas of  technological interest will advance through the related research,  giving the acquisition of this powerful instrument a proper  justification in terms of industrial advances.  ***",
