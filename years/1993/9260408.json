The PI focuses on substituted                                                                                                    polyacetylene membranes, and notes that of this class PTMSP                                                                                                     (poly(trimethylhysilylpropyne): \u0131(C(CH3) = C(Si(CH3)3)n!) has                                                                                                   the highest permeability to most gases of any known polymer.                    However, its selectivity is very poor; for example its O2/N2                    selectivity is only 1.8.  The high permeability is due to the                                                                                                   stiff backbone, and to the fact that the attached                               trimethysilyl group is very bulky.  Both factors limit                          efficient packing of the polymer chains, resulting in a large                                                                                                   free volume which accounts for the permeability.  To improve                    the selectivity, the PI intends to reduce the free volume size                                                                                                  to increase the selectivity at the expense of some                              permeability.                                                                                                                                                   To decrease the free volume, this study will follow two                         strategies;  (a) The first is to develop thermal annealing                                                                                                      procedures which result in membranes in which the chains are                                                                                                    in a more relaxed state that promotes better packing and a                      lower free volume. (b) The second strategy is to copolymerize                                                                                                   high permeability low selectivity polymers with aryl                            substituted polyacetylenes that have high selectivity.  The                     idea is that the aryl groups should promote polymer chain                       cohesion, and that thermally annealed copolymers can be                         developed with the desired balance of values of permeability                                                                                                    and selectivity.",
