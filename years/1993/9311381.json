 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This proposal is for group travel                                 to the binational workshop on: \"Durability of                                   Concrete Structures\" to be held in                                              Bangalore, India, August 26-28.  Professors                                     D.V. Reddy of Florida Atlantic University and                                   V.S. Parameswaran, of the Indian Concrete                                       Institute and the Structural Engineering                                        Research Centre, Madras, are the principal                                      organizers.  The magnitude of the durability                                    problem is of considerable concern to the                                       developed and developing countries.  The                                        primary objective of this workshop is to                                        highlight the most recent advances in the U.S.                                  and India, with special focus on reinforced,                                    prestressed concrete composites.  Composites                                    may be fiber reinforced, ferrocement or polymer                                 concretes.                                                                                                                                                      Scope:  Interaction with Indian engineers                                       should be beneficial for U.S. engineers.  The                                   concrete industry is highly developed in India                                  and quite influential since they provide                                        considerable technical support to neighboring                                   countries.  This is an excellent opportunity                                    for the exchange of ideas and experience with                                   engineers at Indian universities and research                                   institutes.  The proceedings of the workshop                                    will be published.  The India Program                                           recommends travel and per diem support for six                                  U.S. researchers plus for the publication of                                    the workshop proceedings.",
