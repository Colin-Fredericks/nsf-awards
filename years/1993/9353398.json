 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Georgia will collaborate with the local                       State Systemic Initiative projects to enhance                                   interdisciplinary science in the middle school by developing                    leadership resource teams (consisting of 4 master teachers,                     their science supervisor, and two college scientists) from                      nine school districts in the Southeast.  These teams will                       participate in three summer leadership institutes which are                     designed to build teachers' science knowledge base and                          teaching, and which will focus on Science, Technology and                       Society (STS) issues that are relevant to the teachers'                         local communities.  These teams will also develop                               instructional modules linking concerns for STS to knowledge                     of the biological and physical world.                                                                                                                           This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because                    it is designed to prepare teams of Leader Teachers who will                     work with colleagues to bring interdisciplinary science to                      middle school students in their schools.
