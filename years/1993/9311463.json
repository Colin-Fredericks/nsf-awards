 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311463  Laca    Deciding where to search for food is fundamental for animals.   Because herbivores are selective while foraging, their  interaction with the plant community is spatially variable.   Foragers encounter vegetation with characteristics different from  the average for the whole community.  Removal of plant tissue and  other herbivore impacts are concentrated on some areas and light  on others.  The importance of vegetational heterogeneity depends  strictly upon the behavioral mechanisms animals exhibit in  response to heterogeneity.  Dr. Laca will test three behavioral  mechanisms that may be used by a large grazer to forage  efficiently in heterogeneous environments:  restriction of search  to areas where food has been recently encountered, learning of  food locations, and regulation of time spent feeding on food  patches.  The importance and rate of learning will be tested in  controlled food arenas.  Foraging efficiency is hypothesized to  be greater in heterogeneous environments because, by using  specialized and learned searching strategies, animals experience  a foraging environment better than average.  Large-scale patterns  of grazing behavior on natural plant communities will be related  to small-scale behavioral mechanisms.  Additionally, a literature  review will be conducted and a conceptual model of foraging  behavior on heterogeneous landscapes will be developed.    If animal performance is affected significantly by heterogeneity,  measures of spatial variability should allow better evaluation of  the nutritional value of habitats.  If heterogeneity is shown to  improve livestock performance, some pasture and rangeland  management practices may have to be reviewed, de-emphasizing  homogeneity as a goal.",
