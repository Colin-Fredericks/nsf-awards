 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303444 Fink We are the first group to identify a novel, 5S rRNA like sequence present in the genomes of sporulating bacteria like Bacillus species.  Analysis of the functional significance of this sequence may reveal a mechanism for transnational control of bacterial gene expression, which has not been examined in great detail.  We will use molecular genetic techniques to assess the functional significance of this sequence.  This work has the following three  objective: 1)          To examine the expression of the 5S rRNA like gene in B. subtilis cells.  We will use northern hybridization to detect the level of 5S rRNA like material present before and during sporulation.   h h #  2)       (  To determine the nucleotide sequence of the 5S rRNA like gene from B. Subtilis cells.  From a library of B. subtilis DNA, we will isolate a clone containing the 5S rRNA  like region and discern the nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA. 3) To identify the genetic location of the 5S rRNA like gene in B. subtilis and to study its biological significance.  We will map the gene by genetic crosses and attempt to delete this chromosomal region to study effects on the cell. %%% The results of this small grant for Exploratory Research may lead to a general model for transnational regulation in differentiating bacterial cells. ***",
