 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of two parallel and complementary sets of                 research studies.  In the first, three groups of teachers, one of               experienced physics teachers, a second of novice secondary school               science teachers, and a third of middle school math and science                 teachers, will be engaged in collaborative action research on                   their own practice.  In the second, a group of university                       researchers will be facilitating the teachers' research and                     investigating the ways in which they go about doing action                      research, as they generate and share knowledge in that process.                 The primary goals for the project are the improvement of practice               and the generation of knowledge of teaching, action research, and               teacher development.  These will be accomplished by the                         establishment of the action research network, the engagement of                 teachers in collaborative action research, and the research done                by the PI and staff on the teachers' research.",
