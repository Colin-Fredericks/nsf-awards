 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306523  Staub  The goal of this research planning grant is to describe the  endocrinological mechanisms underlying the normal expression of  male-like secondary sexual characteristics in females of several  species in the salamander genus Aneides.  The project tests the  hypothesis that the expression of these male-like traits in females  of several species of Aneides is a consequence of higher levels of  circulating plasma androgens or androgen receptors in target  tissues relative to females which lack these traits.  To accomplish  this, the following studies are planned: 1) documentation of the  secondary sexual characteristics of the jaw musculature of males  and females, 2) characterization of the androgen receptors in the  jaw musculature of males and females, and 3) determination of  levels of circulating plasma androgens and estrogens in males and  females.  Results will be analyzed in a phylogenetic framework with  the goal of understanding how endocrinological variation can  explain the dramatic morphological variation expressed within the  genus Aneides.    In some salamander species, females express male-like traits, such  as enlarged jaw musculature.  The goal of the proposed research is  to describe the hormonal basis of the expression of these traits in  females of several species in the salamander genus Aneides.  The  proposed project tests the hypothesis that the expression of these  male-like traits in females is a consequence of higher levels of  androgens (e.g. testosterone) or androgen receptors in the jaw  musculature relative to females which lack these traits.  The  proposed research 1) compares male and female jaw musculature, 2)  examines levels of androgen receptor binding in the jaw musculature  of males and females, and 3) surveys levels of circulating sex  hormones (androgens and estrogens) in males and females.  The  primary significance of the proposed project is that it will  provide information on the role of androgens in the development of  normal female  characteristics, a role that has remained relatively  unexplored.  ***",
