 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reproductive isolation is important for the maintenance                         of species as distinct entities.  Since reproductive                            isolation is often predominantly maintained through                             behavioral traits, it can be affected by changes in                             courtship patterns.  The period (per) gene of                                   Drosophila, because it is species-specific and                                  regulates an aspect of courtship song, provides an                              opportunity to examine change in a courtship behavior,                          as related not only to reproductive isolation but also                          amino acid and nucleotide level changes.  An ideal                              group in which to study these relationships is                                  Drosophila willistoni and its sibling or closely                                related species.  The group exhibits different degrees                          of reproductive isolation among its species,                                    semispecies and subspecies.  Specifically the project                           will examine; 1) the molecular variation in per and                             behavioral variation in courtship song for several                              populations of D. willistoni; 2) the variation in the                           gene locus and in song for the D. willistoni sibling                            species; 3) if there is evidence for reproductive                               character displacement among populations of D.                                  paulistorum living together vs those living isolated                            from each other and 4) relationships of the sibling                             species as determined by the per sequence.  This                                project should help explain the relationships of                                genetic variation, behavioral change, and reproductive                          isolation in the formation of species.",
