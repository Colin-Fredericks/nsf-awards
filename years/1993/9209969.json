 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the application of                               adaptive control techniques in the development and                              analysis of structures imbedded with                                            intelligent/smart materials.  For example, structures                           such as a cantilever beam embedded with a bulk                                  material having \"smart\" properties will be                                      considered; and, the distributed actuator such as                               current, voltage and/or applied magnetic field will                             be used to control the properties of the smart                                  material so as to control/suppress the vibrations.                              We propose to use an embedded distributed sensor                                in conjunction with embedded distributed actuators                              to achieve the total internal sensing and motion                                control tasks.  By this, the spillover phenomena                                associated with a \"truncated\" model due to                                      neglected modes can be minimized.  Possible                                     applications of this work are in the fields of                                  aeronautics, space and atomic energy development.                               Materials for use under severe environmental                                    conditions not only should have high reliability, but                           functions such as self-diagnosis, damage resistance,                            self-repair, or notification of residual life should be                         provided to avoid accidents.  The project will                                  consist of the following steps:  Modeling and                                   analysis comprising the development and                                         implementation of parameter estimation algorithms,                              development of control policies concerning passive                              and active control of structures and updating                                   periodically material characteristics (smartly) to                              adjust the controller parameters (for adaptive                                  control).  Some new and novel techniques in the                                 parameter estimation and adaptive control of                                    parameter-distributed system will be evolved on the                             basis of distributed actuators and sensors                                      measurements.",
