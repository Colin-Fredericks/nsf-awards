 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the travel of Dr. William Randle                of the University of Georgia to conduct cooperative research                    with Dr. Jane Elizabeth Lancaster of the newly instituted                       New Zealand Crown Research Institute for Crop and Food Research.                The research will investigate biochemical aspects of sulfur                     partitioning in the onion (Allium cepa). The presence of sulfur                 compounds in onions is of importance in determining flavor                      intensity. The research will describe how sulfur is                             differentially mobilized and partitioned among cultivars in a                   plant expending considerable energy in sulfur metabolism, will                  determine sulfur-compound accumulation in the flavor biosynthetic               pathway, and will describe the role of flavor enzymes in                        differential flavor intensity.                                                                                                                                  The project joins the complementary skills of Dr. Randle as a                   geneticist and plant breeder and those of Dr. Lancaster in the                  biochemistry and physiology of sulfur compounds. Since the                      principal investigators work in different hemispheres, two crops                of onions can be produced under natural photoperiods in a single                year. Travel by Dr. Lancaster to the University of Georgia will                 be funded through the New Zealand Ministry of Research, Science                 and Technology (MORST).",
