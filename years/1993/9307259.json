Molecular chlorine  is required because it only absorbs to a coverage of one  monolayer on these two surfaces. The critical qualities for the  laser induced thermal desorption are (a) uniformity across the  sample; (b) complete removal of all etching products; (c)  restoration of the surface to a clean well-ordered state.  These  characteristics will be sought through the use of sequences of  nanosecond laser pulses or single microsecond laser pulses rather  than the conventional nanosecond single pulse technique. The  monolayer peeling technique is critical to the development of  quantum well devices because, if successful, it would allow  etching to the exact interface between two thin semiconductor  layers such as GaAs and AlGaAs.  %%%  The goal of this study is to devise a method of etching GaAs(100)  and Si(100) at room temperature without surface damage and with  an ultra-precise atomic level control over etch depth. This  proposed technique of monolayer peeling is cyclic etching with  chlorine and laser induced thermal desorption. The monolayer  peeling technique is critical to the development of advanced  electronic and photonic devices and integrated circuits using  structures such as compound semiconductor quantum wells, because  it would provide the basis for a critical fabrication process,  etching to the exact interface between two ultra-thin  semiconductor layers such as GaAs and AlGaAs.",
