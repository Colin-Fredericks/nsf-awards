 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a career advancement award to enable the PI to acquire,                 through a sabbatical leave, modern techniques required to examine               the molecular biology of the crayfish calcium ion ATPase and                    factors that regulate expression of the gene during the molting                 cycle.  Preliminary work has employed a heterologous mammalian cDNA             probe to identify mRNA for the crayfish calcium ion ATPase.  The                objective of the present study is to generate tissue specific                   authentic cDNA clones of the crayfish calcium ion ATPase using                  strategies based on the polymerase chain reaction and on screening              a cDNA library.  The full length clone will be sequenced and                    compared to published mammalian sequences.  Partial clones will be              used to study expression of calcium ion ATPase in tissues of                    interest during the molting cycle using quantitative Northern                   blotting and Western analysis, and to examine possible regulation               of gene expression in vitro by the steroid ecdysone.  Findings will             further our understanding of the evolution of ion motive ATPases                and perhaps assist in understanding their form and function.                    Finally the steroidal regulation of calcium ion transfer is of                  significance for all animals that form mineralized tissues.                                                                                                     In living organisms the mineral calcium plays many important                    biological roles.  In animals it is crucial for the formation of                the skeleton.  This process is easily studied in crustaceans                    (crabs, lobsters, crayfish).  First their skeleton is external and              therefore far more accessible than that of vertebrates.  More                   importantly, in order to grow, they undergo the molting cycle.  In              preparation for molting, calcium is reabsorbed from the old                     skeleton and effectively recycled; at the same time a new soft                  skeleton is laid down underneath.  After \"busting out\" of the old               skeleton, the new skeleton is rapidly mineralized to provide                    protection.  Therefore at different stages in the molting cycle                 scientists can study the movement of calcium either into or out of              the skeleton.  This movement is effected by protein \"pumps\" on the              surface of specialized cells.  Manufacture of protein is under the              control of genetic material in the nucleus of the cell.  In this                grant appropriate genetic information that codes for the calcium                pump will be extracted to assess what regulates the abundance and               activity of the calcium pumps at different stages in the molting                cycle.",
