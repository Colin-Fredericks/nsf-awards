 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the Fifth International                 Conference on Arabidopsis Research to be held at the Ohio State                 University, Columbus, Ohio, on August 19-22, 1993.  The aim is to               provide an opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas on all                 aspects of Arabidopsis research, including genome-related efforts.              The conference will include sessions on embryo, vegetative and                  reproductive development, cell differentiation, phytohormone,s                  photobiology, metabolism, pathogen and strews interactions, gene                regulation, genome research, and new technologies.                                                                                                              This is the first international Arabidopsis conference to be held               since 1990 and the number of researcher using Arabidopsis as an                 experimental system has been growing at a tremendous rate.  Thus,               it is timely to hold this conference at this time.  The conference              is designed to maximize participation of young scientist and                    provide an opportunity for graduate students, postdoctoral                      students, and established investigators to exchange research                    results and ideas on the full range of topics that are being                    investigated in this important model system.",
