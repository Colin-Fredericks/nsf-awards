 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of the magnitudes of stresses in the earth's crust               is fundamental to a broad range of problems of lithospheric                     mechanics.  This is a project to make in situ stress measurements               to ~10 km depth in the KTB scientific drillhole in cooperation with             the University of Karlsruhe.  It has never before been possible to              measure in situ stress at nearly mid-crustal depth.  If such                    measurements are successful, it will provide the opportunity to                 test such fundamental concepts as the hypothesis that stress levels             in the brittle crust are in equilibrium with frictional strength                as defined by simple faulting theory and laboratory-determined                  values of the coefficient of friction.                                                                                                                               In a related collaboration with the University of Karlsruhe                (and Geoforschung Zentrum (GFZ), in Potsdam, Germany and the U.S.               Geological Survey), the Principal Investigator will implement a new             research program in eastern Europe to measure in situ stress                    orientation and heat flow (as well as other geophysical                         measurements) in boreholes in eastern Europe and the former Soviet              Union.  The basic idea of this research is to utilize a nearly-                 new (and nearly fully-outfitted) geophysical logging system                     acquired by GFZ for use in existing boreholes.  In situ stress                  orientation will be determined from detailed analysis of borehole               televiewer measurements.  Over time, these measurements will help               fill an extremely large gap in knowledge of stress orientations                 and relative magnitudes.  The U.S. Geological Survey will                       collaborate in this effort as will investigators from the countries             in which the holes are located.",
