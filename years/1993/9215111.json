 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to derive properties of solutions of two                classes of partial differential equations that arise in models                  for the time-dependent behavior of viscoelastic model materials.                The first part deals with linear integrodifferential equations                  that describe materials with long-term memory and their                         solutions.  A goal is to give a detailed description of the                     smoothness of solutions depending on the data.  The methods to be               employed involve various transformation and transfer techniques                 that allow use of known properties of simpler, related problems.                As a result, a better understanding of theoretical models and                   improved insight into the behavior of computational methods will                is expected.                                                                                                                                                         Work will also be done investigating a class of nonlinear                  partial differential equations describing model materials with                  internal friction.  The goal is to construct generalized                        solutions that obey the basic physical principle that matter                    cannot penetrate itself and to analyze their structure.                         Techniques that have been successful for other classes of                       nonlinear partial differential equations, such as a priori                      estimates, are to be employed.  As a result, improved                           understanding of certain classes of models in continuum mechanics               and more generally of solutions of partial differential equations               that are to describe one-to-one mappings should result.",
