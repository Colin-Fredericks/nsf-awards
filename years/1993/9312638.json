 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312638  Williams       This proposal requests funds to create a statewide data  network linking Kentucky's public four year institutions to  SURAnet which is the NSF midlevel network that serves the  southeastern United States.  This new statewide network  connecting Eastern Kentucky University, Kentucky State  University, Morehead State University, Murray State University,  Northern Kentucky University, Princeton Research, University of  Louisville, and Western Kentucky University to SURAnet through  the University of Kentucky is designed to provided access to  111,737 students and 5,625 faculty.  The Kentucky Educational  Network (KECnet), a formal consortium, will provide the  governance structure to insure that all institutions are fairly  represented and the necessary steps are taken to meet all of the  connectivity needs of Kentucky's higher education community.       SURAnet will provide operations management and information  services and it will give the universities and colleges a  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second) National Backbone network.       Each of the universities has provided a description of its  organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet access  that it expects including: greater functionality and network  speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make  file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable  mail system.  Both students and faculty research will benefit  from the network which is a unique opportunity for the schools to  explore innovative and educational resources.    ***",
