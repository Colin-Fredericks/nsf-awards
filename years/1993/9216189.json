 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is the investigation of the origin             and transport properties of coherent structures in the planetary                boundary layer (PBL) using transient development theory.  Previous              theoretical work on this topic has been limited to the                          investigation of the modal instabilities and these studies confirm              that coherent structures in the form of rolls, often revealed as                cloud streets, are produced most efficiently under convectively                 unstable conditions.  Recent work on transient non-modal                        development of unstratified laboratory flows demonstrates that                  coherent structures develop robustly in flows possessing no modal               instabilities.  In this project, transient development theory will              be applied for the first time to convectively stable and unstable               viscous shear flows.  The initial disturbances that lead to the                 largest energy growth will be determined through the employment of              a variational method.  The structure and evolution of these                     disturbances will be studied, along with their dependence on the                Richardson, Reynolds, and Prandtl number.  Transport properties                 associated with the second order exchange process will also be                  studied.  Because the structures evolve in time, the second order               correlations will be obtained as mean quantities over the life                  cycle of the dominant perturbations from initial growth to ultimate             decay.                                                                                                                                                               This study addresses issues important to further progress in               understanding tracer transport, air-sea interaction, organization               of cloud streets, and parameterization of heat and momentum in NWP              and climate models.",
