 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308879  Carter  The  objective of this project is to develop a novel  programming  environment for distributed memory multiprocessors that  provides  efficient  support  for  both  the  data  shipping  and  function  shipping   programming  paradigms.  This   is   accomplished   by  integrating  a  distributed  shared memory  (DSM)  system,  which  provides transparent data shipping, with a remote procedure  call  (RPC) system, which supports distributed function shipping.  This  integration   addresses  the  most  serious  problems   of   both  paradigms.  DSM enables processes to share data across processors  that  only  communicate via message passing, but experience  with  the  Munin  DSM system indicates that it is often inefficient  to  require   all  communications  to  occur  through  shared   data.  Conversely, in conventional RPC systems, it is difficult to  pass  complex  data  structures  that use  arbitrary  pointers  because  clients  and servers reside within distinct address spaces.  This  seriously  restricts the programming model. Supporting  a  shared  address  space allows arbitrarily complex data structures  to  be  passed as part of an RPC,. Preliminary results indicate that  the  combination  of  data  and  function shipping  can  significantly  improve the performance of DSM and improve the programmability of  RPC.   The  project  also  involves  the  development  of  simple  performance monitoring and visualization tools to ease  the  task  of programming such a system.  ***",
