In Meyerowitz' laboratory at the                California Institute of Technology she will isolate and                         characterize \"floral genes\" from planet species identified by                   phylogentic analyses of morphological and DNA characters as                     important to understanding angiosperm origins.  These include the               gymnosperm Gnetales and paleoherbaceous angiosperms (water lies,                monocots and Piperales).  Heterologous gene isolation strategies,               successful for isolating homologues from divergent dicots and                   monocots, will be used to obtain \"similogues\" from Gnetales and                 paleoherbs.  Expression studies on developing reproductive                      materials, combined with phylogentic analyses of coding sequences,              will then be performed to determine molecular homologies for each               key gene or class of genes.  Among hypotheses to be tested are                  homology of Gnetalean reproductive structures will specific                     angiosperm whorls and the history underlying perianth absence in                Piperales.                                                                                                                                                      Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching               undergraduate and graduate seminar courses and sponsorship of                   visiting speakers.  Speakers will interact formally and informally              with students and faculty.  Invitees include researchers using                  interdisciplinary approaches to various biological questions and                professionals in the fields of science education and science                    writing.                                                                                                                                                        This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
