 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310137  Dunnell    Under the direction of Dr. Robert Dunnell, Ms. Diana Greenlee will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Her research focusses  on the period between AD 400 - 1650 in the central and upper Ohio  River Valley and she will analyze skeletal material from a series  of relevant sites. During this interval settlement in the region  changed from dispersed to nucleated with the establishment of  clearly defined villages. Ms. Greenlee wishes to understand the  reasons for this and postulates that a shift to maize cultivation  and a reliance on this staple resulted in a subsistence adaptation  which permitted population aggregation. She will examine this  hypothesis through utilization of bone chemistry. Foods vary in  composition and some leave chemical signatures in the bones of  consumers. Extensive research has shown that maize has a ratio of  carbon isotopes which is different from almost all naturally  occurring plant foods in the Midwest region. Through analysis  therefore of this ratio in a series of skeletal remains which span  the AD 400 - 1650 time interval it will be possible to determine  if, when, and to what degree reliance on this cultigen increased.  Through analysis of elements such as strongium it is also possible  to estimate the amount of meat in the diet.    Many archaeologists have noted the pattern towards nucleated  settlement which developed over time both in the Midwest as well as  in other parts of the world. This change is associated with the  development of social complexity and extensive and centrally  organized political systems. However the processes responsible for  this change are still not well understood. Archaeologists believe  that changes in diet and subsistence strategy may, in large part be  responsible and Ms. Greenlee will focus directly on this question.    This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new  light on the prehistory of the United States and Native Americans.  It will increase our understanding of how soci al complexity  developed and will assist in the training of a promising young  scientist.  ***",
