All  of these fields interrelate, sometimes in remarkable and  surprising ways that have led to striking and unexpected  discoveries with physical implications. One such discovery was  verified last year in a microgravity fluid mechanics experiment  carried out aboard an orbiting NASA Space Shuttle flight. This  experiment and also many other such activities arose largely from  the pioneering work of Prof. Robert Finn, to whom the conference  is dedicated. We anticipate that the proposed conference will set  the stage for new scientific advances of both mathematical and  practical physical significance. An important part of our  objective is to encourage graduate students to participate in the  meeting; we hope thus to spark their active interest in the many  new and exciting discoveries that are now being made or waiting  to be made.",
