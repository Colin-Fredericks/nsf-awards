 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the                 assembly of the spore coat that surrounds and protects dormant                  spores of Bacillus subtilis.  The investigator has                              assembled new evidence that oxidative crosslinking of tyrosine                  residues in the spore coat is a significant element of the process              of spore coat morphogenesis.  Also, the lab has identified                      potential substrates for crosslinking among previously cloned genes             known to code for proteins comprising the spore coat, and has                   preliminary evidence that another spore coat protein, CotE, has                 predicted structural elements which suggest that it might be the                enzyme responsible for carrying out this modification in vivo.                  CotE, expressed in E. coli, possesses the predicted ability to bind             heme , consistent with its proposed function as a peroxidase in                 vivo.  The specific goals are to:   1.Quantify the amount of                    crosslinked tyrosine present in wild type B. Subtilis as a function             of time during spore formation and intracellular location.                      2. Verify biochemically that CotE is competent to carry out the                 proposed crosslinking function.                                                 3. Mutationally inactivate CotE and correlate changes in spore coat             structure with changes in CotE function to confirm its role in                  spore coat assembly and modification.                                           %%%                                                                             Certain bacteria are capable of surviving extreme conditions of                 heat and cold by producing spores.  The coat proteins of these                  organisms are chemically modified to adapt to environmental                     stresses.  This research will study the enzyme that is responsible              for the modification as well as the target protein that it                      modifies.  This research could lead to the production of new                    biomaterials with altered properties which would be useful in                   extreme environments.",
