The University is committed to providing  the remaining funds needed for the acquisition.       The electron microprobe provides quantitative elemental  microanalysis with a spatial resolution of one micrometer. The  capabilities of the microprobe are used by geoscience students and  senior research scientists in the fields of igneous and metamorphic  petrology, as well as for studies in geomorphology and  paleontology. The microprobe lab is also used in a variety of  studies by archeologists, astronomers (studying meteorites) and  biologists (studying hard parts) at the University of Washington.  The digital imaging system will greatly facilitate all of their  studies by enhancing the ability to view the spatial distribution  of elements with respect to sample morphology, and by quantifying  the size, shape, amount and distribution of selected sample  components from digitized images.  ***",
