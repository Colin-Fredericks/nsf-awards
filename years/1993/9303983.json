 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303983  Block       The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)  will conduct a project that will provide guidelines for those  educators who desire to improve the match of their mathematics  graduate students (master's and doctoral) to the needs of  business, industry, and government by characterizing both the  uses and users of mathematics in those sectors by identifying the  skills and attributes possessed by successful practitioners of  nonacademic mathematics, by communicating this information to  employers and educators, and by initiating and promoting reform  in education for those master's and doctoral students bound for  careers in industrial mathematics.  Data from surveys and  interviews of selected graduates, their employers, and their  faculty will be analyzed and appropriate recommendations and  guidelines developed.       The objectives of the project are to (1) characterize the  demand for individuals with training in the mathematical sciences  at the master's and doctoral levels and the ways in which  training is utilized in industry; (2) characterize the skills and  attributes possessed by successful practitioners of nonacademic  mathematics as well as any perceived weaknesses of current  mathematics graduates; (3) formulate guidelines for educators who  desire to improve the match of mathematics graduate students to  the needs of industry; (4) create a continuing process to monitor  the progress of mathematics graduates in industry and to  disseminate this information to educators; (5) initiate  activities to increase among industry managers understanding of  how mathematical and computational analysis can be used  effectively to improve product design, manufacturing processes,  and other industrial functions; and (6) assess the value of  mathematics as perceived by influential managers in a cross-  section of U.S. industries.  The project consists of three tasks:  (1) a written survey with telephone follow-up of recent  mathematics graduates and their employers  and relevant faculty;  (2) site visits to industrial organizations and federal  laboratories; and (3) a survey of decision makers in industry  about the current and potential future value of mathematics to  industry.",
