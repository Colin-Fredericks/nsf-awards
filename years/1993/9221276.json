The objective of this project is to develop methods to  automatically represent text-based documents from a large  collection in a way which facilitates semantically precise  retrieval.  A critical problem in representing documents is that  words in the documents are not accurate descriptors of document  content.  This is in part due to the polysemy of natural language:  A single concept can be described in many different ways.  Most  current approaches fail to account for this, as they determine  semantic relevance using co-occurrence of words in documents.  The  approach is to index documents so that they are representationally  similar when they are semantically related, not just when they  coincidentally share terms.  Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and  Neural Network theory are foundations of the work.  This approach  is demonstrated to be similar to the best current technique for  statistical semantic analysis of documents: Latent Semantic  Indexing (LSI).  The work suggests a generalization of LSI, a  linear and metric technique, to non-linear and non-metric  techniques.  This work is expected to provide a well-founded  theoretical framework for document indexing based on MDS, to  advance the use of neural network techniques in document indexing,  and to help in the quantitative evaluation of current document  retrieval methods.   ***",
