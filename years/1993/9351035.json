 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fast-paced world of rapid-fire TV commercials, action                       movies and dynamic video games does not prepare college                         students for sitting in a statistics lecture and absorbing the                  material presented on a subject that seems remote and                           difficult. Yet, quantitative reasoning skills are essential if                  these students are to be capable of filling the jobs necessary                  to keep America competitive in the world economy and of making                  crucial decisions on issues affecting societal advancement.                     Traditional statistics courses do not build on the interests                    and culture of the students to get them actively involved in                    the learning of the subject. This project is revising, through                  creative use of technology, the content, conduct and quality of                 introductory statistics courses so as to improve the                            quantitative reasoning skills of all undergraduates. This is                    being accomplished through a series of computerized units that                  allow students to \"discover\" basic concepts of statistics while                 engaged in hands-on activities at a computer work station. Such                 an exploratory, discovery-based approach to learning statistics                 requires that the course be taught with a computer laboratory.",
