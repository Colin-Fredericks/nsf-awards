The ocean             is an important source and sink for atmospheric Hg, and plays a                 significant role in the global Hg cycle. Knowledge of the behavior              and fate of Hg in the marine environment is hindered by the lack of             information on the distribution and speciation of Hg in open ocean              regions. The Intergovernment Oceanographic Commission (IOC)                     Baseline Trace Metal cruise aboard the C.S.S. Hudson in June/July               1993 will provide essential data, as well as the supporting                     chemical and physical oceanographic program, to complement and                  extend previous oceanic studies of Hg, particularly those in the                productive equatorial Pacific Ocean. Shipboard analyses will be                 made for reactive Hg, and dissolved gaseous species (Hg degree and              dimethylHg).  Post cruise analyses will be conducted for total Hg,              participate Hg, and for monomethylHg.  The research will focus on               the distribution of methylated Hg species and elemental Hg in an                effort to ascertain the principal sources and sinks for these                   compounds in the surface and deep ocean. The data obtained will                 allow the testing of current hypotheses concerning the sources and              fate of Hg species in open ocean waters, and will broaden the                   understanding of the role of the ocean in the global Hg cycle.",
