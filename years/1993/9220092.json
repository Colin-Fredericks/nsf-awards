 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed work is to gain a detailed understanding               of the biochemical processes by which a product from the ovary                  initiates sex pheromone production in the common housefly. The                  housefly sex pheromone is a chemical attractant produced by the                 female to attract males for mating. A better understanding of sex               pheromone production is needed to take advantage of this essential              form of chemical communication in insects. The regulation of sex                pheromone production in insects occurs via a brain factor in                    Lepidoptera, by juvenile hormones in cockroaches and beetles and by             ecdysteroids in the housefly and perhaps in other Diptera. In none              of these systems is it clearly understood which enzyme activities               are affected to control sex pheromone production. The work proposed             here is designed to gain a clear understanding of the enzymes                   influenced by ecdysone which result in sex pheromone production and             to provide the basic information necessary to develop insect                    control strategies based on inhibiting sex pheromone production.",
