 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three and one half year program to enhance                    the teaching of 75 secondary biology teachers from six                          counties in the state of New York.  This will be                                accomplished via three, three week, summer institutes to be                     held at Elmira College and by follow-up support services                        offered during the following academic years.                                                                                                                    The program will emphasize an experimental,                                     multidisciplinary, hands-on approach to the teaching of                         secondary biology; cooperative learning will also be                            employed.  Four content areas will be covered in each summer                    institute, including biochemistry, human physiology,                            molecular biology and immunology.  The primary objectives of                    the program include curriculum enhancement and tie-in to                        other scientific disciplines, development of a more                             experimental outlook on biology, and increased creativity                       skills.                                                                         Project staff will monitor implementation progress during                       the academic year and will be available to assist                               participants in this phase of the project.                                                                                                                      Cost sharing equals 17.7% of the NSF award.",
