 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colorado College proposes to strengthen offerings in a new                      interdisciplinary environmental science program by adding an                    inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (ICP) to the current                    equipment used to teach environmental courses in the chemistry,                 geology, economics, and biology departments. Faculty in a                       variety of departments have created new courses and improved                    existing courses to meet student demand for environmental                       science education. The next step in providing a substantive                     curriculum for these students is to strengthen the quantitative                 analysis components of environmental course offerings. The                      proposed ICP, because of its multicomponent analysis                            capabilities, is particularly effective for involving students                  in developing and evaluating various alternative models,as well                 as providing quantitative data. The ICP will be used by                         students in environmental courses in chemistry, biology,                        geology, and economics to analyze air and water for elemental                   pollutants, and plants and soils for nutrients and toxic                        metals, as well as investigate the bioaccumulation of heavy                     metals in food webs.Colorado College faculty believe strongly                   that the sciences should be taught as a laboratory or field                     experience in which models and theories are created to explain                  observations, and that the best laboratory teaching experiences                 contain a significant component of original research that                       allows students to become involved in the practice of science.                  Not only are students prepared for possible teaching, graduate,                 or industrial work, but non-science majors are exposed to the                   processes by which scientists arrive at the conclusions that                    impact all of our lives.  Based on past experiences with other                  instruments at Colorado College we expect the ICP to further                    enhance the interaction between departments, both within the                    natural sciences and across to the social sciences.",
