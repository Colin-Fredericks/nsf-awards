The symposium participants will address and discuss             the origin and composition of Andean montane plant diversity, and               the conservation and sustainable use of these forests.  A symposium             synthesis of peer-reviewed papers will comprise a \"state of the                 Andes\" report.  Latin American participants will represent                      institutions and research in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina,              Costa Rica, Ecuador, Bolivia and Mexico.  Because of the number of              Latin American botanists involved, the symposium will be a major                impetus for assessing the state of knowledge of biodiversity and                conservation research in Latin America and for promoting these                  activities. New York is also a logical venue for such a                         symposium, given the history of the Andean botanical collections                and research activity at the New York Botanical Garden, and the                 opportunity provided the Latin American botanists to acquaint                   themselves with and study these collections first hand.  NYBG will              organize the symposium and assemble the final symposium report.                 %%%                                                                             Much of the biodiversity of the Andean montane forests are                      threatened by human activity.  This award will support the                      participation of 22 Latin American botanists and ecologists in a                symposium at the New York Botanical Garden on \"Neotropical Montane              Forests: Biodiversity and Conservation\".  New York Botanical Garden             has a long history of Andean botanical collecting and research                  activity.  The symposium participants will treat the origin and                 composition of Andean montane plant diversity, and the conservation             and sustainable use of these forests.  A symposium synthesis of                 peer-reviewed papers will comprise a \"state of the Andes\" report.               Latin American participants will represent institutions and                     research in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina, Costa Rica,                   Ecuador, Bolivia and Mexico. As such, the symposium will be a major             impetus for assessing the state of knowledge of biodiversity and                conservation research in Latin America and for promoting these                  activities.",
