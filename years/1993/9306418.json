 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306418  Kutter  The bacteriophage T4 laboratory at The Evergreen State College  (Olympia, WA) is continuing studies on the transition from host to  phage metabolism (host takeover).  The laboratory has focussed for  many years on the function of the phage T4 alc gene, which shifts  transcription from cytosine-containing bacterial DNA to T4 DNA  containing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.  They have now cloned alc gene,  which was possible only in an expression vector designed for very  lethal genes.  Experiments with purified Alc confirm that it  interacts with the host RNA polymerase (RNAP) and stops transcript  elongation, and it can cause release at specific, complex sites.   They propose further studies on the action of Alc.  The Alc protein  has an interesting basic domain whose role will be studied by means  of mutant analysis, partial proteolytic digestion, and antibodies  directed against specific domains.  The laboratory has also been  completing the T4 genomic map and sequence integration, and they  have been studying the process of host takeover more globally,  including sequencing a 12-kbp region of the t4 genome that includes  many new genes that are probably involved.  They will clone and  study the effects of some of these new genes, as well as the  previously identified genes controlling nuclear disruption and  internal proteins, and a region of the genome they have  characterized that controls stimulation of, and changes in lipid  metabolism.  They plan to particularly focus on identifying T4  genes that stop host translation, using the genomic sequence data  they have assembled; they will study new T4-encoded ribosome-  binding proteins and identify other translation effects upon  induction of cloned new genes.  They also will also look for T4  factors that modify host factors, inactivate host messenger RNA ,  or release nascent host protein from the ribosomes.  %%%  These studies are of general interest in modeling a wide range of  mechanisms viruses may use in subverting host cells  to virus  multiplication and in analyzing lethal genes.  A number of  undergraduate students will also have the opportunity to take part  in a stimulating research problem.  ***",
