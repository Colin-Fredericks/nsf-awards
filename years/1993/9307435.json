 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Bruce Dahlin and                 Anthony Andrews will conduct exploratory archaeological research at             the site of Chunchucmil which is located in the Yucatan region of               Mexico. Although preliminary work has been done at this site which              consists of a cluster of Mayan ruins, relatively little is known                about it or the surrounding hinterland. It is even unclear exactly              when it was inhabited and whether occupation was continuous or                  episodic. Preliminary work by Dahlin based on aerial photographs                suggests it supported a large population. In this, the first stage              of a longer planned study, Drs. Dahlin and Andrews will conduct a               feasibility study. They will carry out a preliminary examination of             the site to determine the best way to map it. They will also                    undertake a preliminary reconnaissance of the surrounding region to             determine the types and densities of smaller sites and decide how               best to design a regional survey. Some areas, such as the                       associated lowland coastal swamps are difficult to access and                   consequently very poorly known. On the basis of the results of this             one season of field research, a larger long term project will be                designed.                                                                                                                                                       The Mayans built cities with massive public architecture in regions             which today support very low human populations. Based on the                    archaeological evidence, prehistoric densities were likely much                 higher than their modern counterparts and archaeologists wish to                understand the subsistence strategies these ancient Mayans                      employed. Preliminary analysis indicates that the Chunchucmil                   region lacked the carrying capacity to support the prehistoric                  population if one relied on local agricultural production alone.                Dahlin wishes to reconstruct prehistoric population densities                   determine the production potential of this environment and finally              try to understand the subsistence strategies employed.                                                                                                          This project is important for several reasons. It will increase our             understanding of prehistoric Mayan civilization. It will also                   hopefully yield information useful for the present day utilization              of environments of this type.",
