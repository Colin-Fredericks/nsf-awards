 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knauft/Maggi  9307296    The Kalasha of northwestern Pakistan consider the menstrual house to be the most impure place in the valley.  Yet this very institution seems to empower Kalasha women, offering them an opportunity to define themselves in ways which seem to directly oppose dominant ideologies.  The proposed research explores this tension by examining the way in which gender is constructed and used in three distinct arenas:  community ritual practice, the everyday world of house and family, and the bashali, or menstrual house.  Through carefully tracing individual women as they move through these social contexts, the investigator will evaluate the thesis that gendered meanings and practices vary systematically across social arenas.  I hypothesize that male insistence on female impurity and its entailments in female subordinate practice will be most emphasized in community ritual practice, less evident in village and household relations, and strongly countered with female-centric ideology and expressions of women's power and autonomy in the menstrual house.  This contextual variation calls into question monolithic attributions  of \"female status\" or \"identity\" and provides for a more complex and penetrating understanding of how women's experiences are constituted.    The proposed project will contribute significantly to a more balanced ethnographic understanding of the Hindu Kush cultural region, will apply and refine sociocultural theories of gender, and will provide detailed ethnographic information on the menstrual house, and institution which has been much fantasized about but not carefully studied.  ***    Q  QcS S S S T TzUsW     ~                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \u00d5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              !         !         !
