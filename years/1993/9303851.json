 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303851  Slingerland       This study will investigate the processes of avulsion, i.e.,  the permanent diversion of flow away from an existing river  channel, and the role of avulsion in the evolution of river  floodplains and alluvial sedimentary deposits.  The approach will  be collaborative, focusing on mathematical modelling experiments,  and modern and near-modern river floodplains.  The project will  attempt to address such questions as the causes of avulsion, the  processes by which avulsions initiate and propagate through flood  basins, the manner in which floodplains subsequently react to  avulsion, and the effects of avulsion on the character of  floodplain deposits.       Because avulsion is an inevitable consequence of floodplain  aggradation, it may play a vital, and heretofore underappreciated,  role int he evolution of alluvial sedimentary sequences because it  is likely to be a major process of deposition instead of merely a  mechanism by which old channels are abandoned and new ones formed.   When properly understood, avulsions may require modifications in  the way we view the origin and role of meander belts, the relative  importance of avulsive vs overbank flooding, and the manners in  which floodplain deposits are generated.",
