 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skeletal muscle is not only important in animal locomotion, but                 also constitutes a major metabolic store of  protein that can be                quickly mobilized when dietary intake is insufficient to meet an                animal's nutritional needs. In addition, muscle atrophy can be                  induced by disuse, nerve injury, and disease. In some disuse,                   such as muscular dystrophy, wasting is so severe that individual                dies.                                                                                                                                                           The intracellular regulation of protein breakdown in any animal                 poorly understood. The crustacean claw muscle  provides a                       favorable model system for elucidating proteolytic mechanisms.                  During each intermolt cycle, the claw muscle  undergoes a                       sequential atrophy and restoration, in which protein content                    decreases 40% during the premolt period and is resynthesized                    following molt. Atrophy apparently facilitates withdrawal of the                pair of large claws at the time the shell is shed. Protein                      degradation appears to be mediated by five enzymes: four calcium-               dependent proteinases (CDPs) and a multicatalytic proteinase                    (MCP). The enzymes are active a neutral pH and degrade the                      contractile proteins of muscle.                                                                                                                                 This proposal examines the regulation of intracellular                          proteolysis in a muscle that resembles, both morphologically and                biochemically, vertebrate skeletal muscle. Biochemical and                      molecular biological techniques are used to isolate and                         characterize two proteinases. These studies will yield new and                  basic information on the regulation of proteolytic processes                    common to all animal cells.",
