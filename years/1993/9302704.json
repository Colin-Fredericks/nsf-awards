 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302704  Sachs       The investigator models chromosome aberrations in live  mammalian cells, emphasizing implications for large-scale  chromosome geometry and for the biology of ionizing radiation  damage.  The study entails developing computer algorithms,  explicitly solving stochastic process models, and collaborating  with various experimental groups.  Production of chromosome  damage (for example, illegitimate recombinations, involving the  exchange of fragments between two different chromosomes) after  induction of DNA double strand breaks during the interphase part  of the cell cycle is analyzed, using probabilistic models for DNA  geometry, motion, and reactions at the macromolecular level, in  particular polymer models for large-scale chromosome structure  and motion.       Comparisons of the effects of densely ionizing radiation to  those of sparsely ionizing radiation, relevant to chromosome  geometry and to biological dosimetry, are made.  Statistical  questions that arise when very detailed experimental information  about specific individual chromosomes is made available by modern  fluorescent labeling techniques are answered by extending already  developed Monte-Carlo simulations based on previously analyzed  biological models.       Understanding how ionizing radiation damages chromosomes is  important in understanding cancer induction by  radiation, understanding how to cope with radiation accidents or  waste, and improving tumor radiotherapy.  Such understanding  requires geometric information about the chromosomes in a live  human cell; conversely, information about radiation damage  contributes to understanding chromosome geometry, which is of  fundamental biological importance.  While much effort has been  devoted to sequencing the DNA in chromosomes and to modeling  local geometry of chromosomes, quantitative geometric models of  the larger scales of main interest in analyzing radiation  produced chromosome aberrations are just now being developed, by  the principal investig ator and others.  The project combines  standard information on the physics of ionizing radiation with  these new biological models of chromosome geometry to analyze how  the damage is formed. In particular, preliminary mathematical  investigations and a literature search show that, due to  geometric effects, densely ionizing radiations, such as alpha  particles from radon daughters, make a larger fraction of certain  specific kinds of damage (e.g. centric chromosome rings) than  other kinds of chromosome damaging agents, including sparsely  ionizing radiations such as x-rays. This \"signature\" of densely  ionizing radiations should help in realistic assessments of  radiation hazards and will help in understanding chromosome  geometry.  ***",
