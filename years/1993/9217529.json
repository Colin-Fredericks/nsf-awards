 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the travel of U.S. advanced graduate                    students and postdoctoral researchers to a U.S.-Sweden workshop                 to be held in conjunction with a special year (1993) in                         mathematical physics at the Mittlag-Leffler Institute, Djursholm,               Sweden. The workshop will concentrate on three main topics in                   mathematical physics:  quantum mechanical many-body problem;                    problems arising in solid state physics; and asymptotic methods.                Peter D. Hislop of the University of Kentucky and Anders Melin of               the Lund Institute of Technology in Sweden will jointly organize                the workshop seminars.  The young American researchers will be                  able to attend the workshop for a period of two months each and                 will be joined by a cohort of Swedish advanced graduate students                and postdoctoral researchers.  Prominent American, Swedish and                  European mathematicians, who have contributed significantly to the              field, will participate in the workshop seminars, thereby providing             a unique opportunity for young researchers to advance their                     understanding of current research themes and develop their                      research and future collaborations.",
