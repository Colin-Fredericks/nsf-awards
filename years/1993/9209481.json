The organization of STEDT is by semantic                  fields, so as ultimately to constitute a thesaurus of the                       proto-lexicon.                                                                       The Sino-Tibetan (ST)languages (typically monosyllabic and                 tonal) are of unusual cultural importance and theoretical                       interest.  Lexical data, of uneven quality, is now available for                hundreds of TB languages and dialects.  This project has already                created a vast quality-controlled database of historically                      significant lexical material, incorporating some 200 published                  and unpublished sources (some solicited by questionnaire), now                  totalling over 130,000 records and occupying over 60 megabytes of               disk space.  Priority has been given to the profusion of new                    information furnished by Chinese and Indian linguists.  To this                 Lexical Database is joined an Etymological Database, where all                  etymologies previously proposed for any taxonomic level of ST or                its subgroups are collatable for analysis and evaluation.  Yet                  most of the reconstructed roots in this database are quite new,                 and have only been attainable because of the massive amount of                  data brought together by this project.  The first semantic area                 to be covered now comprises close to 1000 roots and root                        variants, to be included in the first volume of STEDT, Bodypart                 Nomenclature, which will come to roughly one thousand pages.                    Production of subsequent volumes will proceed at an accelerated                 rate during the new grant period.                                                    The STEDT will constitute the most comprehensive and                       accurate documentation of the Sino-Tibetan language family ever                 produced, and will be an important resource for historical                      linguistic research and theories of language change in general.",
