 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for American Politics and Public Policy at the                       University of California, Los Angeles, has an outstanding group of              scholars working on issues of race, ethnicity, and politics.  This              Graduate Research Traineeship in Minority Politics will attract and             train a cadre of graduate students interested in the study of                   minority politics.  The Graduate students will have opportunities               to work on projects involving public opinion and political                      participation, urban poverty, and the role of minority elected and              administative officials in local and national public policy.                                                                                                    These traineeships will enhance the educational experience of                   students by permitting them undistracted time and energy to attend              to the rigorous coursework and research required by this                        challenging field of inquiry.  The goal of this award is to attract             intellectually diverse and multiply-equipped students, with special             attention to minorities, women, and others who have been under-                 represented.",
