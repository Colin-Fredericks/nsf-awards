 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224384  Byrd       Precipitation from winter storms in the form of snow and  freezing rain are among the most disruptive of meteorological  phenomena.  Under a previous award, the Principal Investigators  have used observational data and a numerical model to study the  extremely heavy snowfalls that occur on the lee side of the Great  Lakes.  Accomplishments have included identifying critical boundary  layer and atmospheric parameters that are conducive to producing  locally heavy snowfalls.       The Principal Investigators in cooperation with the National  Weather Service will continue this research.  Planned activities  include developing a more sophisticated numerical model and  expansion of their investigations to include the local influence of  the Great Lakes on cyclonic winter storms.  Research objectives  include:       1.  Documenting the spatial and temporal variability of  meteorological fields within and upwind of lake-effect snow  regions, focussing on the role of boundary layer stability, depth,  moisture and wind shear in modulating these disturbances;       2.  Investigating the role of dynamical forcing mechanisms in  the formation and maintenance of mesoscale lake-effect snow bands  and mesoscale precipitation structures associated with winter  season wave cyclones of the Great Lakes region;       3.  Studying the effect of multiple-lake interactions on the  formation and maintenance of lake-effect snow bands;       4.  Investigating the effects of orography on the distribution  and behavior of lake-effect snow bands;       5.  Determining the importance of the Great Lakes and the  surrounding topography in the distribution and behavior of  mesoscale precipitation features associated with winter season  cyclones in the Great Lakes region.  ***",
