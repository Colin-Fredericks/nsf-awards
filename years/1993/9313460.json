 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313460  Glander  The Duke University Primate Center, built in 1968, houses the largest and most diverse   collection of prosimian primates in the world as well as the largest number of endangered   primates.  Many of the species housed at this center have thrived only at this facility.    Therefore, this center operates as a research resource providing observational   opportunities, cadavers of animals that expire at the end of their life-spans, and tissue and   blood samples to scientists on a local, regional, national, and international level.  In-house   research is also conducted by faculty, staff members, visiting scientists, students, and post-  doctoral fellows.  Prosimians are important to primatology because they are \"living   fossils\".  They are the first primates to appear in the fossil record and provide clues about   the earth's past environment.  This award to Duke University will allow for the renovation   of 86 enclosed outdoor runs at this primate center.  This renovation will allow the facility   to meet current university and USDA code requirements.  The renovation to be   undertaken will also dramatically and positively impact the quality and quantity of research   and training opportunities by providing a safe and reliable environment for the animals.    Finally, the renovations will increase opportunities for scientists and facilitate the   implementation of an educational outreach program to area K-12 school children.   ***",
