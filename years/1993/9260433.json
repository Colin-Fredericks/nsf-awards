 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the development of a technique for                   obtaining three-dimensional range images in real-time with                      accuracies of the order of 0.001.  Range image refers to an image               where the value of each pixel in the image represents the distance              from the camera's focal point to the corresponding point in the                 scene.  In this mode, each pixel becomes a timer which measures the             time from the start of the frame until the scanning plane of light              crosses the pixel.  This timing information is readily converted                to distance information.  Thus, the procedure used is                           computationally simple.  The research includes development of the               software, calibration and evaluation of the measurement system, and             demonstration of the feasibility of close-in, high-speed, high-                 precision inspection using the camera mounted on an available                   Stewart Platform.                                                                    Because the system produces high-accuracy three-dimensional                data in real-time, it can be potentially used for in-process                    control for a wide variety of manufacturing processes, so that                  errors in the parts as manufactured can be corrected more                       effectively.  The combination of the camera and the Stewart                     Platform, if successful, would make real-time dimensional                       inspection practical for many cases where it is not practical                   today.",
