 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grochenig  9306430       This project is concerned mathematical problems arising in  wavelet and sampling theory. Particular emphasis will be placed  on the analysis of multidimensional problems.  The thread which  ties together the theories comes from the broader concept of  frames developed in the early 1950's, but not recognized for its  importance in new developments in signal processing.  One  objective of the work is the construction of orthogonal and  biorthogonal wavelet bases for a general class of dilation  matrices in higher dimensions.  A particular step towards  this construction is the characterization of all self-similar  tilings which occur naturally in any attempt to find solutions  ofdilation equations.  The general construction of  nonseparable wavelets will exploit the links with the theory of  self-similar tilings.  This type of wavelet basis is needed in  applications to coding, compression and fast transmission images  to obtain more flexibility with respect to the number of  wavelets, the angular frequency distribution and the sampling  geometry. The second objective is the development of algorithms  for the reconstruction of band-limited multivariate functions  from irregular samples.  Particular emphasis will be given to the  relation between finite-dimensional implementable models of  irregular sampling to the original infinite-dimensional  reconstruction problem, and th analysis of efficiency and speed  of iterative reconstructions.       The growth of wavelet analysis has transformed a sizable  portion of research in harmonic analysis into efforts to find  efficient and fast procedures for analyzing and transmitting  signals in diverse areas such as tomography, seismology, data  compression and image reconstruction.  Many of the concepts have  been known in various forms in the mathematical literature, but  recent applications and discoveries have added impetus to the  basic goal of local analysis of signals in both time and  frequency at different scales in a comput ationally efficient  manner.    ***",
