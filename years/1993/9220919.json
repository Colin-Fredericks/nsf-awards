 "awd_abstract_narration": "Little knowledge exists about the role of antibiotics in                   fungal life cycles an activities.  One hypothesis is that                       antibiotics are important determinants of competitive                           interactions among fungi; experimental evidence to support this                 hypothesis, however is lacking.  A freshwater fungal community on               wood will be used experimentally determine: (1) the degree to                   which competition occurs among fungal species; (2) how the                      competitive ability of initial colonizers influences the                        development of fungal communities over time; and (3) whether the                ability of fungi to produce antifungal antibiotics confers a                    competitive advantage.  Competition will be assessed by pre-                    colonizing wood in the laboratory with pairs of species                         (antibiotic producers and non-producers) in various proportions                 at different densities and then submerging the wood in a stream.                Species reproduction over time will be measured as an indicator                 of species success.                                                             %%%                                                                             Results should demonstrate the degree to which competition                      occurs, the role of competition in organizing fungal communities,               how well species interaction in culture predict species                         interactions in the field, the relative importance of antibiotic                production in fungal species interactions, and the process and                  pattern of fungal colonization of submerged wood.  This knowledge               will contribute to understanding the role of competition, the                   evolutionary significance of antibiotic production, and life                    strategies of saprophytic organisms.",
