The Auburn conference will meet                  April 1-3, 1993, in conjunction with Spring SECOL (Southeastern                 Conference on Linguistics).  It will provide a forum for scholars               in a variety of disciplines, from widely separated parts of this                country and from other countries, who would otherwise not be able               to meet conveniently.                                                                                                                                                Among the goals of the conference are too encourage                        collaboration across disciplines, to promote discussion among                   junior and senior scholars of ongoing research projects, to                     expose recent Ph.D.'s and advanced graduate students to recent                  research in Southern American English, and to foster an exchange                between researchers and local community members.  Sociolinguists,               dialect geographers, lexicographers, historians, literary                       scholars, and educators will share their research on language                   variety in the Southern United States.  Each day will focus on a                different theme:  Thursday on Materials and Methods; Friday on                  Language Contact, Conflict, and Controversy; and Saturday on                    Discourse and Dialect Diversity.  Keynote addresses, panels, and                paper sessions have been structured so as to advance knowledge                  through presentation of new data, to encourage exploration of                   methodological issues, and to provide opportunities for debate                  over controversial themes.                                                                                                                                           The impact of the conference will extend well beyond the                   region.  Through satellite transmission, videotaping, and a                     volume of proceedings, conference activities will be made                       accessible to an audience much wider than that in attendance.",
