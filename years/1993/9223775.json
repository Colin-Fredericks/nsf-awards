 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223775  Taborek    This research project focuses on fundamental studies of adsorbed  films of hydrogen, helium and neon on alkali metals and frozen  hydrogen.  The binding between the films and the substrates is  weak, and as a result the adsorbed films display phases and phase  transitions that do not occur on strong binding substrates (where  the binding energy of the first few layers of adsorbate to the  substrate is larger than the binding energy of the adsorbate to  itself).  Theoretical analysis indicates that these systems  represent the entire range of weak binding behavior.  The emphasis  will be on the determining the dependence of features of the  prewetting phase diagram on the adsorbate-substrate and adsorbate-  adsorbate interaction parameters and on understanding the interplay  between prewetting and bulk phase transitions, inducing superfluid  onset in helium and the triple and critical points for the  classical systems.  The predominant technique will be the  measurement of adsorption isotherms using microbalances  supplemented by calorimetry and third sound.  %%%  The behavior of adsorbed films of liquid on solid surfaces is of  interest from both fundamental and technical viewpoints.  The study  of the behavior of liquid films as they wet surfaces is complicated  by the presence of various impurities at normal temperatures.  This  research will investigate the wetting of a range of surfaces by  helium, hydrogen and neon.  These films require ultralow  temperatures, where impurity effects are essentially absent.  The  research will test recent theoretical predictions that suggest that  the surface behavior of the various films will include unusual  phase transitions that can be investigated by sensitive calorimety  and microbalance techniques.  The research will test these theories  and potentially lead to films with new properties that may suggest  new technological applications.  ***",
