 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative effort between research groups                  headed by Professor Ahmet N. Palazolgu at the University of                     California, Davis and Professor Jose A. Romagnoli at the                        University of Sydney.  This award will provide support for the                  U.S. investigator to travel to Australia once each year for the                 next two years to spend a month working in the facilities at the                University of Sydney which includes a unique pilot-plant                        distillation column with computer interface.                                                                                                                    The collaborative research is focused on the control of linear                  and nonlinear chemical processes with equal emphasis on both                    theoretical developments and experimental verification results.                 Development of control strategies for such processes ultimately                 benefits processing industries in both countries by assisting                   them to operate process units with greater confidence under                     controlled situations. Robust control and nonlinear control                     research are recognized as being among priority research in both                countries. This study will utilize the complementary skills of                  the investigators in theoretical analysis and experimental design               and the collaborative effort has the potential to provide new                   insights and solutions. The exchange visits by Dr. Romagnoli are                supported through the Australian Department of Industry,                        Technology and Commerce (DITAC).",
