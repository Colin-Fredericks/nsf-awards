While clearly science has  revolutionized our lives, society has itself influenced the  development of science.  This is true even of the most esoteric of  sciences, i.e. mathematics.  Dr. Klein is examining the direct  influence of commercial bankers and merchants on the development of  modern statistical practices.    Statistics, originally developed as a study of mass phenomena in a  state of rest, eventually came to be used to analyze dynamic  systems.  Dr. Klein is investigating the practical roots to the  techniques statisticians use to transform time series data from  fluctuations into deviations.  Her research so far has indicated a  chronological primacy to what she calls `monetary algorithms,'  which were developed by European merchants and financiers in the  17th through 19th centuries.  In applications of relative time  frameworks, first differences, index numbers and moving averages,  commercial practice preceded political arithmetic, which in turn  fed into scientific investigation and statistical theory.  Her  periodization from commercial to political to scientific arithmetic  parallels a comparison of forms of statistical representation of  temporal phenomena from the tabular to the graphical to the  algebraic modes.  This investigation addresses the interplay of  deception and accountability in the development of statistical  tools, the relative contributions of the practice and the theory of  monetary exchange to mathematical statistics, and historical  distinctions between processes modeled as functions of time and  those modeled as functions of place in a sequence.  The endpoint  for this study is the identification in 1938 of stationary  stochastic processes.  ***",
