 "awd_abstract_narration": "Further advances in networking coupled with rapid advances in              storage technologies will make it feasible to build multimedia                  on-demand servers capable of providing services similar to those of             a neighborhood videotape rental store on a metropolitan-area                    network.  In this research we investigate architectures for                     multimedia servers that can permit multiple subscribers to                      interactively record and playback multimedia objects over                       integrated computer networks.  We address two main requirements in              the development of such a multi-subscriber multimedia server: (1)               Continuity of playback of each media constituting a multimedia                  object, and (2) mutual synchrony of playback of the different media             constituting a multimedia object.  In order to address the                      continuity requirement, we develop admission control algorithms                 with which a multimedia server can satisfy the maximum number of                subscribers simultaneously without violating continuity of playback             for any of them.  One such algorithm is a quality proportional                  scheme that retrieves media units at a rate proportional on an                  average to their respective playback rates, but uses a staggered                toggling technique by which successive numbers of media blocks                  retrieved are fine tuned individually to admit and service an                   optimal number of subscribers simultaneously.  Initial performance              estimation shows that the quality proportional policy is an order               of magnitude more scalable compared to straightforward admission                control policies such as servicing one subscriber per disk head and             round robin servicing of subscribers.  During retrieval of a                    multimedia object, mediaphones that playback the different media                components of the object may have recording and playback rate                   mismatches.  Furthermore, emerging integrated networks such as ATM              are expected to introduce jitter that can nevertheless be bounded               in the transport of media units from servers to mediaphones.  In                order to ensure synchronous playback of multimedia objects, we                  study  a feedback technique in which a multimedia server uses                   lightweight messages called feedback units generated by mediaphones             and transmitted back to the server to detect asynchronies during                playback.   We study various resynchronization policies such                    as aggressive, conservative, and probabilistic and compare their                performance for video/audio playback.  Initial performance                      estimation shows that whereas aggressive policies are expected to               perform best only at lower playback rates, conservative policies                are expected to perform best only at higher playback rates.  In                 contrast, probabilistic policies have the potential to perform                  uniformly well at all playback rates.  The policies and algorithms              developed in this project form the basis for a prototype multimedia             server being developed at the UCSD Multimedia Laboratory.",
