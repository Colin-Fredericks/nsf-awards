 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamic programming is one of the older general algorithmic  techniques that has been used widely in such diverse fields as  molecular biology, control theory, economics and operations  research, as well as in many areas in computer science, such as  computational geometry, string editing and VLSI layouts.  Until  recently, most applications were tackled with the general dynamic  programming technique.  Recent years have witnessed a renewed  interest in dynamic programming as researchers have begun to  uncover that many of these applications satisfy additional  conditions which can be exploited to yield significant  improvements in both the sequential and the parallel complexity  of some problems.  This project examines methods for speeding up the dynamic  programming technique.  The PI will work to significantly improve  the sequential and parallel solutions for classes of dynamic  programming problems, and seek to find ways to identify and  exploit extra constraints often found in many problems in a  class.  There will also be work on finding efficient solutions to  some specific problems that fit into the dynamic programming  framework.  These problems are important in their own right, and  furthermore, their solution should lead to useful insights in how to  handle the more general cases.",
