 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9353276  Ratcliffe, Alphonso  San Francisco State University    The California State University Alliance for Minority Participation  (CSUAMP) will implement a comprehensive statewide, community  oriented program to significantly increase the number of minority  students who receive a baccalaureate degree in science,  engineering, and mathematics (SEM) fields of study.  By the end of  the grant period, the CSUAMP will increase the number of minority  students graduating with baccalaureate degrees in SEM fields from  750 to at least 1,500.  To accomplish this goal, the project will  involve underrepresented minority students in SEM enrichment  activities throughout their entire undergraduate careers.  This  alliance is a partnership among 16 CSU campuses, 16 community  college campuses, and 12 major corporations.  Program activities  will focus on the transitions from high school to college, from a  two-year college to a four-year university, and from undergraduate  to graduate school.  There are three major sequential components of  project activities; summer bridge programs, academic year  workshops, and research internships.  Freshmen and sophomore  activities will concentrate on enriched mathematics, science, and  engineering courses; junior and senior year activities will be  devoted to paid research internships in SEM laboratories.  A  statewide Governing Board, composed of key leaders in higher  education and the private sector, will provide advice and counsel  to this project.  Finally, the project will work very closely with  two funded established AMP projects in Texas and California.",
