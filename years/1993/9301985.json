 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science award will                                 support the collaboration of John Eyler of the                                  University of Florida and Jose Riveros of the                                   University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.  The project                                 will focus on determining the infrared spectra                                  and binding energies of negative ions with one                                  or two solvent molecules attached to them.                                                                                                                      Both laboratories involved are equipped with                                    mass spectrometric (Fourier transform ion                                       cyclotron resonance) and laser instrumentation.                                  The U.S. group, which includes two students,                                   has an electrospray ionization source that will                                 provide an alternative method of forming singly                                 solvated anions, and probably the only means of                                 forming doubly solvated anions.  The US group                                   is also equipped for two-laser infrared                                         multiple photon dissociation experiments, which                                 permit infrared spectra of ions to be obtained                                  in previously inaccessible wavelength regions.                                  The Brazilian side will contribute expertise in                                 forming the anion solvates by ion/molecule                                      reactions.  The collaboration will likely                                       increase understanding of the effects that the                                  first and second solvent molecule have on                                       isolated ions, and thus of the transition from                                  \"naked\" ions in the gas phase to fully solvated                                 ions in solution.",
