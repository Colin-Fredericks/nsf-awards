 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crandall  9302995       This project continues mathematical research on nonlinear  partial differential equations.  A very broad class of equations  referred to as fully nonlinear will be under consideration.  Also  included will be the associated evolution equation one can form  from a time-dependent differential equation.  The thrust of the  work carries forward investigations into a class of solutions  developed during the past decade known as viscosity solutions.   To be precise, a viscosity solution is a class of functions  within which one expects to find a solution to the equation.  The  methods are closely related to that of continuous game theory  in that from many possible solutions one wants to show that a  best can be determined. There has been considerable success  in obtaining existence results for viscosity solutions in which  the basic operators involved are bounded.  The present work seeks  to expand the possibilities for extending to unbounded versions  and infinite dimensional generalizations. A second line  of investigation will be carried out in an effort to  obtain numerical approximations of fully nonlinear equations.   The work proceeds in several directions.  One must determine what  an effective type mesh would be and in terms of this give error  estimates.  This will first be done without regard to boundary  conditions, but with the understanding that such cases must be  taken into account at a later date.  A modest beginning will be  made on uniformly elliptic equations.       Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions  about uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis  often develops methods for numerical approximation of solutions  and estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.  ***",
