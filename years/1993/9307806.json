 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Hungary Joint Fund research project on                                  chaotic transients will be conducted by Dr. Peter                               Szepfalusy, Institute of Solid State Physics,                                   Eotvos University, Budapest and Dr. Celso                                       Grebogi, University of Maryland.                                                                                                                                Chaotic, unpredictable motion can be permanent or                               transient.  In the latter case chaos can be                                     observed on finite time scales only.  The main                                  objective of this research project is to improve                                understanding of transient chaos in both                                        dissipative and Hamiltonian systems.  The                                       importance of investigating such chaotic                                        transients lies in the fact that by analyzing the                               dynamics on finite time-scales, essential                                       features like sensitive dependence on initial                                   conditions and limited predictability of the                                    process can be observed.  The characterization of                               these transients is considered fundamental for                                  the understanding of the dynamics.  Results may                                 lead to advances in applications in areas                                       involving laser systems and nuclear or chemical                                 reactions.                                                                                                                                                      This theoretical research in mathematics fulfills                               the US-Hungary Joint Fund program objective of                                  advancing science by enabling leading experts in                                the United States and Hungary to combine                                        complementary talents and pool research resources                               in areas of strong mutual interest and                                          competence.  Funds for the project are provided                                 through the US-Hungary Joint Fund, Budapest, in                                 accordance with established guidelines.",
