 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Michael Schiffer, Mr. Axel Nielson                   will conduct field research to collect data for his doctoral                    dissertation. He will spend 18 months working in the community of               Cerrillos located in the highlands of Bolivia. Cerrillos is one                 of the few communities of the Bolivian Altiplano that still                     practices a purely pastorial economy that has characterized the                 Andean highlands for thousands of years. Inhabitants still                      maintain a long-distance caravan trade using llamas as pack                     animals. Mr. Axel Nielson will conduct an \"ethnoarchaeological\"                 study: that is he will examine present practices in an attempt to               understand the past. While it is known that pastoralism was                     practiced prehistorically in many parts of the world, it is not                 well understood what role this way of life played in the                        development of complex civilizations. In part this is because                   archaeologists don't understand how to interpret the material                   remains they recover. It is not clear what kind of archaeological               \"signals\" a pastoral way of life leaves on the ground.                                                                                                          Mr. Nielson research will visit all households in the community                 and select several for intensive study. He will participate in                  caravan trips and in the main non-daily activities carried out                  throughout the annual cycle. He will survey pastures and water                  resources and conduct an in-depth analysis of surface refuse                    distributions at selected settlements.                                                                                                                          This research is important because it will provide scientists                   with the tools to interpret a little-understood aspect of the                   past. A major road construction program is planned for this                     region and the behaviors Mr. Nielson plans to observe will soon                 disappear. The project will also assist in the training of a                    promising young scientist.",
