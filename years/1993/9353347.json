 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353347  Hessler    This project will provide an intensive 3-week inservice,  residential summer institute for Vermont middle level and ninth and  tenth grade teachers.  The content focus is on activity-based  aquatic ecology as a vehicle for developing and teaching a model of  integrative mathematics, science and technology to teachers and  students.  Thirty different teachers will come to the Saint  Michael's campus each summer for three summers beginning in 1994.   Each of the 90 teaches will commit to restructuring curricula in  their schools to support their teaching of integrated aquatic  ecology content to their students for at least three years  following their Summer Institute and to learn development within  their schools.  Schools will be linked by modem and Vermont Ed-Net  telecomputing to one another and to the campus, for data-sharing.   Emphasis will be on the interpretation of data generated by  collecting from points along each river and subsequent analyses.   Data collected by Rivers Project schools will be shared with local,  state and federal agencies.    This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because it is  designed to prepare teams of Leader Teachers who will work with  colleagues to being interdisciplinary science to middle school  students through an integrative local rivers science project.  It  also meshes will with the initiatives of the Vermont Statewide  Systemic Initiatives grant from NSF which is designed to teach  integrative science, math, and technology.    Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 22% of the amount requested  from NSF.",
