A team of ten faculty members from the science and                     mathematics departments at DePaul University will develop a                     three quarter, interdisciplinary science sequence, with                         mathematics integrated throughout. In the sequence, students                    will explore the basic principles underlying modern science and                 the growing degree to which multidisciplinary approaches are                    needed to attack problems in health, ecology, and the                           environment.  The sequence will emphasize the scientific                        process, as well as major themes in physics, chemistry, and                     biology.                                                                        Although the sequence will be developed for all non-science                     majors, the project will give special attention to those                        preparing to be teachers.  In collaboration with DePaul's                       Center for Urban Education, the project will establish                          structured clinical experiences for education majors in public                  elementary and middle schools in Chicago.  Acting as Scientists                 in Residence in these schools, students will adapt hands-on                     activities from the course for the children and teachers.",
