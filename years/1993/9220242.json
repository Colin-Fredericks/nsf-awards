 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the sea urchin embryo there are five territories of invariant                lineage - the prospective aboral ectoderm, the prospective oral                 ectoderm the vegetal plate, the skeletogenic mesenchyme and the                 small micromeres.  In addition to a unique pattern of gene                      expression, these territories are defined by individual cell                    lineage histories and generation of distinct cell types.  The                   lineages forming these territories are completely segregated from               each other by the 6th cleavage and spatially restricted gene                    expression begins one or two divisions later.  In all the                       territories except the skeletogenic mesenchyme, the founder cells               that are the progenitors of each territory achieve unique patterns              of gene expression by means of intracellular interactions with                  other cells.  The following studies are designed to determine the               lineage and fate of founder cells for specific cell types within                territories; to investigate the  specific functional significance               of interactions with neighboring cells in establishing certain of               the  territories; and to test the role of major signal transduction             systems in the specification of territories and cell types.  The                proposed experiments fall into the following categories:  1.                    Vegetal plate and neuronal lineage tracing with caged flourescein-              dextran.  2. Cell lineage and cell interaction studied by means of              cell ablation.  3. Molecular characterization of abnormal                       phenotypes derived from introduction of a foreign serotonin ligand-             receptor system.  4. Developmental consequences of ectopic                      stimulation of the PI signal transduction system in specific                    blastomeres of known lineage (using the serotonin receptor).  5.                The effects of elevated levels of second messengers in whole                    embryos and individual blastomeres.  6. Developmental effects of                the expression of foreign receptor kinases in whole embryos and                 individual cells.",
