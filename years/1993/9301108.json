 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important parameters, which can be derived                 from atmospheric Doppler radars, is the vertical component of the               neutral wind.  This project will compare and contrast the various               methods used in estimating the vertical velocity in the mesosphere.             Mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) and partial reflection                drifts (PRD) radars will be used to achieve this goal.                                                                                                               MST radars typically use either a vertically pointing beam or              the velocity-azimuth-display (VAD) technique to estimate the                    vertical wind.  The vertical beam technique can be biased by                    instrumental as well as atmospheric effects.  The PIs propose that              any instrumental bias can be removed using spatial interferometry               (SI) to track a radio star such as Cygnus A.  Differences between               the astronomical position and that obtained from the SI                         measurements can be attributed to a systematic offset in the beam               position.  Any atmospheric bias, due to inhomogeneities in the                  reflectivity field, can also be removed using SI techniques.  If                implemented properly, the VAD technique can produce an unbiased                 estimate of the vertical wind.  On the other hand, if not properly              implemented, the resulting vertical velocity estimates will be                  biased by the divergence in the wind field.  The PIs propose to                 implement both the VAD and SI techniques using the Middle and Upper             (MU) Atmosphere radar in Shigaraki, Japan, in the 60-90 km range.               Both these mesospheric measurements can be conducted essentially                simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                      Most PRD measurements are restricted to the vertical position              because of the configuration of typical systems.  Therefore, the                biases mentioned above, for the vertically pointing MST radar, are              also applicable for PRD systems.  Furthermore, the biases should be             enhanced because of the typically wide beamwidths used with these               radars.  PRD radars are multiple-receiver systems operating at 2-3              MHz.  As a result, the methods of eliminating the biases using SI               techniques are very similar to the MST case.  The PIs will make                 measurements using a PRD radar, which is planned for installation               in Sondre Stromfjord, Greenland, by researchers at Clemson                      University and the University of Colorado.",
