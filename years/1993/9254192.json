 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oceanography is taken by 25% - 40% of our first year class, and                 it may be the only science course many of these students                        experience. As a large class, it has high visibility on campus                  and presents a vital challenge in efforts to provide each                       student with a dynamic and exciting learning experience.  Funds                 are requested to support the creation of a set of interactive                   Macintosh computer based laboratory tutorial/simulations, a                     comprehensive help database, and an associated workbook.  This                  material will be integrated with the existing graphics database                 and computer automated quiz serving and fading software, and it                 will be available on CD ROM and Internet to other colleges and                  universities teaching oceanography.  Many of the ideas and                      approaches developed for this project also will be useful to                    others teaching large classes in other disciplines.  The goal                   is to make this large class experience every bit as exciting                    and dynamic as that in smaller classes by creating material                     that will truly engage the students in the subject matter,                      supported by a class structure that encourages student                          responsibility and integrative thinking.",
