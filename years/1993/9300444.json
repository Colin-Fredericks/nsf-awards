 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proof construction is a pervasive activity in computing   mathematics.  Although techniques for automated reasoning   made it possible to prove theorems with extreme rigor, much   the past effort has been directed towards proving difficult,  interesting, and often well-known theorems using general-  purpose   logics and proof techniques.  The application of  automated reasoning technology to support formal methods in  software engineering has fallen well short of original  expectations.  The main reason for this failure is the  overriding emphasis on automatic theorem proving.  A  completely new approach is required where the focus must   from theorems to proofs, and from general-purpose language   inference mechanisms to well-integrated, domain-specific  mechanisms.  Any sufficiently rich application domain, such   hardware, real-time, concurrent, or fault-tolerant systems,  exploits a host of specialized formalisms in order to encode  important concepts and methods and to reduce complexity.    project develops multi-modal framework for interactive  proof construction to support the use of domain-specific  formalisms.  The envisaged application is to reason about  complex digital systems.",
