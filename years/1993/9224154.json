 "awd_abstract_narration": "Christie         Recent advances in statistical physics based on the concept  of the renormalization group are applied to the problem of  computer interconnection optimization.  This enables a  thermodynamic model of system connectivity to be developed which  is consistent with the hierarchical boundary conditions imposed  by the rack-board-chip method of computer construction.  From  this theoretical description a new optimization algorithm, called  geometrical annealing, is proposed.  In contrast to other  thermodynamically based algorithms, geometrical annealing  acknowledges the spatial relationships that exist between optimal  wire length arrangements by employing minimization routines based  on geometrical principles.  It is anticipated that this property  may hold the key to matching the performance of experienced human  designers who naturally employ their spatial awareness in  producing efficient wiring layouts.  Other benefits of this  research will include a deeper understanding of the relationship  between statistical mechanics and combinatorial optimization, the  thermodynamic justification of the power-law relationship between  connectivity and system size, known as Rent's rule, and the  development of new thermodynamic relationships between the  parameters which characterize hierarchically structured systems.",
