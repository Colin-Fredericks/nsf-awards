 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symmetry is utilized as a fundamental paradigm in a                             multidisciplinary course whose purpose is to guide humanities                   students to both comprehend and become excited about the                        scientific world. Through sensory-rich examples of symmetry in                  a domain they know, these students are then stimulated to                       journey across this bridge into the realm of science.The course                 begins by illustrating pleasing patterns in the sciences and in                 the arts; this leads to a general definition of symmetry. We                    then characterize symmetry using elementary mathematical                        notions. Next we go on to see examples of symmetry in art and                   in mathematics as well as in poetry and in music. Then we                       display the existence of symmetry in physics, chemistry,                        biology, and cosmology. A brief excursion into asymmetry ends                   the course.Students are able to explicitly develop their                        quantitative abilities and analogical thinking by using                         concepts of symmetry both as a method within a discipline and                   as a bridge between disciplines. They develop these abilities,                  in part, through the medium of a highly graphical laboratory                    experience that utilizes computers for understanding many                       facets of symmetry and for generating their own patterns                        through the use of exploratory-based software packages. Written                 and oral communication are emphasized through classroom                         discussions, exams, laboratory discussions and reports, and                     through a term project. The multimedia course is taught in an                   assembled lecture-discussion setting, and the labs are an                       opportunity for students to engage in collaborative learning.                   A term project requires each student to choose a topic from one                 of the science-based categories discussed in the course. Every                  student will submit an essay explaining his or her project as                   well as demonstrating the project to the class. Occasional                      guest lectures and a trip to a science museum are planned to                    promote further enjoyment of the course.",
