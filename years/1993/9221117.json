 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development has proven to be a powerful analytic tool for                       dissociating different forms of learning and memory in Aplysia.  In             this project a developmental strategy will be used to explore two               key questions:  (1) What is the relationship between nonassociative             and associative learning?  Having already determined when                       nonassociative learning (sensitization) emerges, it will first be               determined when associative learning (classical conditioning)                   emerges.  Following this behavioral analysis, both forms of                     learning will be compared at several mechanistic levels:  (i)                   biophysical; (ii) biochemical; and (iii) synaptic.  (2) What is the             relationship between short-term memory and long-term memory?                    Having already determined when short-term memory (minutes-hours)                for sensitization emerges, it will first be determined when long-               term memory (days-weeks) emerges.  Following this behavioral                    analysis, the development of short-term and long-term memory will               be investigated at biophysical, biochemical, and synaptic levels of             analysis.                                                                                                                                                       By using development as a dissecting tool to uniquely dissociate                and analyze complex behavioral and neuronal processes in a                      preparation such as Aplysia, which is highly suited for a                       mechanistic analysis, this research project can significantly                   advance scientific knowledge in an area of fundamental importance:              the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying learning and                   memory.***//",
