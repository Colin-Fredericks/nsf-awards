It includes: (1) software for tutorials, databases,  and query tools, (2) files of published data for 22 animal  organs, and (3) facilities for electronic submission of data.   The significance of the project is that it makes the methods and  data of QM readily available to the community, organizes  structural information hierarchically, and provides new research  tools.  The new tutorial supplies training in QM, which include  morphometry, stereology, and reconstruction, through use of  detailed descriptions, worked examples, calculation workscreens,  simulations, and toolkits.  It provides: (1) background material  for biologists and computer scientists wishing to use the QM  databases and (2) state-of-the-art tools for researchers  interested in using these methods in the laboratory.  The  databases include a tutorial, data entry forms, published data  and query tools.  Reports allow end-users to standardize,  recycle, and create new data.  A new representation of QM data,  called the structural phenotype, simplifies the task of searching  for structural analogies and generalizations across the  literature.  The project actively supports the use of QM and  contributes a structural component to Biomatrix.  Furthermore the  investigator will begin to port his work to the workstation  environment.  This proposal is being jointly supported by the  Applications of Advanced Technology program in the Directorate  for Education and Human Resources as well as the Computational  Biology Activities program.  ***  Quantitative Morphology Tutorials and Databases for Biology",
