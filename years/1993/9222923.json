 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary group of scholars at Cornell University and                Carleton University, Canada, has initiated a joint project on                   \"Global Environmental Change and Social Justice.\"  The Social                   Science Research Council is co-sponsoring the project, and it is                administered by the Peace Studies Program at Cornell.  In a                     series of three workshops and a final conference scheduled for                  September 1993, participants will examine in depth the ethical                  issues posed by global environmental change and national and                    international policy choices.  Issues to be covered include the                 moral standing of the environment, the role of science in framing               environmental issues, the competing claims of different levels of               community, and the ethical problems posed by environmental                      refugees and resettlement policies.  These issues have been                     relatively neglected in the general discourse on environmental                  change.  This project will begin to elucidate a framework for                   making practical ethical judgments about environmental issues and               to link that framework to discussions of the politics of global                 environmental change.  Selected papers from the workshops and                   conference will be published in an edited book.",
