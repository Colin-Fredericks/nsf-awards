 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will fabricate a design demonstration support                      system for use in undergraduate civil engineering education. A                  computation center and two physical modeling support centers                    will be fabricated for use with demonstration modules to enable                 students to observe physical phenomena and failure mechanisms                   in soil. The project includes funds for data acquisition                        capabilities so that students will be able to obtain                            measurements of displacements, loads and pressures within soil                  in order to verify design procedures common in engineering                      practice. The apparatus will provide the opportunity to                         incorporate novel laboratory experiences and design projects                    into civil engineering education. Course modifications will be                  made in order to incorporate the laboratories into the                          geotechnical/ geoenvironmental program.  The laboratory                         demonstrations will enhance the students' understanding of                      material behavior and mathematical methods used to solve                        engineering problems. The behavior of soil and pore water will                  be observed in the laboratory. Failure mechanisms that are                      predicted from theory will be demonstrated. Flow paths and                      total heads will be observed in flow through porous media                       experiments. Mathematical solutions to governing differential                   equations which are used to solve engineering problems will be                  verified in the laboratory with the aid of the computation                      center.",
