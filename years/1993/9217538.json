 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an investigation of Cretaceous and Tertiary                 decapod crustaceans (crabs and lobsters) from southern South                    America and a comparison of these fossils to similar faunas from                Seymour Island, Antarctica.  In late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic               time, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica                     formed a contiguous landmass in the southern Circum-Pacific                     region and so dispersal of faunas was presumably unimpeded.  Work               in these regions so far suggests that the southern high latitude                region played an important role in the evolution and dispersal of               new species.  However, details of evolutionary centers and                      dispersal patterns remain tentative, in part because of                         insufficient field studies in the Antarctic Peninsula and                       southern South America.  This work will alleviate part of the                   geographical gap in knowledge by collecting and describing                      decapod crustaceans from known Cretaceous-Tertiary stratigraphic                sections in southern Chile and Argentina.  Comparison of decapods               from southern South America with those known from Australia, New                Zealand, and the Antarctic Peninsula is an essential part of a                  paleoecological model of the entire southern hemisphere.  In                    addition, this work will help to define the paleogeographic                     context for the unique Cretaceous-Tertiary fossils assemblages                  that have recently been described from Seymour Island,                          Antarctica.",
