 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is to be a quantitative study of the tri-trophic level,               two-species interaction between the western tree hole mosquito                  Aedes sierrensis and the ciliate Lambornell clarki.  Three models               will be employed: two will compare a general 3-species prey /                   predator / parasite system to explore the unique properties of the              interaction, while a third model will incorporate size structure                and age structure features in addition to extrinsic factors.  Model             analysis is to focus on understanding three kinds of larval                     mortality: over-compensatory, compensatory, and decompensatory,                 each of which has been observed under varying food resource                     conditions.  Sensitivity analysis will be used to determine which               parameters are responsible for causing the various mortality types.             Finally the model is to be validated through experiments designed               to test simulation results.                                                     %%%                                                                             Pollution problems and insect resistance to traditional pesticides              necessitate examination of alternative control methods.  The                    potential for biological control agents is great due to their                   target specificity.  It is expected that this investigation will                significantly improve our understanding of mechanisms for insect                mortality in nature (for example, are they density-dependent?).                 Results should be very useful in guiding pest control strategies                generally.",
