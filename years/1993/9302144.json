 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose to use the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric             Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure to derive ionospheric conductance,             electric filed, current and Joule heating maps for three disturbed              equinox periods:  20-21 March 1990, 23-28 March 1991 and 28-29                  March 1992.  The first period is a Coupling Energetics and Dynamics             of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) storm study interval for which we                have begun initial data collection.  The second period is one of                considerable geophysical interest because it follows one of the                 largest flare events of solar cycle 22.  Three Defense                          Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites observed                     particle and field variations during this interval.  For this                   interval the PIs will also acquire selected Fabry-Perot optical                 data and geosynchronous magnetospheric plasma analyzer data which               we intend to correlate with high latitude-electrodynamic patterns.              Considerable data also exist for the 28-29 March 1992 interval                  which was a Geospace Environmental Modelling (GEM) observational                campaign.  Because four DMSP spacecraft were operating during March             1992, the interval has the potential of producing the most                      comprehensive data set ever assembled for the study of large scale              electrodynamic linkages from the solar wind to the magnetosphere,               the ionosphere and ultimately to the neutral atmosphere.                                                                                                             As in previous studies data will be acquired from DMSP                     particle and field measurements, NOAA particle measurements,                    Incoherent Scatter Radars, Coherent High Frequency Radars, and                  ground magnetic observatories from both hemispheres.  These data                will be assimilated to produce electric potential field                         distributions, horizontal and field-aligned current distributions               and Joule heating and conductance distributions.                                                                                                                     The primary objectives for this study are:  (1) providing                  explanation of deviations from large scale conjugacy in equinoctial             convection patterns in terms of solar wind parameters, (2)                      documenting the temporal and spatial scale of high-latitude                     variations associated with significant changes of the IMF and                   correlating these variations with observations in the                           magnetosphere; (3) supporting new and ongoing coordinated storm                 studies (CEDAR and GEM) by providing a means for interpreting local             observations in a global context.",
