 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314448  Burns    The U.S. scientific community has convened numerous meetings to examine the crisis facing  the scientific community in the former Soviet Union  FSU  during this crucial period of  transition to a market economy.  One recommendation has been to designate the American  Association for the Advancement of Science  AAAS  as an appropriate organization to house  an international clearinghouse for information and support programs to help strengthen the  infrastructure for science and technology in the FSU.  This grant will enable the AAAS plans  to establish such a Clearinghouse to link professional societies, research activities, private  foundations, government agencies, and foreign assistance agencies supporting FSU scientists  and engineers.  The project will make a significant contribution to the development of a  sound infrastructure for science and technology in the FSU.  Specifically, AAAS proposes,  over the course of three years, to coordinate information flow with electronic  communications to facilitate widespread, open, and rapid communication, based on these  premises: (a) it will include activities of FSU universities and government offices in addition  to the FSU's various Academies of Sciences; (b) it will be multidisciplinary, encompassing  the biological, chemical, physical, and social sciences, and engineering; (c) it will aim to  integrate the FSU scientific community into the world community; (d) its function will  gradually be transferred to FSU colleagues.  The Clearinghouse will have six program  elements: (1) developing and disseminating resource base information; (2) allowing FSU  scientists and researchers to participate in international meetings and workshops; (3)  conducting an assessment of FSU libraries; (4) providing fellowships for FSU scientists at  U.S. scientific societies; (5) building a database on FSU science; and (6) continuing to assess  the needs of the FSU scientific and technical community.  ##",
