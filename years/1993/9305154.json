Additionally, individual cells of multicellular  organisms must perceive and respond to internal signals, such as  hormones, which coordinate the behavior and physiology of the whole  organism.  In contrast to the case for animal systems, little is  known about transduction pathways coupling signals to cellular  responses in plants.  The coupling of light reception to leaflet  movement in the tropical legume Samanea saman and of environmental  stress to deflagellation in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas  reinhardtii are signal response systems that appear to involve  calcium.  Phosphoinositide turnover, which produces inositol  phosphates and diacylglycerol, is hypothesized to mediate these  responses by mobilizing intracellular calcium and stimulating  protein phosphorylation.  To elucidate the role of phosphoinositide  turnover in these systems:  (1) the kinetics and properties of the  coupling between signal and cellular response(s) will be  investigated, (2) temporal changes in phosphoinositide metabolism  and intracellular calcium levels will be correlated with signal  reception and cellular response(s), and (3) the effects of  metabolites of phosphoinositide turnover and of agents that perturb  the functioning of phosphoinositide metabolism and calcium  homeostasis on cellular responses to signals will be examined.  %%%  The detailed mechanisms by which plants respond to signals, such as  light, that they receive from their environment are not known.  Dr.  Crain will study this in two systems:  the light-responsive  pulvinar cells of a tropical legume and a green alga which responds  to stress by shedding its flagellae.  The legume, S. saman, has  compound leaves, the leaflets of which open in the light and close  in the dark.  The movements of these leaflets are effected by  changes in turgor of the pulvinar cells.  Turgor chan ges are caused  by ion fluxes regulated by light.  Recent studies have indicated  that calcium ions are important in this response, and since  inositol triphosphate has been shown to regulate calcium in a  number of systems, Dr. Crain will study the formation and breakdown  of this metabolite in cells and subcellular fractions of the  pulvinus, the part of the leaf that moves in response to light.  He  will carry out similar studies of the role of calcium and  phosphoinositides in the flagellar shedding by the green alga in  response to environmental stresses.  These studies will provide  important new information on the biochemical mechanisms by which  plants respond to changes in their environment.  ***",
