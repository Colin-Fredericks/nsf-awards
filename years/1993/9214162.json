 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for the repair                             and renovation of the Anderson Biological                                       Laboratories at Rice University.  This building,                                primarily devoted to research and research training                             activities, houses the Department of Ecology and                                Evolutionary Biology and a significant portion of                               the Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology.                                Since its construction in 1956, there has been no                               major updating or repair of the HVAC, electrical or                             plumbing systems in the facility.  Although                                     renovation for individual laboratory spaces for new                             faculty has occurred, basic support systems have                                not been altered.                                                                    The research activities pursued in this                                    facility span a broad spectrum of biological                                    sciences, from evolutionary biology to molecular                                biophysics.  Despite the breadth of scientific                                  endeavors, the basic requirements of the research                               programs exceed the current limitations of the                                  building in terms of temperature and humidity                                   control, access to power and hot and cold deionized                             water, working hoods and effective cold rooms.                                  Renovations will consist of: replacing the HVAC                                 system with a modern design, insulating exterior                                walls to promote effective temperature control, and                             upgrading the electrical system.  Plumbing and hood                             operation systems will be evaluated and the                                     appropriate repairs will be done to ensure proper                               and effective long-term operation.  Cold room                                   facilities will be renovated to ensure effective                                operation and temperature control.  Modernization                               of the Anderson Biological Laboratories will                                    enhance the research programs, by providing an                                  effective physical environment for the pursuit of                               important biological questions using modern                                     technology and instruments.",
