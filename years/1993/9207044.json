 "awd_abstract_narration": "The remarkable adaptability of insects is clearly demonstrated in               examples of overwintering responses.  Some insects have even been               known to inhabit areas where temperatures reach -75 degrees C.                  Although researchers have been able to identify many physiological              and biochemical parameters that may contribute to survival at such              low temperatures, little is known about the underlying cellular                 mechanisms for these responses and how they are regulated.  One                 major obstacle has been the lack of an in vitro model, i.e. where               tissues or cells from these insects are maintained in culture and               subjected to experimental manipulation.  Recent research in my                  laboratory has now established a system for the long-term culturing             of fat body cells derived from cold-hardy beetles shown to produce              antifreeze proteins during the winter.  The proposed study uses                 this system to more directly investigate the physiological and                  cellular mechanisms of antifreeze protein biosynthesis and                      regulation.  First, it will characterize the cell types that                    predominate in vitro, how they relate to intact tissues, their                  degree of developmental maturation, and their ability to produce                antifreeze proteins, using very sensitive immunological and                     fluorescent labeling techniques.  We will then examine the cellular             means by which these proteins may be stored and then secreted,                  through ultrastructural immunolocalization with electron                        microscopy, and by charting transport of newly synthesized                      antifreezes from cells to culture media.  Concurrently, we will                 examine how hormones and low temperature may directly influence                 antifreeze protein production and secretion by these cells.  Thus,              this study introduces a powerful and state-of-the-art tool to                   research on insect fat body, and low temperature adaptations, and               provides the first cellular analyses of environmental and hormonal              control of antifreeze protein production and secretion.",
