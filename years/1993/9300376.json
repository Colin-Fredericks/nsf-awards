 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research: (1) treats variations in the \"design concepts\"              posed by other members of the design team as \"conceptual noise\";                (2) shows how to incorporate such noise into \"conceptually robust\"              decisions; (3) describes a method for using the same analysis to                provide preference information back to the other team members; and              (4) provides a procedure for determining whether to release the                 conceptually robust design or to wait for further design certainty.             Taguchi's approach is used as a starting point because it is widely             known.  This project generalizes concurrent distributed decision                making procedure by employing genetic algorithms.                                    Concurrent engineering processes involve multi-functional                  teams, which make decisions about many parts of the                             product\\production system and aspects of the product life-cycle                 simultaneously.  This research argues that such concurrent                      distributed decisions must be based on communications about sets                of possibilities rather than single solutions.  By extending                    Taguchi's parameter design concepts, it develops a robust and                   distributed decision-making procedure based on such communications.             That is, it shows how a member of a design team can make                        appropriate decisions based on incomplete information from the                  other members of the team.",
