Focusing on the British Kent and French Calais Transmanche  Euroregion (1990), the investigator will conduct primary fieldwork  in Kent.  The main objective is to present an analytical  ethnography of how local attitudes and allegiances to Britain have  shifted in Kent over the past five years, overcoming strong British  nationalism, and resulting in the region's joining with Calais as  a new trans-border territory of Europe sanctioned by EC law.  This  project will make an important contribution to scientific  understanding of processes of sociolegal change.    The investigator will use observational methods and conduct in-  depth interviews in Kent.  The project will also require analysis  of legal and policy documentation for the period.  The result will  be a thorough description and analysis of how a shared  (transnational) legal system is used as both a technical tool to  bring about change and an ideological framework to mediate  processes of political, economic and cultural affiliation.  ***",
