 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is concerned with the theory of noncommutative                  Noetherian rings, particularly with that of connected graded                    algebras satisfying the Artin-Schelter (AS) regularity condition.               The AS regular rings have been a subject of considerable research               recently, since they provide genuinely new, geometric techniques                for the study of noncommutative rings and are related to other                  areas of current interest, notably quantum groups.  The principal               investigator will study specific, important examples of these                   algebras to develop the abstract theory of AS regular algebras                  and the related theory of \"noncommutative projective geometry\".                 The principal investigator will also work on extending existing                 results on connected graded, Noetherian PI rings of finite global               dimension.                                                                           This research is in the general area of ring theory.  A ring               is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                            multiplication defined on it.  Although the additive operation                  satisfies the commutative law, the multiplicative operation is                  not required to do so.  An example of a ring for which                          multiplication is not commutative is the collection of nxn                      matrices over the integers.  The study of noncommutative rings                  has become an important part of algebra because of its increasing               significance to other branches of mathematics and physics.",
