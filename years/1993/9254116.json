 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introductory curriculum in computer Science is placing an                   increasing emphasis on the science of the discipline itself.                    The student is presented with a broad (yet detailed) overview                   to the breadth of the discipline in a manner similar to that of                 the other sciences (physics, chemistry, etc.).  This is a                       substantial change from the introductory curricula of old, in                   which the primary focus was the development of competent                        programmers, or software engineers.  It provides a proper                       perspective for the incoming student regarding the true nature                  of the discipline of computing.  Furthermore, it increases                      student interest and motivation, as actual research topics and                  applications can be addressed almost immediately in the                         student's studies.  Nevertheless, care must be taken to ensure                  that the students emerging from this sequence are skilled in                    the basic issues regarding software development.  A necessary                   by-product of this introductory sequence must also be the                       generation of competent software practitioners.  This proposal                  focuses on techniques that can be integrated into an existing                   computer science curriculum (that places its emphasis on the                    science of computing) to ensure the production of competent                     software developers.  In particular, emphasis is placed on the                  development of software engineers that can function in an                       environment of large-scale applications, where emphasis is                      placed on maintainability, re-use and reliability.",
