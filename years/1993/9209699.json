The organizers are                                  C.S. Krishnamoorthy, of IIT and J.N. Reddy, of                                  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State                                        University.  India's Department of Science and                                  Technology is a key sponsor and will support                                    all invited speakers from within India. The                                     purpose is to have a detailed exchange of                                       information among prominent scientists on the                                   most recent advances in computational methods                                   for the analysis and design of engineering                                      systems in aerospace, civil, mechanical, and                                    manufacturing.  Advances such as the                                            development of powerful numerical tools, the                                    application of artificial intelligence to                                       design, and the use of special modeling                                         techniques have contributed to the emergence of                                 engineering design as an area of specializa-                                    tion.  In research, too, increasing attention                                   is devoted to developing design theory and                                      models for design processes. The workshop aims                                  at synthesizing and presenting state-of-the art                                 computational methods required for analysis and                                 design of engineering systems.                                                                                                                                  Scope: The workshop should lead to a meaningful                                 exchange of knowledge and expertise in the                                      areas of analytical modeling, advanced comput-                                  ational methods and software for use in                                         practical designs in several disciplines of                                     engineering.  High level academics and                                          practicing engineers in India and the U.S. will                                 review developments in the field, identify                                      future research and development activities and                                  formulate collaborative research projects of                                    mutual interest to the U.S. and India.  The                                     proceedings of the workshop will be a state-of-                                 the-art publication that can be expected to be                                  of immense value to researchers and                                             practitioners in academia and industry, and to                                  students engaged in analysis and design of                                      engineering systems.",
