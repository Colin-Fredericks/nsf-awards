 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a three-year collaborative research project                 between Professor Anil Kulkarni of the Pennsylvania State                       University and Dr. Yuji Hasemi, Building Research Institute,                    Ministry of Construction, Tsukuba, Japan.  In addition, a                       graduate student from Dr. Kulkarni's laboratory will conduct                    research at the Building Research Institute for this project.                                                                                                   The objective of the project is to understand the fundamentals of               the behavior of materials burning in an upward flame spread                     configuration under a simulated surrounding fire condition and to               develop a mathematical model to predict upward flame spread and                 fire growth.  Upward flame spread is the most hazardous mode of                 flame spread; and in a room fire situation where surrounding                    walls impart radiant flux to each other, upward flame spread                    rates are significantly enhanced.  The U.S. and Japanese groups                 will approach the problem from different directions.  At Penn                   State, intermediate scale and small scale experimental facilities               have been constructed to study flame spread as well as to measure               relevant material properties, and a numerical upward flame spread               model has been developed.  At BRI there are extensive                           experimental facilities, large enough for full scale testing.                   The different approaches to investigation of upward flame spread                will allow the groups to benefit from each other's resources and                experience and will provide a cohesive research plan to enhance                 progress toward understanding the upward flame spread process.",
