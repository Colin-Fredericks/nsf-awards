Their immediate goal is to  find out how the inner part of the kidney (inner medulla)  concentrates urine.  The role of loops of varying lengths and  their parallel operation are studied.  Presently available  experimental data, as well as new data, as it becomes available,  are utilized to calibrate and exercise the models.  Current  algorithms for solving the stiff multipoint boundary value  differential equations for serial computers are adapted for the  parallel supercomputers.  New algorithms based on split system  solvers are developed for parallel computation.       Mammals maintain the volume and composition of their  body fluids within very narrow limits.  A basic mechanism for  this purpose is the kidney -- which can produce urine that is  either more or less concentrated than plasma or other body  fluids.  The kidney consists of a large number of distinct  functional units called nephrons, operating in parallel.  The  human kidney contains roughly one million nephrons.  A lengthwise  cross-section of the kidney reveals two distinct parts: the  cortex and the medulla.  In view of differing physiological  characteristics of the tubules, the medulla is subdivided into  the outer and the inner parts. Mathematical models have been  responsible for many of the basic ideas leading to our  understanding of the urinary concentrating mechanism.  These  models --- using experimentally available parameters --- have  established that the outer medulla uses the active mode  (metabolic pumps) for concentration but no model has been able to  generate any significant concentration in the inner medulla.  How  the inner medulla concentrates urine is still one of the major  unsolved problems in renal physiology.  Hypotheses continue to be  proposed to answer this question.   Mathematical models are  essential in the testing of such alternate hypotheses. Realistic  and comprehensive models involve the solution of thousands of  equations.  Therefore, it is essential that the solution  algorithms for the algebraic equations not only run fast and but  also minimize computer storage.  Since the nephrons operate in  parallel, algorithms and computers that are able to utilize this  physiological property are eminently suitable for kidney  modeling.  The goal of this interdisciplinary project is to  develop efficient methods for parallel computers to understand  the concentrating mechanism of the mammalian kidney.  The use of  these methods in several other important physiological  modeling applications will also be investigated.  The project  increases our fundamental understanding of basic and essential  physiological functions, develops software and algorithms that  can be used in other physiological studies, and may have  significant diagnostic implications.  ***",
