 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bowie/Pickering  9221383    This project will investigate the twentieth century incorporation of Lakota households into wage labor and consumer markets.  Despite the tremendous body of research about Native American communities, and about the Lakota of South Dakota in particular, the participation of American Indians as wage laborers in the U.S. economy remains hidden.  Similarly, the choices made by Lakota households among options of wage labor, informal economic activities and urban migration to meet their needs have not been explored.  The thesis of this project is that incorporation into capitalism is a culturally constituted process, both influenced by and influencing the trajectory of the world economic system.    Extensive qualitative interviews will be conducted with Lakota people from the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian Reservations.  Interview participants will be selected to reflect three communities on each reservation and from four urban areas where Lakota people migrate for wage work.  Archival resources and U.S. Census data will be combined with interview information to examine the process of economic incorporation and household decision-making from 1900 to the present.  This research will contribute to the theory of economic incorporation as a culturally mediated process, and of capitalism as a dynamic social system.  ***                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    X   Z                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  !         !         !
