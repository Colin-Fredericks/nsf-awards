 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most species in the genus Xiphophorus (swordtail fish) have males               that vary greatly in body size.  Females prefer the larger males                for mating.  One species, X. pygmaeus, was thought to lack large                males, but, surprisingly, female X. pygmaeus still prefer large                 males:  they are more attracted to big males of other species                   than they are to their own small males.  Dr. Ryan recently                      discovered that large male X. pygmaeus exist at two sites,                      although all other sites lack large males.  At sites without                    large males, females are more attracted to the large conspecific                males from other sites than to the small males from their own                   sites.  However, females from sites with large males did not show               any discrimination based on male body size.                                                                                                                     Dr. Ryan and his colleagues will investigate the factors that                   cause large body size in this species; preliminary results                      suggest it does not stem from the same genetic mechanism that                   causes large size in other swordtails.  The researchers will also               attempt to determine why females at sites with large males do not               prefer large males, as do females from other sites.                                                                                                             The results will bear on several areas of animal behavior and                   evolution.  They will indicate alternative mechanisms for how                   species evolve large body size and the consequences for behaviors               correlated with body size.  They will indicate if female mating                 preferences for traits absent in the species might exist, perhaps               because these preferences were inherited from ancestral species                 in which males had the trait under question.  The results will                  also indicate if such inherited preferences could be lost if                    these preferences begin to entail costs of mating.  Finally, this               research will provide badly needed information about the natural                history and biogeography of a species that is a spectacular                     component of the Mexican fish fauna but whose range is restricted               to a few small tributaries.",
