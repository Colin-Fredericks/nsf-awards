We briefly describe the proposed research directions: 1. Design and refinement of photonic bandgap materials:  Considerable progress has been made in the past two years in the design of PBSs. So far, only  lossless two  component dielectric composites have been investigated for use as photonic bandgap materials.  The research has focused on finding the structure with the right geometry.  We will address the following topics in our research: The effects of realistic considerations, such as losses finite size effects, frequency dependence of the dielectric constant, imperfect periodicity, etc., on the photonic band structure and the eigenmodes. Possibility of using alternate materials, such as superconductors, materials with strong magnetic or piezoelectric properties, and nonlinear dielectric materials, to name a few.  The electromagnetic response of these materials can be controlled to varying degrees, making possible the design of PBSs with optical properties that can be controlled by means of an applied electric or magnetic field, or by elastic deformations or by other means. 2. QED:  An important motivation for the calculation of the eigenmodes of a PBS is for possible use in cavity QED calculations.  The atom field interaction is not only through the density of photon states, but also through the spatial distribution of electromagnetic fields associated with the mode.  Another source of atom field interaction is  through an additional term that represents the interaction of the atom with the induced polarization charges in the      h)          0*0*0*         medium.  A thorough understanding of these mechanisms is essential in designing optoelectronic devices with PBSs.  Periodic superconducting structures can be expected to yield novel QED effects that are not observed or are insignificant in experiments with atoms in a single cavity.  By controlling the position of the band edge, we expect that the radiation properties of the atoms can be controlled altered.  This will give provide a new means of investigating cavity QED; the system could be used as a Q swithch for generating pulses of coherent radiation. ***",
