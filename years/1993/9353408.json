In three week summer workshops, ten two-  person teams of a biology and chemistry teacher from a  district will use analytical instrumentation common to both  disciplines and design laboratory curriculum modules using  the instrumentation in their classroom.  During a second  summer these same teachers will attend another two-week  workshop to learn new content, use of more instrumentation  and to resolve problems they have encountered in classroom  use of the instrumentation.  Teachers may earn nine-credits  for the first summer and six-credits for the second.    A Chemobile will support the summer activities during the  academic year.  It is a van equipped with the  instrumentation the teachers have used.  It will deliver the  instruments to local districts to support instruction in the  teacher's classroom.  Instrumentation in the van is provided  by Purdue University.  The van driver is a teacher qualified  to use the instruments and provide appropriate on-site  instructional support.  Indianapolis schools will be further  served by a Purdue Visitation Team composed of a university  faculty member and an industrial scientist.  The project  builds on an earlier pilot project which served a limited  number of chemistry teachers.  ***",
