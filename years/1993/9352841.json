 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators are writing laboratory materials for and team                 teaching an integrated three semester sequence of courses in                    calculus and physics. The sequence is covering the material                     normally developed during the first three semesters of the                      standard analytical calculus sequence and the standard                          engineering physics sequence taken by freshmen and sophomores.                  The core of the project is the creation of a series of mini-                    labs which develop analytical topics in tandem with physical                    principles using data-gathering equipment connected to personal                 computers. The investigators are considering the long-standing                  pair of problems in introductory science education:                             applications meant to motivate the calculus are often developed                 poorly and/or out of context by the calculus instructor, and                    mathematical tools needed in the physics course are often used                  by the physics instructor before they have been adequately                      developed in the calculus course.",
