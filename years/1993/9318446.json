 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318446  Chang-Hasnain  We propose a novel all-optical, self-routing switching network based on an innovative address coding scheme.  The proposed work includes concerted research efforts at the network, systems and device levels.  \"All-optical\" switching is accomplished by tagging the data packet with an address code consisting of a serial combination of wavelengths, so that switching can be done simply by sensing the wavelength without the need for first converting the high-speed data to electronic form.  Self-routing is exercised by sensing the wavelength content of the address tag in a data packet.  At each switching stage of a multistage switching network, the switching node performs a latching function which directs the entire content of the packet to the appropriate output port based on a certain section of the wavelength address code, until the final destination is reached.  Under this scheme, a large number of address codes can be accommodated and is not limited by the number of available wavelengths as in conventional wavelength division multiplexed networks.      The proposed work consists of investigation of a suitable multiwavelength laser transmitter based on surface emitting laser arrays, a switching node which sorts and routes incoming optical signals to appropriate output ports based on the wavelength tag of the input signal, optical crossbar switches which are based on switched semiconductor amplifier arrays, and system/architectural studies of this type of all-optical self-routing network.  A small-scale demonstration network is planned which uses the novel components described above, which serves as a testbed for investigating systems related issues as well as ascertaining the performance of the interacting devices and components under real traffic environments.  ***",
