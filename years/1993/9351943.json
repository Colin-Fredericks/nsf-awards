This equipment will allow our Computer  Graphics course to shift its emphasis from low-level algorithms  for generating graphical output primitives and GKS to higher-  level problems dealing with three dimensional graphics, PHIGS  and animation. A collection of tools for building an effective  graphical interface based on standard software in an  instructional setting will be designed.The equipment requested  will also allow our Image Processing students to experiment  with the relevant algorithms interactively. An image processing  \"workbench\" will be developed to serve as an interactive  framework within which our students will implement their  programming assignments. This will facilitate learning by  providing an interactive environment for experimenting with the  algorithms and yet allow the students to focus on the basic  principles and algorithms involved without spending excessive  amounts of time in the image processing course on the overall  interactive program design.  ***",
