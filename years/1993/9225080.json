 "awd_abstract_narration": "9225080  Williams  This project will apply a range of modern surface science  techniques to investigate the effects of applied electrical  currents on the surface migration of atoms on metal surfaces.  The  phenomenon is known as surface electromigration (EM).   Interestingly, EM on surfaces is rather poorly understood, though  it is considered to potentially be of substantial technological  interest.  In the past it has been studied, but not in depth, with  modern surface structure tools.  Surface mass transport will be  investigated experimentally by studying the changes of step  structure under an applied electrical current using low-energy  electron microscopy.  %%%  This project will investigate how surface atoms move or do not move  under the influence of an applied electric field.  The changes in  surface morphology will be followed with a new surface microscope  that allows real-time data collection of surface structure images.   This is a low-energy electron microscope.  The phenomenon of  surface electromigration is surprisingly poorly understood.  It has  been studied for many years, but not with the modern techniques of  this project.  The objective is to obtain definitive data about  surface electromigration, which is acknowledged to be potentially  of great technological significance, particularly in the  microelectronics industry.  ***",
