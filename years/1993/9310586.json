 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310586  Krauss    Conversational gestures are unplanned, fluent hand movements that  often accompany spontaneous speech.  Traditionally it has been  assumed that such gestures serve a communicative function - i.e,  that speakers use them to convey information to an addressee in  much the same way they use language.  However, the empirical  evidence supporting this assumption is tenuous, and recent  research suggests that gestures convey relatively little semantic  information.  In contrast, the lexical access hypothesis views  conversational gestures as an intrinsic part of the speech  production process, and hypothesizes that their primary function  is to help the speaker retrieve words from the mental lexicon.   however, these gestures may convey nonsemantic information about  a speaker's internal state, and such information can affect the  interpretation of the spoken message.  In this way, gestures may  play an important role in the regulation and maintenance of  social interaction.    A series of experiments will explore the functions conversational  gestures serve for speakers, the kinds of conceptual contents  whose expression they facilitate, the nonsemantic information  they convey to addressees, and the role that this kind of  information plays in interpersonal communication.  The results of  these studies will broaden our understanding of the basic  mechanisms underlying human communication.  The methodology  developed also has applications in research on communicative  disorders in which speakers experience difficulty in word  retrieval.  ***",
