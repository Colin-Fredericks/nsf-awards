 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research program is the development               and demonstration of adaptable vibration analysis sensors which                 use specialized weighted-sensitivity optical fiber waveguide                    structures.  Several methods to create the necessary sensitivity                variations along the length of the waveguide are suggested, based               in part upon prior published research of the principal                          investigators and Fiber & Sensor Technologies, Inc.  Extensions                 of this work to further permit the realtime modification of such                spatial fiber sensitivity profiles, and hence the in-line optical               signal processing of integrated sensor signals, will also be                    investigated.  Applications of sensor instrumentation products                  which would use such adaptive, weighted fiber elements include                  vibration analysis systems for noise suppression, active                        structural acoustic control, and structural damage monitoring.                  Additional uses in adaptive electromagnetic detection arrays for                both the communication and biomedical diagnostics areas seem                    possible.  Fiber & Sensor Technologies will with cooperation from               the Fiber & ElectroOptics Research Center at Virginia Tech to                   model, fabricate and test the performance of weighted sensitivity               fibers for selective vibrational mode analysis of laboratory                    demonstration articles during the proposed Phase I project.",
