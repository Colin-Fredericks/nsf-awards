 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decreased concentrations of ozone in the stratosphere over                      Antarctica have resulted in increased levels of ultraviolet                     radiation in the UV-B portion of the spectrum incident at the                   earth's surface beneath the 'ozone hole'. There is now world-wide               concern that this enhanced flux of UV radiation may cause serious               harm to the marine ecosystem in the Southern Ocean. This project,               which includes field and laboratory studies, will help to                       determine the effects of enhanced levels of UV-B radiation on                   phytoplankton, and to relate such effects to overlying ozone                    concentrations. UV levels determined from the NSF-Operated UV-                  Spectroradiometer at Palmer Station will be directly applicable                 to the interpretation of observed biological effects. Primary                   attention will be given to the effects of UV-B radiation on                     photosynthetic rates, on damage to DNA with resulting loss of                   cell viability, and on the rates and extent to which                            phytoplankton can minimize cellular UV damage by production of                  specialized protective pigments. Differential sensitivity to UV-B               of dominant phytoplankton species or groups will also be                        determined, as such differences might have important consequences               on the structure of the food web in antarctic waters. As the                    project's activity will cover the period from September through                 December, the resulting data set should encompass the period of                 maximal development of the ozone hole, as well as the time of the               summer solstice. This project is important because it will                      elaborate previous findings and address in detail the extent and                the nature of ultraviolet damage to phytoplankton, as well as                   evaluate the kinds of defenses cells can muster against it.",
