The work will be carried                 out by Dr. William C. Trogler and Dr. Mark H. Thiemens of the                   Chemistry Department of the University of California at San                     Diego.  They will examine the mechanism of decomposition of                     ammonium nitrate, the reaction of hydroxylamine and nitric                      oxide, and other reactions by which nitrous oxide might be                      produced.  The influence of aerosols and particulates on these                  processes will also be investigated.  The means of elucidating                  the reaction mechanism, as well as linking the nitrous oxide                    produced by various reactions to nitrous oxide in the                           atmosphere, will be isotopic labeling of nitrogen and oxygen.                   %%%                                                                             The concentration of atmospheric nitrous oxide has been                         increasing in recent years, but the sources of this increase                    are not well understood.  Trogler and Thiemens will investigate                 the details of nitrous oxide production from various reactions                  that model potential environmental sources.  Trogler's                          expertise in reaction mechanisms, catalysis, and                                photochemistry, and Thiemens' in gas phase kinetics and mass                    spectrometry will be helpful in this collaborative effort to                    examine these reactions under relevant conditions.  Nitrous                     oxide is a greenhouse gas and is also involved in the                           atmospheric ozone balance.",
