 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temperature is a primary determinant of the distribution of plants.             Tolerance limits of each species are genetically determined, and                can be extended through genetic adaptation.  High-temperature                   adaptation in terrestrial angiosperms has been shown to involve                 changes in physiological and biochemical traits, resulting in                   greater thermal stability of photosynthesis and net carbon-                     fixation.  Mechanisms of adaptation will be examined in a marine                alga by comparing traits of a high-temperature tolerant ecotype of              the kelp, Laminaria saccharina, from Long Island Sound and a non                adapted population from Maine.  Adaptive changes in photosynthesis              vs. temperature responses of each ecotype will be examined in                   detail, including time-dependence and reversibility of heat damage,             and high-temperature induced photo inhibition.  Thermal responses               of dark respiration and photo respiration will also be compared for             each plant.  Thermal stability of photosystem II, the most heat-                sensitive component of photosynthesis, will be examined using                   chlorophyll fluorescence techniques.  Adaptive changes in key                   photosynthetic and respiratory enzymes will be determined by                    comparing thermal properties in vitro and by comparing activity in              plants exposed to superoptimal temperatures.  The results will                  provide the most comprehensive information to date about mechanisms             by which a marine alga can extend its temperature tolerance and,                thereby, its geographic and environmental ranges.",
