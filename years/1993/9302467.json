 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302467  Einstein  Numerous research projects and academic courses in several  departments at MIT require the capability to apply loads in  two directions. The proposed portable two-axis hydraulic  testing system will be used for this purpose.  The system  fabricated by Instron, consists of two modular hydraulic  actuators (with 5 gpm servo-valves) and capacities of 11 and  22 kips respectively, each with a 6\" stroke.  The actuators  will be powered by a 6 gpm hydraulic pump mounted on  casters. The control console will be cart mounted and  provide uni-axial and biaxial capabilities.  Each actuator  can be configured for force control, stroke control or  external transducer control.  The digital function generator  does accommodate for a phase shift between the two actuator  motions.    The equipment will be part of the MIT REMERGENCE (Resource  Extraction, Materials and Energy, Reservoir, Geotechnical,  ENvironmental and Construction Engineering) Laboratory, a  joint laboratory of the Departments of Civil Engineering;  Materials Science and Engineering; Mechanical Engineering;  Ocean Engineering and Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary  Sciences.  Faculty, graduate and undergraduate students use  this laboratory.    Typical research projects for which the equipment will be  used are:    Experimental Investigation of Microcracking Processes in  Cementitious Composites under Biaxial Compression (PI:  C.  Leung)  Fracture Coaalescence Research on Model Rock and Real Rock  (PI: H. Einstein)  Cyclic Fatigue of Soils (PI:  J.T. Germaine)    The close tie-in between research and education at MIT  implies that graduate and undergraduate students will work  with his equipment be it in research projects or courses  with experimental requirements.",
