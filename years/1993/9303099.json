 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research  is  concerned with a framework  for  understanding  syntactic,  operational  and semantic properties  of  contemporary  programming  languages.  In addition to  extending  a  descriptive  theory  of  programming  based  on type  theory  and  denotational  semantics,  the  research contributes to the  development  of  new  programming  languages. The programming  language  goals  are  increased  ease and efficiency of programming. This involves  both  cleaner   language  design,  so  that  programs  are  easier   for  programmers to read, write and maintain, and careful attention  to  features that make it possible for programming tools to manipulate  programs meaningfully. The theoretical aspects of the research are  aimed  at establishing the semantic and algorithmic basis for  the  development   and   implementation  of   programming   tools   and  environments. A common thread through the research is the  use  of  type systems, both as a mathematical framework for analysis and  a  syntactic basis for automatic program analysis.  Some  specific  problems are the static type analysis  of  object-oriented  programming   languages,  aimed   toward   establishing  properties of programs that may be used in compilation and program  transformation, type inference algorithms for functional languages  that  include  imperative  and control  features  (exceptions  and  continuations), and the use of linear logic to obtain more precise  static analysis of programs. A pragmatic language design effort is  a  type  and  module  system that is useful  for  the  design  and  development  of  object-oriented programs in existing  languages.  Some  longer-term foundational problems are the  model  theory  of  linear  logic, operational and denotational methods for  reasoning  about   imperative  programs  with  higher-order  and  polymorphic  constructs,  and  treatments of concurrency in a  higher-order  or  object-oriented language framework.",
