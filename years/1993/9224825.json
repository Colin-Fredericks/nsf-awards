The                educational aspects of this program are being funded by the JASON               Foundation for Education and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations.              Scientists will be using a manned submersible and a remotely                    operated vehicle system to explore the seafloor and conduct                     experiments.  Investigators at sea will transmit live video from                cameras mounted on the underwater vehicles via satellite to other               scientists and students at several sites across the country.                    Concurrently, scientists ashore in their laboratories will also be              able to control several functions of the remotely operated undersea             vehicles while they are submerged. The expedition amounts to a                  significant undersea test of telepresence using modern oceano-                  graphic and satellite communications technologies.                                                                                                              The NSF funds will permit the extended use of these undersea                    systems and communications links beyond that required for the JASON             Project's educational purposes.  NSF-sponsored ocean scientists                 will be able to test and assess the effectiveness of these modern               undersea capabilities for controlling submerged vehicles and making             seafloor observations remotely and for manipulating certain basic               ocean science research experiments.",
