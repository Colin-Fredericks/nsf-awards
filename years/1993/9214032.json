 "awd_abstract_narration": "When environmental regulations are proposed by the EPA or other                 federal regulatory agencies, both the regulator and regulated,                  and sometimes third parties, prepare estimates of the cost of                   compliance.  The purpose of this research is to analyze the                     differences between the initial cost estimates before compliance                and the actual costs of compliance.  The first part of the                      project will analyze the use of cost estimates by the various                   parties from a theoretical perspective.  The second part, which                 is the major emphasis of the research, involves a number of case                studies of EPA regulations.  In these case studies the estimated                compliance cost made by different parties will be systematically                compared to the actual compliance costs, and any divergence                     between actual and estimated costs will be analyzed.  This                      research is important because it should help to shed light on the               suspicion that regulated firms frequently overestimate cost                     estimates in an effort to effect regulatory outcomes, while                     regulatory agencies and third parties tend to underestimate them.",
