Gordon of Iowa State University and                   Professor Kazuo Takatsuka of Nagoya University.  Also involved on               the U.S. side are Professor George Schatz of Northwestern                       University and Professor Vincent McKoy of the California Institute              of Technology.  In Japan Satoshi Yabushita of Hiroshima University              and Kimihiko Hirao of Nagoya University are also involved.                                                                                                      This project will address one of the most important new                         developments in chemistry during the past five years -- the                     experimental ability developed by Neumark and others to directly                study reaction transition states by performing photodetachment of               an electron from related anions and then studying the subsequent                photodetachment spectroscopy and dynamics.  The investigators, all              theoretical chemists, will attack this problem from several                     complementary perspectives, including electronic structure theory,              dynamics based on both time-dependent and time-independent                      formalisms, and photoionization spectroscopy and dynamics.  By                  combining complementary expertise, the U.S. and Japanese groups                 will be able to develop insights that build on current                          collaborations.",
