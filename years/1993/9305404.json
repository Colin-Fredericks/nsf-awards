 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Timothy Pauketat and               his collaborators will conduct three seasons of archaeological                  excavation at the site of Cahokia and the surrounding region. This              large site located on the outskirts of St. Louis Missouri consists              of a series of large mounds and represents one of the most massive              prehistoric constructions in North America. Prior work indicates                that the Cahokia polity developed in the first millennium AD and                reached its height around 1000 AD. The site subsequently underwent              decline well before Europeans reached the New World. Building on                prior work in the region, Dr. Pauketat wishes to understand the                 processes which led to the rise of Cahokia. With support for three              field seasons, he will collect a range of data. Because his focus               is on the rise of centralized power he will excavate and collect                cultural material from a portion of the site occupied by elites.                Secondly he will conduct a regional survey to locate all smaller                archaeological occurrences which date to the same period and this               will allow him to set Cahokia into a broader regional context.                  Finally he will excavate at four known subsidiary sites to                      determine their relationship to the central one.                                                                                                                While archaeologists have traced the rise complex centralized                   societies in many parts of the world they still do not understand               the underlying processes involved. At an early stage social                     inequality becomes evident and the egalitarianism which                         characterizes simpler antecedent groups gives way to social                     stratification. Several theories exist which may potentially                    explain the rise of \"chiefs\" or \"big men.\" One emphasizes the                   possible role of dominance while another views chiefs as \"managers\"             who serve essentially to coordinate activities and redistribute                 wealth. Because he adopts a regional approach in which elite and                non-elite portions of Cahokia can be directly compared and Cahokia              itself can be set into a broader regional context, Dr. Pauketat                 hopes to address this issue.                                                                                                                                    This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new                light on a pinnacle of prehistoric Native American development. It              will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and increase               our understanding of the emergence of social complexity.",
