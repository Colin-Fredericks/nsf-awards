 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Paul Rabinow is undertaking a Professional Development                Fellowship at the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) in Paris        receiving training in the innovative techniques of Yeast Artificial             Cloning and DNA typing.  He is undertaking this training in                     biological methods in order to enable him to study CEPH and two                 related institutions: Genethon, a high-tech facility organized to               rapidly identify disease genes and the Association Francaise Contre les         Myophathies (AFM),  a `disease-group' concerned with the myopathies.            Taken together, the CEPH-Genethon-AFM embody a distinctive form of              doing science, one which links science, society and technology from             the start.  Given that the CEPH has been more than competitive in               its scientific and technical output, its success poses the question             about what the connection might be between its commitment to                    integrating social concerns with cutting edge technology and                    scientific advance.  This institutional complex works and it is                 essential for science policy studies to find out why.  Professor                Rabinow's training and research are designed to address the issue               using anthropological and historical methods.",
