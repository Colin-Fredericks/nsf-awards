 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318794  Jacobsen  Dr. Eric N. Jacobsen is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program as a Presidential Young  Investigator.  He will be studying the development of enantioselective catalysts for organic  synthesis.  The oxidation of unfunctionalized olefins will be the first reaction that he will  explore.  %%%  Facial selectivity in group transfer to a prochiral olefin can be controlled by purely non-bonded  interactions or by constraining the degrees of freedom in diastereometric transition states through  substrate pre-coordination.  Catalytic systems are being developed based on both principles.  A  series of chiral manganese complexes have been designed which catalyze epoxidation of isolated  and unfunctionalized olefins by iodosoarenes with up to 33% enantiomeric excess.  The ligands  for these complexes are readily prepared by condensation of chiral diamines with salicylaldehyde  derivatives, permitting systematic variation of their steric and electronic properties.  Current  efforts are directed toward tuning the steric environment surrounding the reactive site in order  to increase enantioselectivity to synthetically useful levels and to use observed stereochemical  preferences to map out the trajectory of olefin approach to the intermediate metal oxo species.   The results with six catalysts prepared to date and examination of a crystal structure of the most  effective system have allowed a detailed transition structure for oxygen-atom-transfer from  manganese to olefin to be developed.  This model is now being refined by systematic variation  of metal, ligand, and substrate; the elucidation of a transition structure which holds predictive  value with regard to stereochemistry will also provide mechanistic insight into the general  question of oxygen-atom transfer from metals to olefins, an important step in a wide range of  laboratory, industrial, and biological processes.",
