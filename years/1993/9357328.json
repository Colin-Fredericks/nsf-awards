 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357328  Abate  This NSF Young Investigator (NYI) Award investigates the molecular  mechanisms that control gene expression in the developing murine  embryo using the hox gene family as a model system.  The hox genes  are expressed in overlapping spatial and temporal patterns  throughout murine embryogenesis and play a fundamental role in  controlling developmental processes.  These encode putative  transcriptional regulators; however, their function as such has not  been well characterized.  In particular, target genes that are  regulated by Hox proteins during embryogenesis have not been  identified.  Moreover, it is not well understood how these related  polypeptides, which share similar binding specificities in vitro,  interact selectively with DNA regulatory elements in the control  regions of target genes.  The focus of my research is to identify  such target genes and, in the course of this analysis, to  investigate the molecular processes that promote target gene  selection.  The specific plan is to isolate genomic DNA fragments  that contain binding sites for the Hox proteins and are potential  regulatory sites in vivo.  These studies will provide fundamental  information concerning the function of these transcriptional  regulatory proteins, as well as general insight into the mechanisms  that control gene expression during embryogenesis.      The goal of this research is to understand the processes that are  required to direct the development of the mammalian nervous system.   The assemblage of a system as complex as the nervous system  requires many signals that are active in prcisely the right cell  populations and at precisely the right times during development.   A family of proteins, termed the Hox family, directs the  appropriate expression of these signals (or genes) during  development.  These proteins are essential for normal development  and any loss of function of these results in gross developmental  abnormalities.  Hox proteins function by interacting with DNA  regul atory elements within the genes and thereby activating (or  repressing) the expression of these genes.  These studies will  provide a basis for understanding how appropriate gene expression  contributes to the development of the mammalian nervous system.  ***",
