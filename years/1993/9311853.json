 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311853  Garland    In this project, new calorimeters are developed for quantitative  measurements of the latent heat and pre-transitional heat capacity.   The new calorimeter can operate over a wide frequency range (10.2  HZ to 10.3 HZ) because there is evidence that slow dynamics occurs  near some of the transitions, and because the heat capacity can be  a complex function of frequency.  With these enhanced calorimetric  capabilities, it will be possible to resolve the critical behavior  at SmC-Sml (tilted smectic-tilted hexatic) transitions by studying  binary mixtures, where the nature of the transition should change  from first order to critical to supercritical.  The proposed  research has the following specific goals:  1) quantitative  measurement of latent heats and pre-transitional Cp wings for  first-order transitions; 2) determination of critical behavior for  the static heat capacity at second-order and multicritical points;  3) characterization of the continuous non-critical evolution or  order in bulk liquid crystals and liquid crystals in a porous  medium (aerogel); and 4) investigation of the slow dynamics near  liquid crystal transitions which give rise to a complex frequency-  dependent heat capacity.  %%%  Liquid crystal, exhibit a variety of long range ordering that is  intermediate between that of crystalline solids and simple liquids.   Understanding the phase transition behavior in these materials is  of importance in view of the growing development of liquid crystal  display and device technologies.  Several challenging problems  remain.  Almost nothing is known about the slow time response near  some liquid crystal phase transitions, and this will be studied  with a newly developed dynamic calorimeter.  The effects of  chirality (right- or left-handedness in asymmetric molecules) are  poorly understood and will be expolored in studies of bond--  orientational ordering and the newly discovered twisted-grain-  boundary phases.  The behavior of liquid crystals in random por ous  media like aerogels is a new field that is closely related to  applications involving liquid crystals in restrictive geometries.   A wide range of exploratory studies concerned with surface effects,  finite size confinement effects, and random field effects will be  undertaken.  ***",
