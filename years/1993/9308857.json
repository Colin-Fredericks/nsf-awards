 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308857  TAKAHASHI       Considerable research has been devoted by scholars to  analysis of individual and collective reactions to the siting of  controversial facilities, which are recognized as necessary but  are seen as undesirable when situated nearby.  Although many  studies have focused on the dynamics of \"NIMBY\" (not in my back  yard) responses to \"LULUs\" (locally undesirable land uses) that  have negative physical environmental externalities, much less  attention has been given to the analysis of reactions to human-  service facilities like homeless shelters and facilities for  treatment of people infected with AIDS.  Initial studies of  community reactions to such facilities disclosed that gender,  income, and other socio-economic characteristics are highly  correlated with individual and collective acceptance of these  activities.  National attitudinal studies indicated that  interregional, intraregional, and other locational factors may  also influence community acceptance of human-service facilities.  This Research Planning Grant will enable a capable and productive  young geographer to begin examination of  attitudinal variations  among different ethnic and racial minority groups.  Questions in  a national survey first administered in the late 1980s will be  adapted to take into account cultural and linguistic differences  among several minority populations, with pilot tests of modified  instruments conducted on a set of minority groups in Orange  County, California.  Results from these pretests will be used to  refine national survey instruments so that they elicit better  information regarding socio-demographic variations in attitudes  toward human-service facilities and other LULUs.       This award will move a promising line of research on an  important topic through a critical phase in the development and  testing of instruments designed to elicit critical information  about variations in attitudes among different groups of people.  By improving data-collection procedures, this  line of research  will better contribute to general understandings about the human  geography of individual and community attitudes regarding siting  of contentious land uses.  The award also will provide a valuable  boost to the independent research career of a highly qualified  woman who has not previous received federal research support.  ***",
