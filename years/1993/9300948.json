 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300948  Friedman       This project is concerned with a number of nonlinear  problems in partial differential equations.  These problems  include: (a) free boundary problems that arise in studying the  visual development in electrophotography, (b) the formation of  electric images in electrophotography, (c) free boundary problems  for Navier-Stokes equations, (d) coalescence models for  dislocations, (e) diffusion of networks, (f) a kinetic model for  photobleaching, and (g) the Stefan problem with kinetic  condition.         The research is concerned with nonlinear problems in partial  differential equations as motivated by physical and engineering  models; many of these models come directly from U.S. industry.   The problems involve either (1) partial differential equations  and systems, which are nonlinear and possibly degenerate as well,  or (ii) linear partial differential equations and systems in  domains with a free boundary.  The problems to be considered  arise from such areas as semiconductor processing,  electrophotography, and coating flows.  ***",
