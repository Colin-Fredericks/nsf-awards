The conference                 will be held in late February, 1993 and will bring together                     engineers, scientists, clinicians, and representatives from                     industry and federal agencies.  The conference will review the                  status of the field, identify those areas where applied research                and developmental efforts are needed and those problems where                   fundamental technological research is warranted.                                                                                                                The areas of presentation and discussion that will be covered in                this conference are interdisciplinary in nature and specific to                 the biomedical focus area.  Regular meetings of professional                    societies are unlikely to have participation from all the                       communities that will attend this conference.  This conference                  should stimulate research by biomedical engineers into important                areas associated with lasers in medicine.  The results of this                  conference will be written and distributed by the Engineering                   Foundation.",
