The underlying                                                reason for this is that to be                                                   applicable to \"large\" classes of                                                process models, the \"parameterized                                              design models\" upon which                                                       \"certainty equivalence control\" is                                              based, almost always have points in                                             their parameter spaces at which the                                             design model is unstabilizable -                                                and at such points certainty                                                    equivalence controller design via                                               \"design model stabilization\" is                                                 impossible. We propose to deal with                                             this problem by exploiting the                                                  special capabilities if identifier-                                             based adaptive controllers                                                      employing switching.  We propose to                                             study switching algorithms of two                                               different types.  The first, called                                             \"hysteresis switching\" has already                                              been used to successfully resolve                                               several long standing problems from                                             classical model reference adaptive                                              control.  The second, called                                                    \"cyclic switching,\" is in an                                                    earlier stage of development, but                                               has the potential of yielding                                                   adaptive controllers with                                                       capabilities well beyond those                                                  existing algorithms.  Ever since                                                the introduction of tuning error                                                normalization by Edgart in 1978,                                                the concept has been vigorously                                                 exploited.  One of the main                                                     benefits of normalization is that                                               it enables one to obtain                                                        stabilizing adaptive controllers                                                which are very much simpler in                                                  structure than are algorithms which                                             do not use normalization.  It is                                                largely for this reason that tuning                                             error normalization in one form or                                              another has been so widely utilized                                             in parameter adaptive control.  On                                              the other hand, it has recently                                                 been observed that, in spite of                                                 their relative complexity,                                                      algorithms not using error                                                      normalization offer several clear                                               advantages over algorithms which                                                do.  We propose to further develop                                              the principles of normalization-                                                free adaptive control, to study the                                             capabilities of normalization-free                                              algorithms, and to compare their                                                performance with the performance of                                             algorithms of the normalization-                                                dependent type.",
