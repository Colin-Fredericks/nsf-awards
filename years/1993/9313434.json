Since that  time, a significant number of younger faculty members have  been added to the staff, and their high levels of research  activity are poorly served by the Science Center's  laboratory spaces. In particular, there are an insufficient  number of efficient fume hoods, and the building's  ventilation system and hazardous material storage rooms are  inadequate. To address these concerns, the University will  upgrade the building's HVAC system, modernize the chemical  storage facilities, and add 24 new fume hoods.       The planned upgrading of Gottwald Science Center will  have several significant effects: 1) the safety of students,  staff, and faculty in the Center will be safeguarded; 2)  research instrumentation will have more suitable  environments; 3) the scope and quality of faculty research  will be increased; and 4) joint student-faculty research  projects will be easier to pursue. These changes will serve  to attract more students into scientific careers.  ***",
