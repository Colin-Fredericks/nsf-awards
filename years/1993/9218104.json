 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arizona State University will undertake a three year program to                 develop, implement and evaluate four core courses on Materials                  Synthesis and Processing.  These courses are distinguished by an                interdisciplinary approach, involving students and faculty in                   Engineering, Physics, and Chemistry.  The courses will be                       integrated into academic programs at Arizona State University as a              Materials Science option in the degree programs in Engineering,                 Physics and Chemistry.  They will have a direct impact on the                   integration of programs in Materials Science and Engineering within             ASU and will complement and strengthen the graduate program in the              Science and Engineering of Materials.  The four proposed courses                are: 1) A sequence of two lecture courses in advanced material                  synthesis and processing with emphasis on thin films of electronic              materials; and 2) Two laboratory courses consisting of 3 projects               each semester chosen from a wide range of 20 topics that emphasize              synthesis and processing, followed by characterization and property             evaluation of advanced materials.  The majority of the projects                 will be carried out in a new laboratory specially dedicated to                  these courses.  Novel features of the courses include the use of                case studies in lectures and videotaping of student presentations               in laboratory projects.  The courses will be evaluated by faculty,              students and an external advisory committee.  It is planned to                  publish a text on the lecture courses, and the experiments for the              laboratory course will be available in manual form.  It is also                 planned to publish descriptions of the courses in the Materials                 Research Society Bulletin.",
