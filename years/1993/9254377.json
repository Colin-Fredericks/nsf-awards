 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Quality Education for Minorities Network will create a                 resource and project center to build capacity -- in as many as                  possible of the approximately 250 predominantly minority                        institutions of higher learning in the United States -- to respond              to and compete effectively for external grant funds for the                     strengthening of participation by minorities in the fields of                   science, mathematics, and engineering education.  QEM will                      establish on- and off-campus links with such institutions to help               them benefit fully from the programs of the National Science                    Foundation, in particular the Education and Human Resources                     directorate.  Over a period of three years, campus-by-campus needs              assessments will be done; workshops for proposal development and                project management will be conducted; and collaborative links will              be forged between institutions with similar or complementary                    characteristics.  Various kinds of communication systems will be                put in place within and between institutions, and between the                   institutions and QEM: for example, E-mail, electronic bulletin                  boards, document sharing, an 800 number at QEM, a Clearinghouse of              grants-related materials, and access to federal databases on                    science and math education and minority education.  For                         institutions presently receiving support from the NSF, the goal is              to improve proposal and project efficiency and to increase the rate             of successful proposals.  For institutions that are not presently               NSF grantees, the goal is to move them into the grantee category.",
