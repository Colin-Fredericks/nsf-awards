 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems associated with the radiocarbon dating of organic-carbon-              poor arctic lake sediments have limited the utility of                          paleoclimatic inferences drawn from these repositories.  To                     evaluate the role of the Arctic in the global climate system from               the geological record requires a network of sites, each with a                  secure independent geochronology.  Separation of cause and effect,              lead and lag times, and distinguishing climate change from                      vegetation migration all require temporal resolution better than                500 years, about the limit of previous studies.  Although the                   precision of 14C measurements by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS)            has steadily improved during the last decade to its current                     precision of <1%, less effort has been directed at separating                   heterogeneous lake sediments into its constituent organic                       compounds.  The Paleoclimate of Arctic Lakes and Estuaries (PALE)               program within the Arctic System Science (ARCSS) initiative                     requires both reliable radiocarbon dating and expeditious                       processing of samples.  This award will meet this need by providing             a standardized sample preparation protocol for organic-carbon-poor              arctic lake sediment based on the results of earlier research, and              prioritizing sample handling so that basal dates for cores                      collected under the PALE initiative will be processed within 2                  months of receipt.  Standardized pretreatment for PALE researchers              will ensure an adequate number of reliable dates for each core.",
