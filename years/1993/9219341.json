 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research is made by the                        Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program                   to support the development and application of high pressure                     photoacoustic calorimetry.  Dr. Theodore J. Burkey of the                       Chemistry Department, Memphis State University, will construct                  a cell in which to carry out reactions of organometallic                        compounds and measure the change in volume due to differences                   in the volumes of reactants and intermediates or products.  The                 method will be useful in determining detailed reaction                          mechanisms for photointiated reactions, including substitution                  reactions and activation of alkanes and other small molecules.                  The project is viewed as risky since the method may not be                      sufficiently sensitive.  If successful, the method could be                     useful for studying organometallic reactions, whose mechanisms                  have not been extensively studied, and for comparison of                        results with the few other methods used for determining volumes                 of activation.                                                                  %%%                                                                             During the course of reactions, both reactant and solvent                       molecules rearrange themselves to optimal orientations required                 for reaction.  As a result of this rearrangement, the volume of                 the reactants changes during the course of the reaction.  The                   volume of the products also differs from that of the reactants.                 Thus, measurement of volume change during reaction provides                     information about the energy and steric requirements for                        reaction.  With the support of this award, Dr. Theodore J.                      Burkey will attempt to develop a new method for measuring                       volume changes and will gain information on a number of                         important organometallic reactions, including some catalytic                    and some light induced processes.",
