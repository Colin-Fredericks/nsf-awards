 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to obtain a comprehensive and innovative               set of key measurements on individual fish larvae that will fully               characterize the animal's size-specific growth, as well as the                  response of these measures to different food levels.  These values              will change with the animal's development, and so the size-related              changes in larval physiology and ecology must be characterized and              understood if their role in population processes is to be known.                The typical values of the measurements, their observed                          distributions and variability, and the strength of their relation               ship to one another, will be evaluated.  The underlying goals for               the work are:  1) to derive baseline information on the size-                   specific development patterns in individual marine fish larvae that             are expected to be important in field recruitment process studies,              and 2) to intercompare this set of condition indices to learn the               strength of the relationships among them, and what their relative               value would be for indicating overall animal condition and                      predicting continued survival.",
