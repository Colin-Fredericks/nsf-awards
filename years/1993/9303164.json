 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interspecific comparisons of temperature effects on metabolic              rates of ectotherms have long been used as premier examples of                  physiological adaptation to environment  - -  typically populations             from relatively cold habitats have evolved increased metabolic                  capacities (compensation) at low body temperatures.  Interspecific              comparisons provide a perspective on long term evolutionary                     patterns, but little insight into contemporary dynamics of                      physiological evolution.  The dynamics of metabolic evolution in                contemporary populations will be explored using a series of                     complementary studies of the thermal dependence of metabolic rate               in Drosophila melanogaster.  First, replicate stocks of the species             will be compared.  Second, these results will be compared to the                same type of data from specimens collected along a 3000 kilometer               transect.  If compensatory evolution has occurred, flies evolving               at low temperatures (or high latitudes) are expected to exhibit                 elevated metabolic rates relative to flies from high temperature                situations.  Correlated responses of thermal dependence of                      metabolic rate to selection for temperature extremes will also be               examined.  If there are genetic correlations between components of              the metabolic response to temperature, selection for tolerance of               temperature extremes should influence metabolic rate at other                   temperatures.                                                                   %%%                                                                             Metabolic rate in ectotherms has a profound significance for                    locomotor performance, competitive ability, and is strongly                     correlated with an array of life history variables.  Recent work in             comparative and evolutionary physiology repeatedly stresses the                 importance of understanding the evolution of thermal sensitivity,               but few studies have examined this feature in small ectotherms.                 One important goal of studying comparative physiology is to                     ascertain why tradeoffs between life history parameters (for                    example, the tradeoff between growth rate and asymptotic size)                  exist.  Ultimately such research has implications for understanding             the biological limits of human life history traits such as                      longevity and reproductive life span.",
