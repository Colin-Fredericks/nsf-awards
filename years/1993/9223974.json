The research will concentrate on the                  institutions that supported \"anonymous\" markets for goods which                 are separated by time place such as credit markets and contracts                for future delivery.  An extensive data collection effort and a                 theoretical framework, building on recent developments in game                  theory, contract theory, and organization theory, will facilitate               an empirical examination of these institutions.  In addition, the               study is aimed at compiling data sets which will provide a better               understanding of the institutions that governed agency relations                in Genoa during the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.  To                 analyze and present this data, the research will take advantage                 of an analytical method which so far has not been utilized by                   economic historians, namely, network analysis.  This research is                important because it will shed new light on the nature and                      evolution of modern institutions, thereby facilitating the                      understanding of the institutional transition that developing                   economies and the economies of the former Eastern block still                   face.",
