 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of various               social insurance programs on the behavior of individuals and                    firms.  The programs to be studied include Unemployment Insurance               (UI), Worker's Compensation (WC), and Aid to Families with                      Dependent Children (AFDC).  The study of the UI program will                    provide a better understanding about  how the level of benefits                 effects the chance of an individual of filing and the length of                 time the person receives assistance.  The WC  program will be                   analyzed to determine the extent to which the reporting of                      nonwork injuries are effected by the level of benefits and other                features of state workers' compensation systems.  The AFDC study                includes an examination of the duration of claims using                         administrative data.  In addition, welfare migration among states               will also be examined.  Part of this project will also include                  assembling, documenting, and disseminating some new and                         potentially extremely useful data sets pertaining to                            participation in these various social insurance programs.",
