That future proposal, which would  serve Native American teachers and teachers who are employed by  districts with a large Native American population, is anticipated  as a project consisting of a series of summer courses and academic-  year follow-up activities for teachers of elementary and middle  school mathematics.  The educators who make up the planning  committee either represent elementary and middle schools and  educational consortia from the targeted population or are community  college or university personnel who have special expertise in  Native American education.  The planning grant provides funds to  cover expenses associated with organizing, attending, and  conducting the two planning meetings and establishing a computer  network among the members of the planning committee.",
