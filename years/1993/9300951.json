 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300951  Fang       This project is concerned with the development of analytical  and numerical techniques for the identification of parameters in  nonlinear partial differential equations which model  semiconductor devices. A particular focus is the quantitative  relationship between measurements collected by nondestructive  testing techniques and the desired model parameters. This  analysis will form the basis for the development of effective  numerical algorithms to be used for identification of parameters  directly from the measurements. It is anticipated that  such  algorithms will have an immediate impact on parameter estimation  in semiconductor devices.       In the semiconductor industry, there are newly developed  nondestructive testing techniques for detection of interior  properties of semiconductor devices that are not directly  measurable. The relation between the measurements collected by  such techniques and the desired interior property is not well  understood quantitatively. In this project, the quantitative  relationship between the quantity that describes the interior  property and the measurements obtained will be explored. Such an  analysis will allow the semiconductor industry to better  understand the practical aspects of nondestructive testing  techniques and hence provide information for improved estimation  of critical parameters in semiconductor devices. Based on this  analysis, computer programs will be developed that can be used to  compute the desired quantity directly from measured data.  ***",
