 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctic fish species have evolved over 40 million years at                    nearly constant body temperatures of about 0 C.  Exposure to                    chronic cold has required adaptations to overcome thermal                       sensitivities of cellular processes and to permit retention of                  characteristics that would be lethal at warmer body temperatures.               Such features will be addressed in this project which focuses on                a hemoglobinless icefish family.  Although it is well established               that these icefishes lack hemoglobin, the presence/absence of the               intracellular respiratory pigment, myoglobin has not been                       resolved as a familial characteristic.  Preliminary evidence is                 presented that suggests myoglobin is expressed exclusively in one               tissue of a single icefish species.  Validity of this conclusion                will be tested using immunological methods to establish                         definitively whether myoglobin is expressed in oxidative muscles                of channichthyid species.  It will also be determined whether                   point mutations in the protein encoding sequence of the myoglobin               gene account for lack of the protein's expression mRNA in tissues               that do/do not express myoglobin.  Characteristics in protein                   structure that are necessary for function of the intracellular                  fatty acid binding protein at cold cell temperatures will be                    examined; this protein enhances transcellular movement of                       metabolically important fatty acids and serves a cytoprotectant                 function.  Coordinated ultrastructural and biochemical                          measurements of icefish glycolytic muscle will identify                         adaptations that have occurred in the tissues of icefish.  These                experiments will test the proposed paradigm that adaptations to                 overcome diffusional limitations are fundamental to ensure life                 at cold cellular temperatures.  The studies will add insight into               adaptive responses of muscle in higher vertebrates and increase                 understanding of the metabolism of antarctic fishes, a group                    important to the trophic structure of the Southern Ocean.",
