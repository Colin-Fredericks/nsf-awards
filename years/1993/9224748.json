The work expands on recent research on  approximation orders in the quadratic and supremum norms.  It is  expected that the approximation order of the intermediate  Lebesgue spaces will remain constant.  In addition, work will be  done on finding the dimension of box spline approximation spaces  in three dimensions. Efforts will be made in seeking a Fourier  analysis approach to solve approximation order questions in  seeking a more general approach applicable to any scale, whether  local or not.  Further research will be carried out on  shift-invariant spaces using shifts of radial functions as  suitable approximants or restricted families of functions. New  approaches to the wavelet construct, the multiresolution  analysis, has led to an expanded nonstationary wavelet which may  have practical benefit.  Related to this will be a close study of  the stability of shifts of solutions of dilation equations in  terms of their Fourier transforms.  Continuing research on  approximation of surfaces and the problems of blending patches of  surfaces will continue.  At the present time, blended patches are  only satisfactory when the given surfaces are relatively flat.   Better understanding is needed to tell whether a given surface  can be well represented by a few blended patches.       Approximation theory combines techniques of special  functions, numerical analysis and functional analysis to analyze  complex problems in which closed form or simple solutions are not  feasible.  By its very nature, such research carries an implicit  goal involving application to questions of the physical world,  although some of the work can be highly theoretical.  ***",
