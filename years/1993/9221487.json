 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to conduct a comprehensive set of                      synthetic, mechanistic, and X-ray structural experiments on two                 types of carboxylate salts having alkene or acetylene groups.                   Solid-state reactions will be induced by irradiation (UV, X-rays,               gamma rays) and/or by heating.  The investigation will focus on the             physical and chemical mechanism of the reactions.  These                        experiments will lead to improvements in the understanding of                   structure-reactivity relationships for solid-state reactions, and               in the effecient planning and execution of stereospecific and                   regiospecific syntheses in solids.  To enhance the understanding of             the radiation chemistry of molecular crystals, metal complexes will             be irradiated by synchrotron x-radiation at specific wavelength                 near the absorption edge of the metal.                                          %%%                                                                             The distinct advantages of solid-state syntheses of chemical                    compounds include improvements in efficiency or selectivity, and                the ability to prepare compounds unavailable by conventional                    solution chemistry at greatly improved yields.  A broad                         investigation is proposed on the solid-state reactivity of salts of             unsaturated carboxylic acids.  The discovery of extensive general               reactivity, particularly for metal salts, promises to open new                  areas of solid-state synthesis.  The mechanism of single crystal                reactions will be probed from both chemical and physical points of              view.  Information gained regarding the role of the metal in the                reactions of unsaturated carboxylate will enhance the understanding             of radiation chemistry of molecular crystals.",
