 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study investigates the nature of ecological                                interactions of two taxonomically disparate organisms                           sharing refuge habitats during early life history                               stages.  Laboratory and field experiments will examine                          interspecific processes of competition and predation                            and their interactions between populations of larval                            fish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and postlarval grass                               shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) which co-occur on vegetated                         saltmarsh surfaces in shallow aquatic microhabitats.                            Both species exhibit rapid declines in numbers                                  following concurrent peak recruitment of juveniles onto                         intertidal marshes.  Density-dependent intraspecific                            and interspecific effects on survivorship and growth                            rates will be the focus of this research.                                                                                                                       Interspecific competition, resource depletion, and                              indirect effects on meiofauna will be examined in                               laboratory microcosms.  Field experiments using                                 enclosures on the vegetated intertidal marsh will                               assess predation and interspecific competitive effects.                         Understanding biotic interactions in this system should                         contribute to a broader understanding and appreciation                          of the role of interspecific interactions on                                    recruitment variability affecting critical early life                           history stages of organisms.",
