Control system courses are  currently taught in a traditional lecture oriented fashion as in  many other universities. Even simple systems can appear abstract  and daunting when described only in mathematical terms. The project  changes this situation by developing experiments and demonstrations  to help students comprehend theoretical concepts and gain  experience. The project involves implementation of motor servo and  temperature control equipment in analog control systems, digital  control systems, and power system courses. Equipment includes a   Complete Modular Servo, and a  Three-Term Temperature Control.  Other ancillary equipment such as a 386-type computer, a data  interface board, and analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog  converters are also included. This equipment is used by the  students for various experiments including time and frequency  response analysis, steady-state error analysis, stability analysis,  and controller design, and for their semester-long design project,  giving them hands-on experience in solving realistic problems, and  thus bridging the gap between theoretical studies and the  application of these theories to practical systems.",
