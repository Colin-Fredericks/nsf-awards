 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302370  Anderson       Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas and, as the  original Central Equatorial Pacific Experiment (CEPEX) proposal  pints out, water vapor is therefore the dominant regulator of the  Earth's energy budget and thus the critical regulator of climate.   An understanding of the processes that dictate the distribution of  water vapor and the processes that link the distribution of water  in all its phases to the frequency-dependent divergence of flux and  radiance constitutes a central element in any considered strategy  to understand secular trends of the Earth's climate.       The PIs will augment the array of CEPEX observations with in  situ observations of water vapor, ozone, pressure and temperature  from the ER-2 aircraft.       Water vapor measurements will be carried out using the Lyman-  alpha photofragmentionion technique:            Water vapor + hv   hydroxyl(A) + hydrogen              hydroxyl radical(X) + hv + hydrogen  that fragments a water vapor molecule with 121.6 nm radiation from  a plasma discharge lamp and observes 308 nm radiation from the  electronically excited product hydroxyl radical.  This experiment  is done both in absorption and in fluorescence to provide a dynamic  range of five orders of magnitude in water vapor concentration and  an absolute calibration of the instrument during each flight.       Ozone observations will be done using ultraviolet absorption  in the Hartley continuum at 257nm.  The instrument uses an on-board  Hg resonance lamp; a MnO2 getter to establish the absorption cell  count rate in the absence of ozone in the sample; a Roots blower to  actively aspirate the measurement cell; and counting electronics to  obtain fractional absorption levels of one part in 105.         This research is important because it will provide water vapor  and ozone observations needed to help interpret climate processes  in a climate-sensitive part of the world.  ***",
