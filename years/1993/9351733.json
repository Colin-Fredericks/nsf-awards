The addition of this equipment  is allowing for development of field and lab exercises in  courses in Sedimentology, Glacial, and Quaternary Geology, in  two current field courses, and in faculty-student research.   The CTD unit is being used to monitor controls on modern  sediment transport and deposition such as salinity,  temperature, and oxygen in the water column.  The acoustic sub-  bottom profiler is an \"echo-sounding\" system that is being used  to obtain detailed continuous records of sediment fill in  transects across the lake or marine basins.  The magnetic  susceptibility system is being used to determine the  magnetostratigraphy of sediment cores recovered from the lakes  and marine basins which will subsequently provide a means for  correlation of cores within the basin.  The new equipment is  greatly strengthening our existing program of environmental and  paleoenvironmental studies by introducing students to modern  sedimentological and stratigraphical techniques that provide  detailed information on sedimentary processes and depositional  environments.  ***",
