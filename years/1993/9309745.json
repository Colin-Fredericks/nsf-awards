 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technology Transfer is difficult to measure in an                          industry/university environment.  This difficulty appears to be due             to causes.  The first is that there have been almost no studies                 within organized technology-based research ventures that have                   sufficient data points to make them generalizable.  The second is               because there is a dearth of tools for assessing transfer of                    technology and information in inter-disciplinary cooperation                    research programs.                                                                   This proposal will address these problems by: 1) holding an                Invitational Technology Transfer Assessment Consensus Conference to             develop the assessment instruments for a study, 2) study                        Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers (I/UCRC) using the             recommended instruments for possible use in the I/UCRC, Evaluation              Program.                                                                             The Principal Investigator is a noted evaluation researcher                studying technology transfer and has the experience necessary for               this study.                                                                          The Program Manager recommends Dr. Craig Scott be awarded                  $54,548 for one year for this project.",
