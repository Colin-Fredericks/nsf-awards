 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate automated deduction and logic                     programming based on some recent developments in Multiple-                      Valued Annotated Logics.  These logics have been advocated as                   a way to a uniform formalization of automated reasoning                         systems that often have to perform reasoning tasks which                        classical logics cannot handle naturally.  These logics have                    been used as tools to explore areas such as reasoning with                      uncertainty, temporal reasoning, as well as reasoning with                      inconsistent information.                                                                                                                                       This research will examine frameworks for automated deduction                   in Annotated Logics.  The adaptation of a resolution proof                      procedure will be studied for another class of Multiple-Valued                  Logics, call Signed Formulas to perform automated reasoning in                  Annotated Logics.  Based on this study, a unifying proof                        theoretic framework will be developed for the various classes                   of Annotated Logics.  The question of efficiency and control                    strategies for reducing the search space of the inference                       rules will be investigated, and a prototype system based on                     the theoretical results will be implemented.",
