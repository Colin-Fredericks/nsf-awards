This work will involve the students              in a comprehensive research program relative to movement and                    dispersion of contaminants and treatment of contaminated media to               minimize potential damage to the environment.  This research                    program will engage students in different areas of research                     relative to movement and treatment of contaminants.  The research               will be conducted in the following areas: environmental sciences                (environmental biology, environmental physics, and environmental                chemistry; environmental engineering (environmental modeling and                process design); environmental ethics.",
