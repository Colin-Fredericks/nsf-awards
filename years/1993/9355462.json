The UCI, a  collaborative of key city stakeholders, has assisted in the  planning process and has helped to identify key strategies that  will lead to systemic reform in mathematics and science education.  The UCI planning team will agree upon actions to implement a shared  vision and will solicit endorsement from cooperating institutions.    Planning grant goals are: to identify the needs of the diverse  communities served by the school system; to involve key  stakeholders in exploring the constructivist learning theory; to  collect and interpret base line data; to identify and prioritize  the use of fiscal resources; to build consensus for a vision of  mathematics and science education; and to prepare and submit a  comprehensive USI proposal for New York City Schools.    Three groups (USI Systemic Management Team; USI Cabinet; and USI  Working Groups) will be convened to assist in the implementation of  the self-study.",
