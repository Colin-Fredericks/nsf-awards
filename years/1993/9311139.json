 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311139  Kirkpatrick    Several species of lizards from the South Pacific have green  blood. This green coloration is the result of the accumulation of  the bile pigment biliverdin. Bile pigments are toxic to virtually  all vertebrates producing the pathological condition known as  jaundice. An understanding of how these lizards are able to  withstand large concentrations of biliverdin may provide insight  into the pathological nature of bile pigments in other  vertebrates including humans. This same group of lizards has  evolved several different types of adhesive toe pads. These toe  pads are so adhesive that they can climb on smooth vertical  surfaces such as glass. By measuring the adhesive abilities of  different microstructures for different species we can understand  the relationship between different morphologies and mechanisms of  adhesion. Knowledge of the evolutionary relationships of these  lizards is critical to understanding patterns of morphological  and physiological evolution.  ***",
