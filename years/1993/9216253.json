Prabhu of the                                       Centre for Atmospheric Sciences at the Indian                                   Institute of Science (ISc)in Bangalore.  They                                   plan to study the atmospheric boundary layer                                    and the land surface processes in the tropics                                   with special emphasis on applications to                                        agriculture and air pollution meteorological                                    aspects and climate modeling.  Specific                                         objectives are:  study the mean and turbulent                                   structure of convective boundary layer in the                                   tropics; study the mean and turbulent structure                                 of the nocturnal boundary layer in the tropics                                  which is normally associated with stable                                        conditions with very limited diffusion and can                                  lead to high ground concentrations of                                           pollutants; study the evapo-transpiration                                       processes under different crop and planetary                                    boundary layer (PBL) conditions; study the                                      effect of the changes in the coriolis parameter                                 on the PBL processes with particular emphasis                                   on the nocturnal layer; and determine methods                                   of incorporating these processes in mesoscale                                   numerical methods.                                                                                                                                              Scope:  The two scientists have been                                            interacting for about four years including a                                    sabbatical by Dr. Raman at the IISc.  They both                                 have extensive qualifications in the research                                   topics, and the two institutes have extensive                                   capabilities to support the research.                                           Bangalore has recently been selected by the                                     Government of India for establishing a national                                 center for boundary layer studies with a 300                                    meter tower, which should aid this research.                                    The area of study is useful in predicting                                       diffusion of pollutants under various                                           conditions, and should be of benefit to the                                     U.S. and India.",
