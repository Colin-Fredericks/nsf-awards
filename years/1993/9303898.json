Work from many laboratories has demonstrated the  requirement for translation in the degradation of mRNAs, and  understanding the relationship between these two processes is a  major challenge for this field.  One clear example of this  relationship is the observation that nonsense mutations accelerate  the decay rates of mRNAs 10- to 20-fold.  We have demonstrated that  the product of the UPF1 gene is involved in this pathway.  Deletion  of the UPF1 gene from the yeast chromosome completely abrogates the  accelerated decay of nonsense-containing mRNAs without affecting  the decay of wild-type transcripts.  The DNA sequence of the UPF1  gene has been determined and demonstrated to contain several  sequence motifs and regions of homology with other genes that may  suggest several putative activities, including:  1) an NTP binding  and hydrolysis motif(s), 2) an RNA helicase motif, 3) Zinc-finger  motifs and 4) sequence homology with the SEN1 gene, whose protein  product is the noncatalytic subunit of the tRNA splicing  endonuclease.  Biochemical analysis of the Upf1 protein has  revealed that it is polysome-associated and that the decay rates of  nonsense-containing mRNAs in extracts prepared from UPF1+ and upf1-  strains recapitulate the results observed in cells.  Based on these  observations, the objective of this proposal is to genetically  characterize the UPF1 gene in order to begin to identify its role  in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway.  Mutations in the UPF1  gene will be isolated and their alleles will be characterized to  determine the effect of these mutations on the decay of nonsense-  containing mRNAs.  %%%  Proper cellular growth and differentiation is determined by the  regulated expression of the genetic material within the cell.  The  control of gene expression has been studied intensively in many  organisms and ha s been demonstrated to be controlled at multiple  points from transcriptional initiation to protein stability.   Recently, it has become clear that the decay rates of mRNAs are  regulated and play an important role in controlling gene  expression.  The decay rates of mRNAs vary from each other by more  than fifty-fold.  In addition, mRNA decay can be modulated  depending upon multiple factors including the stage of the cell  cycle, cellular differentiation and reponses to hormones.  The  mechanisms which are responsible for determining either the  intrinsic decay rate of an mRNA or the regulation of that rate are  largely unknown.  It is the goal of my laboratory to identify both  cis-acting sequences and trans-acting factors which regulate mRNA  stability.  ***",
