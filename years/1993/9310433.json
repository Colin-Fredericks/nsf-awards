 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310433  McLaughlin       In his work on algebraic K-theory, Beilinson introduced  characteristic classes for holomorphic bundles, which refine the  usual Chern classes.  At present, they cannot be constructed  directly from a given bundle and are poorly understood.   McLaughlin will attempt to remedy this by finding explicit  formulae for the Beilinson classes.  This work will lead to a new  interpretation of polylogarithms in terms of multicategories.  He  also expects to shed new light on Bloch's conjecture concerning  characteristic classes of flat bundles.  His methods are inspired  by the degree three non-abelian cohomology recently defined by  Breen.  This geometric technique will also be used to attack some  \"classical\" problems in topology, e.g., lifting group actions in  bundles with non-abelian structure group.       This research project has important implications for  several areas of mathematics and physics.  In number theory,  there is the two hundred-year-old problem of finding the values  of Riemann's zeta function at odd whole numbers.  Some of these  unknown values are related to the Beilinson classes, and this  project will lead to a better understanding of the subject.   Furthermore, the research provides a framework for understanding  the emerging area of non-abelian geometry.  This encompasses such  diverse areas as the classification of three-dimensional spaces  (a problem known as the Poincare conjecture) and even quantum  physics (in particular, string theory).  The project's unifying  approach has already yielded new insights, and there is the  promise of more to come.  ***",
