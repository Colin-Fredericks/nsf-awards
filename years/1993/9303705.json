 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many scientific hypotheses the researcher can specify a  directional effect:  a treatment is believed to improve health, a  new teaching method is believed to improve learning, an increase  in dosage is believed to have an increasing effect up to a  certain (possibly unknown) toxicity point and then a decreasing  effect.  Many statistical methods ignore this directional  information, which results in a loss of statistical power and  efficiency.  Our major goal in this research is to develop very  general approaches to the computation of estimates and tests  along with assessments of the standard errors of the estimates  and the error rates of the tests.  The research has three main  thrusts:  First, the analysis of general algorithms such as  Dykstra's generalization of von Neumann's alternating projections  method.  Second, the development and implementation of smoothing  and fitting algorithms to use on data that arise in experiments  with order restrictions on the parameters.  And third, the  construction of statistical estimation and testing methods with  attendant error rates for research hypotheses that entail  directional effects.  Often in scientific investigations the researcher expects a  directional effect, but cannot justify a specific mathematical  function as a relationship.  For example, the yield of a crop can  reasonably be expected to increase if the amount of fertilizer  applied is increased (at least within a certain range).  The fact  that there is a directional relationship is obvious here, but the  exact nature of the relationship is far from obvious.  Our goal  is to develop methods that make use of directional effects so  that more efficient use may be made of experimental data.  We  will develop computer algorithms to fit data in ways that obey  directional effects, and use statistical and mathematical theory  to study the properties of our fitting methods.",
