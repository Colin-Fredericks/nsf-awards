 "awd_abstract_narration": "9215331  Childers      This is the second year of a three year continuing award to  investigate three major topics in the area of speech synthesis.   The first deals with improving the resolution of existing models of  several voice types such as modal register, vocal fry, falsetto,  and breathy, and extending them to additional types such as hoarse  and harsh.  These models will be used to investigate the relation  between voice production features and aspects of the acoustic  signal through the use of interactive, high quality, formant speech  synthesis.  The second aspect of the research deals with refining  the articulatory speech synthesizer to allow the models of voice  types to be related to speech production physiology, e.g.,  articulator position and movement, and vocal fold vibration motion.    The third aspect is to develop quantitative measures of speech  quality and vocal function.  Anticipated areas of exploration  include the quantification of glottal flow waveform and its  spectral characteristics corresponding to variations in vocal  quality.  Additionally, the vocal fold mass and length, the  aperiodicity of the vocal fold motion, and the glottal area will be  related to aspects of vocal quality.  A unique characteristic of  the models developed is their interactivity, that allows the user  to adjust features of the models related to physiological  characteristics of the speech production process.  This allows the  user of the model to test new hypotheses related to voice  production by adjusting parameters in the model.  Two possible  areas of application are the development to training aids for the  hearing impaired and the design of speech codes based on  articulatory movements.",
