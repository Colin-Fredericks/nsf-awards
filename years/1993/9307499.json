 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hwang will work on two areas in statistics: a theory  concerning  the conditional analysis and a theory about prediction based on a  measurement error model. In the first part of the proposal, the  principal investigator proposes to examine the estimated  confidence approach by applying it to the Fieller's problem and  by relating it to Fisher's exact tests for contingency tables.  The second part of the research will focus on construction of  prediction intervals based on measurement error models, which  arise in many applications.  The examples that motivate the  principal investigator in this research are about the prediction  problems of compressive strengths of concrete based on  nondestructive tests.  The principal investigator will work on two areas:  conditional  inference and prediction.  For the first area, Hwang shall  determine which statistical procedures for evaluating the  probability of a particular event can take advantage of lucky  data better than others; in other words, which procedures work  better conditionally.  The event involved refers to whether a  particular interval (based on data) covers some ratios of unknown  parameters.  In the second area, Hwang's focus will be on  prediction by intervals, where the studies are more applicable to  U.S. society. The aim of the research is to construct a  prediction interval for the compressive strength of a wall, a  bridge, or a building based on a nondestructive method such as  pulse velocity of penetrating sound waves.  Success of this  project may help to determine, without destroying any part of the  bridge, whether the bridge is weak enough that it causes concern.",
