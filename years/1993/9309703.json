 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates how cooperating agents in real-world                 domains can select the most useful information to communicate to                others.  The research focuses on communication between agents in                distributed systems performing complex, problem-solving tasks.                  Here, only partial knowledge of other agents is available, and                  agents have limited computational resources for communication.  To              address these constraints, the researchers will examine how an                  agent's knowledge of its own use of information can indicate the                value of that information to other agents.  Heuristics will be                  developed to evaluate the usefulness of a given piece of                        information based on how that information is used or inferred as an             agent performs its problem-solving task.  These heuristics will be              integrated into the communication system for AUV's that is being                developed at the University of New Hampshire.  The research will                contribute to the ability of AUV's to work together, as well as                 providing insights into how other distributed systems and natural               language interfaces can select useful information to communicate.//",
