Manipulation of the levels of ethylene in plants,  either by increasing or decreasing ethylene production rates, is a  useful option applicable to the optimization of many agricultural  systems.  It has been established that ethylene is biosynthesized  from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) via 1-aminocyclopropane-1-  carboxylic acid (ACC), and the reactions are catalyzed by two  unique enzymes, ACC synthase and ACC oxidase.  The aim of the  present project is to obtain further information about the  mechanism and regulation of ethylene biosynthesis which can be used  to establish a theoretical basis from  which ethylene production by  crop plants and its physiological consequences can be regulated via  biotechnology.  Our primary objectives of this proposed project  are: (a) to characterize the nature of the rapid turnover of ACC  synthase in plant tissue, (b) to isolate tomato ACC synthase genes  that are specifically expressed by auxin application, and to  characterize both coding and regulatory sequence regions, (c) to  study the correlation between structure and function of ACC  synthase using site-directed mutagenesis of amino acid residues  putatively involved in binding the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate,  (d) to further characterize the activation of Acc oxidase by Co2  and to identify the activation site of the enzyme, (e) to study the  mode of high temperature and chilling stress on the inhibition of  ACC oxidase, and (f) to elucidate subcellular localization of ACC  oxidase using gold-immuno labeling techniques.  %%%  Ethylene is a plant hormone regulating many aspects of plant growth  and development, and its effects are commercially important in  agriculture.
