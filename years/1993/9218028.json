 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                   between Professor Richard D. Burkhart of the University of Nevado,              Reno and Professor Masahide Yamamoto of the University of Kyoto.                The goal of this research project is to evaluate the role of                    triplet-triplet annihilations as a viable mechanism of charge                   carrier generation in vinylaromatic polymers as well as small                   molecules present as molecular dopants in inert polymer matrices.               The polymers and small molecule analogues will be synthesized in                Professor Yamamoto's group, while transient absorption spectroscopy             on laser excited solutions and solid films of the polymers will be              carried out by Professor Burkhart's group to determine the identity             of any transients observed, looking especially for transient ions.              These experiments will be carried out over a range of temperatures              from 10K to ambient.  To evaluate rates of decay of the transient               species, nanosecond kinetic measurements will be carried out at the             University of Kyoto.  When both ion and triplet decay signals can               be observed simultaneously, it will be possible to determine                    whether or not a relationship exists between the formation of                   transient ions and the occurrence of triplet-triplet annihilations.",
