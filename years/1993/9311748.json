The LINGUIST List is an Internet  discussion forum for academic linguists, which is distributed from  Texas A&M University and moderated by Anthony Aristar (Texas A&M)  and Helen Dry (Eastern Michigan University).  In its 26 months of  existence it has experienced extremely rapid growth in both  subscribers and functions.    LINGUIST provides an already-established and fully functional means  of communicating effectively with members of the discipline across  the world; and its success demonstrates the viability of the  electronic medium as a means of stimulating linguistic research.   However, LINGUIST needs to be made more efficient, as its expansion  has already overburdened its current editorial resources.  If it is  to continue, LINGUIST needs to be made more efficient, as its  expansion has already overburdened its current editorial resources.   If it is to continue, LINGUIST must have editing software that is  easy to learn and designed specifically for the intelligent  handling of large volumes of mail.  Part of the current project's  budget, then, will be spent in producing software specifically  aimed at improving LINGUIST's mail and data handling capabilities;  and part will go toward the creation of self-instructional  materials (for example, a computer tutorial) for training new  student assistants on LINGUIST.  ***",
