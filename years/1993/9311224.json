However, little is known about the linkages between them and the benefits of combining them to improve upland farming systems and to slow down deforestation.  This study proposes to examine the linkages between LKS and AF (1) by documenting folk taxonomy and traditional management practices of trees, food crops, and soils among the Subanun and Visayan farmers in the southwestern Philippines; and (2) by comparing the differential distribution of this technical knowledge by age, gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity.    The researcher will use archival research, participant observation, informal, and formal interviews to collect primary data.  In addition, semantic domain analysis, a linguistic technique,  will be used to analyze qualitative data.  This study will enhance of our understanding in the linkage of local knowledge systems and agroforestry.  This will also make a basic contribution to the study of intracultural variation.  The applied significance is its potential contribution to an improved design of agroforestry projects that increase food production of the upland farmers and forest occupants, while slowing down the process of deforestation.  ***  bert J.
