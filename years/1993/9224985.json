 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the Undergraduate Internship Program in High-                  Performance Computing in Fluid Dynamics at the University of                    Minnesota is to promote and help support undergraduate involvement              in ongoing and new research on high-performance computing in fluid              dynamics, and in new software development efforts for scientific                computing and graphics support for such research.  The program                  provides a special opportunity for undergraduates to participate                in the research programs and enrich their experience.                           Undergraduates will work with faculty on a wide variety of projects             on high-performance computing in fluid dynamics.  Faculty from                  various disciplines have individually contributed projects on a                 variety of closely related topics in fluid dynamics and will be                 responsible for supervising undergraduate students.  The program                will be administered by the Minnesota Supercomputer Institute and               will be open to undergraduate student participants who are citizens             or permanent residents of the United States and its possessions.                The projects are unified by their common elements of high-                      performance computing and graphics development for the fluid                    dynamics applications.",
