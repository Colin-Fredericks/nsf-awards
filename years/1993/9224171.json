 "awd_abstract_narration": "With increasing genetic knowledge of a wide range of                            organisms, there has been a surge of interest in the                            potential for conflicts of interest within the genome.                          Examples include 'imprinted genes', whose expression                            depends on whether they were inherited from mother or                           father, transposable genes that can \"jump\" around the                           genome, and increase their representation by inserting                          copies of themselves in other genes, and \"selfish\"                              meiotic drive genes that can increase their own                                 inheritance by destroying their homologous                                      counterparts.  Little is known of how common such                               conflicts are, or how strong a role they play in the                            dynamics and evolution of the genome.  t haplotypes in                          mice are one of the best studied examples of meiotic                            drive.  Much is known about how drive occurs                                    genetically, yet very little is known about its                                 ecological or evolutionary dynamics in wild mice                                populations.  This study will contribute significantly                          to this knowledge by (1) surveying how widespread t                             haplotypes are in wild mice, and (2) examining the role                         that population structure and gene flow play on the                             persistence and spread of t haplotypes, through                                 experimental introductions of t haplotypes to an island                         and barn population of mice.                                                                                                                                    Knowledge gained from such detailed studies of mice                             populations may additionally be useful to studies of                            the biological control of mice.  Mice are still an                              expensive pest animal in most farming regions of                                America, particularly in fed storage and in large scale                         automated operations such as poultry farming.                                   Moreover, in some countries, such as the cereal growing                         regions of Australia and China, they still show                                 periodic outbursts reaching plague proportions.                                 Biological methods of control that have been attempted                          to prevent these outbursts include introducing t                                haplotypes, which carry lethal alleles, to mice                                 populations, and through introductions of parasites to                          mice.  The effectiveness of such methods often depends                          on knowledge of the rates of transmission and on                                knowledge of social structure and gene flow.",
