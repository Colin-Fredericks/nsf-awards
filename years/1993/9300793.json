It is a study of educational                    transitions in the physical sciences and engineering among women                and minorities, following a life course perspective.  One dataset               will be an existing longitudinal survey of young people, called                 High School and Beyond, which tracks the life histories of 60,000               high school students interviewed at two year intervals throughout               the 1980s.  Another dataset will be assembled by the present                    investigators from a sample of entering students in a large school              of engineering, and will permit closer examination of social-                   psychological factors that shape careers in engineering.                                                                                                             This study will contribute to the sociology of science,                    gender, minorities, and careers, and it will also provide important             information for deciding public policy concerning the scientific                and engineering workforce.  In addition to the scientific gains to              be achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a                highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.                   dissertation.  Thus it contributes to future scientific manpower                and the thorough training of the next generation of sociologists.",
