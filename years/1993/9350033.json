The Compact was adopted by the Board of Regents in March 1991 and  specifies high expectations, standards, and outcomes  for grades  K-12.  The Compact is an open-ended plan for continuing school  district reassessment and innovation.      A common RFP will be developed and schools in each of the six  districts will be selected as Research and Development (R and D)  schools to provide high-level content and assessment for all  students, and long-term teacher development programs.  Districts  will establish local partnerships with the mathematics/science  communities, parents, and business and industry in support of the  initiative.  The State will provide additional resources to  support the effort through State field-based assistance teams,  staff development, a new school accreditation program that  focuses on teaching and learning, and coordination with existing  programs aimed at at-risk students.  Results and strategies from  the R and D schools will inform future State policy action.   ***",
