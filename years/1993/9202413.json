 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study thin siloxane and epoxy                           polymeric films which will be spin cast as linear chains onto                   a variety of substrates (sapphire, BK7 glass, and silica) to                    thicknesses of 50 nm to several microns, and then crosslinked                   to form a rigid structure. The study focuses specifically on                    the mechanisms by which these films uptake solvent, and how                     solvent permeation and swelling affects the adhesion of the                     film to the substrate, and the membrane mechanics.                                                                                                                   Solvent permeation will be studied using total internal                    reflectance fluorescence  (TIRF), a technique in which the                      substrate onto which the film is adhered is placed on an                        optical prism, and a laser beam impinges at a  grazing angle                    to the substrate /polymer film surface producing  an                            exponentially decaying evanescent wave which penetrates                         through the film. By varying the angle of incidence, different                  penetration depths can be achieved. Using TIRF,  two types of                   experiments will be undertaken.   In the first, diffusion of a                  free dye into an equilibrium swollen film or a partially                        swollen film will be followed by placing a chromophore on the                   dye. The radiation due to the evanescent wave causes the                        chromophore to fluoresce, and by detection of the total                         fluorescence of the film as a function of the penetration                       depth (by changing the grazing angle), the dye concentration                    can be computed by deconvolution (cf. eq. 3). By repeating the                  TIRF angling as a function of time, the time dependent                          concentration profile of the dye can be constructed.  In the                    second type of experiment,  the polymer network of an                           unswollen film will be tagged. The face of the film will then                   be exposed to a permeating solvent, and as the film swells due                  to the solvent uptake, the polymer chains will deform and the                   concentration of the tag will vary.  Again, by using time                       resolved TIRF angling, the time dependent concentration                         profile of the labels can be computed, and from these, insight                  into the spatial distribution of the labels during swelling                     can be obtained. The dynamical mechanical response of the                       membrane will be measured, and a microhardness tester will be                   used to determine the bond between the polymer film and the                     substrate.",
