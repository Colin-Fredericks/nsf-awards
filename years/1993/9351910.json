 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351910  Rogers  We have acquired a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) for use  by undergraduates in supervised laboratory course work, in  classroom demonstrations and for scheduled use in undergraduate  independent research projects.  The STM offers new and  dramatically better ways to introduce students to the physics  of materials and to the basic quantum mechanical nature of our  world.  However, because the STM technique is quite new, its  use in physics and chemistry courses is extremely rare.  We are  harnessing the instructional potential of STM by integrating it  into our undergraduate curriculum.  We are initially  implementing this plan in three specific ways.  First, we  introduce a set of quantitative STM experiments for use in our  senior level experimental laboratory course.  We are designing  a laboratory section in which the students explore quantum  mechanical tunneling and learn how it can be used to study the  properties of materials.  Second, we are developing two  classroom demonstrations which use the STM to illustrate the  atomic structure of surfaces and molecules respectively.   Third, we are tapping the potential of STM for high quality  hands-on research experience for undergraduates by scheduling  the use of the STM for undergraduate independent research  projects.  We believe that it is important to bring modern  research results into the classroom as soon as it is practical  to do so.  We are integrating the new field of molecular  imaging and manipulation into our curriculum to give students  a more concrete understanding both of our physical world and  the fundamental principles underlying modern technology.  ***",
