 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313449  Halperin  The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern  University has exceedingly strong basic research programs  and wishes to place them into advanced research environments  by renovating their laboratories.  This award allows  Northwestern to modernize 11,300 square feet of research  space in order to provide  a state-of-the-art environment  for advanced research in experimental condensed-matter  physics and the design and construction of advanced  detectors for use in condensed-matter physics and  astrophysics.  This modernization will take place in the  Technological Building that has not been renovated in 50  years.  The renovated laboratories will include clean-room  environments, facilities for device fabrication, once-  through air handling, and state-of-the-art vibration  isolation.  These improvements will greatly improve the  department's research and graduate training programs in  ultra-low-temperature physics, NMR studies of advanced  materials, mesoscopic physics, device fabrication, Langmuir  films, and the study of nonlinear optics.  ***",
