 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306909   Fisher        This research will determine the effect of spatial   configuration on nutrient retention in stream-riparian   ecosystems.  Streams are complex, heterogeneous systems   consisting of a wetted channel, saturated sediments below and   adjacent to the wetted channel, and a strip of terrestrial   vegetation (the riparian zone) at each lateral edge.  The extent    and shape of each of these varies greatly in space and time.  As    water flows downstream, it moves to varying degrees among these   components.  Because of several favorable properties, streams of    arid lands will be used as model systems for this study.        The overall goal of this project is to determine how   configuration affects the extent to which materials transported   in this water are retained and recycled within a given reach.    This goal will be met by addressing four questions around which   the research is organized.  First, how does spatial pattern   influence nutrient retention?  Spatial configuration and its   effects will initially be considered for a single point in time.     This will be accomplished by mapping the stream ecosystem a two   scales to determine its physical configuration, describing   hydrologic connections among these elements, and the consequences    of flow path for retention of nutrients.  Configuration will be   manipulated experimentally to determine the effect of different   patterns on the retention process.  Second, how does disturbance    affect this relationship?  Several individual flash flood and   drought events will be studied in terms of their effect on   configuration and recovery of system function between events.    Third, how do configuration and function interact over large   spatial and temporal scales?  This analysis will involve scaling    up reach-scale processes to include geomorphic variation   generated by valley floor width.  Temporal scaling will be   accomplished by considering the effect of variable flood and   drought regimes;  their frequency , intensity, and distribution in    time.  Fourth, how general are results derived from North   American desert streams for this ecosystem type worldwide?  This    question will be answered with a comparative study of the   pattern-process relationship among streams of similar deserts in    Australia and Spain.   %%%   This research is significant in that it will contribute to basic    scientific understanding of how pattern and process interact in   complex ecosystems.  It is an advance over black box, well-mixed    reactor models that have been commonly used in ecosystem ecology.     Research results will be useful to applied ecology as well.    Streams are open systems which link terrestrial uplands with   downstream reservoirs, groundwater supplies, or estuaries.    Retention and transformation of stream load in transit affects   the quality of water delivered to recipient systems.  Riparian   and other wetland ecosystems are increasingly used for this   \"nutrient filtration\" capacity.  Results of this research will   aid in understanding this process in natural streams and   optimizing it in managed and human-designed systems.   ***",
