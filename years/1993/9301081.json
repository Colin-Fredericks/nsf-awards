The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Derek J.                                     Koehler to the Medical Research Council -                                       Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, to work                                     with Dr. Alan Baddeley.                                                                                                                                         Their research topic is the relationship                                        between the active set of hypotheses in working                                 memory and the judged probability of these                                      hypotheses.  They will investigate how the                                      processes of hypothesis generation and                                          probability judgement fit into the well-                                        established framework of working memory                                         developed by Dr. Baddeley and his colleagues.                                   Recent studies show that people's probability                                   judgements are nonextensional, not constrained                                  by rules of set inclusion.  This implies that                                   any descriptive model of subjective probability                                 must account for such judgements in terms of                                    the individual's representation of the events                                   or possibilities under consideration.  Dr.                                      Baddeley's working memory model suggests a                                      potential research program for the empirical                                    study of subjective probability and provides a                                  larger context in which to frame the problem.                                   Such research will allow empirical testing of                                   the theory that people normalize or adjust                                      their probability estimates only with respect                                   to the evidential support received by those                                     hypotheses that are active in working memory.                                   This approach should also yield insight into                                    the more general issue of how people generate                                   and evaluate novel hypotheses under conditions                                  of uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                 The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel and a stipend for                                    twelve months.",
