In view of this progress and recent developments of                   computer hardware and general purpose software, there is a need to              access the current state of art and results from different schools              of thought, with the objective of focusing trends in future                     research.  This Advanced Study Institute (ASI) will bring together              developers of different segments of these schools of thought as                 lecturers, with advanced design engineers and researchers as                    students, for the purpose of presentation, refinement, and                      publication of a comprehensive work on different methodologies in               Computer Aided Analysis of Rigid and Flexible Mechanical Systems.",
