 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests continuing support for a broad spectrum of               modeling activities concentrating on the high speed transport of                polar into the magnetosphere and on ionosphere-plasmasphere                     coupling.  Specifically, support is requested for the following                 major research areas:                                                           1.  The use our hydrodynamic three ion species (H+,He+,O+) polar                wind model to reproduce observations of the classical polar wind                under changing geophysical conditions with special attention to                 modeling the He+ dominated transient outflows.  Individual polar                wind and upwelling ions events will be also modeled and compared                the observations.  These comparisons will be done in cooperation                with Drs. M. Blanc, M.O. Chandler, J.M. Grebowsky, and T.E. Moore.              2.  Further studies of the ionosphere-plasmasphere system with our              ionosphere to conjugate ionosphere model.  Specific studies include             the investigation of solar cycle and seasonal variations in                     plasmaspheric parameters, the effects of variations in atmospheric              neutral hydrogen on plasmaspheric densities and modeling the                    effects of substorms on the coupled ionosphere-plasmasphere system.             3.  A multispecies model will be developed based on a gyrotropic                twenty moment approximation.  The coupled time-dependent 20 moment              transport equations will be solved with a second order accurate                 (both space and time) Godunov-type upwind differencing technique                with dimensional splitting.  The numerical scheme itself is being               developed with the support of the NASA Space Physics Theory                     Program; however, its application to polar wind and plasmaspheric               flows is to be carried out in the framework of this proposal.",
