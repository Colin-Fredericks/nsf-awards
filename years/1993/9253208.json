 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Highline School District of Seattle, Washington, has                        been a leader in the use of hands on science kits in                            elementary schools.  Virtually all teachers in all schools                      rely on a series of experiential learning modules for                           science instruction.  The district now plans to replace                         their current system of paper-and-pencil student assessment                     with \"authentic assessment\", which uses student performance                     products (portfolios, discussion, simulations, etc.) as data                    for evaluation by teachers.  Testing would change from a                        separate activity to one that is embedded in the                                instruction.  Teachers will be exposed to a variety of                          approaches to authentic assessment and the research that has                    been done on each.  With the guidance of specialists on                         performance assessment, the teachers will develop assessment                    techniques that fit into each kit module.                                                                                                                       Many simultaneous benefits will accrue from this change.                        Teachers will gain greater insight into each student's                          abilities and needs, and the methods used for assessment                        will become better aligned with the educational goals of the                    district.  Teachers will also work with volunteer scientists                    in developing assessment plans, thereby increasing their                        understanding of the true nature of scientific inquiry as                       well as of specific content areas.  The implementation of                       performance assessment throughout the Highline District                         constitutes a unique and important experiment that has the                      potential for very wide impact.                                                                                                                                 Cost sharing on this project represents 29% of the NSF                          contribution.",
