 "awd_abstract_narration": "A massively parallel computing system which will be dedicated              to support research in computer science will be purchased.  The                 equipment will be used for several research projects including in               particular:                                                                                                                                                     Signal processing and data analysis employing fast Fourier                      transform algorithms for non-abelian groups and homogeneous spaces              and wavelet and other phase space techniques.  Experimentation with             parallel implementation is an important new direction for this                  work.  Applications in medical imaging are emerging from this                   effort.                                                                                                                                                         Building a prototype checkpointing system for multiprocessor file               systems on massively parallel computers, with follow-on-research in             interfaces, caching and prefetching, workload studies, and remote               heterogeneous file system access.                                                                                                                               Development of virtual memory for data-parallel computing with                  applications in scientific computing.                                                                                                                           Applications in image processing involving ongoing projects in                  human brain labeling, fossil leaf classification, handwriting                   analysis, and simulation of visual attention.                                                                                                                   Implementation of PRAM algorithms aimed at elimination of                       concurrent references to memory in implementations on a massively               parallel synchronous computer, using techniques taken from work of              the current researchers in new algorithms for the PRAM model.",
