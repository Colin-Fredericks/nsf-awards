 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workplace safety problems have played a significant role in US                  history since the onset of industrialization in the mid-nineteenth              century.  Workplace accidents and their prevention are crucial                  factors in the evolution of, among other things, technological                  development, labor organization and tort law.  This project                     focusses particularly on changing scientific, legal and popular                 explanations for why industrial accidents occur: how different                  groups at different times have understood the causes of accidents               in different ways and how they have translated that changing                    knowledge into demands for legal reform has been a significant                  catalyst for the growth of American liability law in general since              the 1850's.  Existing scholarship in labor history, however, has                all but ignored the role of accidents and of accident liability law             in determining the nature of factory production, while the legal                and scientific literature on industrial health and safety has paid              little attention to the role of culture and politics in determining             what factors the law has been able to recognize as significant                  threats to industrial health and safety.  This study aims to                    synthesize those two bodies of knowledge so as to answer that                   question, and to analyze the critical role that industrial                      accidents and disease have played in American economic development.                                                                                             The study will rely on extensive research into workers'                         compensation decisions and the case law on industrial accidents in              several states from the late nineteenth century to the present.                 Primary sources in labor history such as the labor press, union                 archives, and the personal records of individual workers will show              how accidents and disease figured in the lives of industrial                    workers and how they attributed responsibility for them.  To                    explain changes in common sense notions of causality and their                  application to workplace safety problems, the study will rely on                contemporary works in physics, economics, psychology, anthropology,             law, and industrial hygiene.  The study will show how the law both              reflects and contributes to accepted notions about causality in the             natural and social sciences.  It will clarify the theoretical and               practical problems that underlie ongoing crises in tort and                     administrative law where the control of hazardous technology is at              issue.",
