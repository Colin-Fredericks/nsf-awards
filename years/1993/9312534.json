 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312534  Bean    This three-year continuing award is augmenting the basic research  program of Lehigh University's Industry/University Cooperative  Research Center for Innovation Management Studies.  This funding is  provided under the \"Self-Sufficient Partnership for Research\"  Program.  The Center continues to meet the renewal criteria  requirements of the Industry/University Cooperative Research  Centers Program.    Funding for an evaluator to study the industry/university  interaction occurring in the Center is part of the three-year  continuing award.    Additional funding is provided for a woman undergraduate to augment  the Center's research program.  She will study \"Technology Transfer  in the Construction Industry.\"    A woman Professor from Brandeis University is being funded as a  Research Opportunity Award (ROA) to study \"Downsizing Industrial  R&D:  Effects on the Work Environment for Creativity and  Innovation.\"    The U.S. Department of Energy's Environmental Restoration and Waste  Management Office is providing funds to obtain a non-voting  membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends Lehigh University be awarded:   $28,000 for the first year of a three-year continuing award  (includes $8,000 for the evaluator); $4,000 for one year for a  woman undergraduate student; $20,006 for one year for a ROA to  Brandeis University; and $10,000 for one year with funds provided  by the U.S. Department of Energy.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Center Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the industry/university is developing; 2) the extent to which  the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a robust  research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the  Program Manager will recommend support for the next period of this  continuing award.",
