 "awd_abstract_narration": "This second conference on Chromatin and Transcription is to be held             under the auspices of the Federation of American Societies of                   Experimental Biology (FASEB) June 27-July 2 in Copper Mountain,                 Colorado.  Participation will be limited to 150 scientists                      (including speakers and moderators), selected on the basis of their             expertise and interest in this area and their expected contribution             to the success of the program.  It will be the second meeting                   entirely devoted to Chromatin and Transcription:  the critical                  analysis of our current understanding of how nuclear organization               contributes to gene regulation and the evaluation of the most                   fruitful avenues for further investigation.  The Conference will                consist of nine sessions, each with three or four speakers and a                discussion leader, selected among investigators who have made                   seminal contributions to the field and from younger investigators               in the program.  The participation of established and promising                 female scientists and minority scientists will be actively                      encouraged.  This meeting on \"Chromatin and Transcription\" should               serve as a catalyst for stimulating the interest of scientists who              may already have the tools in hand to approach gene regulation in               the context of nuclear structure, with focus upon those young                   scientists who are yet to initiate a major area of independent                  research.                                                                       %%%                                                                             This meeting of scientists will discuss how the molecular structure             of genes is involved in the cellular production of enzymes and                  other proteins.  It is important to know what is different in the               structure of genes that are actively producing blueprints for the               production of proteins versus other genes that are not active in                this manner.  Understanding the chromatin structure is considered               a key aspect in this field.  This area of genetics has rapidly                  progressed over the past few years and this conference will bring               the best talent available for the exchange of information.",
