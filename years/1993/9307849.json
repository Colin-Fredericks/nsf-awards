Pressure  will be used to perturb the local bonding environments of Cr3+,  Tm3+, and Ho3+ in YAG, and experiments will be conducted to  monitor the effects of pressure on optical properties.  The  effect of pressure on the dopant bonding environment will be  characterized so that structure-property correlations for YAG  based solid state laser materials can be developed.  Absorption,  excitation, cw photoluminescence, and time-resolved  photoluminescence experiments will be performed as a function of  pressure.  The effect of pressure on energy levels and  splittings, optical transition intensities, luminescence  lifetimes and efficiencies, and ion-ion energy transfer processes  will be characterized.  Processes to be studied include  Cr3+-Tm3+, Cr3+-Ho3+, and Tm3+-Ho3+ energy transfer, Tm3+-Tm3+  energy migration and cross-relaxation, and Ho3+ upconversion.  %%%  This research aims to improve fundamental understanding of solid  state laser materials.  These materials are important in  applications in the areas of medicine, optical fiber  communications, solar energy, and imaging.  High pressure will be  used to modify material structure, and changes in optical  properties as a function of pressure will be studied  experimentally.  The research is expected to provide the  molecular information needed to understand the relationship of  chemical composition and structure to the laser properties of  garnet based materials.  ***",
