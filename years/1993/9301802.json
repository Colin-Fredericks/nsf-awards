 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Indiana Higher Education Telecommunication System (IHETS)              on behalf of its member institutions, is encouraging participation              in the data network for all higher education institutions in                    Indiana and their constituents, including public libraries,                     hospitals, governmental agencies, extension centers, and business               with research and educational needs for connectivity.                           Additionally, IHETS is working with the Indiana Department of                   Education to provide experimentation opportunities for schools via              linkage with the Department's dial-access system. IDEAnet.                           This proposal requests partial funding for participation in                NSFNET through a connection with CICNET, the regional network                   attaching to NSFNET in the Indiana Area as well as partial start-up             funds for the necessary routers, circuits, and operating support to             facilitate the fullest possible participation.  The educational                 institutions that will participate include:  Grace College,                     Huntington College, Indiana Vocational Technical College, Indiana               Wesleyan University, Purdue University North Central, and Taylor                University-Fort Wayne.                                                               The network initially consists of a redundant T1 backbone                  linking nodes at four of the larger campuses, 56 kbs DDS end nodes,             and connection to CICNET and NSFNET via Indiana University.  Phase              2 will extend the backbone and add the six new colleges mentioned               above.  The network is beginning with the vendor-independent TCP/IP             standard, with the expectation of future migrations to the OSI                  protocol when appropriate.  The network will extend throughout                  Indiana to provide affordable access to Internet resources and                  enhance the state's information infrastructure, particularly                    important in small towns and rural communities.",
