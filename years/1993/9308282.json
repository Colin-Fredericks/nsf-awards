 "awd_abstract_narration": "Yuzhuo Li  9308282    The objective of this work is to use heterogenous semiconductor  systems for photocatalytic organic synthesis.  Emphasis is on  intermediates useful in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, polymer,  and dye industries.  Reactor configurations that are energy  efficient and cost effective are designed and new semiconductor  systems are tested.  Specific tasks include applications of  photocatalytic reduction (using titania photocatalyst) to  aldehydes, azides, nitrites, and nitro compounds; photocatalytic  fixation of carbon dioxide into aromatic compounds on semiconductor  surfaces; preparation of monodispersed particles with a core of  tungsten trioxide coated with ferric oxide and evaluation of their  photocatalytic potential in redox reactions; preparation of  monodispersed titania coated with conducting polymers and  evaluation of their utility in the reduction of nitro compounds;  and design of a flow photochemical reactor for high product output  and low solvent consumption.    In this study, photoinduced (light inititiated) transformations of  organic compounds using particulate semiconductors as catalysts are  explored.  Emphasis is on reduction of organic compounds containing  oxygen or nitrogen.  This approach requires no expendable reducing  agents, which are a major source of toxic-metal waste.  In addition  to its potential for avoidance of toxic byproducts, this approach  may also be useful for destruction of existing toxic wastes.",
