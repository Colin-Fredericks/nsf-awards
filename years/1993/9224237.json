 "awd_abstract_narration": "Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) dominates the early                                 successional forests of the North Carolina Piedmont.                            Scarcity of resources, especially light, causes the                             stands of pine to undergo thinning: as the trees grow                           larger, competition for light escalates and the                                 shorter, shaded individuals suffer high mortality.                              Several investigators have found that in some forest                            tree species, genetic heterozygosity is low in young                            stands and high in older stands.  This trend is the                             likely result of the culling of the more homozygous                             individuals when the stands undergo thinning.  Research                         is proposed to determine whether those individuals with                         high heterozygosity are less likely to die, and whether                         the average heterozygosity of the survivors in a stand                          reflects the intensity of competition for resources as                          determined by initial stand density.                                                                                                                            This research proposes to explore the natural processes                         which influence genetic structure in forest stands.                             Natural forest stands, as opposed to pine plantations,                          may maintain higher genetic diversity as a likely                               benefit of heterozygous individuals through thinning of                         dense stands.  The genetic effects of natural stand                             thinning could have important implications for forest                           management efforts aimed at maximizing tree vigor and                           forest productivity.",
