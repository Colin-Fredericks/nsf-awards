 "awd_abstract_narration": "Galton         This research is evaluating the viability of and will  further develop a novel technique for simultaneously performing  the previously separate operations of phase-tracking and A/D  conversion. The technique gives rise to a family of systems  referred to as Sigma-Delta Frequency-to-Digital Converters  (SDFDCs), and offers the potential of significant reductions in  analog circuit requirements for a variety of applications. Each  system uses coarse analog phase measurements, quantization noise  shaping, and decimation filtering to perform instantaneous  frequency-to-digital conversion. Because they operate on  instantaneous frequency in the manner that SD modulators operate  on amplitude, they share many of the benefits enjoyed by SD  modulator-based A/D converters such as reduced analog circuit  requirements and amenability to VLSI implementation. The research  is developing rigorous theoretical results supported by  simulations with the goal of characterizing SDFDC performance. A  VLSI prototype targeted to a specific application will also be  developed.",
