Campbell of North Carolina State University  and Francois Deleecque of INRIA (French National Institute for  Research in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics),  Rocquencourt, France.  Ramine Nikoukhah, Jean Pierre Quadrat,  also from INRIA Rocquencourt, will participate in the project.   The objective of their research is to develop optimal control  algorithms for constrained mechanical systems, numerical methods  and solutions for differential equations, and a computer  environment employing symbolic, graphic and numerical software.    Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which the investigators  will utilize in their research, are found to be extremely useful  for expressing and modeling optimal control of mechnical systems.   DAEs have advantages over ordinary differential equations in that  one can easily vary design parameters in an implicit model, a  particular system structure can be better exploited, and less  mathematical expertise is required on the part of the designer.   The proposed research in numerical solution of DAEs is important  for work in singular systems, which appear, for example, in  circuits and power systems.  Research results may include new and  more efficient algorithms and design procedures that are  applicable to a wide variety of engineering systems.  The project  takes advantage of the complementary background of the U.S. and  French investigators in many different areas, including control  and mechanics, numerical solutions of DAES, and computer  software.  ***",
