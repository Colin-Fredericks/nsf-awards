 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9350581  University of California-Berkeley  Berkeley, CA    Morrison, Frank H.    \"Summer Science Camp-MESA Project Summary\"    This proposal is for a summer Science Camp grant to help support and academic year  mathematics, Engineering, Science, Achievement (MESA) Program at the University of  California, Berkeley.  The SSC grant would be specifically used for instructional support for 60  Bay Area 7th, 8th and 9th graders in the SSC-MESA Project and as part of the MESA Saturday  Academy.    Program participants will reflrct the rich cultural and ethnic diversity of the Bay Area which  includes African Americans, Chicano/Latinos, American Indians, and Puerto Ricans.    The primary objectives of the proposed SSC-MESA Project are to introduce students to  engineering and science concepts, demonstrate how academic course work relates to their future,  how science and engineering relate to the world around them, to become informed and actively  involved in the education of their children.    The summer program will be held for 6 weeks June 21-July 31, 1993, June 20 -July 31, 1994  and June 19-July 30, 1995.  To meet its objectives, the SSC-MESA Project includes  morning mathematics and communication courses, afternoon engineering and science projects  a \"shadowing\" program, where students will meet with mentor scientists and engineers.  The  academic-year program includes; 1) a Fall-1993 and Spring-1994 Saturday Academy (9 sessions  each semester); 2) after-school math and science workshops for students who attend MESA  schools and 3) evening and Saturday meetings that provide parents and students with information  on college entrance requirements, financial aid, the transition from middle school to secondary  school, and career options in science and engineering.",
