 "awd_abstract_narration": "McKeown  9311618    This doctoral dissertation research support improves our  understanding of international regimes and international  environmental relations by examining the creation and expansion of  the \"Ozone Regime\" - the series of international agreements  designed to protect stratospheric ozone.  Although widely  recognized as an historic case of environmental cooperation, there  has been little in-depth analysis of the ozone regime.    The first part of the study examines the development of  \"international regime\" as an analytical concept, assesses its  strengths and weaknesses, and delineates how the dominant theories  of regime creation and change would attempt to explain the ozone  regime.  The second part of the research uses a  comprehensive, process-tracing case study of the origins, creation,  and expansion of the ozone regime to examine the accuracy of these  expectations.  Then, the investigators examine the importance of  three factors that are largely ignored by existing regime theory  but which preliminary research indicates may be of primary  importance in explaining the ozone regime:  1)international  economic competition;  2)the influence of pre-exisiting  international institutions; and, 3)the \"structure\" of the  negotiations themselves.  The research concludes by arguing for  synthesizing the consideration of these types of factors with the  strengths of exisiting theory to obtain a fuller understanding of  international regimes and international environmental relations.    The study is significant in three important ways:  First, it  provides the first comprehensive, theoretically informed case study  of the ozone regime.  Second, it critiques exisiting regime theory  by comparing its expectations to this important case.  Third, it  expands our understanding of international regimes by identifying,  analyzing and generating hypotheses concerning important but  previously ignored causal factors.  ***",
