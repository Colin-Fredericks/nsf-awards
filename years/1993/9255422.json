 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most astronomy teachers at two-year and four-year colleges are                  not full-time astronomers and many do not hold doctoral                         degrees. However, these faculty annually enroll a large number                  of astronomy students.  The purpose of this project is to                       enhance the faculty effectiveness of a number of astronomy                      instructors at colleges by assisting them to begin their own                    observational astronomy research programs.  The entry-level                     type of research can be mastered by physics-trained faculty                     members.  The data-gathering required for the type of research                  can be undertaken by beginning-level undergraduates using the                   type of equipment found at small colleges. The project will                     enrich educational experiences for a large number of                            undergraduate students who would not normally have such an                      opportunity.                                                                    Two groups of 15 college astronomy teachers are coming to the                   Center for Astrophysics for a week-long workshop.  While at the                 Center for Astrophysics, teachers will be taught the rudiments                  of photoelectric photometry, photoelectric and charged coupled                  device (CCD) observation of occulations.  The program will give                 the participants the necessary theory and background knowledge                  to allow them to actually do astronomical research and will                     provide research opportunities for their students.",
