 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. T. Douglas Price, Ms. Tina L. Thurston               will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will continue              her archaeological and associated documentary studies into change               in the district of Jarrestad which is located in the province of                Skane, southern Sweden. Throughout the Early and Middle Iron Age                (ca. 500 BC - AD 800) Skane was composed of a number of stratified              autonomous political systems. During the Late Iron Age or Viking                period (AD 800 - 1100) these polities passed not only from                      prehistory into history, but also from existing as several middle-              range societies to unification with an emergent centralized state               which was developing in Western Denmark. The goal of this research              is to understand how this change took place and what were the                   processes which underlay it. To achieve this goal MS Thurston will              make use of early written documents and will also rely on the                   excellent archaeological data base available. In addition she                   wishes to study changes in the size and location of settlements and             to determine the extent to which a changed settlement pattern                   reflects outside imposition by a dominant power. She will use the               technique of soil phosphate analysis. Extensive research has shown              that prolonged human habitation changes soil characteristics and                results in a significant enrichment in phosphorus. Through                      controlled excavation in known sites - which will allow the                     construction of precise stratigraphies -, soil sampling and                     subsequent phosphate analysis, settlement size can be determined.               Settlement hierarchies and the pattern of relationships between                 individual sites can then be established.                                                                                                                       While archaeological data make it clear that in some regions states             emerge through a process of internal development, perhaps more                  often such complexity develops through a secondary process in which             local groups unify in response of changes in neighboring regions.               This took place in areas as disparate as lowland Middle America and             Northern Europe. However relatively little archaeological attention             has been devoted to secondary state formation and MS. Thurston's                research will help to remedy this situation.                                                                                                                    The work is important for several reasons. It will provide data of              interest to many archaeologists. It will, hopefully, shed new light             on how social complexity develops and finally it will assist in the             training of a promising young scientist.",
