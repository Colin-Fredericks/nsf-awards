 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested to conduct studies of lake-groundwater                     interaction using stable isotopic and major ion chemical                        approaches.  Emphasis will be on isotopic variation in del O18 and              major ion chemistry (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4, Alkalinity, and pH) in             a number of lakes, their surrounding groundwaters, and local                    atmospheric precipitation.  The research area will extend from the              existing NSF-LTER North Temperate Lakes research site, a location               where extensive biologic, ecological, geochemical, and                          climatological measurements have been made over the past 10 years,              an area in a northern hardwood forest, glaciated terrain with                   abundant lakes and little drainage integration.  Isotope data will              be used to calculate hydrologic budgets for lakes and to establish              regional gradient in groundwater isotope chemistry according to                 methods developed for the NSF-LTER lake study.  Using these isotope             based mass balance estimates we will: a) estimate the average                   composition of input waters to the lakes; b) understand of the                  relative role of in lake cycling vs. external lake loading of                   solutes (especially silica); c) determine natural solute loads to               lakes that suffer significant Cl and Na contamination from winter               road salt; d) model the composition of waters based on observation              of the mineralogic phases that determine the chemistry of the input             waters; and e) predict chemical and hydrologic changes that would               occur in lakes and groundwaters in response to short-term and long-             term climate change.  Our studies have implications on the                      evolution and variations in lake and groundwater chemistry in a                 broad region of youthful glaciated terrains in temperate regions,               and should help us in differentiate the relative importance in lake             geochemical cycling vs. external lake loading.  From the knowledge              of present fluxes of waters to and from lakes and the associated                solute loading we intend to model the response of the                           lake/groundwater chemistry  to short-term and long-term variation               in climate, and estimate the sensitivity of this important region               to such changes.",
