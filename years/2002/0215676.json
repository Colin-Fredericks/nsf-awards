 "awd_abstract_narration": "A unique professional consortium called the Asian-Pacific Network of Centers for Earthquake Engineering Research (ANCER) was established in 2001 in Seoul, Korea by 7 existing national earthquake engineering research centers. The vision of ANCER is to broaden the research and development impact and mitigation practices through cooperative activities that can be best advanced on a center-to-center basis over a large geographical area. ANCER will sponsor, for the first time of this kind, the International Conference on Advances and New Challenges in Earthquake Engineering Research in August 15-20, 2002. The Conference will consist of two consecutive back-to-back meetings in Harbin and Hong Kong, China. The common underpinning of both meetings is the application of advanced technologies and new design philosophies/methodologies to address recent challenges in earthquake engineering and hazard mitigation. This forward looking intellectual exercise will involve multiple agencies and major universities from the Asia-Pacific region, bringing together leading researchers in the field to develop a clear picture of the current status in the field, as well as to examine new opportunities on the basis of Asia-Pacific regional and global cooperation. This project provides the funds to allow a delegation of US researchers to participate in this important Conference.",
