 "awd_abstract_narration": "New directions in clustering and learning\r\n\r\nFaced with ever-larger amounts of data, researchers, government \r\ninstitutions, corporations and even the general public  seek tools that help them deal \r\nwith large bodies of information, identify patterns in it, learn what these\r\npatterns mean, and act upon that information in a timely fashion. \r\nDeveloping such tools involves  a novel and interesting blend of algorithms, \r\nstatistics, AI, and machine learning. The project assembles a team of experts (four\r\nfrom academia and two from industry) in these areas to attack an interesting\r\nand meaningful subset of such problems which have the general flavor of\r\nclustering or learning.\r\n\r\nThe  defining philosophy of this proposal is that no clear boundary \r\nSeparates the twin notions of clustering and learning. Clustering is usually driven\r\nby the end goal of learning, but can also be viewed as  a learning task\r\nin itself since it results in a more compact description of the data.\r\nBy the same  token all learning  involves clustering of some sort, and\r\nin fact this viewpoint is implicit in recent papers in the learning \r\nliterature. The project takes an integrated view of the entire problem of learning\r\npatterns in data, starting from streaming computations that might produce\r\nrepresentative sketches of the data as it streams by, to problems of \r\nclustering data into meaninful patterns (with attendant problems of outlier removal,\r\nmultiobjective optimization etc.), to learning algorithms that fit\r\nsophisticated models (SVMs, bayesian nets, gaussian mixtures etc.) for \r\ninference and reasoning tasks.\r\n\r\nThe investigators believe that all these disparate algorithmic efforts have\r\nunifying ideas. Furthermore, their synergistic approach throws up several\r\ninteresting ideas of its own that could lead to significant advances. \r\nExamples: include using coding theoretic ideas in  disparate applications such as \r\nMulticlass learning (a broad class of learning problems including text and speech \r\ncategorization, part-of-speech tagging, gesture recognition etc.) and shape recognition\r\nin vision; the use of clustering ideas to do dimension reduction (offering\r\nan alternative to popular SVD based approaches), and using ideas from\r\napproximation algorithms and clustering to do near-optimal model fitting\r\nfor models such as bayesian nets.\r\n\r\nThe project also includes a management and educational plan that involves\r\ndissemination of the ideas of this research through development of new \r\ncourses and also pieces of learning software that will be placed in the public domain.\r\nAlgorithms developed in as part of this project will be tested on large \r\ndatasets, including those obtained from Google Inc. Some algorithmic ideas will \r\nalso be implemented in industry (including Google).\r\n\r\n",
