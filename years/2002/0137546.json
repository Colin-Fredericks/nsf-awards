The Radiogenic Isotope Laboratory is a modern facility with new, first-class physical facilities that house a clean room and both thermal-ionization and noble-gas mass spectrometers, plus a full array of ancillary equipment, to support the research measurements.  The laboratory conducts isotope geochemical and geochronologic research on diverse and wide-ranging issues.  The principal isotopic systems of current investigation are Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Pb, K-Ca and also K-Ar especially with the 40Ar/39Ar technique.  Studies include both isotope tracer research, using the radiogenic isotopes (e.g., Sr, Nd, and Pb), and geochronologic determinations (e.g., 40Ar/39Ar and Rb-Sr).  Overall, the research objectives range from the fundamental and methodological to the applied and topical.  In addition to the PI and intramural colleagues and students, the laboratory is utilized by a large number of extramural professionals and students, either as guest workers or by sending specimens for analysis.  Research activities of the PI and Ohio State University colleagues as well as a number of external scientists with on-going collaborative and cooperative projects are quite varied.  The topics range from geological and geochemical earth science to environmental and biomedical.\r\n***\r\n",
