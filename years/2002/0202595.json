 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop seeks to bring together experts in the area of parallel manipulators from around the globe for two days in order to disseminate recent research progress and to identify the most promising future research directions for parallel manipulators.  This meeting is not a routine conference, wherein the primary responsibility of the participant is to present his or her paper.  Instead, through a series of focused keynote presentations, round-tables, focused paper and poster sessions and in-depth discussion sessions the participants will seek convergence on key issues related to parallel manipulators.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the workshop include: (1) Identify roadblocks that must be resolved to increase the industrial use of parallel manipulators; (2) Identify promising approaches that may yield significant advances in the theoretical framework; (3) Discuss educational needs and methods; (4) Develop a strategy for the research community as a whole to accelerate the development and use of parallel manipulators; (5) Establish and reinforce international collaboration and collaboration between academia and industry.  The workshop will be held in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, on Oct 3-4, 2002, immediately following the ASME DETC conferences in Montreal (Sept 29-Oct 2, 2002).",
