She will develop theoretical models of the formation of the very first generation of stars in the early universe.  Recent observations of high-redshift quasars have provided new constraints on the epoch of formation and on the gas out of which the stars were formed. In addition to her theoretical work, Dr. Venkatesan will collaborate with other astronomers at the University of Colorado in further observations of high-redshift objects in order to learn more about the properties of the intergalactic medium at various epochs. As her primary outreach activity, she will tutor and teach for the local Upward Bound program which targets Native American students.  Her educational skills will also be developed by teaching astronomy courses for the general public. \r\n***\r\n",
