The experimental and interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research will provide opportunities for the postdoctoral associate to broaden and deepen research skills and expertise in geometric and physical computation algorithms, human-computer interaction, mechanics of robotic manipulation, computer simulation, animation, teleoperation, and collaboration over the Internet.  Potential applications of the proposed research include virtual prototyping, distance learning, e-commerce, and entertainment.\r\n",
