 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lay abstract\r\n\r\nCAREER: Long-term changes in synaptic function induced by selective\r\nsuppression of activity in single neurons\r\n\r\nThe adaptation of the brain to environmental changes is achieved in part\r\nthrough modifications in the strength of synapses, which are specialized\r\nconnections between neurons. The precise rules governing synapse\r\nformation, maturation and subsequent modification in the central nervous\r\nsystem are not fully understood. Using electrophysiology, fluorescence\r\nmicroscopy and molecular biological tools, Dr. Murthy will investigate\r\nlong-term modification of identified synapses in a simple neural network\r\nin vitro. The overall research objectives of the proposal are (i) to\r\ndetermine the consequences of selective, long-term reduction of activity\r\nin a single neuron within an active network, and (ii) to understand the\r\nlocus and mechanisms in synaptic modification resulting from this\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of results might be anticipated - homeostatic\r\nmodifications that allow neuron-wide increase in synaptic strength that\r\nwill restore the overall activity of the 'quiet' cell to normal levels,\r\nand competitive modifications that reduce or eliminate synaptic input and\r\noutput of the 'quiet' cell. This experimental system will offer\r\nunparalleled access to detailed cell biological investigations of synaptic\r\nmodification - from the level of gene expression to physiological analysis\r\nat single synapse resolution. The investigator will also integrate\r\neducation with his research program by developing up-to-date instructional\r\nmaterial for an advanced course in neuronal cell biology. Since optical\r\nmicroscopy has become an indispensable tool in cellular-level research,\r\nDr. Murthy will organize short departmental workshops on advanced imaging\r\ntechniques. In addition to these instructional elements, the investigator\r\nwill also mentor undergraduate and graduate students, including those from\r\nunderrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
