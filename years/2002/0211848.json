 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integrated studies of interactions among plants, microbes, and the soils they inhabit are\r\ncritical to our understanding of ecosystem function. We propose to use a combination of\r\nbiochemical and molecular-genetic methods to determine effects of artificial defoliation of\r\nPinus contorta (lodgepole pine) on structure and function of ectomycorrhizal (EM)\r\ncommunities in pure P. contorta and mixed P. contorta/Picea engelmannii (Engelmann\r\nspruce) stands. We will defoliate only the pine in both pure P. contorta and mixed P.\r\ncontorta/P. engelmannii patches formed within mixed stands by small-scale disturbance. We\r\nwill then determine how defoliation affects EM fungal community structure, activities of\r\nenzymes that break down litter, and enzymatic function of soil fungal communities. We will\r\nsample across a soil fertility gradient created by a transition from relatively nutrient-rich\r\nandesite, through a transition zone created by glacial activity, to nutrient-poor rhyolite. By\r\ndoing so, we will determine how interactions among carbon flow to roots, tree species\r\ndiversity, and soil fertility influence ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity and function, for the\r\nfirst time.\r\nOur preliminary data from this system indicate that defoliation of pine only in a patch of mixed\r\npine/spruce can 1) significantly affect the EM community of mixed P. contorta/P. engelmannii\r\nstands, and 2) affect the EM of non-defoliated spruce. Our data also show that soil fertility plays\r\na pivotal role in influencing EM community structure, and the work of others demonstrates that\r\nsoil fertility can moderate effects of defoliation and insect herbivory. We will be the first to\r\ninvestigate how alteration of carbon flow to roots affects EM community structure, EM\r\nenzymatic function, and below-ground function in a mixed tree species forest, and the first to\r\ncombine these factors with soil fertility. We will conduct this study in Yellowstone National\r\nPark, the centerpiece of the 11-million acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which includes\r\nseveral National Forests in three states. By using a combination of biochemical and molecular\r\nmethods, we will provide the most comprehensive picture of these aspects of ecosystem function\r\nto date. Thus, we will add greatly to our understanding of a pristine, economically important, and\r\ngeographically dominant ecosystem.\r\nOur education/outreach and broader impacts will be far-reaching. For example, Cullings is\r\nadjunct at a Hispanic-Serving Institution and will teach classes and seminars there, and students\r\nfrom that institution will be invited to participate in the study. In addition, Cullings is a member\r\nof the Ames Native American Advisory Council, an education/outreach organization within\r\nNASA dedicated to bringing science education to reservations. Henson has volunteered for 12\r\nyears as an ASM minority educator/lecturer, and has been a preceptor for NIH (Institutional\r\nStudent Minority Development) and NSF (Minority Access Program, Science and Engineering\r\nfor All) minority education grants. In addition, and for the past 10 years her lab has hosted\r\nNative American high school students and teachers through the American Indian Research\r\nOpportunities (AIRO) program on campus. Her group also assists YNP park personnel with their\r\nmicrobiology brochures and videotapes for the general public, and maintains a Web site about\r\ntheir work in Yellowstone (www.montana.edu.hotfungi). Henson also participates in ASMs on-\r\nline science mentoring project. Students from all programs will be recruited to participate in this\r\nproject.",
