Strong Shift Equivalence (SSE) is an\r\nequivalence relation which arose in symbolic dynamics.  Gilmer is\r\ninvestigating a connection between TQFT and SSE which he has recently\r\ndiscovered.  Using a TQFT one defines various SSE class invariants of\r\nknots and other spaces which are equipped with an infinite cyclic cover.\r\nThis can now be derived as a consequence of a SSE class invariant.\r\nGilmer is attempting to use TQFT to find obstructions to classical knots\r\nbeing slice knots.  In general, Gilmer is using TQFT as a tool in\r\nlow-dimensional topology. In joint work with Stepan Orevkov, Gilmer is\r\ncalculating further signatures and nullities of certain links which he\r\nassociated to collections of curves in the real projective plane.  In\r\nprevious work, Gilmer found restrictions on these invariants if the\r\ncollection of curves is isotopic to a real algebraic curve of given\r\ndegree.  These calculations may lead to new general restrictions on the\r\ntopology of real algebraic curves. Gilmer is also exploring relations\r\nbetween real algebraic curves and shadow descriptions of links, in the\r\nsense of Turaev.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopology is the study of intrinsic shape. It is sometimes called \"rubber\r\nsheet geometry\" because the objects under investigation can be twisted and\r\nstretched (but not torn) without losing their identity. It is a subject\r\nwhich impinges on many areas of mathematics and science.  Topological\r\nQuantum Field Theory is one of the most current and exciting areas of\r\ntopology with intimate connections to high energy physics as well as other\r\nareas of mathematics, for instance number theory and symbolic dynamical\r\nsystems. Gilmer is applying this subject to answer questions about knots,\r\nlinks and 3-dimensional manifolds.  A 3-dimensional manifold is a\r\ntopological object which looks locally like the familiar space we live in.\r\nOne may also consider manifolds of other dimensions. It is ironic that\r\nmanifolds of dimension three and four are least well understood. One would\r\nguess that our intuition should be strongest in these dimensions. A knot\r\nis a closed loop in a 3-manifold. A link is a collection of closed loops\r\nin a 3-manifold.  In 1900, Hilbert gave a famous list of problems for\r\nmathematicians to study. His sixteenth problem concerns the topology of\r\nreal algebraic curves in the real projective plane, It is still unsolved\r\nbut it has lead to many beautiful developments and partial solutions.\r\nHilbert asked how the components (called ovals) of the set of zeros of a\r\nnonsingular real homogenous polynomial of given degree can be arranged in\r\nthe plane, if the number of these ovals is maximal for the given degree.\r\nThis project further studies certain type of links to make progress on\r\nHilbert's problem and related questions.",
