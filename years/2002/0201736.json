This activity will provide a vital link between the University's talented students and individuals with assistive technology needs. Students will create and provide prototype, custom designed devices that will enhance the quality of life for the individual. Also, this program will educate new design engineers on the special needs of community members with disabilities.\r\n \r\nThe project has the following objectives:\r\n\r\nProvide engineering students a multi-disciplinary, meaningful, community service experience\r\n\r\nProvide persons with disabilities assistive devices to empower them to achieve the maximum individual growth and development and afford them the opportunity to participate in all aspects of life\r\n\r\nProvide engineering students education and awareness on the special needs and challenges of persons with disabilities\r\n\r\nProvide undergraduate engineering students exposure to the biomedical field of engineering.\r\n\r\nThe College of Engineering has partnered with three organizations that provide education and service related to disability. The organizations are the Wyoming Institute for Disabilities (WIND) assistive technology program, Wyoming New Options in Technology (WYNOT) and their Sports and Outdoor Assistive Recreation (SOAR) project along with the university's Special Education program. Individuals with disabilities will be linked with a team of engineering students to provide a prototype custom-designed assistive device specific to their needs.",
