Several very \r\ndifferent aspects of the subject will be studied.  Part of the project deals with the special \r\nperiodic solutions of the n-body problem arising from central configurations.  It is a \r\nlong-standing open problem to determine how many central configurations are possible, or \r\neven if the number is finite.  Techniques from algebraic geometry and computational algebra \r\nwill be used to attack this question.  A second part of the project involves the \r\nconstruction of isolating blocks in the phase space of the three-body problem.  It is known that \r\nit is possible to find simple, explicit isolating blocks at the collinear Lagrange points \r\nof the restricted three-body problem.  These blocks can be used to study the complicated \r\ninvariant set nearby.  The project is to carry out such a construction near the \r\ncollinear central configuration of the unrestricted three-body problem.  Here the \r\ndimension of the phase space is higher and the geometry is much more complicated.  A final part \r\nof the project is concerned with understanding the mechanism of Arnold diffusion for \r\nHamiltonian systems. The approach taken here is based on the construction of an invariant \r\nCantor set of annuli and subsequent analysis of the resulting dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe gravitational n-body problem remains an active topic for mathematics \r\nresearch three centuries after Newton proposed it.  Over the years it has been a \r\nstimulus for the development of new mathematics of wide applicability.  It is the classic \r\nexample of a nonlinear mechanical system and its solutions include orderly cyclical \r\nmotions, multi-body collisions, and irregular, chaotic behavior.  The simplest \r\nsolutions are the rigidly rotating orbits arising from the central configurations.  \r\nCentral configurations are special arrangements of the masses such that the gravitational \r\nforces can be exactly balanced by centrifugal forces when the configuration rotates.  Although \r\nthese solutions are dynamically very simple, the problem of finding or even counting the \r\ncentral configurations turns out to be very difficult when there are four or more masses \r\ninvolved.  Part of this project is about how to deal with very complicated algebraic problems \r\nsuch as this, perhaps using the help of computers.  The central configurations are \r\nimportant landmarks which provide a starting point for further analysis.  It turns out that \r\nthere are many other interesting solutions near the simple, rigidly rotating ones.  One \r\nway to trap and study these nearby orbits involves the construction of so-called \r\nisolating blocks. The geometry of these blocks provides qualitative information about the \r\nsolutions inside and can also form the basis of numerical methods for approximating these \r\nsolutions. Finally, there is the problem of understanding chaotic dynamics in \r\nmechanical systems and how such behavior can lead to large-scale instability.  Instability in \r\ncelestial mechanics can give rise to such phenomena as the slow drifting of the orbital \r\nparameters of planets or asteroids.  It also occurs in a variety of other mechanical systems.  \r\nThis phenomenon of Arnold diffusion is only partially understood at present.  The new \r\napproach which will be pursued here seems promising but much work remains to be done before \r\nit can be applied to complex systems like the n-body problem.\r\n\r\n",
