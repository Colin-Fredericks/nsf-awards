 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principle Investigator studies a new class of inequalities \r\non the flag f-vector of convex polytopes. The flag f-vector \r\ncontains all the enumerative incidence information between the \r\nfaces of a polytope. Thus to classify the set of all possible \r\nflag f-vectors is one of the great open problems in discrete \r\ngeometry.  To date only partial results to this problem have \r\nbeen obtained.  In a related problem, the Principle Investigator \r\nand his Research Assistant will study the homology groups of \r\nNewtonian coalgebras that arise in polytopal theory.  These \r\nhomology groups were recently used to give an algebraic proof \r\nof the existence of the cd-index, an important invariant in\r\nposet theory.  Understanding the homology of these chain \r\ncomplexes will give insight into new applications of Newtonian \r\ncoalgebras.\r\n\r\nPolytopes are basic mathematical objects that appear in \r\ndiscrete geometry.  The methods to attack these problems are \r\nunusually interdisciplinary as they involve insights from both \r\ngeometry and algebra.  The results of this investigation are \r\nimportant as they relate both to the pure branches of \r\nmathematics, such as commutative algebra, algebraic geometry \r\nand Hopf algebras, and to the applied sciences, including \r\noptimization and computer science.  Understanding the enumerative \r\ninformation of polytopes will give a theoretical basis for stress \r\nand rigidity problems in mechanical engineering, for the \r\nreconstruction using sampling problem in computer vision, and for\r\ndetermining the complexity of geometrically-based problems in\r\noptimization.",
