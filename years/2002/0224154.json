 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to the Spin Electronics for the 21st century initiative, Program Solicitation NSF 02-036. The proposal focuses on novel optical techniques for measuring carrier spin coherence on semiconductors. Spin based electronics promise to provide increased processing speed, increased integration density and decreased power consumption as compared to traditional microelectronic devices. In addition, electronic spins in semiconductors are attractive for implementation of quantum information processing. These advances require a firm understanding of electronic spin coherence in semiconductors and the development of techniques to probe spin coherence. Previous work has shown that n-doped GaAs has a remarkably long spin coherence time, which has prompted further investigation. Semimagnetic semiconductors display much shorter spin coherences, however the stronger carrier-ion interaction makes them better candidate materials for fabrication of spin filters and related devices.\r\n\r\nThe techniques developed in this project will complement the predominant technique of Faraday rotation and provide information that is not available using Faraday rotation. Of specific interest is why the Faraday rotation signal saturates for high optical excitation density. The techniques are based on transient four-wave-mixing. Specifically, by using a three pulse excitation scheme, it is possible to probe the spin coherence and generate a signal in a background free direction. A modification of this that uses the fifth order nonlinear optical response can generate a Raman-spin echo, which will remove the effects of inhomogeneous spin precession rates due, for example, to a variation in the g-factor with k-vector. The experiments will be performed on n-doped GaAs and semimagnetic semiconductors such as CdMnTe and ZnMnTe. The former samples are commercially available wafers, while the latter will be provided by collaborators at the University of Dortmund, Germany. In the latter case, initial experiments to probe the optical coherence (as opposed to spin coherence) will be performed because it is not well understood and provides important insight into carrier-ion spin scattering, which is crucial for electronically controlled ferromagnetism. Preliminary Faraday-rotation experiments will be performed on both the GaAs and semimagnetic semiconductor samples to provide a connection to experimental results from other groups. During this grant, both spin-coherence and Raman-spin echo experiments will be performed on n-doped GaAs. For the semimagnetic semiconductors, optical coherence and spin coherence experiments will be performed. \r\n",
