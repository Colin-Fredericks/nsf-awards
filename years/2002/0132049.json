 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Joseph B. Yavitt and Stephen H. Zinder at Cornell University to establish a microbial observatory to study the microorganisms that produce methane and decompose organic matter in northern, peat-forming wetland ecosystems. Although northern peatland ecosystems are significant sources of methane, an important greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere, almost nothing is known about the microbes that produce methane (methanogens) in peatlands or about other anaerobes (organisms living without oxygen) that decompose organic matter to compounds used by methanogens. Because northern peatlands are characterized by low nutrient availability and acidic conditions, Drs. Yavitt and Zinder will concentrate on acid-tolerant bacteria. They will study three contrasting sites in central New York State in which their preliminary work suggests a rich diversity of as yet uncultivated methanogens. Molecular biological techniques will be used to further characterize the microbial populations at these sites, and methods will be systematically developed for culturing methanogens and culturing other anaerobes using organic compounds of particular importance in peatlands. Of particular interest will be the highly acidic McLean Bog site with a pH near 3.6.\r\n\r\nThese studies will increase our understanding of microbial diversity and physiology; moreover, some of the acid-tolerant organisms obtained may have biotechnological uses. The microbiological studies will be integrated with biogeochemical studies on carbon flow to methane at the sites, and on methane flux to the atmosphere. As a result, we will be better able to predict how microbial populations in peatlands function and, in particular, how methane production will respond to changing environmental conditions, which will greatly improve our ability to forecast trends in atmospheric methane concentrations. Results of the project will be conveyed to the public through written documents, an internet web site developed and maintained by students, and visits by students to comparable sites in Canada and Europe.\r\n",
