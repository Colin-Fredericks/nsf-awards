A\r\ntriangulation of a 3-manifold determines a class of surfaces in the\r\n3--manifold called normal surfaces. A fundamental observation is that \r\nin most cases when a 3--manifold contains an interesting surface, then for\r\nany triangulation of the 3--manifold the same interesting feature is\r\nexhibited by a normal surface in the triangulation. This has provided a\r\npowerful method for studying 3-manifolds and solving certain decision\r\nproblems. Normal surface theory has, for example, lead to the theoretical\r\nresolution of determining when two 3--manifolds, which contain injective\r\nsurfaces, are homeomorphic, to the classification of these same manifolds,\r\nand to the determination of whether a knot in the three-sphere is the\r\nunknot. However, even with the presence of interesting normal surfaces, a\r\ngiven triangulation may have numerous uninteresting normal surfaces, which\r\nmake theoretical arguments quite tedious and computational attempts nearly\r\nimpossible. The guiding principle of efficient triangulations is reducing\r\nunnecessary normal surfaces and improving the efficiency of computations\r\nfor triangulation based algorithms.  They have exhibited remarkable\r\nsuccess in doing this. However, more surprisingly, efficient\r\ntriangulations have exposed interesting relations between one-vertex and\r\nideal triangulations of three-manifolds and new combinatorial structures,\r\nwhich seem to be intimately related to the topology of the three-manifold.\r\nThis project will explore efficient triangulations with particular\r\nemphasis of their application to the Homeomorphism Problem/Classification\r\nProblem for three-manifolds and issues of computational complexity.\r\n\r\nLow-dimensional topology brings together many areas of mathematical\r\nresearch and provides a common ground for interaction and advance across\r\nall of mathematics. It provides a natural geometric model of most physical\r\nphenomena. Research in this area is making significant contribution to\r\ncomputational geometry and topology and complexity theory. It has\r\nconsequences in physics, computer visualization and medical and biological\r\nmodeling.\r\n",
