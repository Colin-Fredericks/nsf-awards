 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists who study systematics are interested in determining how living things are related and in understanding the evolutionary processes that generate biological diversity.  Bioinformatics, on the other hand, is a relatively new discipline whose practitioners are involved with management and analysis of molecular data.  Brigham Young University (BYU) has developed a summer program in systematics and bioinformatics to provide undergraduate students with an interactive and hands-on research experience.  We will recruit 30 undergraduate students (10 students in each of the years 2003-2005) to spend 10 weeks (June - August) at BYU, Provo, Utah.  Successful students will be paired with a faculty mentor who will assist them in conducting an original research project.  Potential research areas include conservation genetics, HIV evolution, systematics and evolutionary biology, molecular evolution, methods of phylogeny reconstruction, and parallel processing of large data sets.  We will recruit students who do not have substantial research opportunities at their own institutions and will focus on ethnic minority and female applicants.  Opportunities to interact with other students, faculty, post-docs and graduate students will be provided through weekly meetings, workshops and a series of weekend field trips.  In addition, students will present results of their research at a \"symposium\" to be held the 10th week.  The overall goals of this program are to assist students in understanding the scientific method of investigation and to expose students to the possibilities of pursuing a career in the biological sciences.",
