 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in a class of  new class of liquid crystal materials referred to as banana liquid crystals is presently very high among the chemistry, physics and liquid crystal device community. A workshop to be held in the Fall of 2002 will be hosted by the Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Materials Research Center, an NSF MRSEC at the University of Colorado at Boulder to address important and timely research issues that have recently emerged. This will include discussing and agreeing on a much needed classification system to replace the existing convention based on order of discovery. The funds will be used to assist junior faculty, post-docs, and graduate students to attend and present their own research. \r\n\r\nThe liquid crystal community continues to have direct impact on education and the development of new materials for technological advances of high significance to society. The latter include the development of novel electro optic devices of high commercial interest. \r\n",
