 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to develop a high volume manufacturing technology for the production of InnovaLight's highly advanced silicon nanocrystal technology.  InnovaLight has discovered a highly controlled way to make high quality, uniform, and stable silicon nanocrystals with novel properties based on original research at The University of Texas. This is a very important discovery, as the unique properties of these nanocrystals will enable a host of large commercial applications.  However, in order to capture this value, a high-volume manufacturing scheme will need to be developed from the current low-volume, batch process.  The ability to produce high volumes of crystals that are favorably characterized for use in electronic components will enable their cost-effective use in a host of electronics applications. \r\n\r\nPotential commercial markets include use as pixels for use in high-resolution, low-power flat panel displays on computers and electronic instrumentation panels.  The crystals can also be made to emit a tightly confined, coherent stream of light.  This opens them up to use as lasers for short reach optical communications, terahertz-speed optical chips, smart cards, etc.  The crystals also have extremely unique charging behavior that enables their usage in advanced, multi-level memory chips.  Such chips would have an order of magnitude increase in capacity over existing chips.  Lastly, the non-toxic nature of silicon, coupled with the highly controlled surface chemistry of InnovaLight's process, opens these crystals up to many biotech uses such as in vivo cancer cell detection and oblation. \r\n\r\n",
