 "awd_abstract_narration": "0201271\r\nKleinstreuer\r\nThe knowledge of detailed and accurate deposition of toxic particles in the human respiratory system is most important for toxicologists and regulatory agencies to use in evaluating possible health effects, especially in vulnerable population groups such as industrial workers, children, and the elderly. For drug aerosols, it is desirable to predict where and at what concentration the medicine reaches targeted lung areas. In this project an experimentally validated computer simulation model will be developed to predict and analyze micron and submicron aerosol transport in representative human conducting zones.\r\n\r\nComputer simulations and analyses of airflow, particle transport, and particle deposition such as to be made in this project are invaluable tools to provide answers to research problems in both toxic particles and aerosol areas. The computational fluid-particle dynamics studies to be conducted are most useful for: (a) quantitative exposure-dose-and-health-effect studies done by regulatory agencies; (b) hypotheses/effect testing, e.g., air-particle inlet conditions, airway geometry features, and particle characteristics; (c) comparison studies on particulate matter deposition in upper airways between people with respiratory diseases (i.e., partially occluded airways) and normal individuals; (d) the development of transient one-dimensional particle deposition models for whole-lung representations; as well as (e) for medical researchers interested in biological impact analyses of toxic or therapeutic aerosols; and (f) for the development of drug aerosol inhalers and subsequent lung site targeting or interest to manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies.\r\n\r\nDissemination of results from the investigations will be made through peer-reviewed journal articles, review chapters, conference presentations, and fluid-particle flow visualizations to impact textbook writing, teaching, and learning.\r\n",
