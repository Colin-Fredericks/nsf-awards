 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oklahoma - Norman will acquire a X-ray diffractometer with CCD detector for small molecule diffractometry. This equipment will enhance research in a number of areas including the following: a) studies of nitrosyl and nitroso metalloporphyrins; b) the synthesis and characterization of group 13 organometallic compounds; c) the reactivity and synthetic utility of organotransition metal complexes; d) fast ion transport in solids; and e) synthetic bioinorganic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  These studies will have an impact in a number of areas, including the preparation of more efficient catalysts and biochemistry.  In addition, this CCD-equipped single crystal diffractometer will be the first instrument of its kind to be available in the state of Oklahoma, and will be used as a state resource for serving the needs of nearby institutions including several small regional colleges.",
