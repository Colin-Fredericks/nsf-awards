 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Instrumentation program supports the University of Southern Mississippi  with the acquisition of an environmental scanning electron microscopes with energy dispersive X-ray capability. The instrument provides a means of high magnification, high resolution analysis of polymeric materials with minimum sample preparation.  Low vacuum technology favors polymer analysis because non-conductive polymeric surfaces can be imaged.  Imaging does not require that the specimen be coated with a conductive material, thus, saving time and resources.  Furthermore, samples with high water content can also be imaged with low vacuum technology.  Recent developments in low vacuum electron microscope design provide a number of advantages.  Sample chambers can now accommodate samples up to eight inches in diameter. A simple command on the computer controller allows selection of either low or high vacuum chamber pressures.  New electron microscopes are equipped with a number of automated features that improve performance and lifetime of the microscope components.  Automated features now include focus, stigmation, gun saturation, gun alignment, contrast, and brightness. These adjustments were previously made manually by the operator and had detrimental impact on filament lifetime when multiple operators utilized the same electron microscope. \r\n\r\nTraditional scanning electron microscopes (SEM) require that samples are free from contaminates, dry, stable in a high vacuum environment, and electrically conductive to provide for successful analysis. The labor-intensive sample preparation techniques required to obtain useable samples often resulted in the creation of artifacts, thus obstructing the accurate analysis intended.  The advent of the Polymer age in which we live further complicated SEM analysis. Almost all polymers are non-conductive, many are not stable under high vacuum, and some are sensitive to the electron beam.  These problems led to the invention of a new generation of SEM. These environmental/low vacuum scanning electron microscopes (ESEM/LVSEM) have overcome a number of the problems encountered in traditional SEM analysis of polymers.  ESEM/LVSEM utilize partitions to separate high vacuum areas and low vacuum areas of the SEM.  \r\nThe acquisition of an ESEM/LVSEM at the University of Southern Mississippi will aid in characterization of polymers developed for a wide range of applications.  The incorporation of energy dispersive X-ray unit purchased in 1999 will enhance the capabilities by allowing for elemental analysis of polymers and other materials.  This will accelerate the advancement of research by providing a technologically advanced tool capable of utilization by multiple operators in our research center. \r\n",
