 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\nThis is a Full-Scale-Development Proposal based on a successful Proof-of-Concept Grant\r\n(NSF Award No. 9952653) demonstrating an innovative approach to materials for upper-\r\ndivision undergraduate engineering education. The value of visual materials in conveying \r\ntechnical concepts is very well established, and is here applied in a multimedia form to \r\nthe topic of thermofluid dynamics (i.e. convective heat transfer, thermodynamics, and gas \r\ndynamics), with strong emphasis on experimentation and optical flow visualization. The \r\nresults are materials captured on one or more CD-ROMs that can be used by instructors \r\nand students as a visual supplement to any of the standard textbooks on these topics. \r\nThe suitability of such materials for national dissemination has already been demonstrated.\r\nThis approach makes use of the ubiquity and low-cost of CD-ROM technology, \r\nwhich makes it especially important for small and minority universities that sometimes \r\nlack the facilities to convey the laboratory experience directly to their students. The\r\nmajor SMET challenge being addressed is that of enhancing traditional engineering \r\neducation with highly-visual material not currently available, and thus conveying to \r\nstudents a sense of the research-laboratory experience. One DUE theme also addressed \r\nhere is faculty development, by providing faculty with an unusual supplementary \r\nteaching tool, thus broadening their preparation beyond what is traditionally available\r\nin textbooks. Integration of technology is also a component part of this project. That is,\r\nduring the learning, the course materials require the students to use computers and to \r\ninterface with multimedia systems environments.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Multimedia, multimedia fluid mechanics, optical flow visualization.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
