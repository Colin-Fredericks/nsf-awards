Special emphasis will be devoted \r\nto the pursuit of global Riemannian geometry via additional structures. \r\nThis includes but is not limited to structures arising from the presence \r\nof symmetries, and to structures arising from taking external or internal limits. \r\nOur efforts concerning investigations of relations between curvature, \r\nsymmetry and topology is guided by the program set forth by the aim: \r\n``Classify or describe the structure of manifolds with positive or \r\nnonnegative curvature and large isometry groups\". This area is currently \r\nexperiencing significant advances in various directions. The project will \r\nalso include investigations of structures arising from the collapse \r\nof manifolds under a lower curvature bound, and of metric invariants \r\ncoming from investigations of the structure of various spaces of finite metric spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe significance of the main part of the proposal is twofold. On the one \r\nhand there are many geometric situations where no symmetries are present \r\nfrom the outset, but where symmetries emerge non-trivially from the geometry. \r\nAmong such situations are rigidity problems and collapsing problems under \r\nbounded curvature.  General  results achieved through the work proposed can \r\nthen be invoked and help solve the original problem, where no symmetries \r\nwere present. This method has already been used successfully. \r\nOn the other hand, the proposed work provides a systematic approach for \r\nfinding new examples of spaces with positive or nonnegative curvature, \r\narguably one the most central and difficult issues facing global \r\nRiemannian geometry today.\r\n",
