 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER.\r\n This exploratory proposal embraces two themes of the NSF Nanoscale \r\nScience and Engineering Program, including 1) Biosystems at Nanoscale, 2) Manufacturing \r\nProcesses at the Nanoscale. \r\nThe overall goal of this proposed research is to demonstrate the feasibility of a process \r\nfor biosynthesis of germanium oxide nanoparticles.  The PIs specific objectives are to: 1) Establish cultures of photosynthetic marine diatoms known to co-assimilate soluble silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge), including Cylindrotheca fusimormis, Cyclotella nana,and Phaeodactylum \r\ntricornutum;  2) Develop a two-stage photobioreactor for biological manufacture Ge-oxide \r\nnanoparticles by marine diatoms, and identify soluble Si/Ge feeding strategies that sustain Ge-\r\noxide nanoparticle formation; 3) Characterize the composition and size of nanoparticles by \r\nTEM/EDAX; and 4) characterize photonic properties of extracted nanoparticles by \r\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy before and after thermal annealing or H2 reduction.\r\nThe PI proposes that the biomineralization capacity of marine diatoms can be harnessed to \r\nmanufacture germanium oxide nanoparticles that ultimately could be processed into photonic \r\nmaterials. The synthesis of quantum dots by the atomic assembly of Ge atoms or Ge-oxide \r\nnanocrystals on silicon substrates is an emerging area of nanotechnology, as these light-emitting nanomaterials have novel optical / electronic properties. Current technology for manufacture of Ge-oxide nanocrystals involves exotic and cumbersome processes at extreme conditions, such as laser ablation, cluster beam deposition, or DC magnetron sputtering.  In contrast, diatoms could manufacture monodisperse Ge-oxide nanoparticles at the atomic scale by biologically-mediated processes at ambient conditions, using the nanobiochemical machinery of the cell itself. He proposes that Ge-oxide nanoparticle production by diatoms can be accomplished in two stages.   In Stage 1, diatoms are grown to high cell density on a soluble Si substrate (e.g. silicic acid) to the point of Si depletion in the liquid medium.  In Stage 2, soluble germanium (e.g. germanic acid) is continuously added to the dense diatom suspension at sub-lethal concentration. Diatoms assimilate soluble Ge, and then biologically polymerize soluble Ge to Ge-oxide nanospheres, which accumulate within the cell since they cannot be readily assimilated into the silica cell wall.  \r\n \r\nIf this proposed research is successful, then a biotechnology-derived route to synthesis of \r\nnanoparticles or nanocomposite materials with optoelectronic properties would be demonstrated and the impact will be significant. \r\nThe research plan will be co-directed two chemical engineers with respective expertise in cell \r\nculture of marine organisms and semiconductor materials synthesis. Graduate students working \r\nwith the PIs would be uniquely cross trained in two high-technology areas: biotechnology and \r\nelectronic materials.   \r\n\r\n",
