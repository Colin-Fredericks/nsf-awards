 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of computing patterns in sequences or strings of characters\r\nfrom a finite alphabet has important applications in numerous areas of\r\ncomputer science, notably in data compression, information theory, and\r\npattern matching. This problem has also important applications in biology.\r\nThe stimulus for such recent works is the study of biological sequences\r\nsuch as DNA and protein that play a central role in molecular biology. DNA\r\nsequences can be viewed as quite long but finite strings of nucleotides of\r\n4 different types, while protein sequences can be viewed as finite strings\r\nof amino acids of 20 possible types. Patterns such as periodicities and\r\nrepetitions make up a significant fraction of both DNA and protein\r\nsequences. Although the functions of these patterns are not well\r\nunderstood, they appear important for understanding the expression,\r\nregulation and evolution of a biological sequence. These patterns can be\r\nused to identify the sequence among other sequences, an application that\r\nplays a role in genetic fingerprinting. Repetitions in biological\r\nsequences have been associated with human genetic diseases. They also\r\ncomplicate multiple sequence alignment because matches may be present in\r\nnumerous places.\r\n\r\nThe literature has generally considered problems in which a period u of a\r\nrepetition is invariant. It has been required that occurrences of u match\r\neach other exactly. Due to the action of evolutionary mutation, patterns\r\nin biological strings are seldom exact but rather approximate. It\r\ntherefore becomes necessary to recognize u' as an occurrence of u if the\r\ndistance between u' and u is bounded by a certain threshold. Several\r\ndefinitions of distance have been proposed like the Hamming distance which\r\ncounts the minimum number of character substitutions required to transform\r\nu' into u, and the edit distance which counts the minimum number of\r\nsubstitutions, insertions, and deletions of characters required to\r\ntransform u' into u. Although there is an enormous literature dealing with\r\napproximate pattern matching according to these and other definitions of\r\ndistance, very little is known on approximate repetitions, a version of\r\nrepetitions where errors are allowed, and much remains to be done. Given\r\nthe importance of patterns in biological strings and the exponential\r\ngrowth in the DNA database, it is important to develop efficient\r\nalgorithms for detecting these patterns. The investigators study patterns\r\nsuch as periodicities, repetitions, covers, and seeds and their\r\napproximate versions built upon various commonly used distance measures.\r\nTechniques include recent combinatorial techniques related to partial\r\nstrings which are strings where a number of gap characters are allowed.\r\nThey also include the cover array, the highest scoring paths in weighted\r\ngrid graphs, the probabilistic models that have been proposed for\r\nrepetitions, and the subtree max gap problem which is a poweful tool in\r\nparallel algorithm design.\r\n",
