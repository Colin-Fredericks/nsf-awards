While computers have begun to play a role in engineering education, their effective use is far behind their potential. In this proposal we seek to use computational tools to improve the capacity of our graduates to design, analyze and realize complex physical systems, while retaining the strength of the program in\r\nthe engineering sciences. Indeed, we believe that through appropriate utilization of computation throughout the curriculum, students can graduate with a richer understanding of the fundamental concepts of the field than is possible now. We intend to use computation as a bridge across the traditional divide between theory and application with a view to the future. Working with our industry partners, disciplinary professional societies, and the National Academy of Engineering's Engineer 2020 initiative, we will consider the impact\r\nof new emerging disciplines, transformational changes in industrial practice and projected societal needs into our curricular reform efforts. \r\n\r\n",
