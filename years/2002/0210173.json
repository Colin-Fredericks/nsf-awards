 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to gain fundamental understanding of the\r\ndeformation mechanisms that operate in nanostructured metals and\r\nalloys, in particular in those produced by severe plastic deformation\r\n(SPD) methods. Based on this knowledge it further aims to develop full\r\ncapability to manufacture these materials in high quality bulk forms.\r\n\r\nThe extremely attractive (and rare) combination of mechanical\r\nproperties (high strength, ductility, fatigue resistance) and\r\nmanufacturability of these materials leads to a new class of high\r\nperformance alloys for structural uses.  It is understood that this\r\ncombination of properties is due to the formation of nano-scale grain\r\nsizes in these materials, but the mechanisms responsible for the high\r\nstrength combined with high ductility are not well understood. This\r\npresents a fundamental obstacle to the optimization of these\r\nmaterials, or to predictions of the performance of these materials in\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nAn integrated approach with strong emphasis on manufacturing is\r\nproposed. On the theoretical side, deformation mechanisms will be\r\nsimulated with crystal-plasticity aggregate models and with detailed\r\nmodels of the grains and grain boundaries.  The experimental program\r\ncovers a wide a range of strain rates and temperatures, texture\r\ndevelopment, and in situ transmission electron microscopy and atomic\r\nforce microscopy to directly verify deformation mechanisms. The\r\nexperimental results will provide validation to the theoretical\r\nmodeling and manufacturing process simulations.\r\n\r\nFinally, simulations of the manufacturing processes will enable\r\nprocess parameter optimization.  A complete, miniature, yet fully\r\nscalable, manufacturing facility will be designed and implemented.\r\n\r\nThe significant impacts of the proposed research are made possible by\r\nthe acquired fundamental understanding of the deformation mechanisms,\r\nand include advances in manufacturing techniques to produce these\r\nhighly desirable materials in bulk. The miniature manufacturing\r\nfacility will become a source of significant quantities of\r\nnano-structured alloys.  Finally, the proposal will provide students at\r\nthe UCSD and at local K-12 schools with interdisciplinary education in\r\na cutting-edge area of research.\r\n\r\n",
