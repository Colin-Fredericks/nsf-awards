 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop highly proton conductive, water insoluble and thermally stable electrolytes for proton exchange membrane fuel cells, based on a hybrid membrane of a functionalized polyoxometalate (POM) cluster in a sol-gel matrix. Phase I will focus on developing the technology of fabrication of cathode/electrolyte and anode/electrolyte membranes. The procured cathode/electrolyte and anode/electrolyte membranes can then be pressed together and thermally cured to form a cathode/electrolyte/anode membrane assembly.\r\n\r\nThe development of small fuel cell systems for residential may provide the\r\nhouseholder with electricity and heat at a significant saving over conventional services. \r\nFuel cells make distributed cogeneration a competitive alternative as they provide a\r\nunique combination of advantages. Being small, clean and quiet, they can be sited wherever\r\nelectricity is needed, even in the most congested urban location. Fuel cell generators can\r\nbe used in hospitals and computer centers where there is a need for uninterruptible, high\r\nquality power. Micro fuel cells as portable generators and to replace batteries since they\r\nare quick and easy to refuel, have longer operating times and lower operating costs.\r\nSystems are suitable for a number of applications, including portable computers and\r\ntelephones, video cameras and generators for camping, boating and emergency power.\r\n",
