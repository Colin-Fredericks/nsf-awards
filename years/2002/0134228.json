 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed integrated research and education program focusses on\r\ninvestigation of the notorious polarization instability and sensitivity\r\nto optical feedback of single transverse mode vertical cavity surface\r\nemitting lasers (VCSELs).  These intertwined difficulties plague ongoing\r\nefforts to develop the use of single mode VCSELs for applications such\r\nas wavelength division multiplexed communications networks and optical\r\ndisk readout.   Furthermore, we expect that our work will be relevant to\r\nfuture investigations of other low-dimensional semiconductor nano-lasers\r\nwith a large degree of symmetry.  The experimental investigations of\r\npolarization stability will be analyzed using a novel model that we have\r\ndeveloped to describe VCSELs with two polarization eigenstates in the\r\npresence of optical feedback.  This CW work will then be extended to an\r\ninvestigation of the small-signal modulation response of VCSELs with\r\noptical feedback.  Finally, the results of these investigations will be\r\nused to explore practical strategies for improving the stability and\r\npolarization control of single mode VCSELs exposed to optical feedback.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be integrated into the education of our\r\nundergraduate physics and engineering majors, both in the classroom and\r\nvia direct participation of undergraduates in my research program.  In\r\norder to enable our students to acquire the necessary research skills,\r\nwe are developing a new investigative, inquiry-driven, sophomore-level\r\ninstructional optoelectronics lab.  In addition, we are introducing into\r\nour introductory sequence pedagogical reforms aimed at encouraging\r\nstudents to engage in the processes of critical analysis that are\r\nessential to successful, creative research.  Ultimately, this\r\nintegration of research and teaching will contribute to the resolution\r\nof a critical problem in VCSEL development while preparing our\r\nundergraduates to join the ranks of the next generation of women\r\nscientists and engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
