The conferences also facilitate important productive communication between engineers and clinicians that stimulates relevant research and development. Participants have found the meetings to be particularly helpful because of the manageable size, and the commonality of interests of attendees that fosters interpersonal interaction outside the formal sessions. Computers in Cardiology has proven to be a major world forum for presentation of new research over a wide spectrum of computer applications in cardiology. The conference serves as the prime site for gestation and early nourishment of a number of fundamental technologies that have led to major improvements in the practice of cardiology. \r\n\r\nThe results from this award are expected to have broad impacts through the published Proceedings, which are to be produced by the IEEE press, with copies distributed to the attendees and some 300 libraries. Of special significance is the fostering of interdisciplinary research between researchers in different fields including medicine, physics, engineering, and computer science.",
