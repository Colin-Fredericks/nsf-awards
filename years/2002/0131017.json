 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Helicosporidia are a unique assemblage of pathogens isolated from a diverse group\r\nof invertebrates with only one named species-Helicosporidium parasiticum. Morphologically,\r\nthis group is defined by the production of an unusual cyst stage that encloses three ovoid cells and a single elongate, filamentous cell. These organisms were at one time considered to be \r\nprotozoa or fungi but have been unclassified since 1931. Experiments outlined in this project\r\nutilize the expertise of three research teams to explore the structure and function of this novel\r\npathogen. The approach taken in this project, dictated by the lack of biological information on\r\nthis organism, will provide a combination of morphology, life history, and molecular data. The\r\noutlined objectives include a complete analysis of the in vitro developmental cycle of the\r\nHelicosporidium sp. with an emphasis on the ultrastructure and replication of vegetative cells and\r\nthe morphogenesis of the infectious cyst. Preliminary examination has revealed that\r\nHelicosporidia possess many unique cytological features, such as a pellicle that is formed by both\r\nvegetative and cyst phenotypes, nuclei that enclose the cytosol, a number of undefined cell\r\norganelles, and a harpoon-like filamentous cell. The combination of high-resolution light and\r\nelectron microscopy will provide detailed insight on the composition and structure of the surface,\r\nwall structure, and internal morphology of this organism. Under controlled in vitro conditions,\r\ntime-lapse microscope studies will provide details on the developmental cycle of this pathogen.\r\nSecondly, the in vivo infection process, development, and host range of the Helicosporidium sp\r\nwill be examined. Throughout the course of this study, cell-tracking technologies will be\r\noptimized to analyze the ingress of this pathogen through the midgut barrier and its subsequent\r\ndevelopment in the hemocoel. Unlike many insect diseases, Helicosporidium sp., although\r\nisolated from an aquatic environment, can infect a wide range of terrestrial insect hosts. For\r\ncomparative purposes, both mosquito and lepidopteran larvae will be used to document the in\r\nvivo cell cycle. To date, sequence data generated on rDNA and two proteins, actin and tubulin,\r\nhave demonstrated that Helicosporida belongs within the Chlorophyta and, as such, it represents\r\nthe first record of an insect-pathogenic alga. It should be noted that Helicosporidia nests\r\nhierarchically within a group of organisms with radically different morphologies and life history\r\ntraits, allowing for comparative studies that can shed light on genes and structures that were\r\nmodified to achieve parasitism. Molecular studies will be directed at generating sequence\r\ninformation on select genes from the Helicosporidium sp. and on EST libraries. A primary goal is\r\nanalyze the relationship between the genera Helicosporidium, Prototheca, and other members of\r\nthe Trebouxiaphyceae in order to gain a better understanding of the morphological, molecular,\r\nand genetic changes that are correlated with the evolution of parasitism. Furthermore, analysis of\r\nthis sequence data in conjunction with morphological (ultrastructural) features will define the\r\ntaxonomic status and phylogeny of this organism. This project will provide support and training\r\nfor two graduate students and two undergraduate research assistants. The goal is to leverage the\r\ncombined talents of this group to provide students interdisciplinary training in molecular systematics,\r\nhistology, and pathology. These skills are crucial for the discovery, characterization, and\r\nevaluation of microbials for applications to a broad range of scientific disciplines such as new\r\npest control technologies, novel protein and small molecule discovery, etc.\r\n",
