 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the connections between generating functions \r\nfor height pairings of arithmetic cycles on certain Shimura varieties, \r\non the one hand, and second terms in the Laurent expansions of \r\nelliptic modular and Siegel modular Eisenstein series \r\nat certain critical points, on the other. The generating functions can be viewed as \r\narithmetic analogues of theta functions and can be use to define \r\narithmetic analogues of the classical theta correspondence, now taking certain \r\ntypes of modular forms to elements of arithmetic Chow groups. \r\nA main goal is to prove analogues of Rallis's inner product formula \r\nfor these arithmetic theta lifts, which will now involve derivatives \r\nof L-functions. Thus, it is hoped that one may ultimately obtain \r\ninformation about higher dimensional analogues of the Gross-Zagier formula and the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer \r\nconjecture. \r\n\r\nIn the later part of the 20th century significant advances were \r\nmade in developing a `number theoretic' geometry, in which an additional \r\ndimension is added to carry information involving the interaction \r\nbetween the geometry and prime numbers. To a point on such a space, \r\none can attach a number call its height, which is a measure of its \r\n`arithmetic complexity'. More generally, heights can be defined \r\nfor higher dimensional objects, curves on surfaces, for example. \r\nThe present project studies combinatorial relations among such heights, \r\nwhich reflect hidden structure carried by the spaces \r\nof `number theoretic' geometry. \r\n\r\n",
