 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program will be continued in the School of Physics of the Georgia Institute of Technology. The program will encompass Chemical, Optical, Nonlinear, and Condensed Matter Physics but also has been expanded to include projects in MEMS (Micro-electrical Mechanical Systems), Biomedical Imaging, and Material Science- Microscopy. Twelve REU students participate in the program  (ten supported by NSF, two by Georgia Tech), with the choice of participation in the research groups of 18 faculty investigators. The considerable experience of the participating faculty in undergraduate research training furnishes an ideal environment to pursue undergraduate research training among the supportive cast including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The closely monitored research environment is supplemented by (1) weekly seminars presented by both participating faculty and students, (2) faculty-student luncheons, (3) excursions to advanced technology facilities including Lockheed Aircraft, (4) a reasonable but not intrusive number of organized social events as students are encouraged to avail themselves of several cultural opportunities in the Atlanta area dictated by their individual interest. At the end of the summer session, each student presents the results of their research endeavors in a REU Symposium run in the American Physical Society format of 15-20- minute presentations.\r\n",
