 "awd_abstract_narration": "An Immuno-Mimetic Sensor-Actuator using Novel Polymeric Vesicles as Artificial Lymphocytes\r\n\r\nIn this program the principal investigator will develop a breakthrough sensor-actuator, mimicking the immune system to identify, amplify signal from, and respond to low levels of multiple target compounds in\r\na wet environment. This compact (and potentially chip-based), smart system will continuously\r\nmonitor a test space and provide independent real time chemical feedback to multiple stimuli.\r\nMicroelectronics could be integrated into this stand-alone device for added functions.\r\nThe proposed technology exploits novel polymeric vesicles that will act as artificial\r\nlymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. The polymeric vesicles are a new invention, made of\r\ntough membranes that will encapsulate amplification or response molecules. Different surface\r\nreceptors on different vesicles will code for target compounds that, when present in the testing\r\nenvironment, will activate particular vesicles. The test solution flows through an amplification\r\ncascade (a rough mimic of bone marrow) to replicate only the activated vesicles. Replicated\r\nvesicles (a crude mimic of plasma cells) will return to the test space to release response compounds\r\nsuch as drugs or inhibitors to counteract the target compound(s) detected.\r\nThe replicator cascade is like a photomultiplier tube (PMT), with amplification occurring on\r\neach of several stages. The proposed device is, however, more advanced because, of the many\r\ntarget compounds cataloged, only those in the test space will be amplified. In the device, specific\r\nadhesive interactions facilitate separation of activated vesicles from those not yet activated. While\r\nthe latter are recycled, activated vesicles are lyzed to release each test compound (or analog\r\nthereof), at a concentration higher than that at the stage inlet. This solution passes to the next stage\r\nwhere the process repeats, giving a powerlaw dependence of amplification on the stage number.\r\nThis program will conduct the science and device development necessary to form the basis\r\nof a single stage that later could be combined with others to produce the cascade. At the stage\r\nlevel, the goal is to maximize amplification, maintaining selectivity for activated vesicles (not\r\ntriggering the non-activated ones.) To accomplish this, the scientific investigation will address\r\nhow adhesive interactions between receptors on vesicle and separator surfaces could be tuned\r\nthrough receptor placement and macroscopic parameters. Fundamental adhesive behavior will be\r\nassessed using micropipette aspiration methods (paralleling studies of cell adhesion) and compared\r\nwith adhesive performance in device prototypes. Results will be interpreted using formalisms\r\nestablished for cell adhesion, appropriate for specific adhesive groups on a membrane capsule in a\r\nflowing solution.\r\nThe specialized vesicles and their replication cascade form a sensor-actuator system whose\r\nend applications bridge a number of industries, from biomedical uses to chemical process control\r\nand environmental monitoring (closed bodies of water) and response. The proposed scientific\r\ninvestigation targets designs that meet the constraints for a robust technology that will be\r\nimplantable or submersible. The scientific team bridges academic disciplines and specialty areas to\r\ncombine expertise in polymer interfaces, biomimetics, adhesion, and MEMS. Graduate and\r\nundergraduate students from different engineering and scientific backgrounds will benefit from this\r\nsynergistic approach to research, which preserves fundamental rigor and emphasizes engineering\r\ncreativity.",
