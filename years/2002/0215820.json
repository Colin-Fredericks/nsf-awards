 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to Drs. John T. Longino, Elizabeth M. Kutter, and Erik V. Thuesen at The Evergreen State College to acquire a variable-pressure scanning electron microscope, an inverted compound fluorescent microscope, and a stereomicroscope, including motorized drives and computer interfaces that allow remote operation over the internet. The Instrumentation will be used In studies of tropical biodiversity, microbial processes in biofilms, and ecophysiology of marine zooplankton.  John Longino's research focuses primarily on ants, here and in Costa Rica.  The variable-pressure scanning electron microscope and stereomicroscope equipment will be used to finish a taxonomic revision of the Costa Rican Crematogaster, one of the major genera of arboreal ants.  The products will be both traditional published work and image-rich identification guides on the web.  Elizabeth Kutter will use the fluorescent microscope to study phage infections of bacteria in biofilms - very widespread, elaborate communities of convoluted towers and fluid channels that are largely resistant to antibiotics and disinfectants.  Erik Thuesen is investigating the ability of gelatinous zooplankton to survive in low-oxygen environments.  He hypothesizes a facilitated diffusion mechanism which will be investigated using fluorescent microscopy to examine the distribution of mitochondria. \r\n\r\nScience teaching at Evergreen is strongly research oriented.  Many Evergreen faculty members carry out research and teaching programs that rely substantially on microscopy, and their ability to expand and move in new directions will be greatly enhanced by these instruments.  In addition to the microscopy-intensive research of the P.I.'s, a number of other faculty involve their students actively in smaller-scale, locally-funded research projects and presentations, many of which involve sophisticated microscopy.  This includes research into harmful algal blooms, environmental microbiology and soil biology.  The instrumentation will also be used in ways beyond these specific research activities, attracting a broad range of students through exposure to exciting images and concepts and improving access for underrepresented groups of students, especially at our Tacoma campus, which serves a high proportion of inner city students.  The remote control capabilities will support serious research projects in bioremediation and microbiology already initiated at the Tacoma campus and expand microscope use from laboratory to classroom.  Teaching at Evergreen is also inherently and intentionally interdisciplinary, and the SEM and other microscopes will serve as foci for full-time programs integrating arts and sciences.\r\n",
