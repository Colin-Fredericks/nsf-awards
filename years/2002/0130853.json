 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project provides partial funding for a conference on \"Transcriptional Regulation During Cell Growth, Differentiation, and Development\" to be held under the auspices of FASEB at Saxtons River, Vermont, from June 29-July 4, 2002.  Gene regulation through transcription is a fundamental process common to all biological systems.  Transcriptional regulation underlies critical aspects of cell behavior including proliferation, response to environmental signals, differentiation, and the development of multicellular organisms.  The intent of this conference is to bring together researchers engaged in studying a broad range of transcriptional processes in different biological systems and using different methodologies.  The sessions are designed to communicate recent advances in knowledge of fundamental mechanisms of transcriptional activation and repression, chromatin structure, and long-range and epigenetic effects on gene expression, and the relationship of these mechanisms to the biology of response to environmental signals, development, and cell-cycle control.  The conference will underscore the important role that transcriptional regulation plays in normal differentiation and development and the manner in which aberrant gene expression is involved in cancer and other diseases.  This conference differs from other transcription meetings in that it does not focus simply on molecular mechanisms but rather emphasizes how transcription is used by cells to solve particular problems of development and differentiation.  As such, the meeting will include problems encountered and solved across a wide range of species, including yeast, worms, flies, and mammals, such that the similarities and differences can be appreciated.  The meeting will include formal talks, discussion periods, two informal 2-day poster sessions, and excellent opportunities for interaction among the attending scientists.  Attendees will include principal investigators, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students.  33% of the invited speakers and 8/9 session chairs are women, and 54% of the invited speakers are new to this meeting.  The conference will provide an up-to-date overview of one of the most fundamental and rapidly moving fields in biology and is expected to generate new directions for future research.",
