 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cleveland Math and Science Partnership includes the Cleveland Municipal School District, John Carroll University, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland State University and the Education Development Center.  The Cleveland Municipal School District is the largest school system in Ohio, enrolling over 74,000 preK to 12th grade students of whom 71% are African American and 8% are Hispanic.  The Cleveland Math and Science Partnership focuses on the mathematics and science teachers of over 15,000 secondary school students as the majority of these teachers in the District are not properly qualified and do not have the certification to effectively teach these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe partnership aims to improve student achievement in the Cleveland Municipal School District by equipping its teachers with additional skills acquired through university continuing education programs.  The universities will establish three diverse graduate programs for Cleveland middle and high school mathematics and science teachers (grades 6-12): John Carroll University will establish a master's degree program with a specialization in mathematics or science for middle school teachers; Cleveland State University will offer graduate-level content courses that may be counted towards state licensure for middle school teachers; and Case Western Reserve University will offer graduate courses focusing on applied science laboratory and mathematics demonstration preparation for high school teachers.  The university partners will work together on a regular basis to custom-design and refine their courses to align with the District's needs.  The District and university partners will also join with the Education Development Center (a) to train master teachers to become instructional leaders and mentors within the District's schools and (b) to develop a mentoring program for middle school teachers new to teaching mathematics and science.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
