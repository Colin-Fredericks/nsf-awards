 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on cluster algebras recently discovered by the\r\ninvestigator in collaboration with S.Fomin. Cluster algebras are\r\nintegral domains of a special kind designed to provide an\r\nalgebraic framework for the study of total positivity and\r\ncanonical bases in semisimple groups and their representations.\r\nThe investigator studies structural properties of cluster algebras\r\nand their quantum deformations. This study uncovers unexpected\r\nconnections with such diverse subjects as the structural theory of\r\nKac-Moody algebras, thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, quiver\r\nrepresentations, and integrable systems. One of the main\r\ninstruments of the study is polyhedral combinatorics, more\r\nspecifically, an interplay between piecewise-linear and\r\nsubtraction-free birational transformations based on the tropical\r\ncalculus.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for this project comes from two classical areas\r\nof mathematics: representation theory and the theory of total\r\npositivity. Representation theory is a mathematical approach to\r\nstudying symmetry; more specifically, it encodes the symmetry\r\nproperties of various physical and biological systems that occur in\r\nnature. Total positivity is a remarkable property of matrices (arrays\r\nof numbers) that generalizes the familiar notion of positive numbers.\r\nBoth theories\r\nfind numerous applications in physics, chemistry and other\r\nsciences, as well as in other mathematical disciplines. In fact,\r\nrepresentation theory serves as the mathematical foundation of\r\nquantum mechanics, while total positivity is a major tool for\r\nexplaining oscillations in mechanical systems. During the last\r\ndecade, deep connections were found between the two fields, and\r\nthe scope of their applications was greatly extended. This\r\nproject explores the modern framework of representation\r\ntheory and total positivity, with the goal of making its formalism\r\nmuch more explicit and understandable.\r\n",
