A 16-node rack-mounted cluster with dual CPUs, large memory (4 GB), gigabit networking, and high-end graphics is expected to facilitate the research. Specifically, the infrastructure supports the following three research projects:\r\n\r\nPerceptually Driven Interactive Ray Tracing,\r\n\r\nThermal Simulation of Computer Architecture with Graphics Hardware, and\r\n\r\nLarge-Memory Architectural Simulations.\r\nThe computer graphics research investigates new scene rendering algorithms motivated by models of human perception, and requiring flexible (programmable) graphics hardware. This work investigates unconventional rendering techniques that exploit the ability to vary sample location, density, and frequency. Examples include frameless (replaces double buffering with randomized update of pixels), interruptible (unifies spatial and temporal error for a principles fidelity/performance tradeoff), and gaze-directed (varies detail and resolution according to user's attention) rendering. Thermal modeling is directed towards solving heat transfer equations for studying the run-time thermal behavior of microprocessors, especially multithreaded (SMT) and single chip (SCC) systems. The computer architecture component involves performance of SMT and SCC systems and investigation of aggressive branch prediction techniques using distant correlations.\r\nThe educational aspects involve folding relevant topics into the current graduate seminars and students in the research.\r\n",
