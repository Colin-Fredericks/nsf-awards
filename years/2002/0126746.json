The IWOTA conferences offer a rich program on a wide range \r\nof the latest developments in operator theory and its applications. In a \r\ncombination of plenary lectures by eminent mathematicians and parallel \r\nsessions of invited and contributed talks, the plan is for this year's \r\nconference (to be held August 6-9, 2002 on the Virginia Tech campus in \r\nBlacksburg, Virginia) to cover a wide range of topics, including \r\noperator/system theory, operator/scattering theory, operator \r\ntheory/numerical analysis, operator theory/wavelets and signal processing, \r\noperator theory/harmonic analysis as well as topics in Krein space \r\noperator theory and core engineering. These topics form a core of the \r\nbasic science behind a variety of applications, including control of \r\nindustrial processes or high performance aircraft, tomography and image \r\nreconstruction, pulse propagation in optical fibers, seismology, data \r\ncompression and reconstruction, and identification of only approximately \r\nknown parameters.\r\n\r\nThe original concept of IWOTA was as a satellite conference for operator \r\ntheorists to the broader based international symposium on Mathematical \r\nTheory of Networks and Systems (MTNS), to be held August 12-16, 2002 \r\nat the University of Notre Dame. While this concept is still in place, the \r\nscope of IWOTA has broadened considerably in recent years and IWOTA \r\nhas now attained an independent identity as a world-wide conference for \r\nrecent developments in core operator theory and its applications. IWOTA's \r\nprimary objective is to bring together major researchers in the area of \r\noperator theory and related fields. These meetings provide opportunities \r\nfor all participants to present their own work in contributed talks, to \r\ninteract with other researchers from around the globe, and to broaden their \r\nknowledge of the field by hearing the invited lectures of eminent \r\nmathematicians. In addition IWOTA emphasizes cross-disciplinary \r\ninteraction among mathematicians, electrical engineers and mathematical \r\nphysicists, and encourages participants to continue on to the MTNS \r\nconference for a further broader interdisciplinary interaction. In addition, \r\nIWOTA encourages and financially supports the participation of young \r\nresearchers, i.e., advanced graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients, \r\nfor whom the opportunities offered by expert conferences are particularly \r\nimportant\r\n",
