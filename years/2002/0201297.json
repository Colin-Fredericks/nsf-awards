Missouri-Rolla\r\n\"Upgrade of Geodynamics Laboratory Equipment\"\r\n\r\nThis action is to upgrade and modernize the existing geodynamics equipment available in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Missouri at Rolla.  The existing equipment is old and obsolete and requires upgrading or replacement.  It will be upgraded to full digital control and data acquisition.  The UMR Civil Engineering Building is being renovated and a new geodynamics laboratory will house this equipment.  The new equipment will consist of triaxial equipment capable of dynamic soil testing at the low and large strains, in order to develop modulus degradation and damping curves to be used in ground and structural response analysis.  These upgrades and modernization will make the new geodynamics laboratory a state-of-the-art laboratory for research and graduate instruction.  They will be of immediate use in two existing projects, and for future projects that require dynamic material properties of soils.  The equipment will be used in earthquake engineering research projects; in particular for projects related to the Midwest United States region.  One of the largest liquefiable soil deposits in the country occurs near the New Madrid Seismic Zone in the southeastern corner of Missouri and adjoining states (the Mississippi Embayment).\r\n",
