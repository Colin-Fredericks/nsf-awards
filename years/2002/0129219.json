It would be extremely useful to be able to predict when and how such changes will evolve. We know that mutation and genetic variation is necessary for evolution.  This project will search for simple general features of mutation and genetic variation to use as the basis for predictions about evolution, and test these predictions against the differences observed among species.  The wings of fruit flies (Drosophila) will be used as a model system.  Surprisingly, integration of mutation, variation and evolution in one study has never been attempted with a multicellular organism.\r\n\r\n\tIf the predictions of this project are borne out, the methods developed would be applicable to evolution in domesticated plants and animals.  If one can predict combinations of features that are unlikely to evolve, costly breeding programs that are doomed to fail could be avoided. Alternatively, features that are unlikely to evolve with natural variation would be attractive targets for genetic manipulations. If the predictions are not borne out, this will point to the need for a more detailed understanding of the functional basis of biological traits before predictions are useful. \r\n",
