 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research focus of this work is to develop asymmetric catalytic fragment coupling reactions for the synthesis of complex molecules.  The central theme of the approach is \"triple diastereoselection\",  in which a chiral catalyst is used to overcome the poor diastereoselectivity obtained in stereochemically mismatched coupling reactions.  Nickel-catalyzed intermolecular reductive coupling of alkynes and aldehydes (or imines) forms the basis of the coupling strategy.  The focus of the educational effort will be the development of lecture and laboratory courses in organic chemistry.  Dr. Jamison along with graduate and undergraduate collaborators will participate in the project.  Further, high school outreach will be carried out by the graduate student participants.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Timothy F. Jamison of the Department of Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Professor Jamison will focus his research on the development of new asymmetric catalytic reactions for the synthesis of diverse and complex organic molecules.  Further, the methodology allows the preparation of complex molecules from common, simple starting materials.  This approach could have important ramifications for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  The educational activities of the award will center around the MIT Chemistry Outreach Program and course development.",
