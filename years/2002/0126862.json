 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atomic absorption spectroscopy is an important method of elemental analysis that undergraduate chemistry students should encounter at all levels of the curriculum. We are adapting proven atomic absorption experiments that use both flame and graphite atomization procedures and implementing them into the laboratories for Introductory Chemistry, Environmental Chemistry, and Instrumental and Experimental Chemistry. These experiments are taken from the recent educational literature, have an environmental, real-world content and thus are relevant to the experiences of our students, both majors and non-majors alike. The instrument is also being used by undergraduates as part of a variety of research projects. New laboratory manuals are being written to reflect the increased emphasis on atomic absorption spectroscopy and the manuals can be disseminated to other institutions wishing to incorporate atomic absorption spectroscopy into their curriculum. The experiments and the success of our students in mastering atomic absorption will be disseminated to the chemical education community through presentations at local and national meetings, publication in chemical education journals, and personal contacts.\r\n",
