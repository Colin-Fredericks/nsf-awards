 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative NSF 01-157, category NER. Exploratory research will be conducted on the laser chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) of nanostructures. Experiments will be carried out utilizing near filed scanning optical probes (NSOMs) in order to confine the effects of the laser irradiation to lateral dimensions of only a few tens of nanometers. The main objective of the research is to accomplish deposition and writing of nanofeatures at specified locations via NSOM-LCVD processes. Different deposition/substrate systems will be investigated. This approach will lead to controlled crystal growth and fabrication of complex nanostructures in three dimensions. Insight will be gained on the fundamental mechanisms of the complex thermo-chemo-physical phenomena during the nanoscale deposition, nucleation and crystal growth processes. \r\n\r\nThe production of surface nanofeatures has many important applications in critical emerging technology fields, including the fabrication of nano-electro-photo-mechanical integrated circuits. The goal of the research is to develop novel processes for nanostructuring surfaces with tailor-made texture, optical and electromechanical properties. These processes will be of ubiquitous use in the fabrication and heterogeneous integration of functional nanoscale devices. Several existing programs at UC Berkeley will be leveraged in order to broaden the impact of the research on education and outreach and utilized to identify, recruit and attract graduate student researchers from underrepresented groups and minorities. It is expected that the research will form a major part of a doctoral dissertation, while undergraduate students will also participate in the research as laboratory assistants. The research results, procedures and expertise developed in this project will be communicated to both graduate and undergraduate students through coursework and seminars (including a freshman seminar).",
