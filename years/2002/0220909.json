 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jackie Smith\r\nFletcher Winston\r\nSUNY at Stony Brook\r\n\r\nThis Doctoral Dissertation Improvement project examines the tactics of two environmental social movement organizations-one that uses moderate tactics, and the other more radical modes of action.  The goal is to understand these different approaches to collective action, and how relationships with government, businesses, and other nonprofit association might impact tactical decisions. The study has two components-participant observation of two environmental groups on Long Island, one using moderate and the other radical tactics. This will allow the PI to study how processes of interaction influence tactical choice. The second part of the project includes a mail survey of a representative sample of environmental groups to gather data on the types of relationships they hold.  Findings from the project could potentially contribute to our knowledge of how social movement groups come to select tactics and the effect of relational ties on group mobilization. \r\n",
