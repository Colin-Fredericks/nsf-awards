This resource is a searchable, Web-based repository of contextualized multimedia materials teachers can access easily and productively for their own professional development.  With this award WGBH will produce a set of supporting resources to amplify the relevance and impact of this digital library for both students and teachers.  These supporting resources include multimedia presentation features for curriculum units that feature self-contained video and interactive modules; descriptive annotations and background essays to accompany each asset in the collection; and detailed lesson plans and discussion questions for using these resources to support deep learning of the content.  It is anticipated that five curriculum units will be produced, with each unit consisting of two or more modules.  The curriculum units will be developed for the high school level and the five units will include genetics, ecology, evolution, cells and biochemistry.\r\n\r\n",
