 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with questions from pluri-potential\r\ntheory and dynamics in several complex variables. \r\nPluri-potential theory is the higher dimensional version\r\nof potential theory in the complex plane. The \r\ninvestigator plans to study certain classes of \r\npluricomplex Green functions for the complex \r\nMonge-Ampere operator, from the point of view of their\r\nfoliation structure and also in relation to some questions\r\nfrom algebraic geometry. A second goal of the project is \r\nto consider polynomial estimates of Bernstein-Walsh type\r\nrelated to graphs of entire transcendental functions.\r\nThe investigator plans to study certain properties of\r\nentire functions from this point of view. Such properties\r\nare also of interest in transcendental number theory.\r\nFinally, the investigator is concerned with studying the\r\ndynamics of classes of polynomial automorphisms in\r\nhigher dimensions.\r\n\r\nComplex analysis in one and in higher dimensions has\r\nimportant connections with many fields of pure and applied\r\nmathematics and, indeed, with other sciences. It is often\r\nthe case that one gains insight about concrete problems \r\nonce they are formulated in the context of complex numbers.\r\nThis is because of the powerful methods and tools developed\r\nin the study of holomorphic functions in complex analysis.\r\nStudying complex dynamical systems proved to be important\r\nfor understanding the behavior of more complicated real \r\ndynamical systems arising in mathematics as well as in \r\nphysics and biology.",
