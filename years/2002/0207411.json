The main area of investigation is the\r\ninformation theoretic content of the transmitted signals, i.e. a study of how\r\nmany bits of information need to be transmitted between the different components\r\nin order to make the physical system meet its specifications. For instance,\r\nautonomous robotic systems are normally relaying on a variety of heterogeneous\r\nsensors, and the question then becomes, which of the sensors are needed? And\r\nfurthermore, is it possible to compress the data in a systematic way, e.g. using\r\nvirtual sensors, so that information that is not essential to the current task,\r\nor mode of operation, can be discarded?\r\n\r\nSince the sensory data needed for accomplishing a certain task depends both on\r\nthe control law, the dynamics of the system, and the complexity of the task,\r\ninformation theory provides a tool for treating questions concerning sensor and\r\nactuator selection and control mode design in a unified way. This project is\r\nfocused on the following two enabling areas of research:\r\n1. Modeling of the information theoretic content of the symbolic, computer\r\ngenerated inputs used for controlling continuous, mechanical devices.\r\n2. Selection of embedded sensors and actuators for a multi-agent, robotic\r\nsystem. This selection is done so that the control system meets its\r\nspecifications in the presence of bandwidth constraints, i.e. so the robots\r\nmaintain formation while avoiding obstacles in the environment.\r\n\r\nIn this project computer generated, or linguistic control commands are modeled\r\nas strings of mode descriptions that can be read by trigger based hybrid\r\nsystems. In other words, models for software based control of physical,\r\ncontinuous devices are developed in such a way that the actual control signals\r\nhave a clear information theoretic content in terms of code lengths, thus\r\nconnecting the field of multi-modal control with that of information theory.\r\nThis model enables the investigation of component integration issues. Since each\r\nsensor or actuator contributes to the total number of bits needed for coding the\r\ncontrol signals, by minimizing the code lengths subject to the constraint that\r\nthe system should behave in a satisfactory way, a natural measure of what\r\ncomponents are needed in the current mode of operation is derived. Furthermore,\r\nthe explicit focus on code lengths has immediate implication on coding theory,\r\ni.e. a theory for how the information shared between different embedded\r\ncomponents should be represented is a direct consequence of this research.\r\n\r\nThe information theoretic approach to control theory under investigation in this\r\nproject has a number of potential applications outside the field of embedded\r\ncontrol. For instance, in teleoperated robotics the control signals are\r\ntransmitted over communication channels in which the presence of channel noise\r\nmakes it preferable to transmit instructions that are as short as possible. A\r\nrelated problem arises in the area of minimum attention control, where an\r\nattention functional is defined as a measure of the control variability.\r\n",
