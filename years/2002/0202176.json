 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA large part of Professor Lyubeznik's research on local cohomology\r\nover the last decade has been devoted to the study of a number of striking\r\nconnections with several quite diverse areas of mathematics, such as etale\r\ncohomology, topology of algebraic varieties, D-modules and others including\r\nthe theory of tight closure and cohomology of groups. Professor \r\nLyubeznik is going to continue to study these (and some other) \r\nquestions by using methods that have been successful in the past as \r\nwell as developing some new methods.\r\n\r\nIt is always fascinating when a connection is discovered between two \r\nvery different fields of mathematics because it can result in \r\nunexpected and significant discoveries inaccessible by the methods of \r\nonly one of those two fields.  This project is in the areas of mathematics known as Abstract Algebra and Algebraic Geometry, with connections to Topology.  Abstract Algebra is a vast generalization of high school or college algebra, think of it as the algebra of many simultaneous polynomial equations in many variables.  Algebraic Geometry gives a way of studying the solutions to such a system of equations as a geometric object.  Topology is the study of those properties of geometric objects that don't change when the object is stretched or twisted, as if it were made of rubber.  Over the last decade \"local cohomology,\" an algebraic tool used in all three areas, \r\nhas been shown to have some striking connections with a number of \r\nvery different areas, including differential equations and \r\nothers. These connections are mutually beneficial. For example, \r\n\"D-modules,\" an algebraic version of differential equations, has helped \r\nestablish some important algebraic properties of local cohomology, while \r\nlocal cohomology has helped prove some striking topological results. Even though\r\nconsiderable progress on this circle of ideas has been made, much\r\nremains to be done.",
