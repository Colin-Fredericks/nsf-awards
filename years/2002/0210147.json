 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal develops the curriculum and laboratory facilities that are required to train the\r\nstudents of the three participating colleges (Clark Atlanta, Spelman and Morehouse) in the area of Information Assurance and Security.\r\n\r\nThis plan:\r\n_\r\n1) Builds the core curriculum and create necessary laboratory facilities for student education and\r\ntraining in the area of IAS including three core courses and a laboratory course).  The CIS department at Clark Atlanta University will offer two courses. The CS department at Spelman College will offer one course.  The CS department at Morehouse College will enhance some of its existing courses to include IAS related topics. Students from Georgia Tech, CAU, Spelman, and Morehouse colleges can take courses from any of the four colleges, through the University system in Georgia, without incurring any additional charges.\r\n_\r\n2) Creates three computer laboratories, one at each of the participating, with the required facilities for student training in the area of Information Assurance and Security. The laboratories will be equipped with a network of computing systems and students will be able to experiment with the security related software in a controlled environment. \r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed program includes:\r\n_\r\n1) Enhanced curriculum, laboratory facilities and research activities in the area of IAS in all the three participating colleges.\r\n_\r\n2) More opportunities for CS students of CAU, Spelman College, Morehouse College and Georgia Tech to register for IAS related courses.\r\n_\r\n3) Increased awareness of information security related issues in the community.\r\n\r\nThe results are measured using evaluations from students, professors and faculty members outside the consortium with expertise in the area of curriculum development. We anticipate that the students who graduate from the three colleges with concentration in IAS will pursue higher studies at other Universities or take up jobs as security professionals. \r\n",
