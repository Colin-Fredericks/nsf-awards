The activities proposed during the planning process are built upon a foundation that increases the number of mutually beneficial partnerships  between  faculty  members  in  the  College  of  Education  and  the  College  of Engineering and  Information Technology.  The PIs will also personally demonstrate and document the effectiveness of pedagogy-development strategies that are known to education faculty but not to engineering faculty.  As a  vehicle for developing  a comprehensive and integrated program to enhance engineering education in grades K-16, the state-approved Center \r\nfor Engineering Education Excellence will be activated.  \r\n\r\nThe core strategy is to identify  and support partnerships between faculty in the College of Engineering  and  Information Technology  and the College of Education at the University of South Carolina.    By partnering together to apply their unique expertise to address the  common interest of K-12 education improvement,  they have learned from  each other  and are able  to directly  apply their new knowledge in their separate disciplines.  This program is based on cooperative learning techniques.  By supporting good people to work together on good projects, each member of the \r\npartnership will have a greater awareness of what the other has to offer.  This is the cornerstone of a mutually beneficial and long-lasting relationship. \r\n",
