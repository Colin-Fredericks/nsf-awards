The suggested\r\nmethods combine algebraic topology with techniques\r\ncoming from stack theory in algebraic geometry and tools arising\r\nin symplectic geometry. It proposes the  use of the theory of\r\ngroupoids as a unifying tool in the solution these questions; a\r\nmethodology that has proved successful before in our study of\r\norbifolds. The following is a brief summary of some aspects of the \r\nproject. The first project is  program whose objective is\r\nthe study of the cohomological invariants that can be naturally\r\nobtained from several natural spaces associated to an orbifold. A\r\nsecond project consist of a study the orbifold elliptic genus, \r\nits modularity and rigidity properties from the homotopy \r\ntheory point of view. The third project describes a program to \r\ndefine and study Orbifold Deligne cohomologies and their relation \r\nto gerbes defined over the orbifold. The fourth is a project to study \r\nthe relation between the Hodge-Deligne numbers of an orbifold \r\nresolution of singularities of an orbifold and the original orbifold. \r\n\r\nOrbifolds are geometric spaces in which it is very important to keep track\r\nof the local symmetries of the particular situation. So in general the\r\npoints\r\nof an orbifold are classified by the amount of local symmetry. In ordinary\r\nspaces all points are equal, while in an orbifold points carry different\r\nweights corresponding to the amount of local symmetry. Orbifolds have been\r\nused in the study of structural crystallography allowing for a convenient\r\nbook-keeping device by reducing the  redundant information in the space \r\ngroup diagrams of the crystallographic groups. Orbifolds have also become\r\nextremely important in the field of theoretical physics referred to as\r\nSuperstring\r\ntheory. In String Theory, the multitude of particle types of classical\r\nhigh \r\nenergy physics is replaced by a single fundamental building block, a\r\n`string'.\r\nAs the string moves through time it traces out a tube or a sheet,\r\naccording \r\nto whether it is closed or open. Moreover,  the string can vibrate, and \r\ndifferent vibrational modes of the string represent the different particle \r\ntypes, since different modes are seen as different masses or spins. In an \r\nattempt to make these theories describe the physical universe, physicists\r\nhave\r\nbeen motivated to let the string move on an orbifold space. In these cases\r\nthe\r\ntheory acquires properties that are very desirable for it to model\r\nreality. \r\nThe work proposed in this project involves the development of rigorous\r\nmathematical methods to study the geometry of these spaces. \r\n\r\n",
