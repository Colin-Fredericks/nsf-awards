 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program aims to energize 6th-8th grade students in two middle schools within two St. Louis school districts, about math, science, and engineering through experimentation and computer visualization.  Ten teaching teams with specific areas of expertise will be formed, consisting of a GK-12 Fellow, a UGTA, a K-12 teacher and a Washington University faculty member.  Each team will develop a teaching module in conjunction with K-12 teachers in a K-12 subject area related to the research interests of the students. A team will rotate through four classrooms during each year and since each project is multidisciplinary, teaching teams will be expected to draw on the expertise of other teams as necessary.  This program will achieve the maximum leverage possible by ensuring that each student has an opportunity to develop a depth of knowledge in at least four areas and learn how each is strongly tied to the other disciplines. Faculty from the Washington University Department of Education will develop and implement a GK-12 Teaching Workshop to instruct the teaching teams so that they will have a more effective interaction with the students.  The GK-12 Fellows will be selected from diverse backgrounds and in addition to classroom activities will act as role models to the students, potentially influencing them to consider math, science, or engineering as career options. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering.",
