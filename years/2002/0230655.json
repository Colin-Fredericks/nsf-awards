The engineering science paradigm that began in chemical engineering around 1960 still dominates the core curriculum and major educational texts used throughout the field. That paradigm has served us well; indeed, it has been enabling for chemical engineering to become a central engineering discipline . The unique focus of chemical engineering on molecular transformations, processes, quantitative analysis, and multiscale treatment of problems provides an ideal platform for productive interactions with a wide range of other science and engineering disciplines at boundaries that are among the most exciting technology areas of our time. This broad applicability of chemical engineering fundamentals has become a defining feature of the discipline, and we are challenged to convey this breadth to our students. Hence a major driver for curriculum reform is the need to connect students to these many applications. Inasmuch as engineering curricula are often taught largely through example problems, this is a major undertaking if it is to be done well. A second major driver for curriculum reform in chemical engineering at this time is the advent of molecular biology. Our disciplinary focus on molecular interactions and transformations makes for a natural and exciting connection with molecular biology. Finally, we find ourselves in an era of rapid educational reform, in which both methods of engaging students in classrooms and laboratories are being reexamined and methods of incorporating new technology for education are being explored.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for reform in chemical engineering curricula are so compelling and broad that an appropriate response requires wide-ranging participation across the entire discipline. In addition to providing a richer response to this opportunity, extensive engagement of the academic community will facilitate wide adoption of the results of the reform. Hence this proposal is directed to a broad planning exercise to engage the chemical engineering discipline in responding to the challenges of breadth, biology, and new teaching methods. This will be done through a series of workshops, broadly advertised to the community. The first workshop will be focused on (re)defining the core curriculum in chemical engineering, with the product being enumeration of themes for a series of smaller topical workshops in these core areas. The theme workshops are charged with developing proposals for creation of texts, web-based supporting material, and modular experiments, design problems, and subtopics for augmenting and supplementing subjects.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
