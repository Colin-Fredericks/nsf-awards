 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0137287\r\n\r\nIn this project, scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography will continue to produce and distribute a standard reference material for the quality control of oceanic carbon dioxide measurements, in particular those that are made as part of international global programs.  This will help to ensure that such measurements are comparable and accurate although made in different laboratories at different times; and will be an important factor in the design of a Global Ocean Observing System.  To achieve this, the Scripps laboratory will prepare standard materials (seawater) and certify them for the following parameters of the oceanic carbon dioxide system: total dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, hydrogen ion concentration, pH, and d13 C for a sample of sea water.  These reference materials will be distributed to US and international investigators to assist in the quality control of oceanic CO2 measurements. They will also be used to provide test samples for use in collaborative studies of the analytical methods that are used to determine these various parameters.  As part of this work, the scientific team plans to organize various such collaborative studies and will collaborate with the various investigators to ensure that the experience gained is documented in reports and in written methods that are widely disseminated.  \r\n\r\nAn important part of the project involves planning for the future. It is essential to assure a long- term supply of reference materials for future ocean science research, and it will be necessary to identify an agency or company that will take on this responsibility.  To encourage this, the investigators propose to interact with the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology, as well as with Ocean Scientific International (the IAPSO Standard Sea Water Service) and with various Japanese investigators to assess and recommend a plan for the future. \r\n",
