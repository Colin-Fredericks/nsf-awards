We plan to \r\ndesign a good approximation for this problem (i.e., the error \r\nbetween the cylindrical segments and the neuron is small).\r\nWe also plan to have a good implementation, build a prototype \r\nsystem, and perform extensive empirical studies. Practically, \r\na solution to this problem will have a great impact in \r\ncomputational biology.  Theoretically, this problem generalizes \r\nthe problem of finding a single line stabbing a set of balls \r\nin 3D (and has never been seriously studied to the best of our knowledge).\r\n\r\nModeling the motions of human neurons is an important problem \r\nin biology, especially in understanding human behavior under \r\ndifferent circumstances.  To do that, we first need to model \r\na single neuron, which is very much like a tree-shaped \r\npolyhedron, using a set of cylindrical segments. Different\r\ncylindrical segments of different radii have different \r\nfunctionality, so the union of the cylindrical segments \r\nshould be as close to the neuron as possible. In practice \r\nthis problem is estimated manually by technicians in\r\nthe computational biology community. The process is \r\ntime-consuming and error-prone. Our research will focus \r\non automating this process with computers and a successful \r\nsolution will have deep influence in the computational \r\nbiology community. We will train two graduate students\r\nthroughout this project.\r\n",
