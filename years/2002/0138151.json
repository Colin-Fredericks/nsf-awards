Ismat Shah, Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Delaware, Newark, Delaware and Dr. S. Khurshid Hasanain, Magnetism and Superconductivity Laboratory, Physics Department, Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan.  They plan to study the magnetic behavior of nanometer sized magnetic particles by the techniques of DC and AC magnetometry.\r\nDr. Shah's team will synthesize nano magnetic particles to be characterized by the team of Dr. Hasanain.  The initial work will focus on nanoparticles of iron.  The area of nanoparticles in general, and magnetic nanoparticles in particular, is rapidly growing due to the numerous potential applications. The development of the experimental framework will have broader application to magnetic systems. The study of the magnetic properties of nanometer sized iron particles will provide much needed information on the novel properties of these systems, and will also contribute greatly to our fundamental understanding of the behavior of magnetic nanoparticles. The work will help establish the framework for the analysis of magnetic properties of newly prepared samples of metallic nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nScope: The University of Delaware has good programs and good equipment for magnetic nanoparticle research.  The two scientists have complementary expertise, as Shah is an expert in the synthesis and characterization of these systems, and Hasanain has broad expertise in the area of superconductivity and thin-film magnetism. Some preliminary collaboration has already begun with encouraging results, and the proposed experimental techniques are already available in Dr. Hasanain's laboratory. The project will optimize interaction among scientists and graduate students from each of the participating universities. The students will be provided training in an international setting in one of the leading edge areas of research in the field of nanotechnology.  The project meets INT criteria for support of cooperative projects that are mutually beneficial.  Support for this project is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research. \r\n\r\n",
