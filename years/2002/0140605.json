 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is provided under this RUI award to permit 8 teams of undergraduate\r\nstudents over the course of a two-year period to participate in a continuous\r\nresearch project evaluating the thermomechanical fatigue of solder joints. To\r\nmake this experience successful it is proposed to create a unique learning\r\nexperience  which is a combination of innovative classroom instruction and\r\nresearch. A master's student will assist in this project, and by doing so have a\r\nunique master's level experience designed to require the evaluation of the work\r\nof others, the synthesis of their work with that of the undergraduates and the\r\ndevelopment of leadership skills. There are research and teaching  components to\r\nthis proposed project.\r\n\r\nResearch: Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is the leading cause of solder joint\r\nfailure in electronic assemblies. TMF of solder joints is difficult to model as\r\nthere are many complex and interacting factors effecting the progression of\r\ndamage to the joint. Because of the high homologous temperatures (0.8 or higher)\r\nsignificant microstructural evolution occurs during TMF, changing the properties\r\nof the material as TMF progresses. An experimental\r\ninvestigation will be conducted to 1) identify those more readily measured material\r\nproperties most likely to affect TMF resistance, 2) evaluate the various\r\nacceleration factors used in TMF testing, and 3) evaluate the role of wetting in\r\nTMF failures.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this research much insight into TMF failure will be gained - 1)\r\nprogress will be made toward the development of an experimentally verified\r\nenergy model, and 2) the role of wetting in adhesion will be assessed. This\r\nmeans that those considering using lead-free solder alloys will be able to use\r\ndiagnostic \"tools\" not currently available -- the combination of material\r\nproperties which correlate to TMF resistance.\r\n\r\nTeaching: To enable undergraduates to participate in a continuing research\r\nprogram, a unique \"classroom\" experience will supplement the research. These\r\nclass sessions will embrace interactive learning techniques, and expose the\r\nundergraduates to 1) the necessary theoretical background, 2) the status of the\r\nproject, 3) necessary lab techniques including statistical analysis, 4) oral and\r\nwritten communication skills, and 5) broader issues including ethics and\r\neconomic impact. All of these subjects will be context based. The philosophy of\r\nthis course is that upper level undergraduates need to perform at the synthesis\r\nlevel of Bloom's Taxonomy, and their experience is designed to enable them to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThe master's student will be required to perform at the evaluation level of\r\nBloom's Taxonomy (evaluating the work of the undergraduates) and synthesize this\r\nwork with their own study on wetting, thus participating in a unique integrating\r\nexperience. Additionally the student will develop leadership skills, and\r\npossibly be persuaded to pursue a doctoral degree and develop a desire to teach.\r\nThe master's students experience may also encourage the undergraduates to pursue\r\na graduate degree.\r\n\r\nIt is felt that this comprehensive plan will maximize the chances for success\r\nand serve as a demonstration project for others desiring to incorporate research\r\ninto the undergraduate experience and developing a novel masters program.\r\n\r\nImpact: It is felt that this program can significantly impact undergraduate\r\neducation by serving as a proof of concept in the development of research\r\noriented courses, generating an appreciation of life-long learning, and\r\ndemonstrating the value of undergraduate research to the outside community. This\r\nwork  complements the current work of the PI and lays the foundation for his\r\nfuture plans.\r\n\r\n",
