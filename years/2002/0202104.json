 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help support the Big Sky Conference on Discrete \r\nMathematics which is  held in Missoula, Montana. There are two \r\nmain objectives of the conference. First, the conference is \r\ndesigned to bring together researchers and educators from the \r\ngeographical area with interests in discrete mathematics in order \r\nfor them to share ideas, present their work, and collaborate. \r\nTopics for the conference cover areas of discrete mathematics\r\nincluding combinatorics, graph theory, discrete geometry, design \r\ntheory and theoretical computer science. The conference attracts \r\nmathematicians and computer scientists from western US and Canada \r\nand in doing so has strengthened the discrete mathematics \r\ncommunity in the region. The conference also includes  two \r\nresearch-level invited addresses. One is given by a senior-level \r\nexperienced  mathematician and the other by a younger researcher \r\nwho has made significant contributions to the field. The presence \r\nof these internationally-known researchers  greatly enhances the \r\nconference. Secondly, the conference seeks to provide an \r\nopportunity for students, teachers, and others in the region to \r\nlearn more about contemporary mathematics. This award provides \r\nsupport for undergraduate and graduate students to attend the \r\nconference and present their work. In addition, a public lecture \r\n(given by one of the invited speakers) is an integral part of the \r\nBig Sky Conference. The audience, comprised of people of all ages \r\nand many different walks of life, is treated to a dynamic lecture \r\non the beauty and relevance of mathematics. The conference will \r\nbe hosted by The University of Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Big Sky Conference on Discrete Math is held in the early fall \r\nat The University of Montana. The primary focus of the conference \r\nis stimulation and dissemination of research and creative ideas in \r\ndiscrete mathematics. This includes promoting collaboration among \r\nregional colleagues, supporting student research, and \r\ndemonstrating to the general populace that mathematics is a \r\ndynamic evolving field with applications in modern society. The \r\nevents of the conference include contributed talks by faculty and \r\nstudents and three invited addresses. One of the principle \r\nspeakers is an internationally acclaimed specialist and \r\noutstanding expositor. This speaker gives a research level \r\nseminar and a public lecture. With attendance at the public \r\nlecture between 300 and 500 people, public awareness of \r\nmathematics has flourished during the years of the Big Sky \r\nConference. The other speaker is a younger researcher who has made \r\na significant contribution to an area of discrete mathematics. \r\nThis person typically gives a specialized talk about a recent \r\nadvancement in the field. The conference attracts researchers,\r\neducators, and students from the US and Canada, especially those \r\nin the northwest region.\r\n",
