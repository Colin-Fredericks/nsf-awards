 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nWe have developed a number of real-time experiments as an approach to improving student understanding of the graphical representation of a variety of concepts. The project builds on successes by Physics educators (primarily with motion sensors) in combining the use of technology and hands-on engineering experiments to achieve visual analysis of phenomena in real-time in the classroom. Our approach has expanded greatly by using a wide variety of inexpensive sensors that are easily interfaced with PCs. This enables our students to measure many different physical phenomena. We have developed a series of modules in one-page, and use a 20-minute activity format. We hope this format more readily enable faculty to incorporation our modules into their curriculum. Our best modules are being distributed and marketed with the assistance of the manufacturer of the sensors. Our modules have been designed to be appropriate for high school students. It has been our goal to implement our modules across multiple classes. The modules and the format we have created holds promise for students to make connections between courses and thus support curriculum integration. Students are encouraged to learn more effectively and both students and instructors are expected to enjoy the learning process. A multiple-intervention assessment protocol will be used to determine the comparative benefit to learning effectiveness of the following interventions: (1) presentation of concepts with time for reflection, (2) reflection guided by instructor demonstrations using the sensors, and (3) guided, active experimentation with the sensors. A pre-test / post-test design will be used to account for the effect of differences in the initial preparation of the different study populations.",
