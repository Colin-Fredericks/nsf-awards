Yet, these volumes of ionized gas that exist around the most massive young stars, at least in the early stages of their formation and evolution, are some of the least understood objects in the Galaxy. The diminutive cousins of HII regions called ultracompact (UC) HII regions are very different from the parsec-scale, optically-thin HII regions described in classic textbooks.  The evidence is clear: UC HII regions are not simply small HII regions, they represent a unique class of object. The goal of Dr. Christopher De Pree's research project is to compare recent and proposed observations with hydrodynamic simulations to move toward a more complete understanding of the nature of UC HII regions and what their morphologies, temperatures, kinematics and evolution tell us about the earliest stages of massive star formation. \r\n\r\nUC HII regions have never been imaged and mapped spectroscopically on these small spatial \r\nscales. The sources to be studied are optically unobservable, and these will be the best data available until the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is dedicated in the coming decade. These new data provide the best comparison data to constrain hydrodynamic simulations of UC HII region evolution. The Agnes Scott College program has a proven record of success in involving undergraduate women in astronomical research and preparing them for graduate work, and this project would continue and strengthen that effort by providing research involvement and exposure to scientists at two premiere national graduate programs (North Carolina State University and Harvard University). Early data from related projects have been shared informally with a number of investigators, and this project would make existing data and new data freely available.   This award is made under the auspices of the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program at NSF.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
