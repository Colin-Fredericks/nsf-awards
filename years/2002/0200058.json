 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research grant is to establish a computer design procedure for product structures that will provide the highest strength or highest stiffness for a given weight of material.  This will be accomplished by direct solution of the equations defining the optimum structural layout for desired loading and boundary conditions. The method of solution will involve the use of matrix operators, and one part of the work will be the extension of the set of matrix operators to handle a range of different boundary situations.  The procedure will be appropriately applied on personal computers so that it can be widely used in the engineering design community.  The research program will also involve the manufacture and testing of prototype structures to validate the design process at each stage of the research.  Case studies will be carried out to illustrate the range of weight reduction opportunities.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, the principal benefit of the study will be a new approach to weight reduction, spanning a wide range of applications from aerospace to mass-produced durable goods.  It is also anticipated that the fundamental and direct approach to structure design, developed in the research, will be appealing to engineering educators and will impact the teaching of structural engineering and engineering design.\r\n\r\n",
