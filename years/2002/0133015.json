 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves studies of chlorine atom (Cl) initiated oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and subsequent formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Laboratory studies will be carried out in a smog chamber where reaction will be initiated by photolysis of molecular chlorine, and products will be studied using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry and other types of detectors. Field studies will be carried out with the goal of finding unique markers of Cl-initiated chemistry. Computer models will be modified to include detailed chlorine chemistry, and will be used to interpret the laboratory and field data. This research project will develop new tools to study the chemistry of chlorine in the atmosphere and provide new information on the role of this potentially important oxidant.\r\n\r\nFor the education component of this project, the PI will develop innovative coursework, integrate the results of his research into his teaching, and provide research opportunities for undergraduate students. The PI will also participate in a Summer Environmental Enrichment Program (SEEP) designed to encourage the participation of women and members of underrepresented minorities in the environmental sciences and engineering. Efforts will also be directed towards improving retention of engineering students at Duke University.",
