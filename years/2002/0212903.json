 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research continues an ongoing exploration of self-incompatibility and the evolution of self-fertilization in Linanthus (Polemoniaceae).  Self-incompatibility (SI), a genetic mechanism that allows plants to recognize and reject self-pollen, is a common feature of higher plants.  The breakdown of SI, resulting in self-fertilization, is known to have occurred frequently throughout the evolutionary history of flowering plants.  The proposed series of experiments will explore a newly discovered transient form of SI that may represent a \"snapshot\" in the breakdown of SI and evolution toward self-fertilization.  In L. jepsonii, self-fertilization is prevented for a few hours or days, after which flowers become fully capable of self-fertilization.  The proposed experiments will characterize this phenomenon, its genetic basis, and its effect on the rate of self-fertilization.  Molecular methods will be used to explore evolutionary relationships among populations that differ in the extent of transient SI.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will contribute basic knowledge about SI, a phenomenon that has important implications for crop plant breeding.  The genetic and physiological bases of this mechanism have received considerable study, yet we know little about the process by which SI breaks down.  The project has been designed to foster training of undergraduate students.  The modular nature of the research, comprising a series of discrete experiments, will allow undergraduates gain experience in a range of methodologies, including field studies, fluorescence microscopy, pollination experiments, and molecular techniques \r\n",
