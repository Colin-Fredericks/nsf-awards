 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the purchase of eight plant growth chambers and related equipment to be used for studies of major crop plants including maize, rice and tomato, as well as studies of other plants whose genetics and physiology are of general interest.  These chambers are suited for high-throughput and large-scale projects that often require well-defined plant growth conditions, including light, temperature and humidity, or experimental treatments that are not possible without modern growth chambers.  Planned uses include studies of plant-pathogen interactions, nuclear-plastid signaling, and light signal transduction in several major crop plants and in Arabidopsis.  Use of such chambers allows investigators to standardize plant growth conditions that often vary widely from one research group to another. Such standardization facilitates verification of results by other investigators, as well as new investigations that build on the results of previous work.",
