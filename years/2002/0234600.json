 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication protocols form an integral part of many complex \r\nsoftware systems. In many such systems, protocols' impact on\r\nsystem dependability far exceeds the fraction of the total \r\nnumber of lines of code devoted to their implementation. \r\nUnfortunately, there exists virtually no systematic approach for \r\ndesign and evaluation of protocols that considers dependability.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we have developed a systematic, semi-automatic \r\napproach for validation of communication protocols. Our approach \r\nuses semi-formal representations of protocols and efficient search \r\n(forward search as well as fault-oriented test generation) to \r\nanalyze protocols over the entire range of scenarios, including \r\nexternal events, faults (such as loss of packets, communication \r\nlink failures, loss of state in communication nodes, and so on), \r\nas well as network topologies. The effectiveness of our approach \r\nhas been demonstrated via its application to a varied range of \r\nprotocols.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we will undertake three main tasks. First, we \r\nwill extend our previously developed framework to compute values \r\nof appropriate dependability metrics for existing protocols of \r\ninterest to the NASA and the HDCCSR community. Second, we will \r\ndevelop the first systematic approach to design new protocols that \r\nsatisfy desired dependability criteria. Finally, we will use \r\nthe testbed provided by NASA in conjunction with the expertise \r\nand software made available by NASA and other HDCCSR researchers \r\nto fine-tune our approaches and to demonstrate that: (i) accurate \r\nvalues of dependability metrics can indeed be computed for \r\nexisting communication protocols using a systematic, semi-\r\nautomatic approach, (ii) new protocols can be designed in a \r\nsystematic, semi-automated manner to meet desired dependability \r\ncriteria, and (iii) enhancements in the dependability of \r\ncommunication protocols can indeed significantly enhance the \r\ndependabilities of many software-hardware systems of interest to \r\nNASA and the HDCCSR community. \r\n\r\nIn addition to above technical contributions, the proposed \r\nresearch will have broader impact on society. First, results of \r\nthe proposed research will enable improvements in dependability \r\nof critical infrastructure, such as the air-traffic control \r\nsystem. Second, the research will develop new approaches and \r\npractical case studies that will provide us with a unique \r\nopportunity to educate a large and  diverse student body in \r\ntechniques for development of dependable protocols and systems. \r\n",
