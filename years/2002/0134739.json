He will investigate the formation of stars in clusters by observing them at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, taking advantage of newly available telescope instrumentation. Although it is known that most stars form in clusters, the physics of star formation in groups is poorly understood relative to that of the formation of single stars.  Dr. Williams will use observations at continuum wavelengths to locate protostars inside their dusty nascent clouds, and then use observations of molecular lines to investigate the dynamics and chemistry of the surrounding gas. The concentration and motions of the protostars will be used to estimate the relative age of a cluster, allowing Dr. Williams to trace the evolution of the chemistry and motion of the stars and surrounding gas as a function of time.  \r\n\r\nDr. Williams will involve graduate and undergraduate students in his research, and serve as liaison for a new international student exchange between the University of Florida and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias in Spain. He will also participate in his university's Student Science Training Program by mentoring a high school student each summer in a seven week program.\r\n",
