 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Electrodeposition Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is relatively new, started in\r\n1996. It grew out of the Read Conference, one of the primary scientific forums for the\r\nelectrodeposition community since the early 50's.   The understanding of electrodeposition at the atomic scale has increased dramatically in recent years as new analytical methods, like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), have been developed. This has resulted in improved control over processes, and the ability to use electrodeposition in areas where control over the nanometer scale is required. \r\nElectrodeposition is becoming accepted as a standard thin film synthesis methodology in\r\nnew areas. A clear example is the adoption of electrodeposition by the electronics\r\nindustries to form copper interconnects in VLSI. Production VLSI circuits use 135 nm wide copper wires, with research and development teams currently working on 90 nm and smaller copper interconnects. In addition, electrodeposition has a central role in nearly all micro-technologies. New areas where it is playing an increasing roll include\r\nnanofabrication and the formation of compound semiconductor thin films. The 2002\r\nconference has a special highlight on the role of electrodeposition in nano- and\r\nmicro-fabrication.  This proposal will allow the organizers to continue developing the Electrodeposition GRC into the premier electrochemical materials conference.\r\n",
