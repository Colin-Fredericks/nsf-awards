A team composed of members from education and industry will\r\ncollaborate to achieve the goals.\r\n\r\nThis grant is the first step in achieving a larger vision defined by these sequential goals:\r\n(1) create a curriculum development methodology inspired by the Electronic Performance\r\nSystem used in the aerospace industry (Boeing), and adapted to the university\r\nenvironment, the objective of this planning grant; (2) bring together appropriate cross-\r\ndiscipline faculty to use the EPSS methodology for development of a curriculum\r\ncomponent such as a course or a semester of courses as a demonstration project; (3) use\r\nthe same faculty to conduct a one-semester demonstration project with university\r\nengineering and technology students; (4) measure, assess, and compare the student\r\nachievement and satisfaction of the demonstration group at various intervals to that of a\r\ncontrol group of students engaged in the traditional curriculum using outcomes-based\r\nmethodologies; (5) measure, assess, and compare faculty performance, workload and\r\nsatisfaction in both groups at various intervals; (6) evaluate the results of the\r\ndemonstration project and prepare a report; (7) share the results through workshops and\r\nother media with other universities to encourage and support demonstration and\r\ncollaborative projects at those universities; and (8) implement the curriculum concepts on\r\na large scale across the university and between campuses within the university.\r\n",
