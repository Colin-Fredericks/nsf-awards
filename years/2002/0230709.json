In this context, there is a need for our educational institutions to develop \r\ninnovative curriculum, which will enable our students to .hit the ground running. when \r\nthey begin working in their respective organizations upon graduation.  Our manufacturing \r\nindustry needs a new type of engineer, who must not only possess a strong background in \r\nmanufacturing  (and  manufacturing  systems)  but  also  be  skilled  at  using  emerging \r\ntechnologies such as Virtual Reality, the  Internet and other tools to accomplish a wide \r\nrange  of  activities  in  the  context  of  virtual  manufacturing  enterprises.    \r\n \r\nThis project will develop comprehensive plans for the design and development of a new manufacturing engineering curriculum, which addresses the changing manufacturing landscape.  Such an information technology based manufacturing  curriculum will benefit graduating students and industrial organizations (who hire them) by providing a workforce, which possesses skills and knowledge that are necessary to succeed in today's evolving  global economy.  Other  activities proposed include the incorporation of virtual reality technology to enhance student learning for under-represented minorities including students with physical challenges.  The project team includes New Mexico State university and other academic and industry partners. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
