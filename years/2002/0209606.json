Numerical and analytical approaches will be used to study spin transport in paramagnetic quantum fluids and solids.  The research consists of three projects: analysis of transverse relaxation in NMR experiments with highly polarized Fermi liquids; computer simulation of spin waves and spin diffusion in Heisenberg paramagnets; and, calculation of the damping rates of slosh modes in trapped Fermi gases.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate research is an integral part of the Computational Physics program at Wisconsin - La Crosse.  Hence, students play an important role in this research, including the presentation of results at national conferences and undergraduate research forums.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is an RUI award for research at a predominantly undergraduate institution.
