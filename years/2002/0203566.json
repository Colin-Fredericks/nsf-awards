 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Science Research Institute is developing and producing a 15-minute pilot for a regular mathematics slot in a new PBS magazine format program that is being developed.  Keith Devlin will be responsible for the mathematics content as well as appearing as the on-camera host.  The segments will be based on Devlin's popular radio \"Math Guy\" segments that have been appearing on NPR's Weekend Edition.  The topic for the pilot is the Clay Millennium Problems.  The pilot is being produced by Jon Palfreman, an award-winning science documentary producer.  Evaluation of the pilot will be conducted by Rockman et. al.  If successful, a future segment would explore a range of mathematics topics including mathematics education, epidemiology, scientific visualization, uses and misuses of statistics, how the brain acquires and processes mathematics, and the mathematics of voting.\r\n\r\n",
