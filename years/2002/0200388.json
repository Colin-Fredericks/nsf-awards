At present, robot contact operations are clumsy and\r\nineffective, except in instances where the environment is highly predictable and the tasks\r\ncan be accomplished using position control alone. However, for futuristic applications of\r\nrobots, such as autonomous assembly of a space-based power system, robots for defense\r\napplications, or a potential industry in domestic robotics, competence in contact\r\noperations in unstructured environments is essential for success.\r\n\r\nThe exploratory project will evaluate the use of intelligent control algorithms with appropriate set of assumptions and representations of robot/environment contact dynamics, using \"Natural Admittance Control\" and \"virtual dynamics\" as a means to integrate high and low-level controls. \r\n\r\nIt will consider four tasks in intelligent control research: (1) constructing a reflexive damage-avoidance layer to assure the safety of a robot and its environment and enable the capability for safe, autonomous learning; (2) human strategies for contact operations will be analyzed and \"cloned\" for robot execution, using identification of atomic behaviors and recognition of events that trigger sequential behaviors; (3) on-line identification of environment dynamics; (4) neural-net based optimizing control algorithms employing \"adaptive critics\" will be constructed in the context of NAC/virtual dynamics.\r\n",
