 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out the following research:  a) preparation of organometallic complexes with unusual structure, reactivity or physical properties (Deck); b) studies on metal complexes of polysulfonated phosphine ligands as catalysts in biphasic reaction conditions (Hanson); c) isolation of natural products (Kingston); d) rotaxane chemistry (Gibson); e) organic synthesis and synthetic methodology (Carlier); and f) preparation of polypeptides with novel three-dimensional architecture as mimics for the helix-turn-helix motif in polypeptides (Etzkorn).  \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including organic, polymer and organometallic chemistry.",
