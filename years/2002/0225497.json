They can perform tasks, which \r\ntraditional stand along sensors are hard to match. Although sensor networks \r\nhave some similarities with another class of wireless networks called ad-hoc \r\nnetworks, they have several distinguishing characteristics that necessitate \r\ndedicated communication protocols.\r\n\r\nThe PIs overall objective in the proposed project is to develop a system \r\narchitecture, which includes new protocol entities and interfaces. Their focus \r\nwill be on the integration of the proposed algorithms into an efficient \r\noverall system. While they propose to develop new algorithms and protocols for \r\nthe transport and network layers, specifically, their deliverables will \r\ninclude: (a) a new transport protocol called SNTP (Sensor-Nets Transport \r\nProtocol) that is designed specifically for a sensor network environment, \r\nand (b) a power aware and scalable routing protocol that allow an end-user \r\nto control the sensors and reconfigure the interconnection of the sensor \r\nnetwork. \r\n\r\nThe PIs will evaluate their proposed protocols in a ns2 network simulator based \r\nsimulation environment, and make available for public use any protocol \r\nsimulation software. Since the ns2 simulator currently does not extensively \r\nsupport the simulation of sensor network environments, they will also develop \r\nsuch support and make it available for public use. \r\n\r\n",
