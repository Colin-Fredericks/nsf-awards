The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners include the Polytechnic University of New York (Lead Institution), Bodega Association of United States Inc. New York, Datasym, All Long Island Cash Register, Symbol Technologies Inc., South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, Accion-New York, New York National Bank and Wagner Graduate School of Public Service-NYU. The goals for this program are: (1) create the necessary organizational conditions to foster the transformation of knowledge into the systems and services that will educate underrepresented minority retail owners on the value of implementing point of service scanning technology, (2) introduce a point of service scanning technology linked to cash registers in small grocery stores owned by underrepresented communities in New York City, and (3) conduct research to understand the resistance of immigrant and minority communities to using technology.  The partnership of companies that make, install and service the scanners, city organizations responsible for economic development, and financial institutions to process loans to the store owners has been formed.  The program develops training to overcome the knowledge, skill, and psychological barriers associated with getting underrepresented minorities to adopt technology and extends the use of scanned data to identify, record and order inventory. Bilingual minority students are involved in the research and implementation stages. \r\n\r\nThere is a genuine resistance by this minority-dominated retail market sector to use of technology.  The university has the confidence of the retailers association to manage the installation of the equipment and training of personnel in its use.  The partnership includes financial institutions to make loans to the retailers to purchase the equipment.  The minority-dominated retail sector will gain from use of this technology.  The study of the factors that cause the resistance to technology and how they were overcome will serve as a model for technology insertion in other demographic sectors where there is resistance to it. Extensive involvement of bilingual underrepresented students in the effort has obvious societal benefits. In addition, the scanning equipment will lead to increased profit for an estimated 8000 small grocery stores in New York City by providing inventory control and reduced inventory costs.  Retail scanners have been shown to reduce cashier errors and increase profitability nationally.\r\n",
