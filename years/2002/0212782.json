 "awd_abstract_narration": "0212782\r\nVenable\r\nThis LTREB proposal is to extend the continuous record of population and community dynamics\r\nof desert winter annual plants on permanent plots at a Sonoran Desert site at the Desert\r\nLaboratory near Tucson, AZ, USA. It will clarify and extend the understanding of demographic\r\nvariation and covariation and its role in population and community processes. Data on\r\ngermination, survival and reproduction of desert annual plants will be continuously monitored on\r\nlong-term plots established from 10 to 19 years ago at locations both under shrub canopies and in\r\nthe open at this field station. Delayed germination and between year seed carry over are thought\r\nto be important for the persistence of desert annuals, so the magnitude of the soil seed reserves\r\nwill be monitored and determine what fraction germinate in each year for each species under\r\nshrubs and in the open. Seeds will be separated from standardized soil samples and tested for\r\nviability. The results of this research will be analyzed together with weather data to determine\r\nhow climatic variation determines population variation for these annual plant species. The\r\ninvestigators will then construct population and community models of this desert annual system.\r\nThese models will be used to explore the role of soil seed banks in buffering populations in the\r\nface of environmental variation. They will also be used to investigate how life history\r\ndifferences among species promote their coexistence and species diversity.\r\nDesert annual plants have played an important role as model organisms in the development of our\r\nunderstanding of how organisms adapt to variable and unpredictable environments. They have\r\nalso been used to exemplify ideas about non-equilibrium community dynamics in variable\r\nenvironments. Yet their dynamics are not well known empirically, especially the behavior of\r\nseeds. This project will provide the best available long-term data for evaluating these ideas.\r\nThere has been considerable theoretical and experimental work carried out on the evolutionary\r\necology, population ecology and community ecology of this system. Such combinations of\r\ntheoretical and experimental work with long-term observations are proving to be a powerful\r\napproach to yield new insights and syntheses in plant ecology.\r\nThis research will further the goal of combining research and education by virtue of occurring in\r\nthe academic environment of a major research university. Graduate and undergraduate students\r\nwill be involved in capacities that fosters hands-on training and research experience that\r\ncomplements formal coursework. Ph.D., Masters, and undergraduate honors projects will be\r\nfacilitated as part of or offshoots of this research. REU support will be sought for related\r\nundergraduate projects. In the first phase of this research more than half of the undergraduate\r\nand graduate participants in this project were women and an attempt will be made to include a\r\nhigh percentage of women in the proposed research. The PI will endeavor to include\r\nunderrepresented ethnic and cultural groups in this research by working with minority access\r\nprograms on campus.",
