 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program is for the acquisition of a low temperature Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope/Scanning Probe Microscope (NSOM/SPM) for light emission spectroscopic studies of structures down to the nanometer-scale. Such a powerful combination will allow the simultaneous recording of topographical and spectroscopic data, with conventional far-field imaging, confocal microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and near-field optics in a single system. Examples include NSOM imaging/spectroscopy of nanowire arrays, quantum dots, and related III-V and magnetic semiconductor heterostructures, NSOM fluorescence of disordered polymers, glasses, super-cooled liquids, and single molecule fluorescence studies of proteins. Novel experiments are also proposed to explore issues in quantum chaos at optical wavelengths using suitably fabricated structures. The Nanonics Imaging Ltd. NSOM/SPM-100 confocal system is able to perform simultaneous NSOM and AFM imaging. Metal-coated tips will be used for the development of ballistic electron emission microscopy of semiconductor samples simultaneously with light emission spectroscopy. The instrument has the potential of satisfying many diverse users including identifying and building basic skill sets for undergraduate and graduate students and to train talented technicians. It will be a complementary tool to the ultra high vacuum Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM/AFM) and a micro-Raman systems currently available in the physics department at Northeastern University that are devoted to the promotion of research and educational programs in nano- and biomolecular-science.\r\n \r\nThis is an instrument award to Northeastern University for a Near-field Scanning Optical Microscope/Scanning Probe Microscope (NSOM/SPM) with analytical light emission spectroscopic (LES) capabilities. The new facility provides a complimentary platform for the universal integration of several other forms of frontier microscopies, such as an ultra high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope/atomic force microscope and micro-Raman systems, that are currently in use in their physics department today. The instrumentation will enable the user to make direct comparisons between the topographical and optical/spectroscopic properties of samples down to the nanometer scale. The instrument is equipped with a variable temperature capability from room temperature to10K and the proposal calls for future development of ballistic electron emission spectroscopy (BEES) using metal-coated tips for complementary BEES/LES studies of semiconductor heterostructures.\r\nThe facility has two central goals: \r\n1) Collaborative research using NSOM imaging/spectroscopy to explore issues in quantum chaos at optical wavelengths; studies of quantum dots, and magnetic semiconductors for \"spintronic\" applications; and NSOM fluorescence of disordered polymers, glasses; and single molecule fluorescence studies of proteins.\r\n2) Education and hands-on training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and talented technicians in nanometer-scale characterization techniques. \r\nThe instrument request includes 33% matching funds provided by Northeastern University and a substantial discount by the instrument manufactures.\r\n",
