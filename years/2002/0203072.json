One concerns complex analysis\r\non infinite dimensional manifolds, and the proposed problems  \r\nare mostly cohomological in nature. They center around the\r\ncomputation of Dolbeault and sheaf cohomology groups. Two types\r\nof manifolds will be investigated: loop spaces of finite\r\ndimensional compact complex manifolds and Stein manifolds. One\r\n(longer term) goal will be to prove a Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch\r\ntype index theorem on loop spaces, another to discover an\r\nappropriate class of sheaves for which cohomology can be proved\r\nto vanish on infinite dimensional Stein manifolds (generalization\r\nof the notion of coherent sheaves). I will also work on solving\r\nthe inhomogeneous Cauchy--Riemann equations in pseudoconvex\r\ndomains in Hilbert spaces. The finite dimensional component is\r\nabout extending the concept of holomorphic motion from the \r\ncomplex plane to motions of higher dimensional complex manifolds\r\nand their subsets. This will hopefully provide a useful tool for\r\nhigher dimensional complex dynamics.\r\n\r\nMathematics in general elucidates the formal structures\r\nthat underlie the exploration of our world. An example of\r\nsuch a structure is a function, which formalizes the notion\r\nof \"dependence\" among variable quantities. For instance\r\ntemperature at some location on Earth depends on the\r\nlatitude and the longitude of the location, but also on\r\nthe altitude, and the time of the measurement: we have a function\r\nof four variables. In another context, the temperature of say\r\na mole of a gas depends on the velocity of each molecule of the\r\ngas, thus on trillions and trillions of variables. Functions\r\nof such a huge number of variables are best understood by\r\nidealizing to infinitely many variables. These are the main\r\nobjects of the proposed research: functions of infinitely\r\nmany variables. The variables are complex rather than real\r\nnumbers. Introducing complex variables typically streamlines\r\nproblems, and having solved the complexified problem one can\r\noften go back and obtain, by restriction, a solution to the\r\noriginal real problem. The problems to be considered are partly\r\nmotivated by various mathematical disciplines, and also by\r\ntheoretical physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
