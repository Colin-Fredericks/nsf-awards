 "awd_abstract_narration": "To successfully meet the challenges of the 21st century, engineers must be creative and be able to adapt themselves to new ideas. Technology is changing at a rapid pace. The increasing number of new materials and new systems available for structural engineering applications offers a large number of possibilities for the engineer with the knowledge and creative skills to understand them. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this CAREER proposal is to promote innovative teaching and research in civil engineering. The integrated teaching and research plans will provide a fundamental contribution to the use of non-traditional materials for new structures as well as for state-of-the-art repair and retrofit systems.\r\n\r\nThe outlined teaching plan will improve the curriculum in the areas of infrastructure and structural engineering both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. This long-term educational plan coordinates directly with the PI's research interest in the area of laminates for repair and retrofit of civil structures. Two innovative courses, one in materials for structural design, the second on repair and retrofit systems for civil infrastructure; a set of redesigned laboratory experiences for design oriented courses; and a new professional concentration in structural engineering will invigorate the profession of civil engineering. Diversity in engineering will be achieved through undergraduate summer research linked to Clarkson's Ronald E. McNair Program. Low-income and first-generation college students, as well as underrepresented minority students will benefit from this activity. \r\n\r\nThe proposed fundamental research will advance the knowledge of interfacial bond behavior between epoxy bonded FRP laminates and concrete. By characterizing the interfacial bond failure, a reliable design procedure can be developed for structural elements strengthened by externally bonded FRP laminates. Valuable information in the area of fracture mechanics will be gained by evaluating the energy dissipated during the interfacial crack growth. In particular, a new test set-up will be designed to obtain a fracture parameter. Results from this research will directly impact the use of laminates for repair and retrofit of civil structures. This research will help to move laminates and other new materials into the mainstream of engineering practice by contributing to the development of standard design equations and procedures.      \r\n\r\nAs a central outcome of this project the PI expects to become an academic leader committed to enhance the engineering community through her contributions in education and research. By providing teaching and research of the highest quality, the PI will fulfill the mission of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Clarkson University to \"educate talented and motivated men and women to become successful professionals through quality undergraduate and graduated programs that place high priority on student access and interaction with faculty.\"\r\n\r\n",
