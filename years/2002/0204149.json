The investigation involves analysis of the mathematical models as well as numerical computations.\r\n\r\nIn most applications, crystalline materials are used in polycrystalline form.  Polycrystals of the same material but with different textures may exhibit different behavior.  One goal of the present research project is to gain a better understanding of the dependence of the behavior of polycrystals on their texture.  Better understanding will lead to better guidelines for materials selection and processing procedures.  A second goal of this project is to contribute to a better understanding of composite materials---materials composed of two or more integrated pure phases.  In general, a composite has better properties than the pure phases alone.  Examples of composite materials are plastics that are reinforced with glass fibers or glass particles: the result is a much stronger and stiffer material.  The results of this project will be useful for the design of composite materials with specific properties.\r\n",
