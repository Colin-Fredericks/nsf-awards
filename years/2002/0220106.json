 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new, completely-integrated processor-memory-interconnect (CI-PMI)\r\narchitecture model suitable for a range of data-intensive\r\napplications is proposed. Compared to the existing processor-in-memory\r\n(PIM) architectures, the proposed CI-PMI approach integrates more\r\ncompletely the processing, memory, and interconnect. This is achieved\r\nby starting with the classical architecture of high capacity memory,\r\nnamely, a binary tree of decoders with memory modules as leaves, laid\r\nout as an H-tree. In the proposed model, copies of one or more types\r\nof application-specific computing elements are added at different\r\nlevels of the memory decoder tree, desired functionality added to the\r\nmemory decoders to augment their role as interconnects as well as to\r\nsupport desired computation, and, if necessary, additional interconnects\r\nadded between the application-specific processors, the memory modules,\r\nand the decoders. The proposed architecture will be developed and\r\ndemonstrated for a data-intensive application, namely motion estimation\r\nfor MPEG encoding.\r\n\r\nThe results of the proposed research will be used to augment one\r\nadvanced class, to be taught at USC as well as UCI. The class will\r\ntake a top-down view of advanced processor-in-memory architectures\r\nincluding those developed in this project.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will advance the state of the art in computer\r\narchitecture, VLSI, and VLSI CAD, leading to faster and cheaper designs\r\nfor day to day computation and information retrieval, exchange, and\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n",
