 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, in the laboratory of Professor Janice Reutt-Robey at the University of Maryland-College Park, investigates the structure and reactivity of molecular scale architectures formed on well characterized metal surfaces.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, the detailed structure and motion of alane oligomers formed on the Al(111) surface are being examined using scanning tunneling microscopy.  A similar approach is used to examine the structure and reactivity of ordered architectures formed by the adsorption of N-heteroaromatic carboxylic acids on the silver surface.  Information obtained from these studies is fundamental to our understanding of the growth and operation of nano-scale electronic devices.\r\n\r\nUsing scanning tunneling microscopy and other surface sensitive tools, Professor Reutt-Robey and her coworkers at the University of Maryland are probing the adsorption and reaction of a range of interesting chemical systems with connections to the formation of nano-scale devices.  The interaction of atomic hydrogen with aluminum surfaces to form ordered oligomers on the surface is being examined.  Also, the adsorption and interaction of strongly hydrogen bonding nitrogen containing aromatic acids is being examined.  The information gained from these studies will provide important underpinning for the synthesis and manipulation of nano-scale architectures on surfaces.  \r\n",
