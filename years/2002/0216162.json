 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Sweet Briar College will acquire a 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) structure-activity relationship, and the synthesis and testing of analogs of bioactive compounds; b) structure elucidation and characterization of natural products; c) the synthesis of novel ligands for palladium and platinum bioactive compounds; and d) the synthesis and purification of dithiophosphate oligonucleotides, and the testing of activity in cell culture of antisense DNA.   Faculty at Randolph-Macon Women's College, Hollins University and The University of the Virgin Islands will also have access to this equipment.  \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry and drug development.",
