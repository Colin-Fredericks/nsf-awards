 "awd_abstract_narration": "SAMSI is a national institute that will deeply impact the future\r\nof the statistical and mathematical sciences and, through them,\r\nscience in general, by catalyzing creation of the theory and\r\nmethodology necessary to confront the central data- and\r\nmodel-driven scientific challenges of our time. SAMSI will focus\r\non new syntheses of the statistical sciences, applied mathematics\r\nand disciplinary science.  To illustrate the vision, consider an\r\nactivity central to modern science and technology, and with which\r\nSAMSI will be heavily engaged: numerical modeling of complex\r\nphysical processes.  Developing numerical models and evaluating\r\ntheir fidelity to reality requires merging knowledge from\r\nmultiple disciplines. Applied mathematics builds on disciplinary\r\nunderstanding to construct a fine-detail numerical representation\r\nof the deterministic aspects of a process; probability provides\r\nconcepts and insight to characterize stochastic elements of the\r\nprocess; and statistics provides the mechanisms to relate these\r\nconstructs to observational data on the real-world process. But,\r\ndespite a multiplicity of context-specific advances, there is\r\ncurrently no general framework for combining these disciplines,\r\nmuch less a formal system for simultaneously applying them. The\r\nSAMSI efforts in this direction will focus on filling this gap,\r\nby bringing together statisticians, mathematicians and modelers\r\nfrom across the country (and beyond) to establish frameworks for\r\nmodel development and validation, at a high level that spans\r\nmultiple application contexts.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this synthesis of the statistical sciences, applied\r\nmathematical sciences and disciplinary sciences, SAMSI engages\r\nestablished researchers - from academia, industry, national\r\nlaboratories and government - as well as young researchers\r\n(postdoctoral fellows and graduate students) at the formative\r\nstages of their careers. Each research program lasts from 6\r\nmonths to one year, and involves a host of activities ranging\r\nfrom research by intensive interdisciplinary working groups to\r\nbroad, energizing workshops. Outreach to undergraduate students,\r\nhigh-school teachers and faculty from teaching institutions\r\nextends SAMSI's impact on the essential development of the\r\nnational human resource base for science. To enable activities of\r\nthe breadth and depth necessary for the success of SAMSI, the\r\ninstitute is a partnership between the National Science\r\nFoundation and the consortium of Duke University, North Carolina\r\nState University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\r\nand the National Institute of Statistical Sciences.  These\r\npartners provide a uniquely strong base for SAMSI's national\r\nscope. Scientific input to SAMSI comes, in part, from a National\r\nAdvisory Council composed of eminent statistical and mathematical\r\nscientists. Most important, SAMSI will engage the entire\r\nnationwide statistical and mathematical sciences communities, by\r\nmeans of widely publicized opportunities to bring problems to\r\nSAMSI, or direct SAMSI's attention to them.\r\n",
