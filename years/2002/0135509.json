 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to prepare a number of metalloporphyrin material building blocks and then assemble them into photonic materials.  A number of metalloporphyrins will be or have been prepared and the thermodynamics, kinetics, and cooperative interactions involved in the self assembly of these materials will be studied.  These self assembled materials will then be assembled into supramolecualr photonics with multiple functions and these photonic systems will be processed onto surfaces and into polymers. The assemblies thus formed will be characterized by a number of physical methods, some in the laboratory of the PI and some in collaboration with other investigators.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Charles M. Drain of the Department of Chemistry at CUNY Hunter College.  Dr. Drain will explore the synthesis of photonic materials.  Photonic materials are assemblies of molecules which can absorb and emit photons in small defined spaces.  These light absorbing materials (chromophores) are typically assembled onto surfaces (photogated transistors for example or materials on surfaces with controllable luminesence properties) or into polymers or wires.  Students trained as a result of working on this project will gain experience in materials research as well as supramolecular organic chemistry, hence they will have skills needed by both the specialty chemicals and the computer/materials industries.\r\n",
