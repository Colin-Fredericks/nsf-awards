 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award under the Information Technology Research initiative explores and strengthens connections between computer science and the physics of complex systems, addressing the important examples of membranes and disordered materials from condensed matter physics. The proposed research brings these disciplines closer together by recognizing that not only are novel algorithmic tools crucial for modeling complex physical systems, but that there are fundamental links between the physical properties of the system and the computational complexity of the simulation. This project will also train students and researchers in this area at the interface between condensed matter theory and information technology and provide simulation software components for the research community. \r\n\r\nMany of the challenges in sciences such as physics and biology are problems in understanding the behavior of a very large number of strongly interacting degrees of freedom, where the macroscopic behavior is determined by the competition between local ordering and disordering effects, including temperature, heterogeneities, and geometry. Examples abound in the both the classical and quantum world, including vortex lines in superconductors, strongly correlated electrons in disordered solids, and fluctuating membranes, as seen in cells and artificial colloidal structures. Describing the phases and transitions in these systems relies upon being able to build up the large-scale behavior from microscopic models. This is quite challenging for conventional simulations. The intent here is to draw on ideas from computer science to develop new algorithms and to identify universal features using extensive simulations. In turn these features will be used to develop new simulation methods and analytical understanding.
