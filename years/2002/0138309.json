 "awd_abstract_narration": "A project team of engineer educators, engineer practitioners, and philosophers with international reputations in engineering ethics creates a video dramatizing a fictional but realistic case study in engineering ethics. This is a sequel Gilbane Gold; a highly successful, award-winning video. This video will help meet the contemporary need for effective instruction in engineering ethics, prompted by recent accreditation requirements for engineering curricula to include aspects of engineering ethics, and by increases in requirements for awareness of professional ethics in the licensing of professional engineers by states' licensing agencies. The video will reach hundreds of thousands of engineering students, practicing engineers, and others who work with engineers. It emphasizes the positive responsibilities of engineers and the resulting benefit to the public, rather than whistle-blowing, which was one aspect of Gilbane Gold. \r\nBecause of the globalization of the economy, the new video is cast in an international context. The video is done in three versions to enhance its exposure and pedagogical effectiveness: a 20-25 minute \"basic\" story version along the lines of Gilbane Gold, a \"segmented' version that can be viewed in parts, and an \"interactive\" version on DVD that allows the viewer to observe the consequences of different ethical decisions. The film will improve the ability of students and practicing engineers to: \r\nEvaluate alternatives according to basic ethical values and through simple tests \r\nIdentify and distinguish ethical issues, technical issues, and economic issues \r\nIdentify affected parties (stakeholders) and their rights and responsibilities \r\nIdentify social and political constraints on possible solutions \r\nDetermine whether additional information is needed to make a good decision \r\nFormulate alternative courses of action \r\nTest the alternatives and imagine possible consequences of those alternatives. \r\nAlso, the video will help the viewers become more aware that: \r\nEthical considerations are an integral part of making engineering decisions \r\nA code of ethics will provide guidance in the decision-making process \r\nThe obligations of a code of ethics do not stop at the United States border \r\nThe obligations of engineers go beyond fulfilling a contract with a client or customer. \r\nThe effectiveness of the video in achieving these goals is assessed through questionnaires and a \r\nstandard test of moral reasoning. As part of the dissemination plan and in order to assure its wide use in the educational environment, a free copy will be sent to every engineering dean in the United States who oversees ABET-accredited engineering programs. Free examination copies will also be sent to major engineering and applied ethics societies in the United States. This wide distribution will encourage use of the video in conveying the importance of ethics in  undergraduate curricula, graduate curricula, and continuing education programs. \r\n",
