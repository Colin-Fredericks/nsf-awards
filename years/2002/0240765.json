Yamamuro, U. of Delaware \r\n\"First Japan-U.S. Workshop on Testing, Modeling and Simulation in Geomechanics\"\r\n\r\nThis action provides support for the First Japan-U.S. Workshop on Testing, Modeling and Simulation in Geomechanics, to be held in Boston, Massachusetts, June 27-29, 2003.  This meeting was initiated by the signing of an Agreement of Cooperation between the American Society of Civil Engineers Geo-Institute (G-I) and the Japanese Geotechnical Society (JGS).  The purpose of this agreement is to \"promote and enlarge the exchange of technical, scientific and professional knowledge to better serve the interests and welfare of their members, the engineering profession in general, and the public in both countries.\"\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Workshop is to bring together the top researchers from Japan and the United States in various fields of geomechanics, specifically experimentation, constitutive modeling, and numerical simulations.  Researchers from Japan and the U.S. will be invited to present current relevant research activities on a variety of topics for the expressed purpose of sharing knowledge so as to foster and build cooperative efforts between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe topics that will be presented are of broad current interest, and are considered to be the state-of-the-art.  They include: inherent and stress system-induced anisotropic properties; highly non-linear stress-strain behavior; elastic stress-strain behavior at small strains; post-peak stress-strain behavior; mechanics of shear banding; effects of strain rate, aging, and viscous effects on stress-strain behavior; effects of particle size and gradation on stress-strain behavior; stress-strain behavior and residual strains obtained from cyclic loading; mechanics of soil liquefaction; and soil dynamics and the determination of soil behavior using geophysical methods.  The types of geomaterials will be limited to unbound and cemented soils.\r\n\r\nInformation about the Workshop and its activities will be disseminated via the World Wide Web.  Papers and abstracts will be posted on this website for general access, but, especially by non-participants.  E-mail discussions before and after the Workshop will be implemented to obtain feedback and to create new ideas for future workshops.  The proceedings of the workshop will be made available electronically.\r\n",
