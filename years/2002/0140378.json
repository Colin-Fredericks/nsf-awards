 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his coworkers study elliptic curves, special values\r\nof L-functions, and related topics.  Some of the most interesting open\r\nquestions and conjectures in arithmetic algebraic geometry relate\r\narithmetic invariants with special values of L-functions.  Iwasawa theory\r\nand Euler systems have proved to be among the most successful tools for\r\nattacking these problems, by serving as a bridge between the algebraic\r\nworld and the analytic world.  The investigator continues to pursue this\r\napproach, by extracting additional information from Euler systems and\r\ntheir \"derivative\" Kolyvagin systems.  In another direction, the\r\ninvestigator and his colleagues study ranks of elliptic curves,\r\nespecially the asymptotic distribution of ranks in families of quadratic\r\ntwists.\r\n\r\nElliptic curves play a central role in many parts of mathematics\r\nincluding its most applied areas.  For example, elliptic curves are used\r\nin algorithms to encrypt data for transmission, and for efficient digital\r\nsignatures.  In its most basic form, an elliptic curve is a special kind\r\nof polynomial equation in two variables.  Historically number theorists\r\nare interested in finding solutions of these equations in which the\r\nvariables take values which are either whole numbers, or fractions.  The\r\nrank of an elliptic curve is a basic invariant which measures the size of\r\nthe set of solutions.  The investigator and his coworkers study ranks of\r\nelliptic curves and their interrelations with other mathematical objects\r\nand concepts.  These questions are related to the cryptographic\r\napplications of elliptic curves, which come about by considering\r\nsolutions in which the variables take values in finite fields.",
