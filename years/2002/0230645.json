An additional need that has been well documented is the\r\nneed for K-12 teachers who can provide students with interesting, real-world applications of\r\nmath, science, and engineering. The need for faculty who apply the latest advances in pedagogy,\r\nassessment, and learning theory to engineering curricula has also been clearly demonstrated.\r\nThis planning grant proposal addresses these needs through a comprehensive plan to be\r\nimplemented initially through a partnership between the College of Engineering and the School\r\nof Education at North Carolina A&T State University.\r\n\r\nIn this planning grant, education and engineering faculty will work together to develop a\r\ncomprehensive plan that will enhance the role of education pedagogy in the engineering college\r\nand establish a presence of engineering material in the education curriculum. Current A&T\r\nlinkages with K-12 schools in North Carolina will be exploited to help them develop effective\r\nstrategies for meeting newly established State guidelines in science. Interactive workshops with\r\nnationally recognized experts on integration of engineering into K-12 and cognitive science will\r\nbe used to develop effective partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe long-term vision is a novel coordinated effort between the A&T College of Engineering,\r\nA&T School of Education, A&T College of Arts and Sciences, K-12 partner schools, industrial\r\npartners, and nationally known centers of cognitive science to train A&T faculty in pedagogy\r\nthat is effective with HBCU students, train School of Education students in math, science, and\r\nengineering applications that can be used to excite K-12 students about careers in these areas,\r\ntrain engineering students in education topics that will allow them to excite K-12 students about\r\nengineering, and provide resources to current K-12 math and science teachers. The ultimate goal\r\nis to couple A&T experience with teaching minority scientists and engineers with state-of-the-\r\nart pedagogy to increase the quality and quantity of African-American engineering graduates.\r\nThe successes of this institutional model would then be shared with other HBCU as well as\r\nother universities with engineering programs.\r\n",
