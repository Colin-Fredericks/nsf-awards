 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perhaps our greatest remaining scientific challenge is to understand the biological basis for human consciousness.  To approach this we need knowledge of neurophysiology, systems neurobiology and the emergent properties of the human brain as a whole.  However, an important component is also to understand neural development, which involves the progressive unfolding of genetic information during development, through systems of signals between cells.  This investigator uses a simple system which is technologically accessible to model the development of the nervous system: the developing eye of the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster.  The fly eye is comprised of about 800 similar facets.  Four days after fertilization, patterning begins when an indentation (called the morphogenetic furrow) begins at the back of the future eye and sweeps forward to the front edge.  A new column of precisely spaced cell clusters is laid down every two hours, and these found the eye facets.\r\n\r\n\tThis investigator, and others, have found that the furrow involves the interaction of a small number of molecular signals.  One positive and one negative signaling protein act together, ultimately to control the activity of a crucial, central enzyme in the target cells: MAPK.  A simplified view is that the instruction of a cell to be a neuron is the activation of MAPK.  Recently, this investigator has used NSF funding to show that the two signals can integrate at the point of MAPK activity, through negative feedback via an enzyme that inactivates MAPK.  Four questions will now be pursued: 1) How does the negative signal control the inactivating enzyme?  2) Does this enzyme act on MAPK alone?  3) Does this enzyme act in other developmental processes?  4) Does the new enzyme interact with other pathways?\r\n\r\n\tBeyond his scientific work, this investigator makes service contributions to his field (organizing conferences, peer review for NSF, NIH and twenty different journals) and trains PhD students and post-doctoral fellows.  His wider contributions include mentoring high-school and undergraduate students and a high-school teacher.  He also participates in a program to co-train post-doctoral researchers in teaching as well as research, in partnership with local historically black colleges.\r\n",
