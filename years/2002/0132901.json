Computational\r\ngeometry has deep roots in reality: Geometric problems arise naturally in any computa-\r\ntional field that simulates or interacts with the physical world|computer graphics, robotics,\r\ngeographic information systems, computer aided-design, and molecular modeling, to name\r\na few|as well as in more abstract domains such as combinatorial geometry and algebraic\r\ntopology. Aside from their obvious practical significance, geometric algorithms and data\r\nstructures enjoy a rich and satisfying mathematical structure, and their development often\r\nrequires tools from mathematical disciplines such as combinatorics, topology, and algebraic\r\ngeometry, as well as traditional computational tools.\r\nThe proposal outlines a challenging career development plan focusing on research in a\r\nbroad cross-section of computational geometry, building on and significantly broadening the\r\nPI's successful work in the field over the last several years. Specific problem areas in which\r\nthe PI plans to work include approximation algorithms, kinetic data structures, spatial and\r\ntemporal databases, external memory computation, geometric optimization, and clustering.\r\nThis classification is at best a rough guide, as many interesting geometric problems fall\r\ninto more than one category. Furthermore, the PI plans to continue combining theory and\r\nempirical experimentation in his work, putting an emphasize on algorithms that perform\r\nwell in practice.",
