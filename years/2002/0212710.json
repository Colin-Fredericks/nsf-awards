 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a fact of life for organisms living in\r\nthe photic zone of aquatic environments. It is increasingly evident that zooplankton,\r\nphytoplankton, protozoa, and bacterioplankton exhibit taxon-specific differences in\r\nphysiological and behavioral responses to UVR exposure. Although competition for\r\nnutrients is recognized as a critical factor in structuring plankton community\r\ncomposition, nothing is known of the significance of UVR under natural conditions for the\r\nintensity of competition among plankton for limiting mineral nutrients. The proposed\r\nresearch will help to fill this gap in knowledge. We will examine the main and\r\ninteraction effects of the nutrient and UVR regime on the growth rates and competition for\r\nphosphorus of naturally occurring phytoplankton and bacterioplankton. A model is\r\npresented and predictions made regarding the severity of nutrient competition under a\r\nrange in conditions of nutrient (organic carbon and phosphorus) ratios and UVR exposure.\r\nWe predict that, because of differential effects on bacterioplankton and phytoplankton\r\ngrowth rates, UVR will modify the severity of competition between phytoplankton and\r\nbacterioplankton for phosphorus. Using samples collected from a low-altitude reservoir in\r\nnorth Mississippi, experiments will be conducted to test the model predictions. This\r\nstudy fulfills two needs. It will be the first to evaluate by experimentation using\r\nnatural sunlight the interaction effects of UVR and the nutrient regime on growth rates of\r\nautotrophic and heterotrophic plankton under various degrees of nutrient limitation.\r\nSecond, it will provide knowledge of the influence of the UVR regime on the relative\r\nimportance of autotrophic and bacterial heterotrophic production in a southern U.S.\r\naquatic ecosystem, where, compared to higher latitudes, there has been very little\r\nresearch on the ecological significance of UVR. Students will be involved in all aspects\r\nof the project, from planning to sampling to data analysis to presentation. With\r\nanticipated continued increases of UVR in temperate regions due to ozone depletion, the\r\neffect of UVR on plankton trophic-level relationships constitutes a timely and important\r\nproblem.",
