 "awd_abstract_narration": "0220773 Lentz\r\n\r\nIn order to better understand the annual and interannual variability of the density structure over the Middle Atlantic Bight shelf and the linkages between forcing mechanisms and responses, others have studied temperature and salinity variability, but not the important density parameter.  The PIs propose to utilize, in their research, National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis products and historical data from a variety of sources, including light ships, buoys, moorings, and cruises.  Initially, the PIs propose to characterize the temperature structure over the shelf and determine its response to heat flux from the atmosphere as opposed to wind stirring and advection.  Then they will address the effects of salinity and the variability of the full density field.  NCEP reanalysis products are available for the period 1948 to present.  Oceanographic observations extend to 1900, but most observations post-date 1950.  Air-sea fluxes may need to be recalculated to account for significant variability at scales unresolved by the NCEP grid.  Bin sizes for analysis will be determined by data coverage.  Temporal resolution of interannual comparisons will also be determined by data coverage.\r\n",
