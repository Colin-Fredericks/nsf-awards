Peter May\r\n\r\nThis project deals with research in a wide range of topics \r\nin topology, geometry, and related areas of mathematics. \r\nMay studies a variety of categorical and homotopical \r\nstructures in stable homotopy theory, equivariant \r\nalgebraic topology, and other fields. Although his current \r\nwork is primarily foundational, his students and collaborators, \r\namong others, make extensive  calculational applications of it. \r\nHe and his collaborators have recently unified the foundations \r\nof stable homotopy theory by proving that all of the \r\nnew highly structured categories of spectra are Quillen \r\nequivalent model categories, via structure-preserving functors. \r\nThe analogous, and deeper, unification of the foundations of equivariant stable homotopy has also been carried out. Within \r\nalgebraic topology, May has been working on various other \r\nprojects in equivariant and non-equivariant homotopy theory. \r\nHe has also been working on various topics that have roots in \r\nalgebraic topology but are of a more general nature. \r\nIn particular, he has recently obtained a new definition \r\nof enriched weak $n$-categories and has spearheaded a very \r\nlarge scale unification project in higher category theory. \r\nWeinberger studies various areas of geometric topology and \r\ndifferential geometry. He has a longstanding interest \r\nin transformation groups, especially surgery theory on \r\nmanifolds with group actions. In particular, he studies \r\nproblems concerned with removing the ``gap hypothesis'' \r\nthat obstructs the direct generalization of the \r\nnonequivariant theory. Weinberger also has a longstanding \r\ninterest in the Novikov, Borel, and Baum-Connes conjectures, \r\nand he has made recent progress on them. In a new direction, \r\nWeinberger has been engaged in a large scale collaboration\r\nwith Nabutovsky that concerns applications of logic to \r\nRiemannian variational problems and to the large scale \r\ngeometry of moduli spaces. Some of his recent results defy \r\neasy characterization. For one example, he has applied an \r\nold theorem of Browder about finite H-spaces to obtain a \r\ntheorem about the \"social choice problem\". For another, \r\nin recent work with Farb he has shown that \"hidden symmetries\"\r\non a locally symmetric manifold force it to be arithmetic.\r\n\r\nBesides May, the algebraic topology group at Chicago \r\nincludes four nontenured faculty and eight graduate \r\nstudents. The geometry group includes Weinberger and \r\nfour other tenured faculty, six nontenured faculty, and \r\nfifteen graduate students. There is considerable interaction\r\nbetween these groups, and between them and other groups \r\nat Chicago, such as the geometric Langlands group and \r\nthe algebraic geometry group. The research funded by this \r\ngrant is part of a web of research projects in progress at \r\nthe University of Chicago.\r\n",
