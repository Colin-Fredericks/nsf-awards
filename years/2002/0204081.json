 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Number: DMS-0204081\t\r\nPI: Kuperbeg\r\n\r\n\t\tABSTRACT\r\n\r\nResearch will be conducted on continuous dynamical systems on\r\nmanifolds of dimension three and higher, with emphasis on \r\ncompact invariant subsets on which the flow is minimal. \r\nContinuing the work related to the real analytic solution to \r\nthe Seifert conjecture on aperiodic flows acting on the \r\nthree-dimensional sphere, the PI plans to classify the minimal \r\nsets in such flows with respect to their homological and shape \r\ntheory properties. Minimal sets shape-equivalent (in the sense\r\nof Borsuk) to a polyhedron often appear in flows as\r\nattractors, and are of special interest. Minimal sets of \r\nnon-polyhedral shape are usually approximated by circular \r\norbits or by other movable sets with the so called UV-property.\r\nThey have very complicated dynamics around them, which can be \r\ninvestigated through the structure of the family of the \r\napproximating invariant sets. Circular orbits are extremely\r\nimportant in celestial mechanics  as they appear as paths of \r\nmovement. Smaller particles, dust,  can align along a braided \r\norbit, and in the continuous  case,  in a mathematical model, \r\nthis \"orbit\" could be an invariant set,  aperiodic but \r\n\"circle-like\", or \"graph-like\" such as the \r\nwell-known Denjoy continua. A volume-preserving dynamical system, \r\nassociated with incompressible fluids, imposes restrictions on \r\nthe flow outside the special invariant collection and is an \r\nimportant area of study as well.  \r\n\r\nThe theory of dynamical systems was developed in an effort to\r\nprovide a mathematically rigorous description of real physical \r\nphenomena. It is therefore closely connected to many domains \r\nof science: mechanics, various areas of physics, biology, and \r\neconomics.  Dynamical systems connect several branches of \r\nmathematics such as analysis, topology, geometry, algebra, \r\nand combinatorics.\r\n\r\n",
