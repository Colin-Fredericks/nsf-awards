 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two closely related peptide hormones called arginine vasotocin \r\n(AVT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) that have been implicated in several \r\nvertebrates as modulators of social behavior, including courtship, pair-bonding, \r\nparenting, and aggression.  The mechanisms by which these molecules act in \r\nthe brain to produce these behavioral effects remain unclear, but their \r\nwidespread distribution suggests they are evolutionarily conserved.  It has been \r\nsuggested that AVT/AVP may affect the processing of species-typical social \r\nreleasing stimuli such as courtship calls, visual displays, or chemical signals.  It is \r\nimportant to take a comparative approach to this question, to determine whether \r\nor not AVT/AVP can selectively influence behavioral and brain responses to the \r\nspecific releasing stimuli that have evolved in different groups of animals for \r\nsocial communication.  This project is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to \r\ntest this hypothesis directly using goldfish, because the exact chemical stimuli \r\nimportant for courtship and aggressive communication signals in this species are \r\nuniquely identified and can be delivered quantitatively.  The project is exploratory \r\nbecause it is not yet clear whether AVT will influence social behavior in goldfish, \r\nalthough AVT effects on social behavior have been shown in other teleost fish, \r\nand some AVT/AVP effects are known for diverse other vertebrates.  \r\nExperiments manipulating AVT levels in the brain will measure effects on \r\ncourtship and aggressive behaviors in male goldfish during responses to \r\nparticular chemosensory social stimuli that release those behaviors.\r\n    This is a high-impact/high-risk project because the outcome is not clear, but \r\nthe potential impact of success is wide-ranging.  If successful, the results will \r\nlead to further studies on social regulatory functions of hormones, will have an \r\nimpact beyond behavioral neuroendocrinology to brain neurochemistry, animal \r\nbehavior, and evolutionary neuroscience, and could have an impact on \r\napplications in aquaculture and fisheries industries.\r\n\r\n",
