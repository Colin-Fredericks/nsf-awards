 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to the Spin Electronics for the 21st \r\nCentury Initiative, Program Solicitation NSF 02-036. The proposal focuses \r\non the development of a room temperature ferromagnetic compound \r\nsemiconductor material, Ga1-xMnxN, for spintronic devices based on the spin \r\nproperty of electrons.  Many advances have been made in developing the \r\nmaterials and devices for III-V compound semiconductor materials doped with \r\nmanganese (Mn), with Ga1-xMnxAs showing the most promise.  However, the low \r\nCurie temperatures (Tc) for these materials require potential devices to be \r\noperated at temperatures below 77K.  There is a need to produce a new class \r\nof materials that can operate at, or near, room temperature to facilitate \r\nthe ease of measurement and the eventual commercialization of this \r\ntechnology.  The III-Nitrides will be excellent for this application \r\nbecause recent theoretical predictions show that Ga1-xMnxN could have Tc \r\nhigher than room temperature.  The Ga1-xMnxN can also be integrated into \r\nexisting base of microelectronics or optoelectronics existing for GaN-based \r\ndevices.\r\nIn this work it is proposed to produce Ga1-xMnxN by Metalorganic Chemical \r\nVapor Deposition, the growth technique of choice for GaN based \r\ndevices.  There are no published reports of the growth of Ga1-xMnxN by this \r\ngrowth technique at this time.  A systematic study of the growth of \r\nGa1-xMnxN will be completed.  Detailed characterization of the physical \r\nproperties Ga1-xMnxN will be investigated using x-ray analysis, Hall \r\nmeasurements, time resolved photoluminescence, and other techniques.  A \r\nnovel Ga1-xMnxN/Ga1-xAlxN/Ga1-xInxN LED structure will be grown so that \r\nspin injection can easily be investigated at room temperature.\r\nThe broader impact of this work is clear:  Spintronic devices that can be \r\noperated at or near room temperature will be required if quantum computing \r\nbased on compound semiconductor materials is going to have a commercial \r\nviability in the future.\r\n",
