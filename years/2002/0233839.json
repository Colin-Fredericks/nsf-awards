 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will be conducted to integrate the 9 NMI individual research projects awarded last year and 9 more awarded this year.  Since the intent of the overall NMI program is to leverage these individual research projects and incorporate their work as much as possible, it is essential to conduct a workshop with all the NMI PI\ts to plan the activities for the second and third year of NMI.  This workshop will be conducted on July 16-17, 2002 in Chicago.  The purpose of the meeting is to bring together the PIS so that the various individual research project activities can be coordinated and integrated with the larger NMI program plans.  The proposal includes a draft agenda and list of participants.\r\n\r\nThe workshop has been designed so that NMI PIs have a chance to introduce and discuss their research and activities to other researchers and the NMI Team.  The NMI PIs will also have the opportunity to modify their activities to better support the larger NMI program and leverage other work being done by middleware developers.  One of the first tasks will be to define how the individual research efforts can be incorporated into the NMI work plan, and secondly, to outline a specific work plan and process to integrate the software and middleware over the next two years.\r\n",
