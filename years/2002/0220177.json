 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Chemical Society METAL OXIDES Symposium on will be held in Boston, MA, August 18-22, 2002. The goal of the conference is to facilitate multidisciplinary interactions and information exchange within a broad spectrum of researchers, to include CAREER  grantees, post doctoral scholars and graduate students working in priority areas of the broad field of metal oxide solid-state chemistry. The NSF funds will be used to support the costs for invited speakers, junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to participate in the symposium. \r\n\r\nThe Solid State Chemistry community continues to have direct impact on technological areas that are crucial to advancing society through the design, synthesis and application new materials. Examples include metal oxide materials for oxide ferroelectrics,  thin films for electronics and electrooptic devices, oxide superconductors and oxides with negative thermal expansion coefficients. Since these technical areas are of very high priority to industry,  students educated and trained in these multidisciplinary areas involving solid-state chemistry compete very well in the job market and go on  to contribute in many significant ways to the global economy.\r\n",
