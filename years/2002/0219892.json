 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are in the midst of a new wireless revolution, brought on by\r\nthe adoption of wireless networks for consumer, military,\r\nscientific and other applications. Wireless networks are a\r\ncollection of terminals, or nodes, that are capable of\r\ntransmitting and receiving information to nearby nodes using\r\nwireless access methods. The harsh characteristics of the wireless channel provide the\r\nfundamental challenge for communication between wireless network\r\nnodes. The key to reliable communication over wireless links is the\r\nexploitation of diversity, i.e., observation of the same\r\ninformation through different fading conditions. While it is\r\npossible to harness diversity by transmitting the same signal at\r\ndifferent times or frequencies, the implied redundancy is costly\r\nfrom a bandwidth perspective. It has been shown, however, that\r\nintroducing additional antennas at the source and/or\r\ndestination enables diversity gain without compromise in\r\nbandwidth efficiency. Wireless network nodes may or may not be equipped with multiple\r\nantennas. How then, can they ensure reliable and\r\nefficient communication over the fading wireless channel? In this research, we investigate\r\nnovel strategies by which nodes\r\ntransmit and receive cooperatively, allowing\r\nexploitation of spatial diversity gain that would otherwise be\r\nunavailable.\r\n\r\nThe lack of structure in ``ad-hoc'' wireless networks is\r\nadvantageous from the viewpoint of flexibility,\r\nre-configurability, and low management cost. The same lack of\r\nstructure, however, makes the implementation of cooperative\r\nstrategies challenging. It may be difficult, for example, to know\r\nwhich of the helper nodes have correctly received the message. In\r\nfact, it may be difficult to know which, if any, of the nodes can\r\nbe enlisted as helpers. In this research, we solve these problems\r\nthrough the combination of distributed cooperative coding\r\nstrategies, clever protocols, and sophisticated signal\r\nprocessing techniques. The PIs are leveraging their respective expertise in\r\nspace-time coding and blind signal processing to devise\r\npractical strategies for cooperative communication in\r\nwireless networks. In addition, this research investigates the\r\nfundamental limits on the capacity of cooperative wireless\r\nnetworks through a study of information-theoretic bounds.\r\n",
