 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analyzing Evidence is focusing on the Forensic Science Program at Prince George's Community College (PGCC). Individuals who are competently trained in forensic science are essential to the quality of justice administered in the court system as these personnel are responsible for evidence gathering, analysis, and court testimony relevant to that evidence. The overriding purpose of this award is to increase the number of forensic science personnel with the scientific knowledge and instrumentation skills needed for the rapidly changing forensic field. To achieve this purpose, the College is 1) creating inquiry-based mock crime scene modules that incorporate laboratory experiments using state-of-the-art instrumentation to infuse into a variety of forensic science courses, 2) creating an inquiry-based Analytical Forensic Chemistry Identification and Instrumentation course, 3) improving the instrumentation at the College by the purchase of equipment and accessories to perform the laboratory experiments in the crime scene modules and new forensic chemistry course, 4) training faculty to use the instrumentation, and 5) improving career opportunities for students by enhancing internships with local crime laboratories and creating pathways from high school through the baccalaureate degree in the field of forensic science. Modules with laboratory experiments and other teaching materials are being published online and linked from the Payton Scientific website for dissemination to other forensic programs. The Forensic Science Program was created at PGCC in response to a documented need in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area for well-trained forensic technicians. The award has the support and cooperation of state and local police departments and crime laboratories, the University of Baltimore to which the PGCC A.S. program articulates, and the local school system.\r\n",
