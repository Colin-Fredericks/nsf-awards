Therefore, any successful galaxy evolution model must, at the very least, reproduce the properties of galaxies in poor groups over a wide range of redshifts.   This work will use the properties of gravitational lenses as a tool to explore galaxy evolution.  It will constitute the first comprehensive spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the fields of the 56 known strong lenses, starting with those for which even the current, poorly-constrained lensing models require a contribution from additional mass at or near the lens redshift. Careful modeling suggests that the masses, concentrations, and redshifts of any groups identified in this manner are representative of the larger population of dynamically evolved groups. This survey will greatly improve lensing analyses not only by characterizing galaxies in the lens environment and along the line-of-sight, but also by constraining the velocity dispersion and centroid of individual groups and the velocity dispersion profiles of composite groups at different redshifts. As a result, new limits will be placed on the Hubble constant and dark energy that are complementary to those derived from more classical methods. \r\n***\r\n",
