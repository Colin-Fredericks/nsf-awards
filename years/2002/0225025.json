 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores a unique materials science approach to understand and improve transport processes in organic semiconductor materials suitable for the fabrication of electronic or opto-electronic devices. The specific objective of the project is to explore and demonstrate an approach to substantially increase carrier mobility under ambient conditions in organic semiconductors by designing, fabricating, and analyzing structures with built-in strain. The proposed research is motivated by recent experimental results with pentacene. Despite recent progress in organic semiconductor materials research, electronic devices fabricated with pentacene have a primary impediment-a relatively low charge carrier mobility which appears to be limited by intermolecular charge carrier transfer. With decreasing intermolecular distances, as happens under compressive stress, and demonstrated utilizing high pressure, charge carrier mobility in organic materials increases. The research proposed here addresses this critical limitation of low mobility by exploring built-in strain enhancement under ambient pressure conditions. The approach is to deposit pentacene on bent, thinned-down Si/SiO2 substrate wafers. When the substrate is allowed to relax, compressive strain is built into the active pentacene layer. Field effect transistors will then be fabricated on this material and tested for enhanced mobility. The proposed research will explore the feasibility of such an approach through a coordinated effort involving experiment and modeling. \r\n%%%  \r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materi-als science having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is high risk/high payoff potential with strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and educa-tion.\r\n***     \r\n",
