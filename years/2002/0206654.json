 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary:\r\nCurrent global climate change models predict increases in the frequency and intensity of\r\ndrought in the southwestern U.S. In pinyon-juniper woodlands, we hypothesize that drought stress\r\nleads to increased competition between pinyon and juniper, greater dependence of pinyon on\r\nfacilitative nurse plants, and changes in pinyon ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal abundance and\r\ncommunity structure. Because EM fungi can alleviate environmental stress by increasing water and\r\nnutrient uptake by the host plant, it is important to understand factors that affect these mutualists.\r\nThe goal of this project is to examine how competition and facilitation affect pinyon survival and\r\ngrowth, as well as their EM fungi. We will use a combination of field experiments, greenhouse\r\nstudies, and molecular tools (RFLP analysis and DNA sequencing) to identify EM fungal species.\r\nThe results of our study will 1) quantify EM fungal diversity and distribution in pinyon-juniper\r\nwoodlands, 2) provide data on plant responses and EM fungal community shifts in response to\r\ncompetition and facilitation, and 3) contribute to the current library of EM fungal sequences.\r\nBecause many of these fungi can only be identified with molecular tools, the latter objective is\r\nnecessary to allow comparisons of ecological data on fungi from different locations to begin to\r\nunderstand the factors that affect their abundance and distribution.",
