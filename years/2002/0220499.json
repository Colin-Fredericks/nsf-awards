 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the PAthways to Careers in MAthematics and Computer Science (PACMACS) Bridge program at Saint Joseph's University (SJU) is to train and educate academically talented but financially disadvantaged minority students for careers in mathematics and computer science by providing them with an excellent, comprehensive, undergraduate education. \r\n\r\nSJU presently runs PACMACS, an innovative outreach program, for bright minority high school students from Philadelphia public and charter high schools. High school seniors (and exceptional juniors) in PACMACS attend up to 4 college classes at SJU (in mathematics and computer science), and receive college and career guidance.\r\n\r\nThe PACMACS Bridge program is designed to help those students make the transition to full-time college once they are enrolled at SJU after graduating from high school. The PACMACS Bridge program is a comprehensive package of financial, academic and social support offer to undergraduates in the mathematics and computer science department at SJU. Students obtain financial support through the University Financial Aid Office and NSF CSEMS funding. Six to 10 eligible students will be identified and awarded CSEMS scholarships.\r\n\r\nAcademic support programs include faculty mentors, upper level undergraduate student mentors, supervised study sessions, tutoring services and individualized attention in the small classes available at SJU. Social support programs include seminars on college life, peer support groups and panel discussions on cultural diversity to assist the students in the cultural adjustment to an urban, predominantly Caucasian Catholic University.",
