 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes the development of a high sensitivity, large dynamic range force transducer capable of measuring transient force changes in tension and compression. The operating principal is based on the change in optical properties at the molecular level with loading of a pre-stressed polymer material. The polymer acts as a linkage to which a force would be applied either in compression or tension. The molecular deformation of the polymer linkage will be analyzed using miniature optical components arranged as a phase-modulated polarimeter capable of birefringence measurements on the order of 10^-9.  Calibration of the measured birefringence with known loads will provide the necessary calibration parameters. \r\n\r\nPotential commercial instrument would be capable of directional force, pressure and acceleration measurements and would be extremely accurate for measuring low-level forces. Since the force transducer is based on optical techniques, it would be immune to electronic noise, and would allow measurement of rapidly changing loads.\r\n\r\n",
