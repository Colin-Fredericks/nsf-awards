 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of biogels in the function of biological\r\nsystems is increasingly recognized, yet little theoretical work\r\nhas been done to understand their behavior.  Mathematics is\r\nwell-suited to sorting out the interplay among the many forces\r\n(mechanical, electrochemical, and biochemical) that determine\r\nbiogel structure and function.  The investigators use\r\nmathematical tools to explore four closely related problems of\r\nbiogel growth and dynamics, with an emphasis on pattern-forming\r\nmechanisms and the relationship between pattern and function.\r\nThe four problems are biofilm and blood clot formation and\r\nfunction, gastric protection of the stomach, and the behavior of\r\nbiogels in contact with a moving fluid.  Models are developed to\r\nunderstand how physical properties such as the viscoelastic\r\nconstitutive properties and the gel morphology are determined and\r\ncontrolled, and how these properties affect the biological\r\nfunction of the biogel.  The investigators use analytical and\r\ncomputational tools to examine gel growth and dynamics on\r\ndifferent scales using various models (continuum, discrete,\r\nisotropic, anisotropic), while attempting to incorporate what is\r\nknown experimentally, and to expand the experimental database\r\nabout specific biogel systems.\r\n     Biogels are composites of water, filamentous protein\r\nnetworks, and other chemicals, and are increasingly recognized as\r\nhaving profound influence on the function of many biological\r\nsystems.  Important biological settings in which these biogels\r\nplay a major role include blood clot formation,\r\ndifficult-to-treat bacterial infections, and the proper\r\nprotective functioning of the stomach lining.  Improved\r\nunderstanding of how biogels are formed and how their properties\r\nare regulated is critical to understanding these important\r\nprocesses and how they can be manipulated to improve human\r\nhealth.  Because the formation and regulation of biogels is\r\ngoverned by physical and chemical properties and because these\r\nproperties can be expressed mathematically, mathematical tools\r\ncan be brought to bear on these problems.  Through mathematical\r\nanalysis and computational simulations of biogels, a wealth of\r\ndetailed data can be obtained that complements the data\r\nobtainable from traditional laboratory experiments.  Hence the\r\ncombination of mathematical and experimental investigators\r\nbrought together in this project is expected to lead to important\r\nnew insights about biogel behavior.  The project includes\r\nmathematicians, a bioengineer, and a biologist, and provides\r\ninterdisciplinary research and training opportunities for\r\nstudents and postdocs.",
