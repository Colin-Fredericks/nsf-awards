 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many chemicals released into the environment disrupt the function of endogenous hormones by acting at their receptors and/or by influencing hormone production by interfering with synthesizing enzymes. These endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have been found to have effects in several taxa during development and in adulthood, exert their greatest effects in tissues that are responsive to endogenous steroid hormones. These responsive tissues (e.g., reproductive tract, brain) often differ by gender (i.e., are sexually dimorphic) and are involved in display of gender-specific behavior (e.g., reproductive or courtship behavior). The overall objective of the research plan is to determine whether exposure of songbirds to environmental endocrine disruptors affects the normal function of sexually dimorphic (and hormone-sensitive) structures. In particular, effects on the brain regions that control singing (song control system), the song behavior itself, and female responses to song will be assessed after non-stressful exposure to EDCs. \r\n\r\nAbnormal function of the song control system could have implications for the ability of males to attract mates and of females to choose them, which ultimately could affect songbird populations. Songbirds have long been effective models for investigating hormonal effects on brain and behavior; as such, they also could serve as powerful models for investigating EDC effects on brain and behavior.\r\n",
