Michael\r\nClemson University\r\n\r\nIn this exploratory project the PI and Co-PI will focus on creating a series of branched amphiphilic block copolymers and investigating how their assembly, organization and structure are different than brushes formed form linear polymers.\r\n\r\nIn order to maximize the productivity during this one-year exploratory project, the synthesis efforts will focus three types of architectures.  The PI and Co-PI will synthesize comb-block, star-block copolymers and make proof-of-concept syntheses of A2A'B and A3A'B copolymers.  The A2A'B and A3A'B copolymers are novel materials. \r\n\r\nIn terms of characterization, the PI and Co-PI will focus on two key techniques:  They will use the surface forces apparatus (SFA) to investigate the structure of brushes made from the aforementioned materials; they will also investigate the surface morphology and organization using atomic force microscopy (AFM).  The former technique will focus on the layers as they are assembled from a selective solvent, and the latter technique will examine dried layers after the assembly process. The focus here is to explore how the connectivity and size of the new, branched polymers affects the organization and structure of the brush layer.\r\n\r\nThis is an Exploratory/GOALI grant in which the PI and Co-PI will collaborate with Dr. Victor P. Thalacker, Senior Laboratory Manager at 3M Corporate Process Technology Center in St. Paul, Minnesota.\r\n \r\n",
