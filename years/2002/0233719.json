 "awd_abstract_narration": "Costantino\r\n9981374\r\n     Understanding the fluctuations in animal numbers is a\r\ncentral issue in population biology that has far-reaching impact\r\non and implications for problems ranging from food production to\r\nthe conservation of species.  Nonlinear dynamics opens the way to\r\na new phase of population research in which theory and\r\nexperimentation focus on phenomena such as cycles and\r\nquasi-periodicity, chaos and strange attractors, multiple\r\nattractors and complicated basins of attraction, saddle sets and\r\ntheir stable manifolds, and so on.  This interdisciplinary\r\nproject, in which Robert Costantino, Jim Cushing, Brian Dennis,\r\nRobert Desharnais, and Shandelle Henson collaborate, covers a\r\nspectrum of activities essential to testing nonlinear population\r\ntheory: the translation of the biology into the language of\r\nmathematics and back again, the analysis of deterministic and\r\nstochastic models, the development and application of statistical\r\ntechniques for the analysis of data, and the design and\r\nimplementation of biological experiments.  A series of experiments\r\nwith flour beetles of the genus Tribolium provide rigorous\r\nexperimental tests of nonlinear phenomena.  Topics include\r\nnonlinearity in the context of stochasticity, chaos and\r\npopulation control, the impact of periodic environments on animal\r\nabundance, demographic dynamics and natural selection,\r\nnonequilibrium species interactions, and statistical questions\r\nconcerning parameterization and validation of models.\r\n     With a sound understanding of the underlying dynamics of\r\nanimal populations, ecologists can anticipate the consequences of\r\nenvironmental degradation and learn better ways to manage natural\r\npopulations and control populations of pests.  For example, one of\r\nthe experiments suggests that, by taking advantage of the\r\n\"sensitivity to initial conditions\" that is the hallmark of a\r\nchaotic system, managers can dramatically decrease pest\r\npopulation numbers without the use of chemical pesticides by\r\nmaking small perturbations at critical times.  The marriage of\r\necological theory and experiments by the interdisciplinary\r\nresearch team leads to new techniques for the application of\r\nmathematics to ecological problems.  The project is supported by\r\nthe Applied Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, and\r\nStatistics programs in MPS and the Population Biology and Ecology\r\nprograms in BIO.\r\n",
