Higher-dimensional shifts of finite type are symbolic\r\ndynamical systems whose points are arrays of symbols from a finite\r\nalphabet satisfying certain adjacency rules. While there is a\r\nwell-developed theory for one-dimensional shifts of finite type, the\r\ngeneral situation for higher-dimensional shifts has been very\r\nunclear. Recently a number of organizing concepts have started to\r\nemerge and it is hoped that these will lead to a satisfactory theory\r\nfor at least some reasonable collection of higher-dimensional systems. \r\nBirkhoff's theorem is concerned with the effects of averaging a\r\nsequence of measurements of a system taken at equal time\r\nintervals. The result then states that in the case of a\r\nmeasure-preserving transformation, for almost every initial condition,\r\nthe time averages are convergent. Further, the limit is identified if\r\nthe transformation is ergodic. The work will focus on variations to\r\nthis scenario where the measurements are taken at varying\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nThe higher-dimensional shifts of finite type that will be studied are\r\nof relevance in designing efficient data storage schemes. Due to\r\nphysical restrictions on storage media, in many cases certain patterns\r\nof binary digits cannot be reliably written and read back from digital\r\nstorage media. In these cases, it is necessary to encode the data so\r\nas to ensure that the encoded data does not contain any of the\r\nforbidden patterns of binary digits.  This applies to magnetic tapes, but also to conventional hard disks, where data is stored in a number of tracks, all separated from\r\none another. It is likely that in order to continue the growth in the\r\namount of data that can be stored on a single device, it will be\r\ndesirable or maybe even physically necessary to consider\r\ntwo-dimensional storage schemes. Efficient methods for doing this\r\nwill depend on a good understanding of the properties of\r\nhigher-dimensional shifts of finite type. The almost everywhere \r\nconvergence results lie at the intersection of a\r\nnumber of diverse areas of mathematics: probability, dynamical\r\nsystems, ergodic theory, number theory and harmonic analysis. It is\r\nhoped that progress made in this area will have knock-on effects in \r\nthe other disciplines.\r\n",
