 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glycogen and starch serve as major energy storage compounds for nearly all-\r\nliving organisms and are an important energy component obtained from\r\nplants. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGlc Ppase) catalyzes the\r\nconversion of glucose-1-phosphate and ATP to ADP-glucose and\r\npyrophosphate and is a key regulated step in both bacterial glycogen and\r\nplant starch biosynthesis. ADPGlc Ppase regulation is mediated by the\r\nbinding of a number of activators and inhibitors, many of which are key\r\nmetabolic intermediates. This research utilizes the ADPGlc Ppase enzyme\r\nfrom the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Ag.t.) that is regulated by fructose-\r\n6-phosphate and pyruvate. This project outlines x-ray crystal structural\r\nstudies on Ag.t. ADPGlc Ppase to examine substrate binding, allosteric\r\neffector binding, and the mechanism of activation. Several roadblocks\r\nassociated with x-ray crystallography have already been overcome including\r\ncrystallization and heavy atom derivitization for phase determination. Once\r\nthe three-dimensional structure of one member of the ADPGlc Ppase protein\r\nfamily is determined homology modeling can be used to construct reasonable\r\nstructures of the other proteins in the family. As a major control point for the\r\nproduction of renewable and biodegradable carbon sources, ADPGlc Ppase\r\nis an attractive enzyme target for protein engineering. Understanding the\r\nregulation of the ADPGlc Ppase enzyme family is necessary for the\r\nbioengineering of the enzyme and could lead to rational protein engineering\r\nof the enzyme to increase starch production\r\n",
