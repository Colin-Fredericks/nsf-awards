 "awd_abstract_narration": "City University of New York  LSAMP Phase III\r\n\r\nThe New York City Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineeringand Mathematics (LSAMP) was initiated within CUNY in 1992 to promote interest in science engineering and mathematics among underrepresented minority students. The main goal of\r\nLSAMP Phase III is to build a permanent CUNY infrastructure through augmentation of our\r\ndemonstrated productive capacity and output built in Phase I and Phase II, with a\r\ncoordinated program of summer and academic year research, teaching and service\r\nopportunities for participants. The NYC LSAMP Phase III will continue to work for systemic\r\nchanges that will ensure the increased production of minority SMET graduates, and address\r\nthe areas delineated by the NSF as national priorities. The areas are: 1) The Educational\r\nContinuum; 2) Institutionalization and Best Practices; 3) Undergraduate/Graduate\r\nTransition; and 4) Mentoring.\r\n\r\nSince 1992, minority undergraduate enrollment in science, mathematics, engineering and\r\nrelated technology courses has increased from 4,216 to 6,976 in 2001, an increase of 65 %.\r\nIn that same period, those earning baccalaureate degrees increased from 404 to 755 per\r\nyear, an increase of 86 %. The total number of minority graduates since 1992 exceeds\r\n5,800. LSAMP programs now serve more than 14,000 CUNY undergraduates annually. Clearly,\r\nthe LSAMP has had a positive impact in the University during a period when CUNYs overall\r\ntotal enrollment, both minority and non-minority, decreased from about 230,000 to 200,000,\r\nand is testimony to the success of the LSAMP initiative.\r\nNYC LSAMP Phase III will augment and make permanent the following systemic changes and\r\nreforms:\r\n- A hierarchical organizational structure to foster delivery on its goal.\r\n- Restructuring of gatekeeper calculus, chemistry and physics courses.\r\n- Science and mathematics learning centers on CUNY campuses.\r\n- Seamless academic transitions at all critical points, from high school to graduate\r\nschool.\r\n- The universitys investment in undergraduate research as integral to the\r\nundergraduate experience.\r\n- An undergraduate student and faculty research program across college boundaries.\r\n- Sustainable agency and industry collaborations.\r\n- Joint planning and resource commitment with other systemic initiatives.\r\n- Tracking individual student persistence to the baccalaureate and graduate level.\r\n- Producing a steady stream of high school students entering SMET curricula.\r\n\r\nAlliance activities in Phase I and Phase II centered on curriculum reform (Phase I), and\r\nintegrating research into undergraduate education (Phase II). The strategy of increasing\r\nthe enrollment in the SMET disciplines via curriculum reform in Phase I, led in a systemic\r\nmanner to positioning students to take advantage of the increased research opportunities\r\nin Phase II. The Alliance Course Restructuring for gatekeeper calculus, chemistry, and\r\nphysics courses included an emphasis on collaborative learning, a non-competitive approach\r\nto problem solving, and workshops conducted by specially trained peer tutors and faculty\r\nmembers. For the period 1997-2001, CUNY enrolled over 46,000 students in NYC LSAMP\r\ninstitutionalized or restructured courses. It was in this context that over 5,800 students\r\ngraduated with SMET degrees at the BS level, with increased numbers of students participating in LSAMP activities as research assistants. Phase III activities will involve a systemic approach to increase the number of participants that continue on to graduate school or teacher education at the graduate level.\r\n",
