 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is aimed at developing and optimizing a new process for making titanium aluminide sheet materials that find application where structures are required to be fabricated using strong and light-weight materials that maintain their strengths at elevated temperatures. Intermetallic compounds such as TiAl are difficult process using conventional methods and require specialized/expensive techniques such as hot isostatic pressing with controlled inert atmospheres to minimize contamination. The goal of the project is to develop and optimize cold roll bonding process followed by reaction annealing of TiAl sheet samples. The study includes experimental investigation to determine the influence of surface preparation, rolling pressure, and annealing temperature on the microstructures and mechanical properties of the processed sheet. In addition to the tensile and hardness measurements, fracture toughness will be determined. Along with the experimental study, simulation of the cold roll bonding process will made using numerical modeling so that the effects of deformation on the rate of reaction during annealing can be assessed. The fundamental metallurgical investigations will lead to a better understanding of the factors controlling the microstructures and properties of materials processed by cold roll bonding. The funding of this research provides an opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students including underrepresented minorities to develop understanding and experience in the metallurgical and process areas of research.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research develops a new processing method to fabricate intermetallic metals and alloys that find application in several technologies with high temperature applications including aerospace. It is anticipated that this process on a commercial scale can produce relatively large intermetallic sheets measuring several meters. These materials preserve their mechanical strength at relatively high temperatures. The proposed processing eliminates expensive hot isostatic pressing in inert atmospheres making it relatively more cost-effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
