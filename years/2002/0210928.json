 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to describe an exploratory research project that focuses on technology and learning. The research addresses critical issues related to improving how technology is utilized in underserved populations to improve its pedagogical impact. This is accomplished by studying how self-directed learning communities (SDLC) are formed and sustained, as well as the motivational issues related to technology access and implementation. These issues are vital to maximizing the potential benefits of current efforts to bridge the digital divide, which have primarily focused on providing access to hardware, software, and content.  Self-directed learning communities are defined as a vibrant, participative, and culturally aware human environment that promotes learning opportunities to enhance the potential of its members. This definition has been adapted from \"learning cities\" definition of the European Lifelong Learning Initiative (ELLI).  Through this exploratory research, I will be able to begin to establish an empirically based repository for research and practices related to the digital divide and the impact of self-directed learning communities. For this SGER research project, I will focus on a single learning community for a year in and effort to develop concrete data and techniques that may be used in future research. To this end, I will seek to answer the following research questions:\r\n1. What are the essential factors of a self-directed learning community?\r\n2. How should we assess student progress?\r\n3. What kinds of implementation models are valid and replicable?\r\nBecause self-directed learning communities emerge spontaneously instead of being created formally, I will observe and document their formation. Investigating the formation to these self-directed learning communities is crucial and requires the analysis of the roles, relationships, attitudes, and needs of the stakeholders involved. In an effort to establish a benchmark, extant data, which may include standardized test scores, will be used. As the self-directed learning community emerges, the factors effecting its formation will be identified and analyzed.  Once the factors are investigated, the researcher will work with the stakeholders of the learning community to create assessment measures. The assessment measures will be used to validate the factors and test for their generalizeability to multiple self-directed learning communities.  Because self-directed learning communities are innovative in the way that I am applying them, some of the research effort will be spent identifying and analyzing what these constructs are and how they impact learning.\r\n",
