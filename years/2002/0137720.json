The capture will take place in a realistic office scenario, as required for a transcription application. The research is geared towards developing a patient-centered care system that would allow patients and family members to access office visit information. The system will have a speech interface to a computer for disease management feedback between patient and physician. The main goal consists of developing a meeting transcription system that incorporates microphone array algorithms for sound capture from multiple talkers and speaker identification. The microphone array builds on the past research by the PI for incorporating room response information into array algorithms. The array output will be adaptively determined such that it is robust in environmentally changing rooms and for talker positions not initially calibrated. The transcription research, concerned with parsing dialog to distinguish multiple talkers at a meeting (which may not be stored at the database), will be tested using the physician's office dialog. Speaker identification will involve incorporating phonetic knowledge along with keyword content information and talker location to improve the tagging of multiple talkers. Performance will be measured with respect to speech recognition results.\r\n\r\n",
