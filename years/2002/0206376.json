 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasites draw nutrition directly from their hosts and adversely affect them in\r\nmany ways. Major workers in the ant species Pheidole dentata are susceptible to\r\nparasitism by the phorid fly Apocephalus feeneri. Parasitism by the phorid is fatal for\r\nthe parasitized ant and previous work has shown that foraging majors will try to\r\nconceal themselves when phorids are detected. In spite of this attempt to avoid\r\nparasitism, a small percentage of majors are successfully parasitized by phorids. The\r\ngoal of this study is to examine changes of those parasitized majors by comparing\r\ntheir behavior to that of non-parasitized nestmates. Equal numbers of parasitized and\r\nnon-parasitized majors will be marked in a colony and their behaviors observed using\r\nstandard ethogram techniques for the duration of the phorid's larval development.\r\nFrequencies and sequences of behaviors in parasitized and non-parasitized majors\r\nwill be compared. To highlight the effect of parasitism on the specialized defensive\r\nresponse of P. dentata, parasitized majors will be exposed to fire ants in the genus\r\nSolenopsis. The outcome of these experiments will affect future ecological studies\r\nwith P. dentata and potentially bio-control efforts in other ant-phorid systems.",
