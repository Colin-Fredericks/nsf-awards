 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator intends to apply model-theoretic\r\nmethods to the representation theory of Lie algebras and\r\nnoncommutative rings, as well as to the K-theory of a pointed\r\nabelian category.  One of the main goals of the project will be\r\nto generalize classical results about finite-dimensional\r\nrepresentations to the pseudo-finite dimensional case - a\r\nrepresentation of an algebra is called pseudo-finite dimensional\r\nif it satisfies the axioms for a finite-dimensional\r\nrepresentation.  A theory of pseudo-finite dimensional\r\nrepresentations has already been introduced for the Lie algebra\r\nsl (2,k), and the project is devoted to generalizing this theory\r\nfor the case of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra L ,\r\nas well as the corresponding Lie group G(L).  The project will\r\nalso focus on the complex of positive-primitive formulae in the\r\nlanguage of modules over an associative ring R. The aim will be\r\nto establish a relationship between the homology of this complex\r\nand the K-theory of the free abelian category over R.\r\n\r\nSymmetry plays an essential role in the study of physical objects\r\nthat occur in Nature.  The symmetries of an object - think, for\r\nexample, of a crystal or a butterfly - are the rigid motions that\r\nbring the object back onto itself. These symmetries form an\r\nalgebraic structure, called a group. In this way, we can\r\nassociate to every physical object its group of symmetries.  In\r\nrepresentation theory, the mathematician considers a group G as\r\nan abstract object and attempts to classify all the objects of\r\nwhich G is the symmetry group.  Traditionally, research has\r\nfocused on the case where the objects are finite-dimensional\r\nvector spaces. In this project, the methods of mathematical logic\r\nare applied to include the infinite-dimensional cases called\r\npseudo-finite dimensional.  These are the situations that the\r\nlimited power of expression of the mathematical language in use\r\ncannot distinguish from the finite-dimensional. It has been shown\r\nthat many such objects exist, but to unlock the secrets behind\r\nany particular one of them remains a baffling question.\r\n",
