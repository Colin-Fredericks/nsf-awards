 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: DMS 0203164.\r\n\r\nWe have been studying problems in Riemannian geometry that \r\nconcern with interplays between curvature and topology, and \r\nthe major part of our work are about the controlled topology of \r\ncollapsed manifolds with sectional curvature bounded in absolute value and \r\napplications to the global Riemannian geometry. \r\nFor the past three years, we have made substantial progresses\r\nin this field pioneered by Cheeger-Gromov-Fukaya: we \r\nestablished the isomorphism finiteness result for the higher homotopy groups, \r\nthe diffeomorphism finiteness result for a certain class of manifolds, and the \r\nconvergence of collapsing sequences in this class. We have \r\nmade a progress on investigating some rigidity phenomena \r\nfor the class of closed manifolds of non-positive sectional \r\nwhich are not locally symmetric spaces. We have made a progress \r\nin the homeomorphism classification of positively curved manifolds \r\nwhose isometry group contains a torus of large rank, and extend \r\nthis result to the larger class of manifolds which only admit \r\nisometric discrete abelian group actions. We will continue our \r\nprograms in these fields in the near future that \r\nrepresents a continuation of the work proposed three years \r\nago for NSF Grant DMS 9971360. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important developments in Riemannian geometry \r\nin the last two decades is our understanding of the Riemannian \r\nmanifolds which appear to be smaller than \r\ntheir actual dimension (i.e collapsed). For instance, the surface \r\nof a very thin donuts looks like a circle while whose curvature and diameter are \r\nbounded. Our progress is amplified by the amazing fact that \r\namong the manifolds whose curvature and diameter are bounded, all \r\nbut finitely many appear to be smaller than their actual dimension. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
