 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current models for the catalytic mechanisms of protein enzymes are far more advanced\r\nthan those for RNA enzymes (ribozymes). This project will contribute to understanding how the\r\ncatalytic mechanisms of ribozymes compare with those of protein enzymes. The specific\r\nobjectives of this project are to: (1) synthesize atranyl-nucleosides 1-3; (2) characterize and\r\ndetermine the aqueous stability of atranyl-nucleosides; (3) use atranyl-nucleosides as transition\r\nstate analogues (TSAs) to study the hammerhead and lead-dependent (leadzyme) ribozymes via\r\ncollaborations; and (4) train undergraduate students in synthetic organic techniques in\r\npreparation for graduate study and/or careers in science. TSAs are useful for enzyme studies;\r\nhowever, suitable TSAs for phosphoryl transfer reactions are lacking. Compounds 1-3 have an\r\natrane moiety incorporated into a ribonucleoside. The atrane contains a trigonal bipyramidal\r\nsilicon, germanium, tin, or titanium atom; and thus, 1-3 mimic the oxyphosphorane transition\r\nstate of the ribozyme-catalyzed reaction. Compound 2 is a protected phosphoramidite that\r\ncontains uridine and deoxyadenosine connected through the atrane moiety. Several syntheses of\r\n2 starting from 5'-O-DMT-2'-amino-2'-deoxyuridine will be evaluated. Prof. William G. Scott of\r\nUC-Santa Cruz will incorporate 2 into the hammerhead substrate by solid-phase synthesis to\r\nobtain a hammerhead ribozyme-TSA crystal structure. Prof. Arthur Pardi of the University of\r\nColorado-Boulder will similarly determine the structure in solution using NMR spectroscopy.\r\nAnalogous approaches will be taken for leadzyme structural studies following the synthesis of\r\nphosphoramidite 3. These experiments will elucidate the magnitude of conformational\r\nrearrangement required to reach the transition state in each of these small RNA catalysts. This\r\nresearch will also help identify the role of specific RNA functional groups and metal cations in\r\ncatalysis. This knowledge is paramount for understanding the pre-biotic \"RNA world\" and how\r\nour current life forms evolved from it.",
