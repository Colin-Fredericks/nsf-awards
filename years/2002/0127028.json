 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The Physics Department at Towson University is restructuring the calculus\r\nbased general physics courses in order to a) provide a more effective learning\r\nenvironment for the students, b) provide appropriate course content in the service\r\ncourses, c) increase the retention of declared physics majors in the general physics\r\ncourses, and d) teach the general physics courses in such a manner so as to recruit\r\nadditional students. This is accomplished by offering two sequences of calculus\r\nbased general physics; one acts as a service course to other science disciplines, and\r\nthe other is an Honors Physics course. The Honors Physics sequence not only\r\nhas students from the Honors College enrolled, but all declared physics majors take\r\nthe course. Placing the physics majors in a class\r\nwith highly motivated, interested students such as from the honors college helps to\r\nincrease the retention rate of the majors. Additionally, this low enrollment course is\r\ntaught using adaptation of Workshop Physics techniques. This highly interactive, active learning\r\nenvironment has been demonstrated to be a more effective method of teaching physics\r\nthan traditional lectures, and students are expected to retain their enthusiasm\r\nand interest in physics. Additionally, by separating the physics majors from the present\r\ncalculus based general physics courses, the department can modify the content of the courses\r\nto suit the needs of the other science disciplines. Equipment is being used\r\nin both the Workshop Physics honors course and the regular general physic course. In the\r\nregular general physics course, the equipment allows the faculty to\r\nexplore implementation of a calculus-based version of Realtime physics.",
