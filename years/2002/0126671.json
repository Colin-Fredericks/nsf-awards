 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56)\r\nThe latest reports from the National Research Council, the Carnegie Foundation, and the National Science Foundation recommend that faculty use the problem-based learning (PBL) method of instruction in undergraduate education. The literature claims that the PBL method has inherent potential to foster problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills and, therefore, it is superior to the traditional (subject-based) learning method. As a consequence, the goal of this project is to develop a prototype PBL set of course materials that is based on the PBL model, and use this model to formally test this claim. To accomplish this goal, the PI uses established characteristics of a \"good\" PBL problem along with proven processes for writing PBL problems to do the following: (a) develop PBL materials for a engineering measurements course in the mechanical engineering curriculum at North Dakota State University (NDSU); (b) evaluat, using both formative and summative assessment methods, the enhancement in student learning and skills development from this PBL course ; (c) evaluate the project outcomes using the results from five independent institutions; and (d) disseminate the tested PBL educational materials through a web site, CD-ROM, and several workshops to the academic community. \r\n\r\nIn summary, we are developing PBL course materials using proven pedagogical concepts with the assistance of partners from leading instrumentation industry. An independent five-member committee is evaluating all aspects of the project. These committee members are experienced engineering educators from five different institutions. They are providing assessment data during the development phase of the project and testing the PBL modules at their own sites. The dissemination plan includes workshops scheduled for K-12 school teachers, regional colleges and university faculties, and tribal college faculties. \r\n\r\nKey words: Problem-based learning, inquiry-based, PBL problems.",
