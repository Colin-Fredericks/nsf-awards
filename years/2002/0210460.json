 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NER.  Nanoparticle-supported (10-100 nm in diameter) catalysts that can be removed by the application of a magnetic force will be developed.  The magnetic capability of the nanoparticles provides a way for simple and efficient recovery of the catalysts by using a magnetic field. The required features of magnetic nanoparticles for use as effective catalyst supports include chemical inertness, weak inter-particle interaction, large magnetic permeability, high saturation magnetization, and flexibility for surface chemical modification. Spinel ferrite nanoparticles offer an excellent platform for design and control of magnetic properties to satisfy these criteria. These materials derive their unique magnetic properties from their nanoscopic size, which prevents the formation of multiple domains within a nanoparticle, allowing each nanoparticle to behave like a single paramagnetic atom with a giant magnetic moment. Furthermore, it is possible to control the magnetic properties of these materials by adjusting their composition at the atomic level. Therefore, it is possible to tailor the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles for specific applications. Each nanoparticle will have a thin silica coat, which is functionalizable and chemically inert. If successful, this research would lay the groundwork for an entirely new class of highly active polymerization catalysts that could allow for the recovery and reuse of these organometallic catalysts.",
