 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many different sources from which relevant information can be\r\nobtained for an intelligence task at hand, such as an analysis of operations\r\nplanning by Al Qaeda.  The accuracy of this information is frequently\r\nimperfect.   \r\n\r\nInformation obtained from each source is frequently also different in\r\nstructure and scope. XML has emerged today as the standard for information exchange.  Its\r\nflexibility permits the representation of information from heterogeneous\r\nsources in a single unified framework.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to manage uncertain (probabilistic) data,\r\nrepresented in XML.  While there have been previous efforts to develop\r\nprobabilistic relational systems, the need for representing and querying\r\nuncertain information is much greater for loosely structured data not \r\nreadily amenable to a relational representation.\r\n\r\nXML data poses several modeling challenges that are the focus of this\r\nproject: due to the data having (an inclusion hierarchy) structure,\r\nprobabilities cannot be assigned independently; due to XML elements occurring\r\nat multiple granularities, probabilities may be assigned at multiple levels;\r\ndue to the possibility of missing and repeated sub-elements, one may not be\r\nable to obtain complete distributions. \r\n\r\n",
