This instrumentation will provide fundamental and necessary support for cross-disciplinary research and teaching programs in the natural sciences and anthropology. Productive research programs in sedimentary petrology, paleoceanography, structural geology, geochemistry, biochemistry, and archaeometry will directly benefit from access to this instrument. Student research and formal courses at all levels in the Departments of Geological Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Anthropology/Archaeology will utilize this instrument for imaging and compositional analysis. Intramural benefits will be extended to the broader educational community via well-established, NSF- and NIH-funded programmatic ties and joint research with faculty and students of local community colleges and high schools. CSULB is designated a Non-Ph.D. Granting and Minority-Serving Institution. CSULB and the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, where the ESEM facility will be located, has a strong record of commitment to community outreach efforts.  The new ESEM facility, with secondary and backscattered electron imaging, cathodoluminescent detection, and quantitative elemental microanalysis and mapping capabilities, will meet current research and pedagogic needs, and provide the flexibility to support new developments in research, teaching, and outreach missions over the next two decades. The Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) will image and analyze highly porous, delicate, moist, dirty, vacuum-sensitive or rare geologic, biologic or archaeological specimens without carbon or gold coating that would interfere with subsequent trace elemental or isotopic analysis. Joint use of the ESEM facility will foster synergistic, cross-discipline collaboration among the geology, biology, archeology and environmental science disciplines at CSULB.\r\n***\r\n",
