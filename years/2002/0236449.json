 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase I activities associated with construction of a deep-ice neutrino detector known as IceCube (for cubic kilometer detector) will be carried out.  This is an MREFC project.  The activities include: 1) construction of a movable enhanced hot water drill system (EHWDS), including the needed drill camp facilities, suitable for drilling 45 cm diameter, 2.5 km deep holes in the ice at the South Pole at a rate of at least 16 holes per drilling season in a fuel efficient manner requiring 8000 gallons of fuel per hole; 2) construction of specialized detectors for in-ice applications; 3) data acquisition and data handling hardware and software development; 4) system engineering for construction and deployment of the drill system and IceCube detector array; 5) testing of all systems; and 6) establishment of associated management system.  This work will be carried out taking into consideration the need to operate this equipment reliably and safely in the extreme Antarctic environment.  This Phase I work will set the stage for implementation of the full IceCube construction project for deployment of 80 strings of 64 optical modules (consisting of photomultiplier tubes and associated electronics) each that are to be inserted into the holes drilled using the EHWDS, frozen into the ice, and operated in conjunction with a corresponding data acquisition, data handling, and data analysis system.  The IceCube detector array will open a new window on the universe and its origin and evolution by its ability to detect high energy neutrinos from cosmological events.  Education will be a part of the overall IceCube project, but is not a part of this Phase I award.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIceCube Project Outcomes Report\n\nSeptember 5, 2012\n\nIceCube is a particle detector embedded in a cubic kilometer of deep, very transparent South Pole ice designed to detect high-energy neutrinos.  Neutrinos are tiny, nearly massless particles that travel at near light speed and are remarkably abundant in the Universe.  The science capability of this observatory ranges from detecting neutrinos from dark matter annihilations that are predicted to take place in the sun, to observing bursts of neutrinos from stellar explosions in our galaxy, to searching for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos produced by violent astrophysical events at the centers of active galaxies across the Universe.  IceCube greatly exceeds the capabilities of previous detectors and those currently under construction, and thus its potential for transformational discovery is significant.\n\nThe IceCube Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) project was proposed in 1999 and received final approvals for construction in April 2004.  Detector installation began in January 2005 and was completed in December 2010.  A specially designed hot water drill was used to bore holes in the ice near the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.  Each hole measured 60 cm in diameter and was 2.5 km deep.  Deployment specialists carefully connected light sensors known as digital optical modules to the lower third of the cables as they were lowered into the drill holes.  There are 86 cables in all, each with 60 modules attached to it.  IceCube has a surface component called IceTop that serves as a cosmic air shower array.  The construction effort required almost ten million pounds of cargo and over 30,000 person-days of work at the South Pole.  The total MREFC project cost of IceCube was $279.5 million.  The National Science Foundation provided $242.1 million and funding partners in Belgium, Germany, and Sweden provided support valued at $37.4 million. \n\n \n\nThe IceCube Collaboration includes about 250 scientists and professionals from 39 institutions in 11 countries.  The technical, cost, and schedule performance of the IceCube MREFC project was consistent with the original project baseline and the NSF funding plan approved in 2004&mdash;i.e., the project was completed on budget and on schedule.  The IceCube detector exceeds its original performance goals.\n\nThe intellectual merit of IceCube is especially compelling because of its potential for transformative discovery in multiple scientific disciplines, including astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear and particle physics, cosmology, and glaciology.  IceCube opens a new window for extragalactic astronomy and astrophysics, exploring a range of neutrino energies not available from any terrestrial source built by nuclear and particle physicists.  Its potential includes discovering the nature of dark matter, black holes, supernovae explosions, and gamma-ray bursts, as well as revealing new celestial objects and phenomena.  Historically, new ways of viewing the Universe have resulted in unanticipated discoveries, opening new fields of study and reshaping our understanding of the Universe.\n\nWith its transformational science undertaken in a captivatingly hostile environment, IceCube represents a truly unusual opportunity not only for scientific discovery but also for education and public outreach regardless of one\u00c6s level of scientific understanding.  The mystique of the South Pole environment and the transformative nature of the science are an alluring mix with respect to the broader impacts of the project.  IceCube scientists and staff eagerly share the excitement of their experiences at the South Pole station and of the discovery potential of this project with a broad audience beyond the research community.  Building on this excitement, IceCube maximizes the educational value and public knowledge of IceCube science through talks to service groups, school visits, summer enrichment programs for Upward Bound students, and appearances in ..."
