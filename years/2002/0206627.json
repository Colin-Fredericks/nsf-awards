The conference will focus on new \r\nand innovative developments in nonlinear dynamics and its \r\napplications, such as nonlinear observer design, cooperative \r\ncontrol, flow control, and bifurcation control. The symposium will \r\ninclude several invited 50-minute talks and a series of shorter \r\ncontributed presentations of approximately 20 minutes each. The \r\norganizers plan to publish proceedings of this meeting in book \r\nform. \r\n\r\nThe rapid pace of change in technology constantly presents new \r\nchallenges and new opportunities to researchers in systems and \r\ncontrol, especially those in nonlinear control. Advances in \r\nmaterials science, active actuators and sensors, and fluid \r\nmechanics challenge the community to develop controllers for \r\ncomplex nonlinear systems of both finite and infinite dimensions. \r\nModels of nonlinear systems that are especially interesting to \r\nresearchers in nonlinear control include fluid dynamics, flow \r\ncontrol, smart materials, and chemical reactions. The nonlinearity \r\nof these complex systems leads not just to instability but also to \r\nperiodic solutions, bifurcations, and chaos. Recent research shows \r\npromise for controlling such systems to achieve stability or \r\ninstability.  Cooperative control is another research topic of \r\nnonlinear systems that is attracting increasing attention. Recent \r\nadvances in computing and communications make it possible to \r\noperate a large number of autonomous or semi-autonomous agents \r\nsimultaneously in a cooperative manner. Such systems involve \r\nnonlinearities that are far more complicated than those exhibited \r\nby a single system. Problems involving cooperative control of \r\nmultiple nonlinear systems are found to have numerous \r\napplications. Several of the presentations and discussions during \r\nthe symposium will address issues related to cooperative control \r\nand its applications (e.g., control of a satellite constellation, \r\nmultiple munitions). The symposium will provide an opportunity \r\nfor both well-established and young researchers to exchange ideas \r\non new developments and directions for future research. These \r\nnew challenges require a review of major developments in \r\nnonlinear control theory from the past and to discuss new research \r\ntrends to meet the ever-increasing needs of industrial applications. \r\nMajor topics to be addressed in the symposium include new \r\ndevelopments in the theory of nonlinear systems and control such \r\nas nonlinear observers, bifurcations and control, and turbulence \r\nand control.\r\n",
