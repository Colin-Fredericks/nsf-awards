 "awd_abstract_narration": "Florida Georgia Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Program (Phase III)\r\n\r\nFlorida A&M University in coalition with Albany State University, Bethune-Cookman\r\nCollege, Florida State University, University of Florida, University of South Florida,\r\nUniversity of Central Florida, Florida International University, Florida Memorial\r\nCollege, University of Miami, Tallahassee Community College, Miami Dade Community\r\nCollege, and Florida Community College at Jacksonville has developed a program to\r\nsignificantly increase the quality and quantity of minority students successfully\r\ncompleting science, engineering and mathematics (SEM) B.S. degree programs as well as\r\nsignificantly increase the number interested in and qualified for matriculation into Ph.D.\r\nSEM programs of study. Subsumed under these goals are the following measurable\r\nobjectives: at least quadruple the annual entry of minority B.S. graduates into Ph.D.\r\nSEM programs from 100 (year 2001 baseline) to 500 over the next five years; (2)\r\nincrease by ten percent (baseline 2320), the number of B.S. degrees awarded to\r\nunderrepresented minorities in SEM disciplines by the year 2007; and (3) institutionalize\r\nthe FGLSAMP Project at each participating institution by 2006 to insure FGLSAMP\r\npermanence after NSF funding ceases.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance proposes to utilize a holistic model to transition SEM scholars from high\r\nschool to college, positively influence their retention in college, enhance their B.S.\r\ngraduation rates from college and entry into Ph.D. degree SEM programs of study.\r\nProject activities to realize these goals and objectives include developing structured\r\nrelationships with school systems and community colleges to attract students to SEM\r\nmajors; establishing workshops to increase student academic performance; implementing\r\na pre-matriculation institute; and implementing a pre-junior graduate school orientation\r\nprogram and pre-senior research apprenticeship to stimulate student competence and\r\ninterest in graduate school.\r\n\r\nThe FGLSAMP Project will form partnerships with AGEP Projects, Ph.D. degree\r\ngranting institutions, other appropriate NSF agencies, national/governmental laboratories,\r\nprivate foundations and private industry to assist in providing funds for research stipends\r\nand graduate fellowships for student participants.\r\n\r\nThe Florida Legislature provides $640,000 in matching funds annually to support\r\nparticipating Florida institutions in the FGLSAMP Project. The results from this project\r\nwill be shared with other institutions and scientists via reports, newsletters, FGLSAMP\r\nEXPOs and published articles.\r\n",
