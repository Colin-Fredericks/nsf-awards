 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI and his collaborators, will continue their investigation of the\r\nrelations between periods and special values of\r\nL-functions. Specifically, those pertaining to the conjecture of Bloch\r\nand Beilinson for elliptic curves and those implied by Borel's theorem\r\nfor a number field and their connection to the Mahler measure of\r\nLaurent polynomials and the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe PI's research area is in Number Theory, a very old subject with\r\nconnections to every other conceivable area of Mathematics as well as\r\nPhysics. It is remarkable how the type of questions one would like to\r\nanswer in Number Theory, for example, can we write the number 1 as the\r\nsum of the cubes of two rational numbers?, which at the time of Fermat\r\n(1600's) say, most likely had no direct implications to everyday life,\r\nhave evolved into highly relevant issues today. In our current\r\ntechnology age, Number Theory is behind much of the safety of common\r\nactivities like, for example, shopping on the internet. The PI's\r\nspecific research concerns L-functions, certain analytic objects one\r\nassociates to questions like the one above, which are central to\r\nmodern Number Theory and from which one expects to, and often does,\r\nretrieve answers. \r\n",
