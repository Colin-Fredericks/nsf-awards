During this time, the western continental divide of North America has followed the crest of the migrating topographic bulge.  Thus, regional drainage, which in middle Miocene time was to the east from a continental divide in central Idaho, was disrupted to radial north- and south-flowing streams draining away from the topographic bulge.  Following passage of the hot spot and subsidence of the Snake River Plain in its wake, the west-flowing Snake River has progressively captured segments of several streams, causing them to flow west, rather than north, south, or east.  The migrating hotspot model makes testable predictions about Miocene to Recent drainage capture.  \r\nThis project will test the utility of the detrital zircon provenance method to accurately record drainage basin provenance.  PI will use SHRIMP (Sensitive High-Resolution Ion Microprobe) U-Pb geochronologic analyses of 60 grains each, from about 50 samples from modern streams and Neogene terrestrial sediments from the northern Rocky Mountains. He will investigate the size threshold of fluvial systems where mixing begins to mask distinctive zircon signatures. \r\n\t\r\n",
