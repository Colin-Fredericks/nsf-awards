Briefly, spectral functions are mappings of the spectrum \r\nof real or complex valued matrices to the real numbers. Two \r\nexamples are the spectral abscissa (the maximum real part of the \r\nspectrum) and the spectral radius (the maximum modulus of the \r\nspectrum). The spectral abscissa and the spectral radius play an \r\nimportant role in understanding the asymptotic behavior of \r\ncontinuous and discrete dynamical systems, respectively. For this \r\nreason, understanding their variational behavior will greatly impact \r\na number of application areas. In general, spectral functions have a \r\nnumber of features that make them difficult to analyze. Foremost \r\namong these is that they are typically nondifferentiable, indeed \r\nnon-Lipschitzian. These functions can be very poorly behaved \r\nespecially in regions of interest for optimization. Thus, even \r\nthough these functions have a classical history in mathematics, \r\nscience, and engineering, intimate knowledge of their variational \r\nbehavior has proven elusive. For this reason, new tools of analysis \r\nin conjunction with classical techniques are required. In this \r\nresearch we bring together the modern techniques of variational \r\nanalysis and classical methods of Puiseux-Newton series, semi-\r\nalgebraic sets, conformal mappings, and the geometry of \r\npolynomials. These tools have proven to be phenomenally \r\nsuccessful in shedding new light on this very important class of \r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nIn optimization theory and practice one tries to either minimize or \r\nmaximize a performance measure subject to limitations on how the \r\nperformance measure can be adjusted. Optimization is a \r\nfundamentally interdisciplinary area of research having a \r\nsignificant impact on a wide range of academic, industrial, and \r\ngovernment research activities. Research in optimization requires \r\ntheoretical advances, the development of numerical solution \r\nmethods, and a firm grounding in applications. The particular \r\nresearch outlined in this proposal focuses on optimization \r\nproblems that are closely related to the stability properties of \r\nsystems that evolve with time. In particular, it impacts the design \r\nof structures such as buildings and aircraft that are subject to \r\ntemporal deformations from environmental factors such as an \r\nearthquake or a wind-shear. The underlying optimization problem \r\nin this context is to make the structure as stable as possible in a \r\npotentially hostile environment while satisfying certain design \r\nlimitations on such things as weight, size, and cost. The great \r\ndifficulty in this research is that the performance measures under \r\nconsideration, such as stability, do not vary in a smooth manner as \r\nthe underlying parameters vary. Consequently fundamentally new \r\nmethods of analysis are required to understand the variational \r\nbehavior of these performance measures. Indeed, the mathematical \r\ntools necessary for this kind of analysis have only very recently \r\nbeen developed. In this research we intend to make significant \r\ninroads into the analysis of these kinds of problems and to develop \r\na range of numerical methods that can be used to solve them.\r\n",
