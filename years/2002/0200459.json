 "awd_abstract_narration": "A four day workshop in Algebraic Geometry is planned, focusing on the\r\ntraining of graduate students and junior faculty.  The format will\r\nemphasize participants working together in small groups led by\r\nmentors.  The workshop is designed to engage students and junior\r\nfaculty in related areas of algebraic geometry focusing on stacks and\r\nperhaps including computational algebraic geometry.  The working\r\ngroups will organize around problems and topics within these\r\nsubfields.  Senior faculty will give plenary lectures to set the\r\ngeneral direction.  The expected composition of the workshop is\r\napproximately 60 graduate students, 15 junior faculty, and 8 senior\r\nfaculty.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of the relationship between algebraic\r\nproperties of polynomial equations and the geometry of their solution\r\nsets.  During the past century, algebraic geometry has been applied\r\nrepeatedly to a wide range of areas of study in pure algebra and pure\r\ngeometry.  More recently applications have emerged in theoretical\r\nphysics, cryptography, and engineering.  The workshop is designed to\r\ncomplement other forms of training received by junior algebraic\r\ngeometers, providing them the experience of actively doing research\r\nwith their peers and mentors.\r\n\r\n",
