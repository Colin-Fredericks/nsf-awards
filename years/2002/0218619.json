 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neurons communicate with one and other primarily by secreting chemical\r\nneurotransmitters that influence the electrical or biochemical activities of\r\nneighboring cells. These neurotransmitters are stored in small organelles\r\ncalled synaptic vesicles that are localized to presynaptic nerve endings. In\r\norder for neurotransmitter to be secreted, a synaptic vesicle must fuse with the\r\nsurface membrane at the nerve terminal, which allows neurotransmitter to diffuse\r\nto the nearby target neurons. This tightly regulated fusion process is the\r\nfundamental event in interneuronal communication. Recent work has revealed that\r\nvesicle fusion is a low probability event related to the number of synaptic\r\nvesicles docked with the active zone, the site at which fusion occurs. A dynamic\r\nequilibrium exists between vesicles that are fusion-competent and the majority\r\nof vesicles that are held in reserve; this equilibrium is regulated in a\r\nCa2+-dependent manner. The molecular basis for these Ca2+-dependent changes in\r\nthe brain is incompletely understood, in part because billions of microscopic\r\nnerve terminals are distributed throughout the brain, making it difficult of\r\nimpossible to synchronize the activity of the nerve terminals in an intact\r\npreparation. Work proposed by Dr. turner is designed to study the\r\nsignaling pathways that regulate synaptic vesicle dynamics using synaptosomes, a\r\npreparation of isolated nerve terminals that is relatively uniform in\r\ncomposition.  Dr. Turner's laboratory will use synaptosomes to measure biochemical changes in\r\nthe activities of specific signaling pathways that have been implicated in\r\nregulating synaptic vesicle maturation, including Ca2+-regulated kinases and a\r\nmonomeric GTP-binding known as Ral. In parallel, the relevance\r\nof these signaling pathways will be evaluatued by measuring the strength of synaptic transmission in a more intact preparation, the acute brain slice obtained from cerebellum.\r\nThe parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse found in this preparation is a \r\nwell-characterized excitatory synapse that should be representative of\r\nexcitatory synapses found in all parts of the brain. Simultaneous measurements\r\nof neurotransmitter release and the attendant changes in cytoplasmic signaling\r\npathways will advance a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms that underlie Ca2+-dependent changes in synaptic strength important to interneuronal signaling in the brain.\r\n\tThe impact of this work will extend broadly throughout neuroscience because of the fundamental importance of synaptic transmission in information processing by the brain, for features including sensory reception, motor control, attention and decision, and learning and memory.  In addition, this project will help launch the independent career of a young investigator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
