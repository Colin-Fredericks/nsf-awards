 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Biodiversity of the Russian Far East\" is a long-term international effort\r\nto document the diversity of plants and animals that occupy the landmasses\r\nthat surround and enclose the Sea of Okhotsk.  This region is one of the\r\nmost biologically diverse yet poorly known areas within the northern hemisphere.  At the same time, compared to most other high-latitude regions of\r\ncomparable size around the world, its biota is relatively undisturbed.\r\nFor political reasons, but also because of its remoteness and severe\r\nclimate, all but a few Russian biologists have ignored this region.\r\nInformation about the plants and animals of Okhotskia is largely unknown\r\noutside of Russian and what little is available is published in Russian\r\nand thus relatively inaccessible.  Each summer since 1994, three-dozen\r\nscientists, along with their students, from the University of Washington,\r\nthe Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Sapporo\r\nand Hakodate campuses of Hokkaido University, Japan, spend eight weeks\r\nexploring remote islands and continental shorelines, utilizing land-based\r\nfield stations or ocean-going Russian research vessels.  While our primary\r\ncenter of focus has been the island biotas of the Kuril Archipelago, our\r\ndestination over the next two years will be Sakhalin Island.  Our goals\r\nare to record the detailed species-level diversity of life in aquatic and\r\nterrestrial habitats of the Russian Far East as a prologue to\r\ninvestigations of biological patterns and processes, and as a basis for\r\nthe development of conservation strategies for this part of the world.\r\n\r\nBiological materials from lichens to liverworts, from spiders to frogs are\r\nbeing collected, curated, and made available to specialists around the\r\nworld.  Dozens of species new to science are being named, described, and\r\nclassified, and numerous scientific and popular articles are being\r\npublished.  In the area of conservation, our work is providing an\r\nimportant foundation of information that will promote long-term\r\nenvironmental protection of these unique biotas.  Finally, our\r\nbiodiversity studies in the Russian Far East contribute significantly to\r\neducation and to the development of human resources in science at the\r\nundergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels.  Since 1994, the\r\nproject has provided financial support and direct involvement in field and\r\nlaboratory research for dozens of students.  With major responsibility for\r\ncollecting, identification, and curation, as well as data collection,\r\nanalysis, and interpretation, students share authorship on scientific\r\npublications.  International collaborative interaction between students\r\nand scientists of diverse interest and training provides unique\r\nopportunities to address important new questions ranging from comparative\r\nbiology to conservation.\r\n\r\n",
