Holland\r\n\r\nHolland's proposed work centers on applying the Hrushovski-style\r\namalgamation technique to produce novel examples of omega-stable\r\nstructures.  Together with Baldwin, Holland is engaged in an\r\nattempt to use this technique to produce a bad field.  Holland's\r\nwork toward this end has produced algebro-geometric results of\r\nindependent interest on the relationship between transcendence\r\ndegree and multiplicative group rank in characteristic zero\r\nfields.  Holland proposes to exploit this work to complete the\r\nbad field project with Baldwin and to extend the\r\nalgebro-geometric results.  She further proposes to settle\r\nstability questions for certain structures produced by the\r\ntechnique; to analyze the geometries of structures produced by\r\nthe technique and to extend her joint work with Baldwin toward an\r\nabstract model theoretic analysis of the technique and its\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nSince its introduction in the early 90s, Hrushovski's\r\namalgamation technique has been applied with great success to\r\nsettle a variety of old existence conjectures central to\r\nalgebraic model theory.  Holland's ambition, embodied in this\r\nproposal, is threefold: To continue breaking new ground in\r\napplication of the technique, to explore the limitations of the\r\ntechnique by characterizing common properties of its products,\r\nand to make the technique more widely and efficiently applicable\r\nby extracting common difficulties arising in its implementation\r\nand dealing with them uniformly on an abstract level.\r\n\r\n\r\nHolland's proposed work centers on applying the Hrushovski-style\r\namalgamation technique to produce novel examples of omega-stable\r\nstructures.
