 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nLaSalle University is enhancing student learning by incorporating Problem-Based Learning (PBL) into two courses that are integral components of its new Integrated Science, Business and Technology (ISBT) Program. Modeled after a very successful program at James Madison University, ISBT is an interdisciplinary, undergraduate major that draws on LaSalle's solid traditions in science, technology, and business education to develop graduates that are uniquely qualified to take active leadership roles in arriving at scientifically and economically informed solutions to real-world problems. Funds are being used to purchase two UTMs, one Gas Chromatograph with auto sampler, and two, 5-liter B. Braun B Fermentation Systems, and to support faculty and curriculum development for Technology Foundations II-Materials (sophomore-level) and Bioprocessing (junior-level). Materials are designed around student use of a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and students are learning to use the UTM to test ferrous and non-ferrous metals, polymers and elastomers, ceramics, composites, and adhesives and to perform tensile, compression, shear, and flexure testing. This laboratory-intensive approach affords the investigation of a broad range of material types within a one-semester course and permits each student to discover a valid taxonomy of material type and physical behavior. Bioprocessing is designed to integrate concepts introduced in previous courses and imparts an understanding of fermentation system fundamentals, knowledge of several different mammalian and microbial biochemical systems, and an appreciation of the unique requirements of each system. Students manipulate and use real-time data to keep fermentation systems under control. PBL is being delivered through facilitated small student groups and utilize the new equipment.",
