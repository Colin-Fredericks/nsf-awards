 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports Wayne State University with the acquisition of a 200 kV Transmission Electron Microscope for interdisciplinary materials research and education at the institution.  The proposed instrument will have wide accessibility to campus researchers and will be used as a central analytical tool for many NSF-funded nanomaterials research projects in the departments of Chemistry, Engineering, and Physics and the Institute for Manufacturing Research.  Research areas that will be supported by the proposed instrument include discrete nanoparticle synthesis, nanostructure by design, and materials processing and manufacturing.  The instrument will impact areas as diverse as solid state physics, materials science, electrical engineering, chemistry, and medical science.  All of the Principal Investigators are currently supported by NSF (and other) grants.  Furthermore, this instrument will be an important resource for the training and education of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers.  Finally, this instrument will be accessible to local high technology startup companies and industry, and should play a key role in economic development and new job creation in southeast Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program supports Wayne State University with the acquisition of a transmission electron microscope for interdisciplinary materials research and education.  An electron microscope is required to allow visualization of nanometer-sized materials that are prepared in many research projects that are being conducted at Wayne State University.  The instrument will have wide accessibility to campus researchers and will be used as a central analytical tool for many NSF-funded nanomaterials research projects in the departments of Chemistry, Engineering, and Physics and the Institute for Manufacturing Research.  Furthermore, this instrument will be an important resource for the training and education of our undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers.  Finally, this instrument will be accessible to local high technology startup companies and industry, and should play a key role in economic development and new job creation in southeast Michigan.\r\n",
