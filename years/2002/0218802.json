J. Northrup, Tamra Schiappa\r\nBoise State University\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\"Web Tools for Global Time Scale Development: an Example from the Pennsylvanian-Cisuralian (Early Permian)\" is an information technology project that deals with the development of the geologic time scale. The geologic time scale is a fundamental tool of Earth Science research. The correlation of global events and the calculation of rates of processes during Earth's history all depend directly on the accuracy and precision of the geologic time scale. These processes include, for example, the rates and causes of extinction, climate change, plate motions, and mountain building. Despite its critical role, portions of the time scale have not been formally defined. The focus of this project will be twofold: 1) to develop a method that will serve as a model for international discussion and agreement on the development of a complete time scale, and 2) to use a particular part of the time scale that is presently undefined, as an example of how to achieve this goal. Specifically, PIs will develop Web-based tools that will facilitate the international debate for establishment of the Pennsylvanian and Early Permian stage boundary definitions, and that will serve as a permanent resource for the data utilized for these definitions. This tool will allow all interested workers to easily enter and extract a wide variety of data from a system that is global in extent. The time scale is based on the succession of fossils that are preserved in the stratigraphic record, and therefore, these data will include a wealth of information on paleontology and biostratigraphy.  The ability to interact with these data and other researchers over the Internet will help resolve issues about the terminology for specific species, and hence remove fundamental road blocks to international agreement.  The system must also accommodate information about the stratigraphy - the architecture of the succession of sedimentary rocks - that are the hosts for the fossil record.  It must also include so-called absolute ages of rocks based on radiometric dating.  Various geochemical, paleomagnetic and other data must be included to form a true systems approach to building the time scale.  By combining these and other data types into a single system, PIs hope to be able to, for the first time, develop a reliable approach to the development of the geologic time scale.\r\n",
