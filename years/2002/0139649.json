 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an REU site that was initiated in 1999 with the purpose of introducing students and faculty members at Clark Atlanta University to interdisciplinary studies in geosciences.  Ten students are selected each year from Clark Atlanta and other academic institutions to participate in a ten-week summer program consisting of lectures and research projects.  These activities are designed to complement the regular program in Earth System Science (ESS) at Clark Atlanta.  The projects include data analysis and modeling activities on topics related to (1) the effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols on solar radiation, and (2) micrometeorological processes in the atmospheric boundary layer.  The students work closely with the principal investigator in defining and planning their research projects, writing final reports that document their summer activities, and preparing oral and poster presentations on their research findings.  Objectives of the program are to enable students to think critically, to encourage them to approach problems from an interdisciplinary point of view, and to increase the number of minority students seeking graduate degrees and careers in ESS and related areas of study.",
