 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n    A  grant has been awarded to the State University of New\r\nYork  at  Stony Brook under the direction of Dr. Raleigh for the acquisition of an analytical ultracentrifuge.\r\nThe  analytical  ultracentrifuge was first developed more than 50 years ago\r\nand  its  invention  lead  to a Nobel Prize. Since that time it has evolved\r\nfrom  a custom made piece of specialized apparatus to an essential everyday\r\ntool  for the investigation of basic biochemistry and chemistry. Analytical\r\nultracentrifugation  is the method of choice for studying the properties of\r\nlarge  molecules that associate in solution. It is applicable to biological\r\nand  non-biological  systems  and  it  is now an important research tool in\r\nbiochemistry,  structural  biology  and  polymer  science.  The  ranges  of\r\napplications  of  this  technique  are  immense and are rapidly increasing.\r\nAcquisition  of an analytical ultracentrifuge will complement major ongoing\r\ninitiatives  in  polymer science and in structural biology and biochemistry\r\nat SUNY Stony Brook.\r\n\r\n    Ten  investigators representing five academic departments at SUNY Stony\r\nBrook  will  conduct basic research projects. Their research interests span\r\nthe  range  from  the  development  of  new  materials, to biology, polymer\r\nchemistry,  enzyme  mechanisms,  protein  dynamics  and  folding, and viral\r\nassembly.  Together  they supervise more than 90 researchers. Professor Chu\r\nwill  use  the instrument in his investigations of novel vesicle structures\r\nand  surfactants  formed by modified fullerenes. These new materials have a\r\nrange of potential applications including delivery agents. Professor Kisker\r\nwill  use  the  ultracentrifugation  in  her  studies  of  DNA repair while\r\nProfessor  de  Los Santos will make use of the instrument in his studies of\r\ndamaged  DNA.  DNA  repair is essential for maintaining the correct genetic\r\ninformation.  Mutations  are  the  primary cause of hereditary diseases, as\r\nwell  as  cancer, and may also be involved in aging. Professors' London and\r\nSmith will investigate fundamental issues in membrane protein structure and\r\nfolding  and the ultracentrifuge will play an important role in their work.\r\nIt  is  estimated  that 30 % of all proteins are membrane proteins but very\r\nlittle  is  known  about  their structure and folding despite the fact that\r\nthey  play a central role in many important biological processes. Professor\r\nRaleigh  will  use  the instrument in his studies of the process of protein\r\nfolding.  The  protein-folding  problem refers to the mechanism by which an\r\ninitially  unfolded protein achieves its final functional structure. It has\r\nlong  been  known that the linear sequence of aminoacids dictates the final\r\nfolded  structure  of  proteins but the rules that govern this key assembly\r\nprocess are still not understood. Professor Sampson will use the instrument\r\nin  her  studies of the important enzyme cholesterol oxidase, which is used\r\nas  a  cholesterol  sensor. Professor Sampson and Professor Tonge will make\r\nuse  of the instrument in their basic studies of enzyme functions while the\r\nlaboratory  of  Professor  Scarlata will apply the instrument to studies of\r\nviral  assembly.  Professor  Schindelin will use the ultracentrifuge in his\r\nstudies of the proteins involved in the biosynthesis of critical molybdenum\r\ncofactors.\r\n\r\n    The  consortium  of  investigators  who will make use of the analytical\r\nultracentrifuge  study  fundamental  problems  in biology, biochemistry and\r\npolymer  chemistry.  Many  biologically important molecules as well as many\r\nman  made  macromolecules  work in tandem with closely associated partners.\r\nUnderstanding   the  detailed  nature  of  these  interactions  is  key  to\r\nunderstanding  these  complex  systems.  An  analytical  ultracentrifuge is\r\nrequired  for  these  studies. Examples taken from work at SUNY Stony Brook\r\ninclude  studies  of  critical  proteins  involved in the repair of damaged\r\ngenetic  material,  the  assembly  of  viruses,  the  behavior of novel new\r\nmaterials  made  from  C60  (\"buckyball\"  derivatives),  and studies of the\r\nfundamental  processes  by which proteins acquire their biologically active\r\nstate.  The  instrument  will  also  greatly enhance the infrastructure for\r\ntraining  graduate  students  at  SUNY  Stony  Brook  and will also benefit\r\nresearchers at nearby Brookhaven National Laboratory",
