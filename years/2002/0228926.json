 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will connect Loyola University Chicago to the Abilene high performance network via the Metropolitan Research and Educational Network (MREN) in Chicago. \r\nThis advanced network connectivity will deliver high performance network services to the laboratories, research work areas and desks of researchers at Loyola University Chicago for carrying out meritorious science research projects.\r\n \r\nThe requirements for this advanced network connectivity are driven by four proposed science research projects:  one in neuroscience, one in biology and two in computer science.  The four researchers are co-PIs.  The Vice President for Information Services at Loyola University Chicago will be the principal investigator. \r\n \r\nThese meritorious science research projects are presently constrained by high latency, limited bandwidth and problems with prioritization in using Internet 1 (or now called the commodity Internet).  To proceed, these projects need high performance network connectivity through the Abilene network because they require high bandwidth, very low latency and the full breadth of Quality of Service (QoS) initiatives.  Moreover, these projects involve essential collaboration with connected Internet 2 universities and research centers, nationally and internationally. \r\n \r\nLoyola University Chicago has developed a plan to extend the use of the proposed high performance network connection beyond the early adopters, i.e., these four research projects.  This plan will enable researchers from the Chemistry department, and the schools of nursing, education and medicine to access and use the advanced networking resources to conduct their meritorious research that will require services, such as distributed high performance computing, remote visualization and imaging, and tele-collaboration, and involved collaboration with universities and research centers who are connected to Internet 2, nationally and internationally. \r\n\r\n",
