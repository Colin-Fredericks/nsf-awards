The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support an eighteen-month research fellowship by Dr. Marc Zupan to work with Dr. Norman A. Fleck at the University of Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis goal of this project is to demonstrate strategies for minimum weight energy absorption systems based on egg-box panels and to develop a group of design parameters that allow egg-box panels to be adapted for specific protection needs.  The realizations will be manifested in (1) characterizing the mechanical response of egg-box panels in both crash and blast situations; (2) analytical models will be developed so that minimum weight designs can be achieved for specific needs; (3) design maps will be produced and validated by the production and experimental analysis of new geometries to meet current industry demands.  Egg-box panels are a new category of energy absorption devices.  It is feasible that egg-box cores, when configured correctly, can be used in a broad range of protective situations for both crash and blast protection.  Energy absorbers based on egg-box panels promise to have a significant influence on vehicle protection providing a novel minimum weight, low cost energy absorber leading to the combined goal of reduced weight, and superior energy absorption across widespread applications.\r\n\r\nThe University of Cambridge's Micromechanics Centre will provide a diverse environment, providing direct partnerships not only with the host, but also with many others.  The interdisciplinary facility currently maintains close international links with both European and American research groups.\r\n",
