They have already become an integral component of\r\nsafety critical systems involving aviation, military,\r\ntelecommunications, and process control applications.  Interest in\r\nembedded systems is growing further due to the expectation that they\r\nwill become a key component of many commonplace consumer appliances.\r\nConsumers will expect levels of reliability and predictability\r\nassociated with the very best brands of cars, televisions, and\r\nrefrigerators. Glitches, crashes, and general erratic behavior of the\r\nsort seen with prior generations of consumer PC software products will\r\nbe unacceptable for these embedded applications.  It thus becomes\r\ncrucial that these embedded software systems satisfy high levels of\r\ncorrectness criteria, well above those of today's large software\r\nsystems, which are often highly error-prone.\r\n\r\nBesides the requirement of a new standard of functional correctness,\r\nembedded systems pose additional challenges which were not fully\r\naddressed by previous validation and verification approaches. These\r\ninclude adequate guarantees of timeliness, low or controlled power\r\nconsumption, and low or controlled memory utilization.  With the\r\nspread of embedded systems, and the need to guarantee an acceptable\r\nlevel of functionality and reliability of the applications they are\r\nembedded in, the industry needs an effective and reliable development\r\nprocess. Due to market constraints, such a process should also support\r\na fast turn-around time as well as enable the easy design of many\r\ncustomized variations of the same product.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing the foundation for a seamless design\r\nprocess for embedded systems as described below.  In particular, it is\r\ndeveloping:\r\n\r\n A formal visual language for requirements, including behavioral,\r\n temporal, and TPM constraints;\r\n\r\n A methodology for the automatic synthesis of an executable\r\n specification from the requirement specification language;\r\n\r\n A methodology for the verification of the intermediate and\r\n distributed representation of the systems against requirements;\r\n\r\n A methododology for automatic code-distribution of\r\n specifications, possibly with some architectural constraints\r\n provided by the user;\r\n\r\n A model for representing hardware/software co-design\r\n platforms that enables modeling of both loosely- and tightly-coupled\r\n components as well as compositional reasoning about them;\r\n\r\n Algorithms for automatically generating \r\n architecture-optimized code from executable specifications;\r\n\r\n Methods for translation validation of the\r\n generated code and run-time validation on the system using\r\n  monitors;\r\n\r\n The Design of a profiler process which analyzes machine code,\r\n computes the resulting figures for time, power, and memory, and\r\n back-associate these figures with their executable specification\r\n sources, enabling early-stage analysis of these requirements.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the project is to streamline and significantly\r\naccelerate the time to market of embedded applications of both new\r\nproducts and revisions and customizations of existing product lines.\r\nAnother impact is to upgrade the level of dependability and\r\npredictability of embedded software to new standards, compatible and\r\ncomparable to those expected from the best brands of consumer\r\nproducts.\r\n",
