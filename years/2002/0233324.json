 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build a QoIA-aware attack resistant database\r\nsystem framework, call Linba. The trustworthiness of a computing\r\nsystem in delivering valid services in face of attacks has\r\nbecome a more critical concern than ever as people are experiencing\r\nincreased cyber security threats. A Quality of Information\r\nAssurance (QoIA) service is a service associated with a specific level\r\nof trustworthiness. From the viewpoint of end users, the goal of trusted\r\ncomputing is to enable people to get the QoIA services that they\r\nhave subscribed for even in face of attacks. However, (most) existing\r\ntrusted systems cannot deliver QoIA services since they have very limited\r\nability in providing (sustained) quantitative trustworthiness guarantees.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to build a new trusted computing\r\ninfrastructure that is able to continue delivering QoIA services\r\nin face of attacks and cost constraints. Based on a novel formal\r\n(service) trustworthiness model, Linba\r\ndelivers multilevel, differential, quantitative QoIA services\r\nthrough near optimal neuro-fuzzy composite QoIA adaptations where\r\nLinba intelligently adapts itself to environment changes and\r\nQoIA-cost tradeoffs are done in an optimized way. Successful\r\ndevelopment of Linba will arm existing trusted database systems\r\nwith the ability to deliver QoIA services (in a cost-effective\r\nway) and provide very valuable hints on developing a variety of other\r\ntypes of trusted computing systems that can deliver QoIA services.\r\nThe cost-effectiveness of Linba will be evaluated through\r\nsimulation or prototyping.\r\n",
