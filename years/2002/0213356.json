 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative research project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, O'Brien will conduct research on the electronic spectroscopy of metal containing diatomic radicals CuO, NiH, NiCl, and NiF.  The goal of the work is to provide new or improved molecular constants for a series of electronic states and to construct the energy level scheme and potential curves of these species.  These species are characterized by their open shell structure, which give rise to a host of interactions between nuclear, electronic, vibrational, and rotational degrees of freedom.  Besides being of intrinsic interest, the results of this research will also have bearing on other fields such as astrophysics.  Experimental techniques are based on intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy, the equipment for which is located at the University of Missouri at Saint Louis.  This research will be conducted with undergraduate and MS level graduate students who will receive knowledge and training in the techniques of contemporary experimental and theoretical spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nThis project consists of a collaboration between researchers at a primarily undergraduate institution and a major research university.  The research program is designed to provide new information about the energies of a set of metal containing diatomic molecules, the results of which will be useful to other fields such as astrophysics.  The project provides training in research to undergraduate and intermediate level graduate students in advanced contemporary techniques of laser spectroscopy.  The project also contains an outreach program that will allow gifted high school students to participate in the research.  \r\n",
