 "awd_abstract_narration": "his proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF01-157.  Quantum\r\ncomputing offers the prospect of computational power far beyond that\r\nwhich could be obtained merely by scaling current technologies to\r\never-smaller scales.  However, recent \"proof-of-principle\"\r\nrealizations of quantum  computers do not appear to be amenable to\r\nlarge-scale integration, like   current solid-state technology. One\r\nof the outstanding unsolved problems in  materials theory is\r\nunderstanding the feasibility of a solid-state quantum bit  (qubit),\r\nthe fundamental building block of a quantum computer.  The proposed \r\nresearch will study the possibility to use a pair of extremely\r\nsmall  semiconducting islands (with diameters less than 20\r\nnanometers) as a solid-state  qubit.  The dynamics of quantum\r\ncontrol in this system will be investigated  theoretically,\r\nincluding the coupling to the environment, which tends to  \"collapse\r\nthe wavefunction\" of the qubit.  This problem is an example of a\r\nvery  general problem in quantum mechanics, that of tunneling in the\r\npresence of a  dissipative environment. It is closely related to an\r\nanalogous problem in  nuclear physics, the decay of a superdeformed\r\nnucleus. Progress in understanding  the proposed mathematical model\r\nis thus likely to impact not only nanoscience  and quantum\r\ncomputing, but also nuclear physics (femtoscience). \r\n\r\nAs a testbed for the solid-state qubit, it is proposed that such a\r\ndouble  quantum dot can be operated as an electron pump with a\r\nquantized electrical  current.  Because the operating frequency of\r\nthe proposed electron pump would be  much greater than that of \r\nprevious quantized current sources, it could be  significant for\r\nmetrology.  The accuracy of the current quantization in this set-up\r\nis a measure of the fidelity of the qubit under repeated logical \r\nmanipulations.  This research is cofunded by the Divisions of\r\nMaterials Research and Physics.\r\n",
