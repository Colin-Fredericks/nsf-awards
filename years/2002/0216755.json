US PI Allen Goldman, Institute of Technology Distinguished Professor of Physics, University of Minnesota will start a collaborative research program with N. Chandrasekhar, Indian Institute of Science (IISc).  Goldman's NSF supported research focuses on properties of electrons confined to a plane (2D), particularly superconductivity in the extreme 2D limit, where there are issues of quantum critical behavior and the existence of a metallic state in 2D.  Chandrasekhar's efforts are concentrated on similar problems, but with specific experimental investigations, which differ from Goldman's.  They propose to join forces to carry out investigations on a subset of their respective broader programs.    \r\n\r\nScope:  This research will add an international dimension to both research programs and will greatly speed the progress of research on measurements of the superfluid density near the SI transition.  The collaboration will enhance the training of graduate students and postdocs at both institutions and promote interaction between the powerful groups in condensed matter theory at the IISc, (Ramakrishnan) and at Minnesota (Larkin and Glazman).  These individuals are world-class theoreticians.   Goldman's research program is very strong in the development of young scientists.  This activity is supported by the Indian Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.    \r\n",
