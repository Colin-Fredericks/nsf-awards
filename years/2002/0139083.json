 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this REU Site program (Research in Prokaryotic Biology) is to introduce undergraduate students to exciting areas of microbial research and to increase their awareness about careers in science.  This goal will be achieved through an intensive, approximately 9-week long, hands-on summer laboratory research program in the Microbiology Department of the University of Georgia in Athens.  Ten undergraduate student participants will be recruited from undergraduate institutions with limited research opportunities in Microbiology.  In addition, students who are members of groups that are underrepresented in the scientific community will be encouraged to participate in the program.\r\n\r\nREU participants will conduct independent projects under the supervision of faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students.  A wide variety of research topics will address the diverse functions of prokaryotic organisms (bacteria and archaea).  State-of-the-art techniques will be used in interdisciplinary approaches that combine knowledge from the fields of Genetics, Biochemistry, Physiology, Molecular Biology, Cellular Biology, and Ecology.  Microbial investigations will address broad questions ranging from the role of prokaryotes in environmental and geochemical processes to their role in human health.  Research experiences should generate enthusiasm among the students for the scientific topics and help them understand more about graduate education and careers in science.\r\n\r\nTo enhance the research experience, the REU students will have informal meetings with faculty, attend scientific seminars, join the weekly research meetings of their lab groups, and participate in ethics-in-science workshops.  Students will present their research results at the end of the summer.  This program will have a significant impact both on science and education.  The students will advance the research programs of the faculty mentors.  Moreover, the exchange of ideas among faculty and students from around the country will help spread awareness of the importance of prokaryotic biology.  Students will be able to communicate what they learn about scientific careers to their peers at their home institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
