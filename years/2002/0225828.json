Since then, suction piles\r\nhave been successfully used in numerous occasions on a variety of offshore\r\nstructures.  Suction piles have advantages over conventional underwater\r\nfoundation systems due to their simplicity and efficiency.  More obvious\r\nadvantages of suction piles are easy installation, large bearing capacity,\r\nand retrievability.  \r\n\r\n\tThe retrieval of suction piles is achieved through careful\r\napplication of increased water pressure inside the pile.  The applied water\r\npressure must be determined carefully so that the suction pile can be\r\nretrieved safely.  The main objective of this study is to identify the relationship\r\nbetween the applied positive water pressure inside the pile and the\r\nresulting pile pull-out movement through full-scale field tests.  These\r\nexperiments will provide an invaluable insight for the future development of\r\nan analytical solution for safe suction pile retrieval.  \r\n\r\n\tThe field retrieval and instrumentation will be designed and\r\nsupervised by the principal investigator and performed by the Naval\r\nFacilities Engineering Service Center with three suction piles that were\r\nsuccessfully installed by the principal investigator in 1999.  Significant\r\nmatching contribution commitment has already been made by the Naval\r\nFacilities Engineering Service Center as evidence of their interests and\r\nemphasis on the expanded use of suction piles.\r\n",
