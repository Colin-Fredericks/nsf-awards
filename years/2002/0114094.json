 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports instrument development at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS).  Thee goals of this project are: (1) to develop a transmission-mode focusing x-ray monochromator optimized for the relatively large spot size and angular divergence of the x-ray beams produced by a high power wiggler; (2) to develop the electronics required to synthesize locally a high-quality timing signal that can be used to synchronize (ultrafast) laser pulses with the electron bunch structure of the synchrotron; and (3), to develop a focusing asymmetric-cut Bragg monochromator to compress the x-ray beam for small angle x-ray scattering applications. These devices will be used to perform time-resolved structural measurements on dynamically evolving materials and will be permanently installed on the new synchrotron x-ray beam lines currently under construction at CHESS (the G-lines). The central campus location of this facility allows it to be staffed primarily by graduate students from a wide variety of disciplines, creating a comprehensive educational and outreach environment.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports instrument development at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS).The goal of this project is to develop x-ray optics designed to take full advantage of the powerful x-ray beams produced by three new beam lines (the G-lines) at CHESS. These devices will be used to perform time-resolved measurements of the atomic scale structure of dynamically evolving materials. CHESS's location on the central campus of Cornell University enables a level of hands-on training and involvement of all levels of students which is difficult to achieve elsewhere. Indeed, the G-lines are staffed primarily by graduate students from a wide variety of scientific and engineering disciplines, working on a wide variety of materials research projects. These students have been involved in all phases of the construction of the beam lines and are heavily involved in outreach to the local community, working primarily with K-12 students and their teachers. The final result is a comprehensive educational and multi-disciplinary research environment that is accessible to students of all levels. \r\n\r\n",
