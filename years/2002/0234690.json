The proposed research focuses on the development of techniques for software verification based on the joint use of\r\nmodel-checking and interface theories.\r\n\r\nSoftware model-checking constructs and analyzes finite abstractions of the software, refining the abstractions until they can be shown to satisfy a property, or until errors are found in the software.\r\nInterface theories permit the specification of the interaction behavior of software components.\r\nThe proposed research will combine these two techniques into a scalable and compositional approach to software verification, where model-checking is used to analyze individual software components, and interfaces are used to specify and verify the interaction between the\r\ncomponents in a design.  \r\nThe approach will be applied to the verification of the NASA MDS testbed.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed project consists in the\r\ndevelopment of a compositional approach to software verification based\r\non the joint use of  methods for single-component and\r\nmultiple-component analysis.\r\nThe broader impact consists in the development of tools and approaches\r\nfor the design-time validation of software, thereby increasing both\r\ndependability and quality of software systems.\r\n\r\n",
