 "awd_abstract_narration": "In concept learning, the learner is typically given a sample of instances\r\nlabeled according to some unknown target concept. The learner?s task is to\r\nconstruct a hypothesis that is a good approximation of the target in a\r\nreasonable amount of time. Building concept learning systems has become an\r\nimportant research area due to the ever-increasing need for analyzing huge\r\namounts of stored data. Although many efficient algorithms were constructed for\r\nlearning various classes of concepts, these concept classes are extremely\r\nsimple. Further, numerous hardness results seem to suggest that learning more\r\nexpressive concept classes is extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nTwo research directions have evolved in an effort to address the difficulty of\r\nlearning more expressive concepts. One is to construct multiple classifier\r\nsystems (MCS) and the other is to consider the possibility of actively\r\ninteracting with the environment (a.k.a. active learning). Currently, due to\r\nthe success of the Adaboost algorithm, theoretical research on MCS (and in fact\r\nmachine learning in general) tends to focus rather narrowly on ensemble\r\nmethods. Similarly, active learning research has been concentrated on the use\r\nof membership queries, and to some extent the teaching model. Other types of\r\nMCS and active learning that may lead to more intelligent learning systems have\r\nnot been well studied. A good understanding of how to build more sophisticated\r\nMCS and exploit other possibilities of extracting information from the\r\nenvironment will move us one step closer to achieving the original intent of\r\nmachine learning, which is to automate the knowledge acquisition process. This\r\nproposed research will investigate complex multiple classifier and active\r\nlearning systems so that the learning of difficult concept classes becomes more\r\ntractable.\r\n\r\n",
