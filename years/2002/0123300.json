 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Silicon Run Series consists of topical videos on semiconductor manufacturing. This format, which includes overviews as well as process specific videos, has proven invaluable to instructors who often must teach courses to students at different levels of technical understanding. The Silicon Run series currently consists of the following videos:\r\n\r\nIntroductory: Overview Silicon Run Lite 30 min.\r\n\r\nIntermediate: \r\nOverview Silicon Run I - 2nd Edition 40 min.\r\nSilicon Run II 35 min.\r\n\r\nAdvanced: Process-Specific: \r\nSilicon Run Deposition 31 min.\r\nSilicon Run Lithography 31 min.\r\nSilicon Run Etch 37 min.\r\nSilicon Run Ion Implantation (to be produced)\r\n\r\nThe objective of Silicon Run Ion Implantation is to complete the Series with a 30 minute video production featuring the process whereby impurities, known as dopants, are introduced into silicon wafers to alter the electrical conductivity of specific regions. As with the rest of the Series, this video is designed for undergraduate electrical engineering and engineering technology courses and for industry's semiconductor technician training programs. Educators who use the Series to supplement their courses are specifically requesting the production of this last video to ensure they have in-depth coverage of all four semiconductor processes. To them, the videos provide their students what they themselves can not; an intimate close-up view inside an IC fabrication facility. Industry's restrictive policies, due to clean room procedures and competitive issues, make manufacturing sites unavailable to the public and even to in-house employees. This inaccessibility has proven an educational challenge which the Silicon Run Series has addressed through its videos. The production of quality educational videos is the method being employed to visually document state-of-the-art ion implantation and make it relevant to semiconductor education and technician training programs. This requires the participation of professors and industrial trainers to ensure content accuracy; corporate sponsors to provide funding and access to industrial locations: and media artists to capture the process in a professional video format that can be edit into an engaging storyline. Animation, microscopic filming, and special effects are used to enhance understanding. The production of Ion Implantation will complete the Silicon Run Series so it can serve these programs as an educational tool that provides a realistic look at semiconductor manufacturing.\r\n",
