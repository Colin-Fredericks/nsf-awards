 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe effective instruction of Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR) theory and its applications is dependent upon the availability of modern and reliable instrumentation. The goal of this project is to enhance the understanding and mastery of current FT-NMR applications and theory at the undergraduate and community college level in Eastern Kentucky through multiple hands-on experiences. Following the acquisition of an Anasazi-upgraded NMR, students are operating the FT-NMR instrument as well as interpreting the data individually and in group experiments. The students are learning to apply their knowledge of FT-NMR to a variety of standard and advanced FT-NMR techniques. The level of FT-NMR education is being increased for students at Maysville and Prestonsburg Community Colleges in Eastern Kentucky by hosting visits/experiments by those students who in the past did not have routine access to NMR instrumentation. These students are involved in group experiments with current Morehead State University students. Students' education at all levels, freshman to senior, is being impacted by the new instrumentation, with use of the instrument in organic chemistry courses for both science majors and nonscience majors, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and advanced courses including independent research. Experiments are being adapted from both the educational literature and the research literature.\r\n",
