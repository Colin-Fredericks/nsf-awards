 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the dynamics of certain classes of\r\nintegro-differential equations that arise in models of cortex.  He\r\nexamines how recurrent activity terminates due to any of several\r\neffects such as synaptic depression, depolarization block, and\r\nafter-hyperpolarization.  He also considers how recurrent\r\nconnections lead to bistability and under what conditions this is\r\nsufficient to produce localized spatial states, wave fronts, and\r\npulses.  He uses methods of averaging and bifurcation theory to\r\nderive and analyse simplified dynamics from these models.  The\r\nmathematical results explain a variety of experimental findings\r\nin both normal and pharmacologically manipulated neural tissue.\r\nThese methods are applied to the Limax procerebral lobe, the\r\nturtle olfactory bulb, and various cortical slice preparations.\r\n     Neurons, the main cells in the brain, are responsible for\r\nprocessing inputs from the outside world and converting this to\r\nmotor actions.  They communicate by producing spikes that are\r\npropagated to different regions of the brain by chemicals called\r\ntransmitters.  The nvestigator is interested in how this\r\nelectrical and chemical information moves from one part of the\r\nbrain to others.  He uses simulations and mathematics to derive\r\nequations and general principles about how this is done.\r\nExperiments have shown that during some cognitive tasks, certain\r\ngroups of neurons fire synchronously.  He is interested in the\r\nconditions that are necessary to attain precise timing between\r\ndifferent groups of neurons.  In order to study these, he has\r\ndeveloped mathematical software for the study of complex\r\nbiological and physical systems.  As part of this project, he\r\ncontinues to develop this software and to make it widely\r\navailable.  The project also provides interdisciplinary training\r\nopportunities for students and postdocs.",
