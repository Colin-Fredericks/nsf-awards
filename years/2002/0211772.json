ECCAD has been held annually at a variety of North American locations on\r\nthe East Coast since 1994. The ninth meeting in the series will be held on Saturday, May 18,\r\n2002, at LaGuardia Community College, Long Island City, New York. The proposers will\r\ninvite three speakers for featured presentations, and organize contributed poster/software\r\ndemo sessions, covering the various aspects of computer algebra: algorithms, software imple-mentation,\r\nand applications. They expect about 70 to 100 researchers, post graduate and graduate students to participate, with most of the attendees coming from the North East, but also many from all over North America and even Europe.\r\nIn addition to invitations to the many universities and institutions along the East Coast where significant research in symbolic computation is going on, the 2002 ECCAD will be made a (separately funded) part of the Faculty Development Program of The City University of New York (a minority institution), and the proposers will specifically encourage faculty and students from all campuses of CUNY to participate.",
