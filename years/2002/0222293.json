HPNC proposals are complex documents that include many nuances and requirements.  This workshop will take the participants through the proposal preparation process and assist investigators in developing their proposals.  This workshop will cover the technical, administrative and research justifications that are required, and the workshop will address budget, format and narrative requirements.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be a one day, hands-on event where the participants actually begin preparation of their HPNC proposal.  The day will be divided into sessions that will focus on key areas of the proposal development process.  Mentors will open each session with a brief discussion of the area of the proposal being addressed in the session.  Then, the mentors will be available for questions and advice during the time allotted for proposal writing.  Each session will contain actual proposal writing time.",
