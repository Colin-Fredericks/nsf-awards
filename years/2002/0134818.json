 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Michael Carrasco, of the Department of Chemistry at Santa Clara University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies to determine how peptides and proteins can be made resistant to proteolysis by the attachment of sugars or other small organic molecules. By studying arrays of neoglycopeptides synthesized by a recently developed combinatorial method, Professor Carrasco hopes to discover general structural motifs that confer proteolytic resistance. These motifs will then be tested on peptide and protein models of practical and theoretical interest. The stages of research will be: (1) synthesizing a combinatorial array of neoglycopeptides, (2) determining the proteolysis of the members of the neoglycopeptide array by a variety of proteases, (3) analyzing the results to determine general, protective structural motifs, and (4) introducing these motifs to bioactive peptides and proteins to increase their proteolytic resistance without disturbing their function. The results generated will provide new strategies for the design of novel peptide and protein pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nThe teaching portion of this proposal focuses on extending the culture of research and community of scholars present in the sciences to include underrepresented students with a special emphasis on Latino students. Four concrete objectives will be implemented to foster a network of students and faculty across the scientific disciplines that will address both general scientific issues and ancillary issues specific to those from multicultural backgrounds. The four objectives are: (1) identifying and recruiting research students from underrepresented groups, (2) creating a faculty and peer mentoring network, (3) establishing a specific program of research presentations and attendance at regional and national meetings, and (4) initiating a regular, special seminar series given by prominent scientists from underrepresented groups. The main emphasis of the program is providing both scientific and personal mentoring for the students. Therefore, with the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for this CAREER award, Professor Michael Carrasco, of the Department of Chemistry at the Santa Clara University seeks to determine if glycosylation can be an effective tool in developing more proteolytic-resistant peptide and protein pharmaceutical as part of his research effort and will use teaching and mentoring underrepresented students as part of his educational goals.\r\n\r\n",
