 "awd_abstract_narration": "0203333\r\nScarlatos, Lori\r\nCUNY Brooklyn College\r\n\"Innovative Approaches to Computer-Human Interfaces\"\r\n\r\nThis project, involving two universities, addresses the transfer of Human Computer Interfaces (HCI) research into undergraduate and graduate curricula. The PI and Co-PIs explore alternative approaches to HCI including immersive interfaces, virtual reality and ubiquitous computing as well as alternative input modes, such as voice, gesture, and eye tracking. They have also experimented with using objects in the environment as input devices (tangible interfaces) and giving those objects intelligence about where they are in relation to others (smart objects). This proposal describes a way to address the need to expand the pool of HCI practitioners through curricular changes integrating the PI's and others' research. This project involves the development of a sequence of courses for both computer science and math/science education students that teach them how to 1) utilize  new interface technologies, 2) apply those skills in multidisciplinary teams, and 3) evaluate their resulting projects in public settings. The computer science and math/science education students collaborate to develop educational tools designed to get K-12 students interested in math and science. The new courses are taught at two public universities, Brooklyn College (CUNY) and Stony Brook University (SUNY), where they reach students and future/current teachers from both the suburbs and the inner city. In addition, the PI plan two teacher workshops at Stony Brook's Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, and the installation of the projects in two museums: the New York Hall of Science, and the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science. This combined research curriculum development effort is expected to yield several benefits. (1) The work may impact a broad range of people, including a large number of students in groups that are underrepresented in math and science in college classrooms, public museums, and public schools, (2) This multidisciplinary program will facilitate and support collaboration between computer science students and math/science education students (who are generally practicing teachers). These undergraduate students will learn about state-of-the-art research advances in the area of computer-human interfaces, and how those interfaces can be used to enhance education, apply these technologies to educational applications in a collaborative effort, and participate in research evaluating their applications in real-world settings, (3) Student projects, installed at the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, the New York Hall of Science, and the Goudreau Museum of Mathematics in Art and Science, will provide learning opportunities and inspiration to a wider audience including both students and educators, (4) Two workshops, held at the Center for Excellence in Learning and Teaching, will help to further disseminate the findings of this project among the community of educators (5) A new textbook, with supplementary materials available online, will enable others to teach these courses at their institutions. Educational applications utilizing innovative computer interfaces may then become the tools of an even greater pool of educators and students.\r\n\r\n",
