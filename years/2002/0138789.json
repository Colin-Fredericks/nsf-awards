The US organizer is Dr. Anwarul Haque, Department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  The co-organizer is Dr. A.K.M. Sadrul Islam, Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Dhaka, Bangladesh.  The workshop will include discussions on response of composite materials to various loading conditions including static and cyclic, mechanical and thermal.  It will include a short course on composite materials with emphasis on polymer matrix composites.  The binational workshop is to be in conjunction with a meeting organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) and The Bangladesh Society of Mechanical Engineering (BSME) and titled \"BSME-ASME International Conference on Thermal Engineering\".  The organizers plan a publication of the proceedings. \r\n\r\nScope: This project enables four US scientists to attend this workshop to exchange information with Bangladesh scientists about recent developments in the analytical and experimental research on composite materials in the United States and in Bangladesh.  Discussions will be held on possible future collaborations among University of Alabama and BUET researchers.  The project meets INT objectives in supporting workshops where mutual benefit and dissemination of information are likely to result. \r\n",
