 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0204826\r\nJason Cantarella and Joseph Fu\r\n\r\nThe project will study the geometry of knots which are critical\r\nconfigurations for \"ropelength\", which is defined to be the quotient\r\nof their length over the radius of their largest embedded tubular\r\nneighborhood. Since the ropelength functional is not smooth, there is\r\nno classical Euler-Lagrange equation describing the minimizers.  The\r\nprimary aim of the projec666t is to provide an analogy to the\r\nEuler-Lagrange equation: a \"balance criterion\", which shows that a\r\ncurve is ropelength critical if and only if the first variation of the\r\nlength of the core curve can be balanced by a system of self-contact\r\nforces acting on the surrounding tube. The methods used to prove the\r\nbalance criterion (a generalization of certain aspects of tensegrity\r\ntheory to a class of \"continuous tensegrities\", using a version of the\r\nFarkas alternative theorem for linear operators on Banach spaces)\r\npromise rich applications in other areas of mathematics, such as the\r\nstudy of convex curves, and of \"knot energies\".\r\n\r\nA natural model for a rope with a circular cross-section is a space\r\ncurve surrounded by a non-self-intersecting tube of fixed radius.  If\r\nsuch a rope is tied in a knot, and the knot is pulled tight, the\r\nresulting curve is a critical configuration for the \"ropelength\" of\r\nthe curve, which is defined to be the quotient of the length of the\r\ncurve over the radius of the tube. The project studies the geometry of\r\nropelength-critical curves using ideas from the theory of frameworks.\r\nThis theory studies simple engineering models of structures, and gives\r\na precise description of how external loads on a structure are\r\nresolved into tensions and compressions of different structural\r\nelements.  The project views the tension in a tight knot as exerting a\r\nforce directed towards the inside of each curve of the rope, and aims\r\nto show that such a curve is tight if this force can be resolved into\r\na system of self-contact forces acting on the surface of the tube.\r\nThis \"balance criterion\" has surprising consequences. Imagine a rope\r\nstretched horizontally, like a clothesline. If another rope is passed\r\nover the line, and pulled down until the pair is tight, the ropes form\r\nfour straight segments joined to a central region where the strands\r\ncurve around one another. One would expect the ropes to maintain\r\ncontact throughout this curved clasp, with the two points on the\r\ninside of each bend touching one another. However, according to the\r\nbalance criterion, this cannot happen: there is always a small gap\r\nbetween the two strands at the center of the turn. This model has\r\nalready been used in molecular biology to describe the behavior of DNA\r\nstrands; the new geometric information provided by the project will\r\nhelp to refine and extend many other appications of this model in\r\nphysics, biology, and engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
