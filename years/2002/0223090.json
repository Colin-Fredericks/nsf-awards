 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2002 annual meeting of the Phytochemical Society of North America will bring together (for the first time) chemical ecologists, biochemists, natural products chemists, molecular biologists, biomedical researchers and ethnobotanists/pharmacologists with the goal of developing an integrative synthesis of these traditional and modern approaches.  Symposia will address ways in which these subdisciplines can inform each other about the evolution, function, and potential applications of plant products.  Submitted presentations also will address the meeting theme, \"Integrative Phytochemistry: From Ethnobotany to Molecular Ecology\".  This meeting will provide an unprecedented intersection of biology, chemistry, sociology and medecine and should produce truly novel, international and cross-cultural collaborative opportunities. \r\n\tThe meeting will be held in Merida, Mexico; attendees will come from all over North America and Europe (at least), and strong representation by Mexican and other Latin American scientists and students is expected.  Meeting organizers highlight participation by students and younger scientists by organizing a 'young researcher' symposium and seeking support for travel by students, postdocs, and junior researchers.  Proceedings will be published as a volume in the widely-read \"Recent Advances in Phytochemistry\" series. \r\n",
