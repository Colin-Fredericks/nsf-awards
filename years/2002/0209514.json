The U.S. organizer is Dr. Abdelghani Bellaachia, Professor in the Department of Computer Science, George Washington University, Washington, D.C.  The Moroccan co-organizer is Dr. Said Belcadi, Director, Scientific Research and Cooperation (CNCPRST), Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Rabat, Morocco. The workshop will cover topics in the following areas: bioinformatics, e-commerce, internet/networking, software engineering, telecomputing/telemedicine, and wireless communications.  It is hoped that the presentations and discussions will lead to identifications of areas of cooperative research of mutual interest to the two countries.\r\n\r\nScope:  This project will likely open avenues for collaboration in information technology research, an important area for the United States and for many of the developing countries, such as Morocco, where there is a need to accelerate the development in that area and to reap benefits in many applications such as in education, communications and in industrialization.  The U.S. team that Dr. Bellaachia has assembled is composed of eminent and experienced scientists. The Government of Morocco has strongly endorsed the workshop.  Funding for the project is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Advanced Networking Infrastructure and Research.\r\n",
