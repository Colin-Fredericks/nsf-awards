 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project outlines a solution to a two-fold problem in Texas. The two-fold pieces of \r\nthis problem are: 1) the productivity of the flourishing high technology economy in the \r\nstate of Texas is being negatively impacted by the severe lack of well-educated \r\nengineering professionals; and, 2) a significantly large human resources, particularly \r\nminorities living in the state, do not participate in the development of the high \r\ntechnology industry. Consequently, economic prosperity bypasses this group. Therefore, \r\nwhat is needed is some economically feasible funding source that allows all Texas state \r\nresidents to gain employment in the high technology industry. Hence, the scholarships \r\nafforded through this grant are assisting in alleviating this dual dilemma. The MEET-SWT \r\nproject management plan is providing a system of prudent strategies for recruiting, retaining \r\nand ultimately graduating traditionally underrepresented individuals. These graduates enter \r\ninto and to become productive members of the Texas high technology workforce. The \r\nDepartment of Technology at SWT is optimistic about the opportunity that this scholarship \r\nprogram is having in promoting education and career opportunities in engineering and \r\nengineering technology for all Texas state residents.",
