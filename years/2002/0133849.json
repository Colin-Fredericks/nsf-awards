 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Development Plan involves an integrated collection of research and \r\neducational activities focused on algorithms for high-dimensional \r\ngeometric problems.\r\n\r\nGeometric computing with high-dimensional data is of crucial importance to \r\nmany areas of computer science, including  machine learning, data mining, \r\ndatabases and information retrieval, computer vision and computational biology.\r\nExample problems in this area are: nearest neighbor search, many variants of \r\ndata clustering, and discovering linear structure of the data (e.g. via \r\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)). \r\nUnfortunately, the classical geometric algorithms for many of these problems \r\ndo not scale well with the dimension. For example, the running times of the \r\nclassical algorithms for the nearest neighbor search depend exponentially \r\non the dimension, which makes them inefficient for dimension higher than, \r\nsay, 20. This is unfortunate, since many applications involve number of \r\ndimensions anywhere from a few hundred to a few million.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, new, powerful techniques for solving these\r\nproblems have been discovered, most notably dimensionality reduction and \r\nrandom sampling in geometric spaces. The algorithms obtained using those \r\ntechniques enjoy very low (at most linear) dependence on the dimension, \r\nat the cost of providing approximate answers. The problems amenable to \r\nthese techniques include nearest neighbor search, clustering and PCA.\r\nHowever, the algorithmic solutions to these problems still possess \r\n(sometimes quite severe) limitations. Our goal is to identify methods for \r\ncircumventing these limitations and making the algorithms efficient, both \r\nin theory and in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe techniques which led to the development of the aforementioned \r\nalgorithms are new and still not widely known. \r\nThey include many tools which have been developed during 70s and 80s \r\nin the field of mathematics called functional analysis. \r\nHowever, computer scientists became aware of those methods only very recently,\r\nand many of the fundamental results are still not widely known or used.\r\nTherefore, it is important to make these results accessible to large computer \r\nscience audience so that they can be successfully used, investigated and \r\ndeveloped. In the Education Plan section we outline a plan on how to make \r\nthem more accessible to students as well as computer scientists.\r\n",
