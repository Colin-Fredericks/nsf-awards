 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of their economic impact as plant pathogens, Phytophthora species are being intensively studied through molecular genetic and genomics approaches. These organisms have served as lead species for the entire Stramenopiles lineage, a major radiation of crown eukaryotes distinct from plants, animals and fungi.  The Phytophthora molecular genetics community has developed a strong culture of collaboration, communication, and  sharing techniques and resources. With the recent blossoming of genetic and genomic tools for Phytophthora, many new investigators from a variety of backgrounds have become interested in Phytophthora molecular genetics. This award will facilitate the integration of these investigators into the community and will further strengthen the cooperative culture of this community. The specific goals of the network follow:\r\n1. To promote communication and collaboration, and to minimize duplication of effort, within the worldwide Phytophthora molecular genetics community by means of an annual workshop, exchange visits among laboratories, and a community web site.\r\n2. To produce and distribute research resources including libraries, specific DNA clones, genetic strains and cDNA microarrays, that will benefit the whole community,\r\n3. To promote the entry, participation and training of students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and more established faculty in the field of Phytophthora molecular genetics.  The network is especially interested in facilitating the participation of minority individuals and those from predominantly undergraduate institutions, institutions with high percentages of students from groups underrepresented in the U.S. research infrastructure, and institutions in states that have traditionally received lower amounts of federal funding for research and development. This will be done by means of travel awards to the annual workshop, training internships, and facilitated access to techniques and resources.  Faculty from nations without established research infracstructures will also be eligible for some support.\r\n\r\nThis Research Coordination Network is open to all researchers with an interest in Phytophthora molecular genetics. It promises to broaden the diversity of scientists working  in this field and to advance our understanding of the biology of these important plant pathogens. \r\n\r\n",
