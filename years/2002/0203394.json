It is a common method to use 2-dimensional surfaces as a\r\ntool in studying 3-manifolds.  The most useful surfaces in studying\r\n3-manifolds are essential surface, essential laminations, and Heegaard\r\nsurfaces.  The purpose of this project is to study the properties of\r\n3-manifolds using these surfaces and Dehn surgery.  There have been\r\ngreat progress in this area in the last few years, for example we now\r\nknow that an essential surface will remain essential after most Dehn\r\nsurgeries, and the exact upper bounds on distances between all ten\r\npairs of nonsimple surgery types have been determined.  However there\r\nare still some very important problems remaining to be solved in this\r\narea.  An objective of this project is to determine how many surgeries\r\nare ``exceptional'' in certain sense, for example, how many will\r\nproduce so called Seifert manifolds, and how many will kill an\r\nessential surface.  The PI will also study the problem of how an\r\nimmersed surface intersects a Heegaard surface.\r\n\r\n3-manifolds are objects that are locally like ordinary 3-dimensional\r\nspaces, but whose global structure may be quite complicated.  Such\r\nobjects appear naturally from different areas of mathematics as well\r\nas physics and other sciences.  The ultimate goal in the study of\r\n3-manifold topology is to have a thorough understanding of the\r\nstructure of 3-manifolds.  This has not been achieved yet, but there\r\nhas been a great progress towards the proof of a conjectural picture\r\ndescribed by Thurston more than 20 years ago.  The PI proposes to\r\ncontinue studying 3-manifolds via Dehn surgery, which is a method of\r\nconstructing new 3-dimensional spaces from an existing 3-dimensional\r\nspace, by removing a neighborhood of a circle and then gluing back in\r\na different way.  The achievement of this project will be an important\r\nstep towards the goal of having a clear understanding of the\r\ntopological and geometric structures of 3-manifolds.\r\n",
