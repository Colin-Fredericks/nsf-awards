This symposium will be held as part of the 2003 EGS-AGU- EUG joint meeting in Nice, France, from 7-11 April 2003.  The objective of this symposium is to advance our knowledge of:\r\n Potentially stable or unstable continental slopes - important to the health and safety of offshore and coastal regions;\r\n The possible presence of gas hydrates and free gas zones - so as to improve environmental protection during offshore activities such as cable, pipeline laying and drilling operations;\r\n Forces and release mechanisms of slope failures on margins, and of endangered areas - for a major contribution to sustainable development;\r\n Establish, describe and develop tools for evaluating the consequences of submarine mass movements to the sea floor, man-made structures or coastal communities;\r\n Links between the submarine mass movements and the generation of tsunamis.\r\n Predictive tools and risk assessment of continental slope activity for the next 100 - 1000 years.\r\n\r\nA US delegation of six (6) researchers will participate in the symposium.  Every effort will be made to invite junior researchers of the U.S. tsunami community as the members of the delegation.\r\n",
