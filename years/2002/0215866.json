 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Connecticut College will acquire a powder X-ray diffractometer for undergraduate research and research training. This equipment will enhance research studies involving the chemistry of microporous manganese oxides with layered and tunneled structures.  These manganese oxide projects include a) nonaqueous sol-gel syntheses of layered and tunneled materials; b) sol-gel preparation of thin films; c) sol-gel preparation of aerogels; d) room temperature synthesis of manganese oxide colloids as precursors to layered materials with a wide variety of interlayer cations; e) solventothermal reactions of colloidal materials; f) electrochemical studies of colloidal films; and g) control of Mn valency in colloids.  Faculty will also implement X-ray diffraction experiments in upper level laboratory courses.  \r\n\r\nThe X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and it provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of the molecule relative to the neighboring molecules.  These studies will have a strong impact in materials chemistry.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
