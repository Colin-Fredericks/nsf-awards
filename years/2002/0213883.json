The Center also supports a wide range of educational activities, including the establishment of advanced degrees in polymer education and a new course leading to an advanced degree in Distance Leaming. The Center is entitled the Response-Driven Polymeric Films Center. The Center supports well maintained and accessible shared experimental facilities and interacts with industry and other sectors at local, regional, national and international levels. \r\n\r\nThe Center's research is organized into two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGS). \r\nIRG 1, Design and Synthesis ofresponse -Driven Poymers, focuses on the the design and synthesis of molecular processes in biomaterials, liquid crystals, and environmentally fismart\" molecules. IRG 2, Response-Driven Film Formation, conducts molecular level investigations of films and coatings that exhibit response-driven properties. Potential application of the Center's research are in diveres areas such as water treatment, controlled drug release, and formulation of water-based coatings.. In addition, seed support is provided for emerging research opportunities which are within the general scope of the Center. \r\n\r\nParticipants in the Center currently include 19 senior investigators, 2 postdoctoral associates, 30 graduate students, 12 undergraduates, and 6 technicians and other support personnel. Professor Marek W. Urban directs the MRSEC. \r\n",
