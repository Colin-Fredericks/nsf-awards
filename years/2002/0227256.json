 "awd_abstract_narration": "The SUPER (School-University Partnership for Excellence in Research-based) STEM Project is a partnership between the Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) and the University of Maryland Baltimore County.  SUPER STEM activities are built on a foundation of past work between the district and the university.  The project focuses on increasing student achievement, especially that of low-performing students, and targets low-performing schools. Located in the suburban region around Baltimore, BCPS enrolled 107,322 students during the 2001-02 academic year.  The County population is rapidly shifting in ethno-racial characteristics such that the most recent census indicates that White residents in the county have decreased from 84.9% in 1990 to 74.4% in 2000.  Within BCPS, 33.7% of the students are African American, 59.7% are White, 4.0% are Asian American, and 2.0% are Hispanic. \r\n\r\nTo achieve its MSP-aligned goals, SUPER STEM will:\r\n1.  Establish Visiting STEM Scholarships to attract talented scientists and educators to accelerate the development and teaching of new curricula;\r\n2.  Provide weekend and summer accelerated academic coursework for the lowest-performing students and schools;\r\n3.  Create STEM Academies in the lowest-performing schools;\r\n4.  Expand the UMBC Urban Education Principal, Teacher and Intern Scholarships to recruit and retain the most talented STEM educators to lowest-performing schools;\r\n5.  Provide over 100 hours of STEM training to roughly 1800 teachers; and\r\n6.  Conduct ongoing, hierarchical, multi-method longitudinal student and teacher achievement analyses, performance assessments, and work sampling.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
