The co-organizers are Professor Ross Boulanger of the University of California, Davis and Professor Ikuo Towhata at the University of Tokyo in Japan.  Earthquakes can devastate major urban areas in a number of ways, including through the hazards posed to the population, the disruption of lifeline systems and services, and the economic impacts on the region, state, or nation.  Advances in our understanding of seismic hazards and their mitigation continue to be learned from recent large earthquakes.  Recently the 1999 Chi-Chi (Taiwan), 1999 Kocaeli (Turkey), and 2000 Bhuj earthquakes caused tremendous damage to the civil infrastructure in and around urban areas in those countries.  Reconnaissance teams sent independently from the U.S. and Japan investigated these disasters.  Geotechnical aspects of these disasters will be discussed, including the effects of liquefaction, ground deformations, foundation failures, landslides, and surface ruptures on civil infrastructure (e.g., lifelines, ports and harbors, buildings, transportation systems).  The objective of the seminar is to facilitate advancement of our understanding and ability to mitigate geotechnical aspects of seismic disasters.  Discussions on these subjects will include: 1) development of new engineering techniques for mitigation of these hazards; 2) identification of those problems that should be solved with the highest priority; and 3) sharing the most recent results of research to advance our understanding of, and ability to predict, these types of hazards and effectively plan mitigation efforts.\r\n\r\nA number of researchers in both countries will continue to more thoroughly investigate important sites for lessons that can advance our understanding of these hazards. The project advances international human resources through the participation of postdocs and a graduate student.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The researchers plan to publish results of the seminar proceedings on their web site at the Center for Geotechnical Modeling (http://cgm.engr.ucdavis.edu/).\r\n",
