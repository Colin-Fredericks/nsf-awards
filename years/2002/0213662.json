The researchers will investigate how the computer science pipeline gets constructed. \"Technological portraits\" for three Los Angeles public high schools will be developed and in-depth interviews will be conducted with approximately forty district-level technology administrators, principals, counselors, computer science and math teachers, and technology and magnet coordinators at these three schools. Each of these three schools has a high numbers of African-American and Latino/a students.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will study the perceptions and thinking of those who help to construct the pipeline-namely, state, district, and local educators. In particular, they will focus on 1) educators' perceptions of what a computer science curriculum should be for their students; 2) the courses and curriculum sequences that these educators shape; 3) the criteria they use to judge which students should study computer science and which are not capable of success ; and 4) how these norms and structures that influence the construction of the pipeline translate into educators' role in shaping students' course-taking choices. Dissemination of findings is an important part of this proposal and the investigators will hold on-going discussions with school educators about these issues. Printed materials will be produced for distribution in the three schools, and meetings/discussions will be held with the teachers about the research findings. The findings will be disseminated nationally.\r\n\r\n",
