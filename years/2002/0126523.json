 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThis project is improving the laboratory experience for our students in The Chemistry of High\r\nPolymers. This is being accomplished by the introduction of a GPC, coupled with UV and light-scattering detectors, with attendant software. Experiments are being adapted from a program at the University of Northern Iowa and from the educational literature. These instruments allow students to accurately determine synthetic and/or commercial polymer's accurate macromolecular characterizations, such as their molecular weights, molecular weight distributions and molecular size. The result is that we are upgrading and enhancing the laboratory program for an undergraduate polymers course that has been offered for the last 26 years. Since it is a well-known fact that about 75% of all chemistry majors will work in the chemical industry at some time in their careers, and that a vast majority of those chemical companies manufacture polymers, many exclusively so, this particular course and its laboratory experience are integral to the education of chemistry majors who pass through our department. It has proven to be a very popular course over the years we have offered it, and most all our chemistry majors take it.",
