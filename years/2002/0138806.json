 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Newark Public Schools Systemic Initiative in Mathematics\" is a five-year Local Systmeic Change project targeting K-8 mathematics.  In association with higher education partners Rutgers University and Montclair State University, the project will effect change in three broad areas:  the implementation and institutionalization of standards-based curricula, instruction and assessment in every K-8 mathematics classroom in Newark; professional development for the existing cadre of mathematics resource teachers as well as K-8 teachers and administrators; and intensive collaboration with parents, higher education partners and community agencies.\r\n\r\nThe project targets 1040 elementary teachers, 260 middle school teachers, 30 mathematics resource teachers, and 60 school administrators.  Teachers will participate in two-week summer institutes, monthly follow-up sessions and mathematics/mathematics education courses at the universities.  In addition, teachers will receive ongoing classroom-based support for their work.  The mathematics resource teachers will receive professional development aimed toward enhancing their ability to provide instructional support to the classroom teachers.  School administrators will participate in professional development to enhance their understanding of current mathematics educational practices, providing a basis for leadership and support of standards-based mathematics instruction.  Project partners will also develop after-school centers to serve as laboratories for collaboration among unversity partners, prospective teachers, undergraduate/graduate students, classroom teachers, mathematics resource teachers, administrators and parents.\r\n",
