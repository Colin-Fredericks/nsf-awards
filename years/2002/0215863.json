 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Profs. Michael A. Dvorak and Daniel Gregory of St. Cloud State University will develop a time-resolved laser based instrument for integration into the undergraduate chemistry research and curriculum experience.  This is a collaborative venture between St. Cloud State University and Dakota Technologies Inc. (DTI).  The overall goal of these studies is to create affordable and easy-to-operate modules that can be readily coupled to commercial spectrofluorimeters, and greatly expand their capabilities.  This research will focus on the development of two spectroscopic modules: a nanosecond laser light source, which will allow recording of fluorescence decay data, and a transient absorption accessory, which will allow absorption studies.  \r\n\r\nUndergraduate and graduate students will be heavily involved in the development phase of this project and will use the instrument in their research.  Thus, the educational impact from the instrumentation for undergraduate chemistry training will be significant.  Central to any chemist's training is the understanding of spectroscopic techniques that play a critical role in all areas of chemistry.",
