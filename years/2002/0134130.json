 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nAn advanced renewable based distributed power generation system is required for\r\nthe next age of the alternative energy market. Improved and dependable systems\r\nfor energy conversion, energy storage requires power quality demands and\r\ncompatibility with distributed energy systems, also called by microgrid or\r\nmicropower energy systems. An intelligent-based control methodology must be\r\ndeveloped to optimize the microgrid system requirements, aiming convergence of\r\nadaptive, parameter insensitive and on-line learning capabilities. This research\r\nproject is concerned with three main issues (1) small distributed generation\r\nprototype development of a high frequency ac link (HFAC) microgrid system, (2)\r\nanalysis and modeling of behavior interactions and architecture management and\r\n(3) intelligent control applications.\r\n\r\nPower electronic systems will be designed to connect distributed sources to the\r\nHFAC. Intelligent control techniques will be developed to implement capabilities\r\nof learning by sensing the environment in order to reach its objective of\r\noptimum power operation, automatic functioning, self-monitoring and\r\nself-checking of failures and detection/recovery for efficient user interface. A\r\nbehavior based hierarchic control capable to generate set-points for optimal\r\nneural network controllers based on Adaptive Critic Design will be developed.\r\nAn educational plan is focused to leverage the interdisciplinary mission of the\r\nEngineering Division at Colorado School of Mines. It is proposed the development\r\nof educational material will be developed to allow students to have experience\r\nin studying theoretical foundations of intelligent control systems,\r\nunderstanding their functional operation through the use of computer for\r\nsimulation in promising research directions. The five-year, integrated\r\ndevelopment plan encompasses research, education and outreach activities in\r\norder to incorporate intelligent control techniques for performance improvement\r\nof distributed energy systems used in residential and small business\r\napplications.\r\n",
