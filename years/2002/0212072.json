Adult development begins in the larva and precursors for \r\nadult-specific structures such as the wing and compound eye are \r\ntypically present at the time of pupation in the form of discrete \r\npackets of cells called imaginal discs.  The familiar and \r\nwell-characterized example provided by the fruit fly, Drosophila \r\nmelanogaster, in which the imaginal discs are present through the \r\nentire larval stage, appears to be a derived condition.  In contrast, \r\nimaginal discs in apparently the majority of holometabolous species \r\nare not created until the final larval instar.  Little is known about \r\nthe development of these \"late-forming\" imaginal discs.  The current \r\nstudies focus on the late-forming imaginal eye disc of the moth, \r\nManduca sexta.  Prior to forming the imaginal eye disc early in the \r\nfinal larval instar, the adult eye precursor cells in Manduca \r\nfunction as fully-differentiated larval epidermal cells.  Members of \r\nthe Pax-6 and Six gene families are thought to play essential early \r\nroles in eye development of all animals.  Portions of these genes \r\nhave been isolated and their expression will be characterized as the \r\neye disc is being formed.  A combination of in vivo and in vitro \r\nstudies will be done to follow gene expression as the larval \r\nepidermal program is turned off and the adult eye developmental \r\nprogram is activated.  A central goal of these studies will be to \r\nestablish the regulation of these events by the hormones that control \r\ninsect metamorphosis, juvenile hormone and ecdysteroid.\r\n\t\r\nScientists and nonscientists of all ages and backgrounds find \r\ninsect metamorphosis a particularly appealing issue.  This attracts \r\nundergraduates from a variety of backgrounds to participate in the \r\nresearch program.  Undergraduates as well as graduate students will \r\nbe integral participants and it is anticipated that they will be \r\ncoauthors on primary research papers.  The proposed studies are \r\nexpected to significantly broaden our understanding of the regulation \r\nof insect metamorphosis and the findings will be communicated to the \r\ngeneral public as well as the scientific community\r\n\r\n\r\n",
