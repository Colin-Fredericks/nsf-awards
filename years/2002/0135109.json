 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Daniel Chiu of the University of Washington has received a CAREER award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to investigate the effects of constrained space on enzyme kinetics.  Single molecule spectroscopy will be utilized to examine enzymes such as beta-galactosidase acting on fluorophores contained in 100 nm synthetic vesicles and designed planar supported bilayers in nanochannels. Electroporation and microfluidics will be used for manipulation of vesicles and single enzymes.  The studies will ascertain whether the surface charge and hydrophobicity associated with cellular nanoenvironments can exert significant influence on the activity of proteins.  These studies will lead to a better understanding of cellular functioning and compartmentalization.  The PI will offer a new graduate course covering topics in microfabrication, fluid mechanics, Fourier optics and bioanalytical methods, and also will use web-based technologies extensively to assist in the General Chemistry courses.  \r\n\r\nMost protein reaction studies are carried out in solutions in beakers, and any effects of the cell surfaces are lost.  The advent of single molecule spectroscopy makes possible the study of single enzyme molecules inside tiny channels or vesicles, mimicking the enclosed ultrasmall spaces found in cells.  Differences from molecule to molecule have shown up in previous studies, and these can be significant.   The effects of the walls and limited spaces on the biochemical reactions can then be studied.  Students engaged in the technologies used in this research and in the graduate course can transfer the knowledge to many efforts such as lab-on-a-chip and sensors.\r\n\r\n",
