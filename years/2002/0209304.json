 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oceanic thermohaline circulation is strongly affected by localized\r\ndense-water formation in high-latitude oceans. Such dense water masses\r\nare released into the large-scale circulation in the form of ocean bottom\r\ndensity currents mostly from localized regions (e.g., Denmark Strait,\r\nStrait of Gibraltar for the Mediterranean overflow, Bab el Mandep Strait\r\nfor the Red Sea overflow). Because of the small space and time scales\r\nrequired to resolve their dynamics, such density currents form the\r\n``bottle neck'' of the thermohaline circulation investigation. Despite their\r\nimportance, we have a limited understanding of the dynamics of bottom\r\ndensity currents, and at present, the oceanic density currents are poorly\r\nrepresented in global climate simulations. The main goal of this proposal\r\nis to enhance the understanding of the dynamics of ocean bottom density\r\ncurrents from laboratory scale, to geophysical scale, through three-dimensional,\r\nnonhydrostatic numerical simulations. The investigators accomplish this\r\nin three stages. First, benchmark a parallel high-order spectral element\r\nNavier-Stokes solver, Nek5000, by reproducing existing laboratory results\r\nof bottom density currents by direct numerical simulations. Second,\r\nexplore dynamics for which there are few or no laboratory results, in\r\nparticular dynamics of bottom density currents protruding into a stratified\r\nfluid, and in a rotating environment. Third, bridge the gap between\r\nlaboratory scale and geophysical scale by using large eddy simulations.\r\nGeophysical scale calculations are configured for the Red Sea overflow,\r\nand confirmed with data from the Red Sea Overflow Experiment. Various\r\nmetrics are used to quantify density current dynamics.\r\n\r\nVariation of solar heating with latitude, and other factors, drive the\r\nso-called ``thermohaline'' circulation in the ocean, which is closely\r\nlinked to the role that the ocean plays in climate dynamics. This complex\r\ngeophysical problem, with its range of scales, physical, mathematical and\r\ncomputational constraints can only be approached through an orchestrated\r\neffort involving cross-disciplinary expertise. The investigators conduct\r\nphysically-guided numerical simulations, quantify dynamical behavior of\r\nocean density currents, and describe the impact of density currents on\r\nthe climate. The investigators integrate this research project with\r\neducation of three graduate students and contribute to the training of\r\nUS technical workforce for the 21st century. This research project\r\nenhances the scientific understanding of oceanic density currents, and\r\nhelps improve the representation of ocean density currents in global\r\nclimate simulations and contribute to the climate change research.",
