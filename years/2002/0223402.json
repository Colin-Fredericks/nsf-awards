 "awd_abstract_narration": "A contact center is a collection of resources providing an interface \r\nbetween a service provider and its customers. The classical contact center \r\nis a call center, containing a collection of service representatives (reps) \r\nwho talk to customers over the telephone. In a call center, the service reps \r\nare supported by quite elaborate information-and-communication-\r\ntechnology (ICT) equipment, such as a private branch exchange (PBX), an \r\ninteractive voice response (IVR) unit, an automatic call distributor (ACD), \r\na personal computer (PC) and assorted databases. With the rapid growth of \r\ne-commerce, contact between the service provider and its customers is \r\noften made via e-mail or the Internet instead of by telephone.  \r\n\r\nThe design and management of contact centers is important, and worthy of \r\nresearch, because contact centers comprise a large, growing part of the \r\neconomy and because they are quite complicated. Classic call centers are \r\ncomplicated because there are often many types of calls, requiring \r\ndifferent service skills, such as knowledge of different languages and \r\nknowledge of different special promotions. The ACD is able to respond \r\nthrough skill-based routing, but there remains an opportunity to determine \r\nbetter routing algorithms and more effective methods for staffing. The \r\ndifficulties are largely due to uncertainty about future arrivals of service \r\nrequests of various kinds and the time and resources that will be required \r\nto respond to those requests.\r\n\r\nGiven that contact with customers no longer need be by telephone, it is \r\nnecessary to consider the other media. When service reps perform several \r\ndifferent kinds of work, there is a need to allocate effort to the different \r\ntasks, which presents opportunities for improved efficiency if some of the \r\nwork can be postponed. Multimedia also lead to more complicated contact \r\nexperiences.  For example, customers might alternate between periods of \r\ninteraction with service reps and periods of browsing on the Internet.  \r\n\r\nThis project aims to respond to these challenges by conducting exploratory \r\nresearch on stochastic (probability) models of contact centers, aiming to \r\nuncover fundamental principles and develop performance-analysis tools \r\nthat will make it possible to improve the design and management of \r\ncontact centers. Effort will be made to find conditions for resource pooling \r\nin contact centers, where the efficiency of a large single-skill center is \r\nachieved in a multi-skilled center with minimal flexibility. Staffing will be \r\nstudied in each of three important time scales: real-time, short-term and \r\nlong-term. Effort will be made to understand the contribution of different \r\nsources of uncertainty: model uncertainty, parameter uncertainty and \r\nprocess uncertainty.\r\n",
