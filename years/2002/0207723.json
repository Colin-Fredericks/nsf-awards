 "awd_abstract_narration": "The failure of large groups of students to perform to their potential.such as females in \r\nmath, or African Americans across a variety of academic disciplines.is one of the great \r\ntragedies in our educational system. The significance of this problem has inspired numerous \r\ninvestigations of its scope, nature, and potential causes. A recent breakthrough points to the \r\npower that social context can have in creating, perpetuating, or eliminating the underperformance \r\nthat has hindered these groups. Steele, Aronson, Spencer, and their colleagues have demonstrated \r\nthe crucial role of stereotype threat, a situational phenomenon that occurs when individuals who \r\nare targets of stereotypes alleging intellectual inferiority are reminded of the possibility of \r\nconfirming these stereotypes (e.g., Spencer, Steele, & Quinn, 1999; Steele, 1997).  For example, \r\nSpencer et al. (1999) showed that high-achieving female college students performed significantly \r\nworse than males on a standardized math test when the stereotype about their math ability was \r\nmade salient (.Males have performed better than females on this test in the past..). However, this \r\ngender gap was eliminated simply by changing the words used for introducing the test (.Males \r\nand females have performed equally well on this test in the past..).  A counterintuitive finding is \r\nthat only individuals who are highly identified with success and achievement in given \r\nstereotyped domains are the ones who show deficits under threat, in contrast to stigmatized \r\nindividuals who are not achievement oriented in these domains (Steele, 1997). Thus, it is the \r\npeople in the vanguard of their group who are the most vulnerable to situations in which \r\nstereotypes about their ability become salient. The detrimental effects of stereotype threat extend \r\nto African Americans (e.g., Steele & Aronson, 1995), Latinos (e.g., Aronson & Salinas, 1997), \r\nand students of low socioeconomic status (e.g., Croizet & Claire, 1998), who are concerned with \r\nacademic success. \r\nWe hypothesize that the priming of a stereotype results in heightened physiological \r\narousal. According to the classic Yerkes-Dodson (1908) law of physiological arousal, \r\nperformance is optimal at intermediate levels of arousal and decreases when arousal is either low \r\nor high, resulting in an inverted-U shaped function.  More recent neurophysiological research has \r\ncorroborated and expanded on the classic findings of the Yerkes-Dodson law in animals and in \r\nhumans.  For example, Lupien and McEwen (1997) provided evidence for an inverted-U shape \r\nrelationship between the level of the corticosteroid, cortisol, and cognitive processes in a variety \r\nof animal and human studies. We hypothesize that high-achieving individuals in stigmatized \r\ndomains approach a problem-solving task in the given domains with an optimal level of arousal \r\nfor performing well. Stereotype threat may interfere with these individuals. performance by \r\nleading to arousal that exceeds an optimal level, causing performance deficits.  By trying to \r\nuncover the role of physiological arousal in mediating stereotype threat and the cognitive nature \r\nof the resultant deficits, we are hoping to contribute to understanding the theoretical \r\nunderpinnings of stereotype threat as well as to help stigmatized high-achieving students to \r\novercome its effects. In the psychometric literature, Gallagher (1992, 1998) has shown that \r\nfemales performed more poorly than males on math-SAT problems that required the use of \r\nmeaningful mental short cuts and estimation (versus problems that required standard calculation).  \r\nThere is reason to believe that cortisol reactivity may be implicated in defaulting to rote \r\nalgorithmic versus meaningful problem solving (Forget, Lacroix, Somma, & Cohen, 2000).  We \r\nwill test interventions for combating stereotype threat by reducing arousal, improving the use of \r\nmeaningful problem-solving strategies, and creating a practice of self-affirmation. In sum, the \r\nproposed research is designed to examine: (1) the role of physiological arousal as a mediator of \r\nstereotype threat; (2) whether reasoning becomes more algorithmic and less meaningful under \r\nstereotype threat; and (3) ways in which the detrimental effects of stereotype threat can be \r\nmitigated or eliminated.",
