 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of synthetic methodology using the allenic Pauson-Khand reaction to prepare cross-conjugated trienes via a formal Alder-ene reaction.  The scope of the reaction will be determined and the resulting information will be used to guide the synthesis of complex molecules having interesting biological properties.  The research will also lead to a better understanding of transition metal catalyzed carbon-carbon bond forming reactions.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kay M. Brummond of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Brummond will focus her efforts on the use of transition metals for the development of new strategies for the construction of molecularly complex and biologically relevant compounds.  Carbon-carbon bond forming reactions with an emphasis on the allene functional group will be emphasized. The methodology has potential impact for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries and the project is an excellent vehicle for the training of graduate students.",
