 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award is in partial support of the Gordon Conference on Sensory Transduction in Microorganisms to be held Jan 13 - Jan 18, 2002 at the Ventura Beach Hotel in Ventura, CA. \r\n\r\nThis meeting provides a unique opportunity for cross fertilization of cutting edge research in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The isolated, informal atmosphere characteristic of the Gordon Conference format is important for providing the opportunities for generating novel concepts. It is anticipated that there will be around 150 attendees from the United States and abroad to discuss the latest developments and ideas regarding the molecular mechanisms of  signal transduction in unicellular microorganisms. The species covered will include bacteria, yeast, slime molds and ciliates, as well as selected examples of speicalized cell types from higher organisms (e.g., pollen tubes, neutrophils) where sensory transduction mechanisms are key to functionality.  There will be 9 formal sessions, each consisting of an introduction by a leading researcher, 4 - 5 major presentations, and 2 - 3 'minitalks' that provide special opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows to present poster data. The selection criteria for invited speakers (and participants) include expertise relevant to the meeting topics, gender balance, minority representation, and promise as a future scientific leader.  The sessions will be integrated across species and explore fundamental topics such as receptor structure and function, transmembrane signaling, intracellular signaling pathways, and coupling to output responses. In addition, sessions on important emerging topics such as microbial biofilms/quorum sensing and genomic/proteomic approaches will aid in directing future research. A combination of poster and oral presentations will enable scientists ranging from graduate students to senior professors to present and discuss their work.\r\n",
