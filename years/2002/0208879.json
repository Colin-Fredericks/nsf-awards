 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research addresses problems in two topics: scheduling of random\r\nprocesses and quantum information theory.  Scheduling problems arise in\r\nmany areas of computer science.  The investigator studies the possibility\r\nof scheduling two random sequences of activities in a way that prevents\r\ncertain conflicts between them.  The methods applied also advance the state\r\nof the art in percolation theory (a fundamental area of probability theory\r\nand statistical physics).  Quantum information theory extends the questions\r\nconcerning conditions and methods for reliable transmission of information\r\nto the setting of quantum mechanics.  It has applications in cryptography,\r\nand also relates to the promising area of quantum computing.  The theory of\r\ndescription complexity has been useful in clarifying concepts of classical\r\ninformation theory.  The research extends description complexity theory in\r\norder to help study the much more complex questions of quantum information\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nIn the scheduling problem, given are the sample paths of two or more random\r\nprocesses (like queues) and some condition telling when these processes\r\n``collide''.  The task is to introduce delays into each of the processes in\r\na way that avoids collisions.  Reformulation introduces a dependent\r\npercolation model with novel convergence properties that aroused much\r\ninterest.  The principal tool of the solution is renormalization, greatly\r\nrefined.  The achieved results are qualitative, leaving much quantitative\r\nwork to be done.  In the application of description complexity to quantum\r\ninformation theory, a universal semicomputable density matrix (``universal\r\nprobability'') is taken as a starting point, and complexity (an operator)\r\nis defined as its negative logarithm.  A number of properties of Kolmogorov\r\ncomplexity and von Neumann entropy extend naturally to the new domain, and\r\nthe quantity reflects appropriately some of the peculiarities of quantum\r\ninformation (no cloning).  The approach taken unifies other approaches made\r\nby several researchers in this direction.\r\n",
