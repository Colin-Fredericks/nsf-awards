 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports enhancement of a synchrotron beamline for magnetics research and education. Development of a new generation of spintronic materials is occurring and there is a need for facilities targeted to characterize the relationship between magnetic properties and electronic and physical structures. This grant addresses this need by leveraging a significant investment in the existing beamline at the LSU CAMD synchrotron light source. The upgrade will provide for improved characterization of magnetic materials using circularly polarized light at energies spanning the L-edges of 3d transition metals. The upgrade consists of two sets of improvements. First, the current plane-grating monochromator beamline will be enhanced to allow for the use of tunable, circularly polarized synchrotron light. Stepper-motor controlled, cooled baffles will be constructed to extract circularly polarized light from the upper and lower portions of the orbit. The beamline was designed to accommodate two gratings, and a new, 300 - 1200 eV, grating will be installed to extend the current photon energy range. Finally, a triple-reflection polarizer will be installed beyond the last optical element in the beamline to measure the degree of light polarization. A second component is a general-purpose user-endstation to provide for sample preparation, evaporators for in-situ film growth, and coils for magnetizing samples. Spectroscopy will include total yield measurements as well as photoemission and provide for inclusion of current LEED and RHEED instrumentation. \r\n\r\nThis enhancement will leverage investments in a group of magnetic materials researchers from Louisiana, Nebraska, Alabama's NSF-MINT Center, and Illinois and provide for a simple but reliable method to characterize a broad range of magnetic materials. The access provided by the location of this light source, located in an underserved region of the country, serves the needs of researche\r\n",
