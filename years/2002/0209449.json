While a new QuBIC program has been announced in he EIA division of CISE,\r\nthere is arguably a need for a focused program on quantum information processing with a direct\r\nfocus on he computer science aspects of he research. The C-CR division of CISE would be the\r\nnatural location for such a program on \"Quantum Communications, Cryptography and Coding.\"\r\nTo gauge the need and plan what migh be the scientific coverage and research agenda for such\r\na potential program,we plan to bring several of he leading researchers together for a planning\r\nworkshop.This workshop will lead to a five-to ten-page report that will give a detailed assessment\r\nof the need for a new C-CR program and give a descrip ion of he research areas ha such a program\r\nshould focus on. By having a C-CR program on \"Quantum Communications, Cryptography and\r\nCoding,\" NSF would be able to focus its efforts on he computer science aspects of quanum\r\ninformation processing and greatly enhance its ability o make sure he United States keeps its\r\nleading role in his important area. This workshop and report will be the first important step in\r\nplanning such a program.",
