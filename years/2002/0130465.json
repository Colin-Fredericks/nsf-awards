Bush, MIT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to perform research in three areas of fluid mechanics: free surface flows, geophysical mixing, and sedimentation in stratified fluids.  The free surface flow consists of experimental and analytical study of Marangoni convection in thin films and fluid polygons. The geophysical mixing forced by plumes and gravity currents will be studied by detailed experiments.  The physical processes involved in the sedimentation in stratified fluids will be studied by experimental and analytical means.  The education plan is aimed to bring direct experimental experience in fluid dynamics research to Mathematics undergraduate and graduate students in MIT and to high school students and teachers.  The PI has been supervising undergraduates in the design and construction of laboratory experiments for educational and research purposes. And such activities will continue.  The PI will also participate in two of the MIT's high school outreach programs.  One is the Science and Engineering Program for Teachers, the other is to involve promising high school students in summer research program.\r\n",
