 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n\tSpatial heterogeneity and movement behavior can greatly influence predator-prey population dynamics.  Much progress has been made in understanding the consequences of spatial structure and exploiter behavior using experiments and models.  However, despite overwhelming experimental evidence that many prey modify their behavior in the face of predation risk, few models include this important feature.  Monarch butterfly larvae exist in a system that is well suited to exploring the effects of both predator and prey behavior in a spatially heterogeneous landscape.  Experiments will be performed involving monarch caterpillars and predatory wasps that will reveal the ability of predators to generate positive spatial covariance with prey.  Similarly, the ability of prey to generate negative covariance with predators will be measured.   Computer simulations and mathematical models will then be built that use this information in order to explore the consequences of incremental changes in spatial structure and predator and prey behavior (e.g., movement rate and distance).  Because many species migrate (e.g., birds, fish, ungulates, and monarch butterflies) or immigrate (e.g., corn ear worms and other crop pests) into patchy habitats, the focus is on the consequences of these important components of biological systems to single season dynamics.\t\r\n",
