 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThis proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and\r\nEngineering Initiative, Program Solicitation NSF 01-157, in the NER\r\ncategory.  The proposal focuses on the development and characterization of\r\none unique class of metal-semiconductor heterostructures, which potentially\r\nwill result in production of a spin injector.  Specifically, problems exist\r\nin characterizing the nature of spin transport and scattering through the\r\ninterfaces of nanomagnetic and spintronic materials.  As one considers\r\nvarious potential hybrid structures, the need to be able to probe the\r\nspin-dependent transmission properties of the interfaces between\r\nsemiconductors, ferromagnets, non-magnetic metals, and insulators becomes\r\ncritical.\r\n\r\nOur objective is to fabricate and characterize a structure that will allow\r\none to interrogate the spin-dependent transmission properties by providing\r\nan easily-controlled source of spin-polarized electrons.  The device uses\r\ncircularly-polarized light to excite spin-dependent carriers within GaAs,\r\nand incorporates a Ag thin-film quantum-well spin-filter to energy select\r\nthe hot electrons.  This source of energy-selectable spin-polarized\r\nelectrons then forms the substrate for the subsequent growth of magnetic\r\nstructures.  We will characterize the degree of spin-polarization by using\r\nthe empty minority states of a Co film grown on this spin injector as an\r\nanalyzer.  While changing the doping of the GaAs provides a coarse energy\r\nselection, judicious choice of the Ag thickness provides a fine-tuning of\r\nthe energy of these electrons via the energetics of the relevant Ag\r\nquantum-well state.\r\n\r\nOur plan to demonstrate, refine, and calibrate this device involves the\r\ngrowth of quantum-stabilized Ag films on cleaved GaAs(110) and on GaAs(100)\r\nwafers.  We have already shown that these Ag films exhibit quantum-well\r\nstates and they will be used to further energy-filter the spin-polarized\r\nelectrons.  To analyze the spin-polarization of these electrons, we will\r\nepitaxially grow Co on the Ag/GaAs structure and calibrate the\r\nspin-dependent transport into the empty minority-state bands, both as a\r\nfunction of the polarization of the electrons from GaAs as well as the\r\nmagnetization of the Co.  Future extensions include the incorporation of an\r\nAl2O3 insulating barrier to test the operation in practical spin-tunneling\r\ndevices.  Throughout the research plan, emphasis will be placed on\r\ncorrelating atomic/morphological and electronic properties of nanophase\r\nheterostructures with ensuing spin-dependent conductance.\r\n\r\nThis project impacts the field of magnetics in several ways.  This\r\nstructure provides an inexpensive tool to interrogate spin transport\r\nproperties and provides an alternative to spin-polarized photoemission and\r\ninverse photoemission.  Once calibrated, it can be used to quickly evaluate\r\nthe spin-dependent transport properties of advanced materials such as\r\nhalf-metallic thin-films.  Furthermore, it can be used in a direct manner\r\nto provide valuable data on the spin-dependent scattering processes that\r\noccur at the interfaces of spintronic structures.\r\n",
