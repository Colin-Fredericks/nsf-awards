 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 0205789\r\nTerndrup\r\n\r\nMany outstanding issues concerning the formation and evolution of the Milky Way require improved\r\nknowledge of the kinematics and chemical enrichment patterns of local metal-poor subdwarfs in the\r\nGalaxy's halo and thick disk, and how these compare to globular cluster stars. Even after several recent\r\nefforts, current samples do not adequately cover the range of metallicities and kinematics seen in globular\r\nclusters, while observations of local metal-poor giants give tantalizing evidence of significant differences\r\nbetween local halo stars and those in globular clusters of the same metallicity.\r\nThis project will improve the observational situation by obtaining accurate and self-consistent\r\nmeasures of temperature, reddening, and composition for a critically selected sample of approximately\r\n150 subdwarfs identified in recent surveys for metal-poor stars. There will also be new theoretical efforts\r\nto explore the dependence of the main-sequence luminosity on detailed stellar chemical composition and\r\non often-neglected physics such as helium diffusion and rotation. This project will also yield valuable\r\ninformation on the kinematics and star formation history of the halo and the metal-poor tail of the thick\r\ndisk, identify samples of subdwarfs that are well matched in abundance patterns and kinematics to\r\nglobular cluster stars, and improve the temperature and abundance scales of globular cluster main\r\nsequences for comparison to spectroscopic determinations on the giant branch. There will also be a\r\nsystematic study of the relative and absolute ages of globular clusters, with a focus on reducing the errors\r\nin the theoretical plane.\r\nImportantly, this project will enable the community to take full advantage of the future FAME and\r\nSIM satellite missions, which will measure accurate parallaxes for the subdwarfs in the sample and\r\nthereby yield the absolute calibration of the main-sequence luminosity for globular clusters and hence\r\ntheir distances. Current distance estimates are only good to 10 - 15%, resulting in age errors of about\r\n30%, insufficient to reliably explore the age spread in the globular cluster system or even set lower limits\r\nto the age of the Universe by comparison with the predictions of stellar evolution theory.\r\n\r\n",
