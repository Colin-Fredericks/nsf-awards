The Workshop will be organised by: Deborah J. Goodings (PI, and Professor at the University of Maryland) and Dr. Ryan Phillips (Senior Key Personnel, and Geotechnical Director and Associate Professor at Memorial University, Canada).  The goal of the Workshop is to educate attendees on the opportunities to integrate physical modelling research as it is conducted into education at the K-12 level, into education at the undergraduate level, and with increasing coverage into graduate level education.  The workshop is relevant to educators with modelling facilities in their home institutions, as well as to those without modelling facilities, and it will provide an excellent and timely opportunity for teachers, academics, and potential employers to consider the role of geotechnical physical modelling in education.  With NSF support, the workshop can be open to any attendee without charge.  In addition, travel subsidies will be provided to senior graduate students and junior faculty from US universities to attend the Workshop, with particular attention to encouraging women and underrepresented minorities to attend.\r\n",
