 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this research project is to understand the fundamental science affecting the nanoscale processing of plastics.  Manufacturing is responsible for control of molecular morphology and geometry.  At the nanoscale, control implies understanding interfacial effects.  While much of the current nanotechnology research has focused on ceramic and metallic materials, there has been relatively little work done on the processing of polymers at the nanoscale.  Yet, because of their low density, high toughness, and versatility, polymers will play an important role in the nanotechnology revolution.   We intend to focus on the effect of polymer properties and process conditions on \"internal\" interfaces between phases in polymer blends and on the \"external\" material/tooling interface.  Applications of this technology include extruded multicomponent thin films for conformable, high-density data or energy storage, injection-molded low-cost calibration standards, and electrospun nanowires and nanotextiles for circuits and selectively permeable membranes.  This research project builds upon our unique strengths in the area of plastics processing, our exceptional contacts with industry and government labs, and our interdisciplinary interactions with faculty in polymer chemistry and the engineering programs at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell (UML).\r\n\r\nThe discoveries made as a part of this research project will be broadly disseminated through support of graduate and undergraduate students and yearly workshops open to industry and academia.  To educate industry and the general public, a series of nanotechnology seminars will be developed in conjunction with UML's highly successful continuing education plastics seminar program.  For the broader audience, through coordination by the UML Institute for NanoScience and Engineering Technology and the College of Engineering, the excitement of nanotechnology and research in general will be conveyed to middle school and high school students and teachers with hands-on demos and activities.",
