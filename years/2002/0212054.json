 "awd_abstract_narration": "0212054\r\nCarson\r\nLTREB\r\nWe have underway a long-term, large-scale experiment that is addressing one of the primary\r\nhypotheses proposed to explain the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests, namely,\r\nthat mammals acting as herbivores, seed predators, and dispersers, are critical determinants of tropical\r\ntree diversity and abundance. This experiment is essentially a community-level test of the Janzen-Connell\r\nHypothesis that predicts that the removal of ground-dwelling mammals will ultimately cause a\r\ndecline in tropical tree diversity. Under this scenario, mammals preferentially prey on the juveniles of\r\ntree species that are abundant and ultimately keep these tree species in check.\r\nThe study system is mature-phase tropical moist forest in central Panama on Barro Colorado\r\nIsland (BCI) and the adjacent mainland (Gigante Peninsula). Since1994, we have monitored the\r\nconsequences of excluding ground-dwelling mammals in 8 large (1355m\r\n2\r\n) fenced exclosures and\r\nadjacent unfenced control plots. Four pairs of treatment and control plots were established on BCI and\r\n4 pairs were located on Gigante in similar mature forest. Prior to initiating any treatments, we\r\ncensused, measured, identified, and tagged all woody plants > 50 cm in height in all plots. In\r\naddition, we quantified newly recruited seedlings in 28 smaller subplots in each large plot. In total,\r\nwe have now followed the fate of more than 60,000 individual seedlings and saplings. Overall, the\r\nexclusion of mammals led to a substantial and sustained increase in seedling density.\r\nThe results of this experiment to date suggest that excluding mammals may significantly\r\nincrease woody species diversity of the seedling layer at least in the short-term (~10 yrs). Thus, our\r\nresults contrast sharply with the community-level predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. We\r\npropose a new conceptual model that suggests that the consequences of the short term removal of\r\nmammals (2-25 yrs) from tropical forests, whether by experimental exclusion or more broadly via\r\nover hunting, will cause first an increase in woody species diversity and thereafter potentially a\r\ndecrease (see Fig. 1). This result will first appear in the seedling layer (1-50 cm in height) and then\r\nmove as a wave through larger size classes. The data to date, however, even after 7-years, remain\r\nequivocal. The short term increase in diversity clearly documented inside exclosure plots may be a\r\ntransient effect of the 1998 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. Specifically, the ENSO event\r\ncaused a severe and extended dry season that increased seedling mortality. Because there was a higher\r\nseedling density inside the exclosures, these sites may have been buffered from the drought. We\r\nbelieve that it is imperative that we continue this experiment and monitor the next phase as the seedling\r\nlayer moves into the small sapling size class. The conservation implications of this work are clear; the\r\noverexploitation of the mammalian fauna in many tropical forest reserves, parks, and fragments may\r\nhave long-term negative consequences for forest diversity that may not become apparent for decades.\r\nIt is only through long-term experiments that we can unequivocally separate out short-term dynamics\r\nfrom long-term forest trajectories.\r\n",
