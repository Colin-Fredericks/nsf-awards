Turner\r\n\r\nAn active area of research in commutative algebra since the \r\n1950s has involved the use of homological methods to \r\ncharacterize Noetherian rings and the homomorphisms between \r\nthem. In the 1960s, simplicial methods were used to enable \r\nhomotopy theory to apply to commutative algebras and develop \r\nricher homological techniques. This project seeks to use \r\nhomotopy theory to characterize (simplicial) commutative \r\nalgebras with a Noetherian property. Part of this effort \r\nwill seek to resolve a conjecture of Quillen on the rigidity \r\nof the homology of commutative algebras and draw deeper \r\nconnections between simplicial methods and methods from \r\ndifferential homological algebra. This project will also \r\nstudy how the cohomology of algebras can serve as host \r\nfor obstructions to realizing a topological space from \r\ngiven algebraic data that functions as the value of a \r\nsuitable homotopy invariant of the putative space. \r\nAttention will be paid to developing methods for computing \r\nsuch obstructions.\r\n\r\nHomotopy theory is a method of studying certain mathematical \r\nobjects and the relations between them from a global \r\nperspective. In the case of geometric objects, certain \r\nalgebraic invariants can be assigned to study and distinguish \r\nbetween homotopy types. Understanding the properties of these \r\nalgebraic structures and how they relate to the geometric \r\nobjects they are associated to are therefore important parts \r\nof this theory.  This project seeks to further the \r\nunderstanding of the homotopy theory of geometric objects \r\nfrom the algebraic perspective. There are two aims to this \r\nproject. The first is to develop further the homotopy theory \r\nof algebras that parallels that of geometric objects. The \r\nsecond aim seeks to make use of the homotopy of algebras \r\nand their various properties to understand the homotopy of \r\nspaces.  This would involve studying the extent to which \r\nalgebraic structures and properties can be lifted to \r\ncorresponding structures and properties for geometric objects. \r\n",
