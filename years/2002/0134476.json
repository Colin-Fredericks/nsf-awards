An entire interdisciplinary program/plan seems to be associated with this proposal. The PI is a very active outstanding young faculty who has a multidisciplinary background, interacts with researchers with various backgrounds and expertise, and is an expert herself on the main experimental techniques to be used within the proposed research activities.\r\nThe research questions address in the research plan are highly relevant and the approaches are novel. The proposed level of characterization of mechanical properties of the implant materials/scaffolding materials is consistent with the current needs of the tissue-engineering field. The results of this investigation may significantly contribute to the advancement in the development of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
