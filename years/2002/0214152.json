 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (SBN) is fairly young (founded 1995), \r\nand expects attendance of around 300 at this sixth Annual Meeting.  The SBN, in its \r\nmeetings and its journal (Hormones & Behavior) uniquely emphasizes multidisciplinary \r\nintegration of cellular and molecular concepts into a functional framework involving the \r\nbrain, behavior, development, evolution and the ecology of social behavior.  This \r\nconcentration linking hormones to many areas of behavior, including both field and \r\nlaboratory approaches, makes this focal meeting different from other meetings in the \r\nfield.  The conference organizers are highly regarded and experienced, the topics are \r\ntimely, and in addition to scientific talks there are particular sessions planned for \r\nstudents and trainees on 'survival skills', 'meet-the-professor' lunches, 'alternative \r\ncareers' and poster sessions with awards expanded to include undergraduate work.   \r\nDissemination of the conference findings will be through a special supplemental issue of \r\nHormones & Behavior.  The SBN meetings strongly emphasize bringing in students \r\n(graduate and undergraduate, representing 1/3 of the total membership) and postdocs \r\nfor interdisciplinary interactions with established investigators.\r\n   The potential impact of this conference is high in the fields of neuroendocrinology and \r\nbehavioral neuroscience, because of the focused discussions shaping future work, the \r\npotential to develop new cross-disciplinary collaborations, and the likely interactions and \r\nintroductions essential to career development of young investigators. Funding from NSF \r\nis important to help students, postdocs, and young researchers attend, and for some \r\ncareer development workshop speakers who are not currently society members.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
