 "awd_abstract_narration": "The symposium will explore the role of law in changes taking place in both post-industrial and industrializing Pacific Rim nations. Papers will be presented at the symposium focusing on cultural, social and economic issues that affect the development of legal institutions and legal doctrine throughout the region. The trend towards globalization stretches the significance of these issues beyond the borders of individual Pacific Rim countries. \"External\" popular culture as well as legal culture comes on the heels of expanded free trade, but existing local cultures resist simple transplantation. Many Pacific Rim nations, whether highly developed or not, are in the midst of important struggles over the place of legal institutions and legality in their responses to globalization. This award supports travel and expenses for approximately twelve scholars from Pacific-Rim nations such as The Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Vietnam, and Thailand to join with social scientists from Japan, Korea, the United States and Canada.  The symposium will be held prior to the 2002 annual meeting of the Law and Society Association in Vancouver.",
