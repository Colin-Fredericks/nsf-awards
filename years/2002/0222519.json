 "awd_abstract_narration": "By their nature, volumetric data sets, such as  CT, MRI and the Visible Human cryosection \r\nimages,  are  not  subject  to  the  same  form  of  visual  inspection and  cognitive  refinement  that \r\nhuman experts apply when viewing and interpreting 2D images. \r\nThe internal cycle of choices made by humans as they  visually survey  an image is disrupted and\r\nforced into an external process where users must adapt to the technical requirements of the\r\nvisualization system. This project proposes to continue research into an immersive visualization\r\nsystem that is a first step toward  creating  a  user  interaction  paradigm  that  more  naturally\r\nallows  users  to  apply  their interpretive  expertise  to  the  visualization  and  segmentation  of\r\nvolumetric  data  sets.  In  this environment, segmentation, the process of isolating discrete structures within a data volume, is performed in parallel with visualization. Users have continuous control of the visualization and segmentation algorithms and can freely exercise their expert\r\ninterpretive knowledge. \r\n \r\nThe current implementation, called the  Immersive Segmentation Environment, emphasizes the \r\ncontrolled application of high computational cost algorithms to local regions of the data volume. \r\nUsing  stereo  graphics,  the  user  is  presented  with  the  illusion that  the  data  volume  occupies \r\nphysical space. The user interacts with the system using a 3D space tracked probe. Visualization \r\nand segmentation algorithms continuously operate on the data volume within a local \r\nneighborhood of the user.s position. This neighborhood corresponds to the user.s visual focus \r\npoint. The algorithms initialize themselves based upon an analysis of the local neighborhood and \r\nheuristics. The system is implemented as a client/server application and consequently allows a \r\nuser  at  a  low-cost  workstation  to  effectively  use  remote computational  resources  to visualize \r\nlarge volumetric data sets. The system implements two main classes of segmentation algorithms. \r\nBoth determine initial algorithm parameters based upon a cluster analysis of the local neighborhood and are characterized by an iterative refinement approach. \r\n \r\nThe proposed research will continue to investigate the capabilities of this unique user interaction \r\nmodel for visualizing, exploring and interpreting volumetric data sets. \r\n\r\nThe research plan contained in this proposal is a natural outgrowth of prior work performed by \r\nthe PI. This ongoing work has had a positive impact on the curriculum, student research projects \r\nand faculty research within the Computer Science department at the UW-La Crosse. \r\n\r\n",
