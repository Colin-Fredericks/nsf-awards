 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation\r\n\r\nThe University of Texas System Alliance for Minority Participation (UT-System\r\nAMP) brings together all nine academic components of The University of Texas System\r\nand ten regional community college partners in an effort to increase the number of under-\r\nrepresented minority students and students from other under-served populations enrolling \r\nin and graduating from baccalaureate programs in science, mathematics, engineering, and \r\ntechnology and entering graduate programs in SMET fields at UT-System universities.\r\nThe activities of the UT-System AMP are supported by partnerships with industry and\r\ngovernment agencies, particularly national laboratories. The educational institutions in \r\nthe Alliance serve a rapidly growing region, where by the decade's end minorities will \r\ncomprise a majority of the population. Prominent among the institutions are those in the\r\nU.S.-Mexico Border regions serving large numbers of Hispanic students and those in \r\nmetropolitan areas serving mainly commuter students,including many minorities. The\r\nUT-System places a high degree of importance, system-wide, on improving retention\r\namong undergraduates and providing enhanced opportunities for these undergraduates \r\nto enter graduate programs in SMET. This proposal also emphasizes the system-wide\r\nsharing of resources to attain these goals.\r\n\r\nIn Phase III, the University of Texas System Alliance for Minority Participation is \r\ncommitted to achieving the following objectives: 1) The UT-System LSAMP universities \r\nwill enroll a minimum of 200 under-represented minority and other under-served student \r\nin their STEM doctoral programs by the fall of 2008, an increase of about 100% over the \r\nfall 2000 baseline and 2) The UT-System AMP universities will continue to work towards\r\nthe Phase II goal of graduating a minimum of 1,374 under-represented minority and other \r\nunder-served students with B.S. degrees in SMET. It is estimated that we will achieve this\r\ngoal by 2006. When achieved, this will represent a 244% increase over 1991-1992 baseline.\r\nLSAMP program activities will focus on three major areas: (1) retention of students who\r\nare STEM majors through the development of strategies at all partner institutions to \r\naddress retention of second year students in SMET; (2) mentoring and career development\r\nopportunities for STEM majors interested in pursuing an advanced degree. Activities will\r\ninclude the development of GRE workshops and career development/mentoring activities at\r\neach partner institution; and (3) a summer research academy where rising junior and senior \r\nstudents will have the opportunity to work in a research laboratory at one of the five\r\ndoctoral-granting institutions in the alliance. Students will receive stipend support, \r\nmentoring and training. The UT-System LSAMP has permanently changing the nature of\r\nSMET higher education in Texas.\r\n\r\nThrough the UT-System LSAMP, the participating universities have raised the \r\nvisibility and increased the awareness of the chancellor, presidents and chief academic \r\nofficers about SMET program outcomes and the status of under-represented minority\r\nstudents. Providing leadership to the UT-System Alliance for Minority Participation will \r\nbe a Governing Board, chaired by Ed Sharpe, Executive Vice Chancellor of The University \r\nof Texas System, which includes presidents, vice-presidents, or provostsof UT-System \r\nmember institutions and participating community colleges as well as a selected number \r\nof experts from industry and the national R&D community. Meeting annually, the Governing\r\nBoard will continue to provide general oversight of the UT-System AMP. The Academic\r\nLeadership Council (ALC), composed of deans, chairs and distinguished faculty are involved\r\nin the implementation of AMP activities at their institution. The ALC meets twice \r\n",
