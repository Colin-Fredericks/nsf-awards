 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, meteorologists and applied mathematicians are\r\ncollaborating to study the \"weak temperature gradient\" (WTG) equations for\r\nlarge-scale tropical atmospheric dynamics.  The WTG equations form a\r\n\"balance model\", or set of singular limit equations, asymptotically valid\r\nin a parameter regime relevant to the tropical atmosphere.  The WTG\r\nequations are designed to facilitate study of key aspects of the tropical\r\nclimate problem, such as the large-scale dynamical roles of moist\r\nconvection and other diabatic processes.  This focus is achieved by\r\neliminating other processes which can be present in solutions to the\r\nprimitive equations, such as gravity waves and baroclinic instability, in\r\nthe same way as gravity waves are eliminated in extratropical balance\r\nmodels  such as the quasi-geostrophic equations.  One goal of this project\r\nis to develop new mathematics by studying the WTG equations' properties.\r\nAnother goal is to solve the equations under geometries, boundary\r\nconditions and forcings which represent idealizations of those relevant to\r\nthe real earth's climate, and then to study the sensitivity of the\r\nsolutions to key parameters.  Achievement of these goals is expected to\r\nlead to deeper understanding of both the real climate and more complex\r\nmathematical models of it, such as general circulation models (GCMs).\r\n\r\nThe earth's climate system is notoriously complex.  Many different\r\nphysical processes interact in a tangled web of feedbacks to produce the\r\ndynamic and variable climate we observe.  Unlike a laboratory science,\r\nmeteorology and oceanography are hindered by the impossibility of\r\ncontrolled experiments which might allow the key mechanisms to be\r\nconclusively revealed.  We are stuck with the one planet on which we live\r\nand cannot change its basic properties to see what happens.  Consequently,\r\nthe science proceeds by observation and by a heavy reliance on numerical\r\nsimulation with GCMs, which are sophisticated computer programs run on the\r\nmost powerful computers available.  These simulations offer the\r\npossibility of a certain kind of controlled climate experiments:  we can\r\ncreate virtual earths on the computer, control their properties, and\r\nobserve their behavior with precision.  One obvious limitation of this\r\napproach is that the models are imperfect representations of reality.  A\r\nless obvious, but equally important problem is the models' complexity,\r\nwhich both limits the number and type of simulations which can be done and\r\nrenders the results nearly as difficult to understand as the real climate\r\nsystem.  Because of these problems, there is a need to supplement\r\nobservational and GCM studies with theoretical studies using models that\r\nare simpler than GCMs - if not simple enough to allow solution with pencil\r\nand paper, then at least using very simple computer programs that run\r\nquickly on a PC.  To the extent that these simpler models have key\r\nfeatures in common with the real system, their simplicity allows a deeper\r\nlevel of understanding of the basic dynamics of climate and leads to\r\nexplicit hypotheses that can be tested against observations and GCM\r\nsimulations.  This project  harnesses the physical insight of climate\r\nscientists and the sophisticated methods of applied mathematicians to\r\ndevelop and study simple models designed specifically to represent the\r\ntropical atmospheric component of the earth's climate system.\r\n",
