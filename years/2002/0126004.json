 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nMuch of Earth's continental crust comprises Precambrian through Cenozoic orogens,\r\nwhere preexisting rocks have been variably modified by metamorphism and deformation. Owing\r\nto the association between collisional tectonic events and mountain building, this long record of\r\norogenesis provides the most accessible means of reconstructing paleotectonic settings and\r\nevents that have shaped our planet. Although the Appalachian mountains are widely used to\r\nillustrate Earth's tectonic evolution and associated orogenesis, collisional processes and events\r\nthat drove the Ordovician Taconian orogeny in the Quebec Maine segment of the northern\r\nAppalachians remain enigmatic. Deformational features in this region cannot be satisfactorily\r\nrelated to a specific convergent setting or collisional event(s) because the nature of the eastern\r\n(present coordinates) Laurentian margin during the early Paleozoic is poorly understood.\r\nInterpretations are divided as to whether the orogeny was caused by ophiolite emplacement,\r\nisland-arc collision, or microcontinent collision. Because the Taconian orogeny initiated the\r\nAppalachian mountain-building cycle, understanding its architecture and evolution is essential\r\nfor understanding the Appalachians as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to investigate structural, metamorphic, and temporal relationships among the\r\nrock units that make up the Chain Lakes massif and Boil Mountain ophiolite in order to test\r\ncompeting models and hypotheses for the Taconian orogeny in the northern Appalachians. Their\r\nmultidisciplinary approach incorporates mapping, structural, microstructural, metamorphic, and\r\ngeochronological studies. Integrating field and laboratory studies, the PI will establish: (a) the\r\nrelative and absolute timing of metamorphic and deformational events within the Chain Lakes\r\nmassif, (b) the crystallization age of the mafic portion of the Boil Mountain ophiolite, (c) the age\r\nand kinematics of ophiolite emplacement, (d) whether mafic volcanic rocks near the ophiolite\r\nrepresent a genetic part of the ophiolite, and (e) the age of possibly rift-related mafic dikes in the\r\nChain Lakes massif. The geochronology portion of the project will include in-situ U-Pb analyses\r\nof monazite to provide high temporal resolution for metamorphic events, small-number\r\nmultigrain U-Pb analyses of zircon or baddeleyite from gabbro to determine the crystallization\r\nage of the ophiolite, U-Pb analyses of zircon to establish the age of the dikes, and laser step-\r\nheating 40 Ar- 39 Ar analysis of muscovite to determine the minimum ophiolite emplacement age.\r\nThe PI will compare his results with existing interpretations of the Thetford Mines ophiolite and\r\noverlying units in southern Quebec, the Maquereau Dome in the Gaspe Peninsula, and the\r\nDashwoods Subzone in Newfoundland in order to evaluate temporal and spatial relationships\r\namong these potentially correlative units. Because the extents and boundaries of terranes are\r\nfundamental components of the tectonic models, testing the terrane relationships will test the\r\nmodels. The work will clarify the nature of the Taconian orogeny in the northern Appalachians,\r\nand will bear on conceptual models describing Iapetan paleogeographic reconstruction and\r\ncollisional accretionary processes.",
