 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nPathogens and parasites are a major component of biological diversity, and have\r\nimportant impacts on natural populations. A central question in host-parasite ecology concerns\r\nwhat features of host behavior, life history, and environment best explain the diversity and\r\nevolution of infectious diseases. Significant theoretical progress has advanced our understanding\r\nof factors that influence infectious disease dynamics within populations, yet relatively few\r\nstudies have analyzed ecological variables that underlie observed variation in pathogen diversity\r\nand characteristics. This project will examine patterns of parasite diversity across three\r\nmammalian orders to explicitly test predictions derived from both epidemiological models and\r\nisland biogeography theory. Major questions this project will address include (1) What are the\r\nkey ecological variables that determine variation in the types and diversity of parasites in wild\r\nmammal populations? (2) How do parasite transmission mode and the degree of specificity\r\ndepend on host ecology? (3) Does evolutionary diversification of hosts correlate with patterns of\r\nparasite species richness? (4) Does knowledge of parasite diversity have important implications\r\nfor wildlife conservation?\r\nEstablishing a large database on the pathogens and parasites infecting wild mammals is\r\ncritical to conducting comprehensive analyses and represents a major goal of this project. The\r\ninvestigators have recently assembled a large database on the pathogens and parasites of\r\nprimates and will extend this effort to two other well-studied groups - carnivores and ungulates.\r\nThese databases capture (i) ecological, behavioral and life history traits relevant to theoretical\r\nmodels of disease spread, (ii) records of parasites and pathogens recovered from wild\r\npopulations, (iii) data on parasite transmission mode and degree of host specificity, and (iv)\r\nphylogenetic information on the hosts. Database development requires an immense effort and\r\nfollowing this study all data will be made freely available over the World Wide Web so that\r\nother scientists can access the fruits of this labor.\r\nUnderstanding factors that underlie parasite diversity and characteristics is vital to\r\nmanaging vulnerable wildlife populations and mitigating threats to human health. This study\r\nextends the scope of previous host-parasite comparative work by examining a rich diversity of\r\nboth micro- and macroparasites, including information on parasite characteristics, and by\r\nassessing phylogenetic information involving tree topology, branch lengths and rates of host\r\ndiversification. Analytical comparative methods will control for sampling effort, test multiple\r\nvariables simultaneously, and will assess whether host and parasite traits are correlated with\r\nphylogeny. A synthetic approach that links ecology, parasitology, epidemiology, and\r\nphylogenetic comparative methods is crucial for developing a broad conceptual framework to\r\nexplain parasite diversity and characteristics in relation to host features. To advance these goals,\r\nthe investigators will organize three annual workshops composed of experts from each of these\r\ndisciplines to refine predictions for comparative research, explore methods for examining\r\necological and evolutionary interactions in host-parasite assemblages, and chart future directions\r\nfor both theoretical and empirical work.",
