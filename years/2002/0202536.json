Here\r\nfor example we consider isospectral problems: to what extent must spaces\r\nwith the same spectra (e.g. eigenvalues of the Laplace Beltrami\r\noperator, or Lengths of closed geodesics) be isometric.  This also\r\nincludes questions about metric rigidity induced by conjugacy of\r\ngeodesic flows, as well as inverse scattering problems.  The other theme\r\nconsiders infinite groups G acting cocompactly on nonpositively curved\r\nspaces H (in the sense of Alexandrov).  The project is to study the\r\nrelationship between the geometry of H and the induced action of G on\r\nthe ideal boundary of H.  This can be considered an aspect of geometric\r\ngroup theory and is partially motivated by some questions of Gromov.  \r\nAs well as these two major themes the proposal concerns the authors\r\ncontinuing work on various isoperimetric inequalities.  These groups show up as \r\nsymmetries of Hadamard spaces H (which include spaces of nonpositive curvature.)   \r\n\r\n\r\nThe first theme of the project concerns the question of whether a space\r\ncan be determined by a certain set of data.  One part of this relates to\r\nquestions of remote sensing.  For example: can you determine the density\r\nof an object (say a persons body or the moon) from measurements taken\r\n\"from the outside\"?  The CAT scan is a practical example where one\r\ndetermines the mass density (or more accurately the absorption\r\ncoefficient) of an object from measurements of the total mass along\r\nstraight lines.  An alternative set of measurements is the set of times\r\nit takes for sound to travel between any two points on the boundary\r\n(this is a special case of the boundary rigidity question dealt with in\r\nthe proposal).  The thrust of the proposed study is to determine under\r\nwhich circumstances certain sets of data (e.g. eigenvalues, lengths of\r\nclosed geodesics, distances between boundary points) are sufficient to\r\ncompletely determine the geometry of the spaces in question. Groups show up \r\nnaturally as symmetries of various spaces.  The second theme of this project \r\nconcerns the study a certain class of infinite groups. \r\n",
