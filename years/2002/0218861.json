 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Genesis Group of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory is working\r\non a computational theory of human intelligence.  Their work is grounded in\r\ntwo key assumptions: first, that humans think with their language, vision,\r\nand motor systems, and their interaction; and second that humans can think\r\nabstractly because they can build on a foundation of thinking about concrete\r\nevents in the physical world.\r\n\r\nTheir plan includes the development of a testbed that features paths,\r\nagents, causes, both language and visual inputs and outputs, complex state\r\ntransitions, and support for abstract reasoning in abstract worlds.\r\n\r\nThey propose to exploit both symbolic and nonsymbolic representations.  The\r\nsymbolic representations will include a representation for describing the\r\nmovement of animals and artifacts along trajectories and a representation\r\nfor describing state transitions in terms of a vocabulary of qualitative\r\nchanges.  The nonsymbolic representations will include memory traces lying\r\nclose to experienced sensory inputs.\r\n\r\nThe Genesis Group expects success to lead not only to a better\r\nunderstanding of natural intelligence buy also, in the long term, to\r\nimportant practical results, such as computer applications with genuine\r\ncommonsense and educational applications that exploit an understanding of\r\nhow best to engage human linguistic and visual problem solving faculties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
