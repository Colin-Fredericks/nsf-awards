The purpose of the symposium is three fold: (1) to bring together experts from the public and private sectors to discuss by-product optimization through application of state-of-the-art benign manufacturing, advanced environmental technologies and eco-industrial processes; (2) to identify cutting-edge environmental technologies and benign manufacturing processes that convert wastes into value-added products that will facilitate new job creation and business development and (3) to facilitate inter-disciplinary dialogue and information sharing leading to the development of a research agenda that focuses on increasing industry's competitiveness in the global market.\r\nThe Center for Economic Development will post papers and presentations from the Symposium on its website.  In addition, the National Association of Management and Technical Assistance Center (NAMTAC) will assist by disseminating findings from the Symposium to a diverse group of member organizations, including business, economic development and technical assistance providers.\r\nCo-Chairs of this symposium are Dr. Tridib Banerjee, Professor at the School of Policy, Planning and Development and Dr, Mansour Rahimi, Associate Professor at the School of Engineering, both at USC. ***\r\n",
