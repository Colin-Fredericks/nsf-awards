 "awd_abstract_narration": "THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DISASTER ASSISTANCE IN NEW YORK IN THE AFTERMATH OF SEPTEMBER 11: THE DYNAMICS OF MULTIORGANIZATIONAL RESPONSE\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center Towers in New York City, a massive mobilization of disaster assistance and relief efforts took place.  These relief efforts raise a number of questions that have both practical and theoretical importance particularly with regard to the organizational and administrative processes employed by the governmental agencies, non-profit charities, and private sector groups involved in delivering disaster assistance.\r\nThe principal objective of this research is to develop a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of the disaster assistance process, particularly as it relates to programs that benefit individuals and households.  Data will be obtained through a brief questionnaire-type survey that will be administered to representatives of each of the more than 200 private or non-profit agencies and the administrators of the more than 50 federal and state run assistance programs involved in the disaster relief effort in New York.  Follow up interviews will be conducted with selected officials.  We will seek to identify and code the types of assistance offered, the number of victims who sought assistance and the number of recipients who ultimately received aid, and the costs associated with providing this assistance, among other information.   \r\n\r\nWe believe that this line of research will provide a more detailed understanding of the inter-organizational dynamics associated with disaster recovery and will provide a starting point for more in-depth analysis of the political and organizational aspects of large-scale victim assistance following a disaster.   On a theoretical level, this research will contribute to our understanding of patterns of behavior in multi-organizational systems in disaster settings-questions of long-standing interest in both the sociological and public administration literatures.  In addition, it will provide a foundation for better understanding of the interplay between those providing and those receiving disaster assistance.  This research will also yield benefits to policy makers (both inside and outside of government) and disaster assistance program administrators.  The disaster in New York City provides an opportunity to examine the rationale underpinning the existing disaster relief system and to evaluate how the system was implemented in this particular case.  This information can then be incorporated into future disaster recovery plans.\r\n",
