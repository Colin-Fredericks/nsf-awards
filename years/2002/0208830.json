 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop advanced digital signal processing algorithms for specific\r\ncoherent imaging systems where complex signals are spatially and temporally sampled,\r\nand subsequently processed by computers.Modeling of the physics of data acquisition\r\nwill play a crucial role throughout the signal processing chain,from preprocessing at the\r\nsensor level to adaptive processing/beamforming and final image formation.The focal\r\nresearch areas will involve ultra wide band medical ultrasound imaging,and\r\nelectromagnetic wave imaging in millimeter spectral bands.Millimeter electromagnetic\r\nwave imaging could have important anti-terrorism applications such as detection of\r\nplastic guns and knives in human body scanning at airports,and surveillance of suspected\r\nsafe houses,storage areas,and cargos by imaging through walls or crates.\r\nIn the medical ultrasound area,the research will involve the following specific topics:(1)\r\noptimal transmit/receive beam forming for near field dynamic focusing;(2)multiple foci\r\nB scan imaging for increasing scan rates;(3).theoretical performance bounds associated\r\nwith combined random processes of random scatterers and noise.and (4),phase\r\naberration correction algorithms for 3-D systems including new methods for dealing with\r\ndispersed aberrators such as fat lobules,membranes,etc.,that can diffract and refract the\r\nultrasound beams.The research in electromagnetic coherent imaging will involve:\r\nsynergistic adaptation of the statistical ultrasound autofocusing/phase aberration\r\ncorrection concepts to the electromagnetic spectrum;development of millimeter wa e\r\nimaging algorithms for surveillance functions such as rapid body scanning and imaging\r\nthrough thin dry medium such as wood,plaster board or stone.The research in all the\r\ncoherent modalities will involve:development of practical fast converging computer\r\nimplementations of reconstruction algorithms;extensive simulations,and performance\r\nanalyses of the new models and algorithms.",
