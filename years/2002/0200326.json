Sverak\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\n   In this proposal we suggest to study open problems in regularity\r\ntheory of the following partial differential equations:\r\n1. strongly elliptic systems arising as Euler-Lagrange equations\r\n   for multiple integrals in the Calculus of Variations;\r\n2. three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and some related\r\n   model equations; and\r\n3. Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equations and Landau-Lifschitz equations.\r\nThe regularity theory for these equations is mainly governed by two\r\nfactors: the smoothing properties of the linearized operator,\r\nand the tendency of the non-linear part to produce singularities.\r\nIn all the cases above there is a certain critical dimension\r\nbelow which (and, in many cases, at which) the natural energy\r\nestimates for the equations together with smoothing properties of the linearized operator\r\nare sufficient to guarantee regularity of solutions.  For most\r\nof the equations above the critical dimension is two. The situation\r\nis more complicated above the critical dimension, when the specifics\r\nof each equation come much more into play, and not many results\r\nare known. The research will concentrate on problems in this\r\nrelatively unmapped area.\r\n\r\n   The study of regularity theory for Partial Differential Equations\r\n(PDE) is usually motivated by the following factors:\r\n(1) A good regularity theory can serve as an important check that\r\n    a PDE is appropriate for modeling a given phenomena.\r\n(2) The more information we have about regularity of solutions of\r\n    a given PDE, the better chance we have to  design a good numerical\r\n    method for calculating its solutions on a computer. It is no\r\n    coincidence that the equations for which we can calculate solutions accurately are more or less exactly those for which we have a good regularity theory. (Confirming that \"There is nothing quite so practical as a good theory\".)  Roughly speaking, the more we know about solutions, the easier it is the avoid some of the many pitfalls into which numerical simulations can fall.\r\nThe work suggested in this proposal will address basic open problems\r\nin regularity theory for important classes of equations with strong\r\nnon-linearities. Many of these equations (such as the\r\nNavier-Stokes equations, or the Landau-Lifschitz equations) are of\r\nconsiderable practical interest.\r\n\r\n***************************************\r\n\r\n",
