 "awd_abstract_narration": "0136973 Fine\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project to estimate the uncertainties for individual tracer ages, and to associate differences in the magnitude of these uncertainties with known circulation phenomena. The focus is on thermocline and intermediate water masses, using World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) chlorofluorocarbon and tritium/helium-3 data that have recently become available. Tracer ages are a measure of the ocean's ability to transport atmospheric constituents into the interior. Isopycnal mixing rates will be calculated for regions of the subtropical gyres where isopycnal mixing can significantly alter tracer ages. Errors  in  tracer  ages  arise from  analytical,  source  function,  and  other  factors.  Here  a differentiation will be made between  errors  in  tracer  ages  and  distributions. The  effect  of  errors  on  tracer  age distributions is small compared with effects of oceanic processes. Depending on the extent and pathways of mixing, a tracer can exhibit a broad distribution of ages within a given water mass. Mixing, therefore, compromises the ability to interpret tracer ages; i.e., the elapsed time since a water parcel was in contact with the atmosphere. Mixing histories will be assessed by analyzing distributions of tracer ages with an accepted theoretical framework.  Isopycnal mixing rates and Peclet numbers will be calculated for sub-regions of the subtropical gyres. These values will be compared  to  tracer  age  distributions  and  non-linear  mixing  terms.  The  work will  be extended using  a  high  resolution  numerical  model  of  the  North  Atlantic  with  an  assumed  stationary circulation.  This  will  permit  analysis  of  simulated  CFC  and  ideal  ages,  their  distributions, comparison with observations, and assessment of ventilation and mixing in the model. Results from the proposed multiple tracer approach will contribute toward quantifying the rate at which the ocean takes up atmospheric gases, for example, CO2.\r\n\r\n",
