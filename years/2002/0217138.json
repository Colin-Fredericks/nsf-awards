 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hear Our Voices is a Demonstration initiative that links twenty Clubhouses from the \r\nComputer Clubhouse Network in creating new opportunities specifically for girls and\r\nyoung women, to develop fluency with computer technology, and to learn valuable career\r\nand life skills as well. Hear Our Voices will serve as a model for the future in other \r\nComputer Clubhouses in the Network, as well as like-minded informal educational\r\nprograms for girls and young women at other institutions.\r\n\r\nFounded at the Computer Museum in Boston in 1993, the Computer Clubhouse has grown\r\ninto a Network of 48 Clubhouses in 13 states and the District of Columbia, plus 11\r\nClubhouses overseas, touching the lives of thousands of young people. The Computer \r\nClubhouses provide a successful, innovative, andempowering after-school learning\r\nenvironment for young people (ages 8-18) from underserved communities. A safe and\r\nwelcoming milieu, skilled and caring mentors, and high-end hardware and professional\r\nsoftware tools help Clubhouse youth become confident learners through a variety of creative\r\ncomputer applications.\r\n\r\nThe flagship Computer Clubhouse moved to the Museum of Science in 1999, when the\r\nComputer Museum joined forces with the Museum of Science. Since then, the Network \r\nof Clubhouses has grown rapidly; with the support of Intel Corporation and other\r\nsponsors, more Clubhouses are now being planned and implemented. Based on community\r\ninterest and the success of the Clubhouse learning model in transforming young people's\r\nlives, current plans call for growth to more than 100 Clubhouses by 2004. Located\r\nprimarily in youth-serving organizations such as Boys & Girls Clubs and Urban Leagues,\r\nComputer Clubhouses serve inner-city neighborhoods as well as smaller communities \r\nwith a high proportion of under-served populations. The Computer Clubhouse community\r\nis diverse, made up of African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans, Native\r\nAmericans, recent immigrants, and Whites.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to recruit and retain more girls and young women in a field that has a \r\ndearth of participation by women -computer technology - the flagship Computer Clubhouse\r\nin Boston since 1995 has pioneered several programs especially for girls, providing them\r\nwith access to rich technology resources, female mentors and role models, a \r\ncommunity of peers, and a positive, creative, and supportive learning environment. \r\nThe new Hear Our Voices program will significantly expand the flagship Clubhouse's\r\nprogramming for girls and young women, to 20 new venues and with new, locally-designed\r\nprogramming. Specifically, it will enrich opportunities for girls in four ways:\r\n\r\n*Twenty of the Computer Clubhouses within the United States will receive funding and \r\nsupport to hire and train staff dedicated to gender equity and girls programming, and to\r\nlaunch locally-based Hear Our Voices programs at their Clubhouses, including at least \r\none component of girls-only hours or days at each participating Clubhouse.\r\n*Leveraging the experience gained at the flagship Computer Clubhouse, Network staff\r\nfrom the Museum of Science will provide professional development and program assistance\r\nfor girls'programming to Clubhouse Coordinators across the Network.\r\n*Building on the momentum and resources of the growing Clubhouse Network, a digital \r\nnetwork called the Clubhouse Village will support both a real and a virtual community of\r\nClubhouse youth.  An area on the Village will be designated especially for girls'\r\nactivities, and the Village will also support interaction among staff and mentors for\r\nmutual support and for sharing best practices. The Clubhouse Village will consist of a\r\nsecure, private Intranet, using Internet technology and tools to enable Clubhouse youth \r\nto communicate with each other and collaborate on creative projects.\r\n*The virtual community will be made more viable by a face-to-face gathering of \r\nparticipating youth and staff at a Computer Clubhouse Youth Summit in the summer of\r\n2004.",
