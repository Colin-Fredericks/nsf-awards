 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aschbacher and S. Smith recently completed the classification of the finite\r\nsimple quasithin groups.  This work fills a significant gap in the\r\n classification of the finite simple groups.  Aschbacher and Smith are\r\n editing their manuscript to make it ready for publication.  Aschbacher\r\n is continuing his project to produce a unified, accessible, and\r\ncomplete treatment of the existence, uniqueness, and structure of the\r\nsporadic groups.  He is writing up his work on recognition theorems\r\n for small groups with one class of involutions.  He is working with\r\n R. Guralnick and K. Magaard on lower bounds on the genus of coverings\r\n with a classical monodromy group.  He is investigating the p-radical\r\nsubgroups of the sporadic groups.\r\n\r\nGroups are algebraic objects of crucial importance in mathematics; for\r\nexample they are the basis for the study of symmetry. Finite groups can\r\n be decomposed into building blocks know as ``simple groups\";  the\r\n classification theorem lists the simple groups explicitly.\r\n Together with descriptions of the structure and representations of the\r\nsimple groups, the classification theorem forms the foundation for the modern\r\ntheory of finite groups.  Several years ago it was discovered that an\r\n important case in the classification had not been completely treated.\r\n Aschbacher and his collaborator S. Smith have now dealt with this case and\r\nare readying their manuscript for publication, in order to place the\r\nclassification theorem on solid ground.  The completion of this work,\r\n together with efforts to answer certain questions about the structure\r\n and representations of the simple groups, make up the project.\r\n",
