 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Award, provided by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, supports the research and educational program of Professor Donna Chen of the University of South Carolina at Columbia.  Her research addresses the chemistry of metal on oxide surfaces at the atomic level.  Using thermal desorption spectroscopy in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, the growth and surface chemistry of Ag and Pt nanoparticles deposited on titanium dioxide single crystal surfaces are being examined.  The oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide, and the reduction of NO with CO will be used as probe reactions to examine the detailed surface chemistry of these metal on oxide systems.  This approach will be extended to bimetallic nanoparticles as well.  The integration of undergraduate and graduate research participants in this research program forms the focus of the educational plan in this Career Award.  Interactive learning using web based tutorials and peer study groups are being implemented in the undergraduate curriculum, and the integration of research problem solving approaches in the courses of the P.I. is being implemented. \r\n\r\nThe application of modern ultra-high vacuum surface science tools to the microscopic understanding of the surface chemistry of metallic nanoparticles on oxide surfaces forms the focus of this Career Award.  The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program supports the research and educational activities of Professor Donna Chen at the University of South Carolina.  Scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spectroscopy are the major tools applied to the interactions of Ag and Pt particles with oxide surfaces.  Integrating undergraduate and graduate student research with the curriculum, and the use of interactive learning methods form the focus of the educational aspects of this Career Award.",
