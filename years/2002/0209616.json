 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Sharp will develop techniques to measure electron spin-related properties of transition metal ions with total spin greater than one. The electron spin physics will be probed indirectly by NMR spectroscopy. New methods of orienting paramagnetic molecules in flow-stretched hydrogels will be developed. Proof of concept experiments will be performed on paramagnetic complexes with spin S = 1, 3/2 and 5/2 and used to test the underlying theory. \r\n\r\nBiological and biochemical systems often contain ions that are characterized by electron spin. The total electron spin of these units plays an important role in the behavior of these systems. While the theory for systems with just one unbalanced electron spin is well developed, this is usually not the case when transition metal ions are present. The goals of the present project are to perform proof of concept experiments and thereby aid in the development of a satisfactory theory.  Students will participate in this research. They will gain experience in one of the forefront areas of contemporary physical chemistry and thereby prepare them for entry into the scientific/technological workforce.\r\n",
