 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nInternational Conference on Representations of Algebras and Related\r\nTopics, July 15 -- August 10, 2002, Toronto, Canada\r\n\r\nThe PI and the organizing committee plan to provide support for the\r\nparticipation of as many junior US mathematicians as possible in the\r\nbiennial international meeting in Toronto this summer. Next to the\r\npresentation of cutting-edge research, several series of overview\r\nlectures by leading experts and an extensive workshop program aim\r\nat introducing start-up researchers to the field. Central subjects\r\nare the geometry of module varieties, invariants and deformations,\r\nhomological developments -- specifically, derived categories,\r\nrepresentation type, including the in-depth exploration of pivotal\r\nclasses of tame or wild algebras. Among the applications -- their\r\nthorough documentation is one of the highest priorities -- are the\r\ntheories of complex semisimple Lie algebras and algebraic groups,\r\nsingularities and categories of perverse sheaves, new insights into\r\nthe structure of the Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand category, as well\r\nas the homological treatment of finite group schemes.\r\n\r\nThe representation theory of algebras has its origin in the study\r\nof 'groups', originally certain collections of motions of space\r\nwhich allow for concatenation and inversion. The next idea was to\r\nrepresent more abstract algebraic objects, arising in theoretical\r\nphysics and chemistry for instance, in terms of linear motions of\r\nsuitable spaces, to render their structure more transparent. In the\r\nmeantime, the scope of objects studied along this line has been\r\ndramatically enlarged, and a big arsenal of methods to analyze such\r\nrepresentations has been assembled. Tools which have proved\r\nparticularly effective include geometrical and combinatorial\r\nsetups, and variations of a general theme which can be outlined as\r\nfollows: One starts by establishing optimal situations, which can\r\nbe completely analyzed, and then measures the deviation of a more\r\nchallenging situation from the optimal ones to make headway in\r\nsteps dealing with progressive increases in complexity.\r\nApplications extend to almost all parts of mathematics and provide\r\nthe theoretical frames for models in theoretical physics.\r\nIn fact, some of the recent initiatives were prompted by physicists\r\nand feed back into quantum physics.",
