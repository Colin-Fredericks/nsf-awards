Nochetto and students from the University of Maryland-College Park in a collaboration with Gerhard Dziuk of the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Freiburg, Germany.  The award is a one-year renewal of a project begun in January 2000.  The project focuses on error control for nonlinear partial differential equations via a posteriori error estimation.  The techniques will have applications for physical problems involving diffusion, advection, phase changes, and interface dynamics.  Such problems arise frequently in industrial applications, and raise fundamental and challenging questions that need to be addressed in order for the field to advance.  The collaboration combines complementary expertise and facilities on both sides.  In particular the innovative software toolbox ALBERT, developed by the German group, is central to the proposed work, which will gain added value from the powerful theoretical capabilities of the U.S. group.  The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international travel and research.\r\n",
