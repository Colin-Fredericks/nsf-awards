 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to determine the elementary mechanisms and kinetics governing the non-thermal reactions of hyperthermal, gas-phase oxygen atoms with atoms adsorbed on single crystal silicon.  A novel beam source of hyperthermal atomic oxygen will be used to stimulate reactions at the adsorbate-modified silicon surface.  The desorbing reaction products will be monitored during the atom-adsorbate reactions using mass spectrometry.  The reaction products that remain adsorbed on the surface and the chemical changes of the surface will be studied using thermal desorption, x-ray photoelectron and Auger electron spectroscopy.  The reactions of hyperthermal, gas-phase oxygen atoms with adsorbed oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and deuterium atoms will be investigated with these techniques to determine the influence of adlayer structure and bonding energetics on the elementary mechanisms, kinetics, and selectivity of the reactions.  Results of this project will advance the current understanding of elementary atom-adsorbate reactions.  The educational component is the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students.  Graduate students will be trained in an area that will be of significant interest to industries interested in heterogeneous chemistry, especially in the semiconductor industry. The results of this work could have a significant impact on our understanding of processes in the semiconductor industry, including plasma processing.",
