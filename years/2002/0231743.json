It is responsive to key areas of understanding of costs and opportunities, and how to optimize them, for the net impact of SSP on the biosphere and on sustainable growth.\r\nThe research will involve detailed computer-based modeling and evaluation of the economic value of SSP as a source of commercial power by the year 2020.  The research will focus on the potential effects on the biosphere from SSP operation and the potential contribution of SSP to energy security and power supply resiliency.  Both of these factors are key determinants of the role of SSP in sustainable economic growth around the world.  To fully understand the contribution of SSP to sustainable growth, however, requires a broader economic context.\r\nAdditional intellectual merits of the model will be explicit and the formal incorporation of uncertainty for all parameters, including terrestrial and SSP energy supplies, costs, biosphere and security effects, and adoption rates towards the year 2020.  The research will result in a computer-based simulation model of the relative benefits and costs of SSP and explicit representation of energy, environmental, and security impacts.\r\n",
