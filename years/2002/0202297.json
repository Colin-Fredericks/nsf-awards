 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation by the principal investigator and three other US scientists in two consecutive day-long workshops concerned with regulations affecting research on wild animals.  The workshops will be held at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada.  All four scientists will speak during one or both of the workshops.  The first of the two is an Animal Care Regional Workshop convened by the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC), the Canadian group responsible for establishing Animal Care Committees, the Canadian equivalent of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) at US institutions.  The second is a Workshop on Cross-Border and Multi-Center Wildlife Studies.  Previous US workshops have underscored the need for additional and ongoing discussion of how the animal welfare act, the endangered species act, and other relevant regulations affect the conduct of field research with vertebrates.  The Vancouver workshops will address, among other issues, transportation of wildlife, projects involving migration and endangered species, multi-center project approval, and wildlife management relative to basic research.  The impact of newly revised Canadian wildlife guidelines will also be discussed.  Approximately 150 attendees are anticipated.  Because the NSF, like the NIH, delegates most responsibility for enforcement of all pertinent animal care and use regulations to grantee institutions, there is a significant need for ongoing discussion and education efforts in this area; participation of these four speakers will enhance the value of the workshops. Additional support will be provided by the CCAC, by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of the NIH, and by the host institution where the workshops will be held.",
