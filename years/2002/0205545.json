 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS - 0205545.\r\n\r\nA number of problems of elliptic and parabolic type in\r\ngeneral relativity will be studied.  The investigator\r\nwill model rotating stars by a self-gravitating \r\nperfect fluid rigidly rotating on its own axis using a\r\nperturbation method. The perturbation parameter is the\r\nratio of the angular velocity to the central density,\r\nallowing rapidly rotating solutions when the density\r\nis sufficiently high. The investigator will work on\r\nthe uniqueness of the Kerr black holes, to rule out\r\nmultiple black hole configurations, as conjectured by\r\nRoger Penrose.  A new approach is proposed consisting\r\nof the investigation of the relation between\r\nuniqueness theorems for black holes in equilibrium and\r\nPenrose-type inequalities. The investigator will\r\ncontinue his work on the connectedness of the space of\r\ninitial data for the Einstein vacuum equations,\r\nextending results obtained in the context of\r\nquasi-convex foliations, foliations with leaves of\r\npositive Gauss and mean curvature.  The investigator\r\nwill work, in collaboration with Y. Li and A. S.\r\nTahvildar-Zadeh, on blow-up of wave maps, the\r\ndynamical counterparts of harmonic maps.  These maps\r\nhave attracted considerable attention by researchers\r\nin nonlinear hyperbolic equations mainly due to their\r\nsimilarity to the Einstein equations.  The\r\ninvestigator will also work on the asymptotic behavior\r\nof harmonic maps with prescribed singularities into\r\nHadamard manifolds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMathematical general relativity overlaps three\r\ndisciplines: physics, geometry, and nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations. As such, it is an ideal source\r\nof problems whose solutions have the potential to\r\ninfluence all three of these fields.  The problems in\r\nthis project fall in this category.  For example, the\r\nstudy of Penrose-type inequalities is of interest both\r\nto mathematical relativists and to geometers studying\r\nspaces of dimension three. Developing a good\r\nmathematical model for dense rapidly rotating stars is\r\nan important goal in astrophysics, for example when\r\ntrying to understand pulsars, and would also\r\ncontribute new results in perturbation theory.  \r\nUnderstanding wave maps should help the study of other\r\nnonlinear evolution equations governing various\r\nphysical phenomena.\r\n\r\n",
