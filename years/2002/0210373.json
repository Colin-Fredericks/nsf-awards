 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mark Oskin\r\nUniversity of Washington\r\n0210373\r\n\r\nQuantum computers seem the subject of science fiction, but their tremendous\r\ncomputational potential is closer than we may think.  Despite significant\r\npractical difficulties, small quantum devices of 5 to 7 bits have been built\r\nin the laboratory.  Silicon technologies promise even greater scalability.\r\nTo use these technologies effectively, and help guide quantum device\r\nresearch, computer architects need to start designing and reasoning about\r\nquantum processors now.  However, two major hurdles stand in the way.\r\nFirst, compactly describable rules that characterize silicon-based quantum\r\ncomputing technologies are not known.  Second, there does not exist an\r\ninfrastructure to design, test, and evaluate architectural alternatives.\r\n\r\nThis grant addresses both of these\r\nitems.  First, we will formalize the design rules of a widely discussed\r\nand likely quantum device technology.  Second, we have already begun to\r\ndevelop architectural abstractions for this technology that can be composed\r\ntogether to form general-purpose quantum information processors.  Third,\r\nusing these abstractions we will develop an automated computer aided\r\ndesign tool that takes a description of a quantum computing architecture and\r\ncompiles it to a device library of quantum cells.  Finally, we will\r\ndevelop a simulator that quickly estimates the cost-performance of quantum\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nThese research goals, once accomplished, will serve as foundational\r\nresources for the development of quantum computer architectures.  In\r\naddition, by reasoning about architectures we can begin to find the limits\r\nof current quantum device proposals.  These limits can be turned into\r\nresearch goals, items that further quantum device research needs to\r\novercome.\r\n",
