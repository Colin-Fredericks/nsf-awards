 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to study finite dimensional normed spaces and convex bodies\r\nusing methods of Fourier analysis. The idea is to express different\r\nproperties of convex bodies in terms of the Fourier transform and then\r\nsolve geometric problems using Fourier analytic methods.\r\nThis approach has already led to several results including a\r\ncomplete analytic solution to the Busemann-Petty problem on sections\r\nof convex bodies. The PI plans to develop new connections between\r\nthe Fourier transform, spherical harmonics and parallel section functions\r\n(X-rays) of convex bodies that will lead to new results on critical sections\r\nof convex bodies, intersection and projection bodies and to new results\r\nof Busemann-Petty type. A significant part of the work will be related to\r\nseveral open problems of the local theory of Banach spaces. This includes\r\nseveral possible Fourier analytic approaches to the slicing problem and\r\nthe study of the central limit properties of convex bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn important direction of the geometry of normed spaces is the study of\r\ngeometric properties of convex bodies based on the properties of sections\r\nand projections of these bodies. This direction has already found\r\nnumerous applications to engineering and medicine, starting with the\r\nclassical theory of X-rays and geometric tomography. The goal of this\r\nproject is to develop a new approach to the study of sections and\r\nprojections of convex bodies based on methods of Fourier analysis.\r\nNew connections between sections of convex bodies and the Fourier transform\r\nhave been recently found by the PI and have already led to an analytic\r\nsolution to the Busemann-Petty problem of whether smaller bodies can have\r\nuniformly larger central sections. The connections with Fourier analysis\r\nand geometric tomography will further relate methods and results of the\r\nBanach space theory to different areas of mathematics, engineering and\r\nmedicine. New techniques for computing the Fourier transform will have\r\nindependent value and can also be applied to signal processing and statistics.",
