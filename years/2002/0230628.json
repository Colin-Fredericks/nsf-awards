This planning grant will address the Capstone design\r\nprogram, which will be greatly revised to provide a multidisciplinary design experience\r\nfor senior students and to integrate juniors and sophomores into the Capstone experience.\r\nThe team  will assess the outcomes of the Capstone experience to generate data to guide the revision of our curriculum in general.\r\n\r\nA major objective of the Capstone design courses is for the students to work on a\r\ndesign project at a professional level. The project makes use of most of the knowledge\r\nthat students have acquired in the previous two to three years of the ECE curriculum.\r\nTherefore, the outcome of the Capstone design experience should be an excellent\r\nindicator of the how well the education process in the ECE Department is preparing\r\nstudents for their professional career. A year-to-year assessment of the outcomes of the\r\nCapstone design courses will enable us to make continuous improvements in the\r\nsophomore, junior, and also the senior year curricula. This being the case, the revision of\r\nthe Capstone program will serve as the engine to drive curriculum revision for the entire\r\nECE program.\r\n\r\n",
