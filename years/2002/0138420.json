Given a family of surfaces that \r\nrepresent the boundary of a 3D shape whose geometry and \r\ntopology change with time, we propose to construct a \r\nhigher-dimensional multiresolution representation, which \r\nwe have named Atlas Transition Diagram, abbreviated ATD, \r\nthat will identify and track the morphological and \r\ntopological features of the 3D shape as they evolve with \r\ntime and with resolution. Our ATD will also associate a \r\nchart to each feature, thus providing a surface-parameterization \r\nthat naturally follows the branches and handles of each \r\nshape in the family. The charts evolve smoothly with time \r\nand resolution and are topologically glued together at \r\ntheir common boundaries to provide a continuous mapping, \r\nS(r,t,u,v;f); f), that, given a feature ff, a resolution rr, \r\na time tt, and two parameters u and v, will identify a \r\nunique point on the surface and will allow us to trace \r\nits evolution with rr and tt. The theoretical underpinnings \r\nand algorithmic designs that will lead to a practical \r\nimplementation of an efficient system for building and \r\nquerying ATDs go far beyond simple extensions of Morse \r\ntheory, of surface segmentation approaches, and of \r\nmulti-resolution techniques, which have so far been \r\nmainly explored for static surfaces in 3D.\r\n\r\nEvolving surfaces are important to many scientific \r\nand engineering disciplines, including medicine, \r\ndevelopmental biology, cell biology, computational \r\nfluid dynamics and computer aided design. They may \r\nfor example represent the growth of a tumor, the shifting \r\nin position of a vortex over an airplane wing, or the \r\nbudding of fingers on the hand of a human embryo.  We \r\npropose to develop and integrate a collection of \r\ntheoretical and algorithmic tools for the analysis \r\nand automated visualization of such evolutions. These \r\ntools will allow us to partition the evolving surface \r\ninto features upon which a high-level description of \r\nthe shape of the surface and of its evolution will be \r\nbased. Furthermore, they will allow us to track their \r\npoints, and thus surface properties, through time and \r\nto better visualize their evolutions through texture \r\nmaps that continuously evolve with the features and \r\nhighlight their boundaries and natural orientation. \r\nFinally, these tools will help us support queries \r\nabout the time and nature of topological changes \r\nin the evolving surface, which may be important for \r\nthe automatic analysis and retrieval of scientific \r\ndatasets. To achieve these results, we propose to \r\nbuild a surface representation that is controlled \r\nindependently or simultaneously by time and resolution \r\nand to decompose the time/resolution domain into cells \r\nwhere the surface topology (number of components and \r\nthrough holes) and its partition into features remain \r\nconstant. To validate our theoretical contributions \r\nand to increase their impact on the community, we plan \r\nto develop a prototype implementation for animated \r\nobjects with triangulated boundaries. We expect to \r\nmake the source code of this implementation and its \r\nprogramming interface publicly available. We envision \r\nexploring collaborations with application developers \r\nin Science, Engineering, Medicine and Biology to help \r\nus refine and validate this approach.\r\n",
