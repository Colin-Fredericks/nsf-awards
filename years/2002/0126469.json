 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nThis project develops a new discovery-based laboratory course, \"Laboratory in Genetics\", adapted from a course at Santa Clara University. Targeted to upper-class undergraduates, the course permits students to experimentally explore concepts of classical and modern genetics, including genomics. Two inquiry-based research projects are initiated and carried out by the students; both projects generate novel data. This approach offers students the opportunity to explore a unique genetic problem, acquiring related concepts and information in the context of that exploration. The course makes use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, taking advantage of the ease and practicability with which relatively sophisticated genetics experiments can be carried out with this organism. For example, the second project incorporates a new experimental technology that enables genomic sequence information to be transferred to a functional assay in this organism. A pilot offering of the course demonstrated the feasibility of the course plan and enabled the sharpening of course goals. The pilot helped identify specific equipment needs that are necessary to meet the course objectives. Project outcomes are: (1) to refine the syllabus and course materials to increase student capacity and make the course exportable, (2) to provide the means for students to explore a wider array of genotypes and phenotypes, and (3) to give each student the opportunity to become proficient at utilizing the available literature and post-genomics databases and tools. In this way, the larger goals of improving acquisition of scientific knowledge and skills, including analytical, technical and communication skills, can be achieved.",
