 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses fundamental issues of structure, composition, growth and reactivity on tech-nologically relevant thin films. The research explores film and interface behavior of ultrathin oxides in the critical 1-10 nm thickness range. Plans include growth and analysis of films grown on Si, Ge and SiC. The primary technique employed is high-resolution medium energy ion scat-tering (MEIS), enabling accurate determination of composition as a function of depth, and, in some cases, precise structure determinations. The MEIS experiments will be complemented with infrared absorption spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and photoelectron spectroscopy. Some aspects will be done in collaboration with industrial scientists at Bell Labs and elsewhere. The project also addresses fundamental studies of ion-surface inter-actions, specifically the effect of electronic excitation processes on ion scattering spectra as the film thickness drops below one nanometer. The aim is to provide fundamental understanding of high-resolution depth profiling of surfaces and ultrathin films. This work will be done in close collaboration with theorists. The broader technological impact of this work results from devel-opment of a microscopic understanding of thin film growth and of new experimental and theo-retical tools. A new level of conceptual understanding, based on atomic concepts, is expected to emerge which will aid in the continued development of electronics. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues in areas of electronic materials science and condensed matter physics having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. The research program provides excellent opportunities for hands-on experience in the use of sophisticated sci-entific equipment. The combined resources, including experimental and theoretical methods, provide special opportunities for education and training of post doctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students involved in highly interdisciplinary forefront research. The direct and visually oriented nature of the information obtained facilitates communication of the excitement of surface and materials science to undergraduates as well as middle and high school students.\r\n***  \r\n",
