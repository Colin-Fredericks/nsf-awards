Paden\t\r\nInstitution: Univ California-Santa Barbara\r\nProposal Number: 0220386\r\nProposal Title: \"Dynamic Models for Electrodynamic Suspended Magnetic Levitation\" \r\nAbstract: \r\nThe novelty in this project is the application of mathematical analysis to investigate the dynamic properties of electrodynamic suspension (EDS) magnetic levitation (maglev). Objective of the research are to: a) develop, validate and analyze dynamical models for EDS on a perforated track, b) investigate fundamental limitations of the proposed technology with respect to design parameters and levitation control strategies, and c) guide the further technological development of maglev, and d) facilitate cost effective engineering designs.  The intellectual merit lies in the application of tools from functional analysis and dynamical systems to forward the development of maglev technology, and to introduce these tools to the maglev research community. The program thereby advances knowledge in maglev, and across the fields of system theory, dynamical systems and functional analysis and magnetic levitation.  By investigating the fundamental limitations of perforated track EDS maglev with respect to design parameters and levitation control strategies, we guide the technological development of and advance discovery of new maglev technology and facilitate engineering design. Understanding physical limitation will advance knowledge of maglev in a fundamental way, and we aim to define new research directions within maglev technology. \r\n\r\nThe suggested research is well-organized through a cohesive plan of dynamical modeling, mathematical analysis, experimental validation and dissemination of results in engineering and mathematics communities.  Our available resources is primarily through interactions with researchers within the field of maglev, dynamical systems and control theory, mathematics, and industry. Our ongoing interaction with Dr. Richard Post at LLNL, the inventor and patent holder of the Inductrack levitation concept, ensures support on the modeling of maglev. The strong position of the Center for Control Engineering and computation at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) gives valuable support in infinite dimensional dynamical systems and control theory through its affiliated members from multiple departments among Mechanical and Electrical engineering and Mathematics. MagTube, a newly started venture capital funded company located adjacent to our campus, provides know-how on important engineering issues in maglev design, and ensures relations with industry.  Maglev technology has potential for significant impact on society at large by promoting efficient high speed transportation without direct combustion of fossil fuels, and with substantially higher energy efficiency than existing means of ground, air and sea transportation. The research will also contribute to MagTube.s innovative transportations concept (which has received $2 million in venture capital after a critically  reviewed financial analysis) of a high speed transportation network based on magnetically levitated capsules moving in evacuated tubes in an automated network system resembling packet switched networks in communication technology.\r\n\r\nThis research will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups through support of the PI as he works with the LEGO-Robotics, which involves secondary school teachers and students from Latino communities. The experimental apparatus will enhance the infrastructure for research at UCSB by establishing instrumentation and data acquisition capabilities. The equipment will also contribute to the education facilities used in the PI's graduate dynamics and control lab course taught in collaboration with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UC Santa Barbara. \r\nResearch dissemination will be performed to fora on maglev, dynamical systems and control research, through conference attendance and journal publication. Our experimental results, data and simulation models will be made available through the internet for effective data sharing. Lastly, we have already significant interaction with MagTube and General Atomic who aims to commercialize the inductrack technology.\r\n",
