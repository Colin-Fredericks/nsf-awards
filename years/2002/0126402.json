 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nIn this project, four science departments (Chemistry, Biology, Physics, and Geology) at SUNY Potsdam are using Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (AFM/STM) to continue their ongoing efforts to incorporate advanced technologies into laboratory experiences for science majors. While examples of atomic imaging techniques in new textbooks have enhanced student's visualization of atoms and molecules, the lack of an AFM and appropriate related laboratory experiences has limited student learning in this area. Bridging the gap between coursework and the laboratory, a number of new experiments based on AFM/STM use are being developed, some of which are integrated across the curriculum.\r\n\tThe ability to engage students in experiments using AFM/STM is creating possibilities for designing innovative courses and is advancing undergraduate research. This equipment enables students in chemistry and biology classes to (1) measure the forces between molecules, including antigen/antibody interactions (V.W. Jones, J.R. Kenseth, M.D. Porter, C.L. Mosher, and E. Henderson, \"Microminiaturized Immunoassays Using Atomic Force Microscopy and Compositionally Patterned Antigen Arrays,\" Anal. Chem., 1998, 70, 1233-1241), (2) explore phospholipid and drug interactions (T.H. Ha, C.H. Kim, J.S. Park, and K. Kim, \"Interaction of Indolicidin with Model Lipid Bilayer: Quartz Crystal Microbalance and Atomic Force Microscopy Study,\" Langmuir, 2000, 16, 871-875), (3) examine structure of polymer films (D. Raghavan, M. VanLandingham, X. Gu, and T. Nguyen, \"Characterization of Heterogeneous Regions in Polymer Systems Using Tapping Mode and Force Mode Atomic Force Microscopy,\" Langmuir, 2000, 16, 9448-9459), (4) observe pitting corrosion and to study the effect of inhibitors on metal corrosion, imaging the surface of nanoelectrocatalytic materials used for methanol oxidation, (5) examine microporosity and mesoporosity in different carbon materials, (6) observe adherence of bacteria to surfaces, (7) examine the structure of biological molecules at very high resolution, and (8) study the viral infection process. Biology and chemistry students are now able to study the actions of DNA binding proteins and ligands, including restriction enzyme mapping and gene localization (H.B. Sun, L. Qian, and H. Yokota, \"Detection of Abasic Sites on Individual DNA Molecules Using Atomic Force Microscopy,\" Anal. Chem., 2001,73, 2229-2232). The data generated through AFM analysis of these processes are then compared with those generated through traditional methods, and demonstrate the evolution of modern chemistry and molecular biology, while providing the students with a glimpse of the future direction of the science. \r\n",
