 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  award  supports research into the development  of  efficient  automated  coalition  formation  methods  that  are  targeted  to  operate  in  inherently distributed situations with combinatorial  characteristics---e.g. task and resource  allocation  and  multi-  agent   planning  and  scheduling.   Of  specific  interest   are  situations in which agents have different goals and each agent is  trying  to  maximize its own good without concern for the  global  good.   The  first  part of the research extends  prior  work  on  coalition  formation under bounded rationality to new  models  of  computation and communication limitations.  More general settings  will also be studied in which a coalition's value is affected  by  nonmembers  actions.  For this, powerful new  strategic  solution  concepts will be used. A paradox of bounded rationality in multi-  agent  systems  also  will be further studied  and  resolved.   A  second  part of the work will explore coalition formation,  using  protocols  that  incorporate  constructive  multi-agent   search,  iterative   refinement  via   renegotiation,   backtracking   via  decommitting,  and  avoiding  local  optima  via  specific   more  powerful  agreement  types. A broad  set  of  protocols  will  be  explored. Collusion will also be analyzed among agents that  have  probabilistic, conditional performance profiles for  their  local  deliberation  algorithms, as well as  agents  that  can  gain  by  explicitly   coordinating   their   computations   with   others.  Algorithms will be designed and tested, and applied to two  real-  world problems:  distributed vehicle routing and multi-enterprise  manufacturing.",
