 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Arthur Pardi at University of Colorado, Boulder that provides partial funding for purchase of a state-of-the-art 800 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  A consortium of three Universities in the Rocky Mountain Region; the University of Colorado, Boulder, the University of Colorado Health Science Center (UCHSC) and the University of Utah School of Medicine, will equally share this instrument.  This high field NMR will benefit the research programs of the seven major users (Drs. A. Pardi and D.S. Wuttke at Boulder; Drs. W.L. Sundquist and D.R. Davis at Utah; and Drs. B. K. Bendiak, D.N.M. Jones, and M.J. Overduin at UCHSC) as well as other minor users at the three institutions and in the Rocky Mountain Region.  The various research programs are focused on structure-function studies of proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates.  Recent methodological developments allow acquisition of very high-resolution NMR spectra on much larger macromolecules than was previously possible.  These powerful new techniques are most effective at ultra-high magnetic fields, and the requested 800 MHz NMR will make it possible for the members of this consortium to dramatically enhance their research programs on larger and more complex macromolecules.\r\n\tThis instrument will accelerate new and ongoing research projects in the following areas: Oligosaccharide Structures and Cell Surface Carbohydrate-Protein Interactions - B. K. Bendiak; Structural Studies of HIV Primer/Template Complex - D. R. Davis; Structure-Function Studies of Proteins and Carbohydrates Involved in Disease - D. N. M. Jones;  Structures, Interactions and Dynamics of Membrane-Associated Proteins - M. J. Overduin;  Structure-Function Studies of RNA - A. Pardi;  Structural Studies of HIV-1 Assembly and Budding - W. I. Sundquist;  Structural Studies of Biologically Important Molecular Recognition - D. S. Wuttke.  The major users currently have access to lower magnetic field NMR instrumentation so the 800 MHz NMR will be exclusively used for projects that have a demonstrated need for the higher field, higher resolution and higher sensitivity of this instrument.  In addition to using the 800 MHz NMR to determine solution structures of biologically important macromolecules, some of the major users are actively involved in development of improved techniques for determining structures of biomolecules in solution.  Thus this ultra-high field NMR will also be used to aid in the development of new methods for probing the structures and dynamics of larger proteins, RNAs, DNAs, and carbohydrates than was previously possible.\r\n\tThere is a growing awareness of the potential of structure/function studies of biomolecules for revolutionizing human medicine and health care.  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography are the two techniques for determining high-resolution structures of biomolecules.  The research performed on this 800 MHz NMR instrument will lead to technological innovations that maximize structural and dynamical information on potential drug targets which can aid in the development of improved therapies for cancer, viral and microbial infections and developmental diseases. The acquisition of this state-of-the-art 800 MHz NMR will also have significant impact on the educational training of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, undergraduates, and faculty at the three Universities in the consortium.  The 7 major users groups together support a large number of graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral researchers and technical staff.  Access to this state-of-the-art instrument for solution structural studies of proteins, carbohydrates and nucleic acids will provide an outstanding training opportunity, leading to much higher level of expertise of these NMR users.\r\n",
