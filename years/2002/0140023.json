DMS-0140023\r\n\r\nProposal title : Nonlinear Dispersive Equations. \r\n\r\n \r\nIn recent years there has been a significant progress on\r\nthe study of qualitative behavior of solution to nonlinear\r\ndispersive systems. The relation between dispersive and nonlinear effects\r\nhas motivated several remarkable works. Among them one finds\r\nsharp local and global wellposedness theories under minimal regularity \r\nassumptions on the data, precise blow up results as well as ill-posedness \r\nones. As a consequence our understanding of several phenomena in nature is \r\nnow more complete. The principal investigator will focus on several\r\nrepresentative problems connected with partial differential\r\nequations arising in wave propagation and fluid mechanics.\r\n\r\n The wave propagation in diverse mediums and the interaction of\r\ndifferent kind of waves can be modeled by complicated systems of\r\npartial differential equations. These systems involve many variables\r\nwhich depends of the particular physical setting of the problem. In many \r\ncases, these systems are too complicated to be treated with reasonable \r\naccuracy, thus one has to consider approximated models. The validity of these \r\napproximations is essential to further study of the physical phenomenon. One \r\nhas to give precise conditions under which the qualitative behavior of the \r\nsolution of these approximated models captures the features of the physical \r\nsetting. It is here where the theoretical study of these solutions become \r\nessential. Thus, one starts with special solutions and its properties, \r\nstability, long time behavior, ill-posedness, etc. In situations where these \r\ntheoretical results are unavailable one needs to start the study with \r\nappropriate numerical simulations.\r\n\r\n",
