 "awd_abstract_narration": "Homologous meiotic recombination is an important process for sexually\r\nreproducing organisms: it creates new genotypes by shuffling chromosomal\r\nsegments that otherwise would be inherited as a unit and promotes fertility by\r\nensuring that chromosomes segregate properly at meiosis.  For close to a century,\r\ngeneticists have been using recombination as a tool to construct genetic maps,\r\nwhich now find practical applications ranging from risk prediction for inherited\r\ndeleterious alleles to marker-assisted selection of desirable genotypes in\r\nagriculture and map-based cloning of valuable genes in plants and animals. Yet,\r\nin spite of its importance, our knowledge of the process of homologous meiotic\r\nrecombination in higher plants is rudimentary compared to other organisms, like\r\nyeast. This project will increase our understanding of this basic biological\r\nprocess in maize, a plant that is both an excellent model organism\r\nfor studies of recombination, and an economically important crop in American agriculture and industry.\r\nThe genetic system being used in the project is the bz locus, which affects seed\r\npigmentation and is uniquely advantageous for studies of recombination. This\r\nproject will continue the analysis of meiotic recombination in maize by combining the power of the genetics of the bz region with that of modern molecular tools. It is greatly influenced by the recent finding that the organization of genes and retrotransposons in the bz genomic region is polymorphic in different maize lines. There are five specific objectives of the project:\r\n1. To analyze conversion tract lengths within the bz gene island in heterozygotes\r\nlacking heterologies and extend the analysis to adjacent retrotransposon blocks.\r\n2. To determine if the apparent conversion polarity at bz, detected with small\r\ninsertion mutations at the 5' and 3' ends of the gene, but not with more centrally\r\nlocated point mutations, is due to the nature or the position of the mutations.\r\n3. To test whether the presence of a highly methylated retrotransposon block\r\naffects recombination in adjacent genes.\r\n4. To determine if all recombination junctions in an interval made up of genes\r\nand retrotransposons fall in genes.\r\n5. To test if recombination between two sites in the genome separated by a\r\ndifferent number of genes in different lines is a function of the number of\r\ncommon genes in the intervening segment.\r\n",
