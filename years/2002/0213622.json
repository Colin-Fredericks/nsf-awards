 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process industry (chemical, petroleum and pharmaceutical) in the United States has been one of the strongest industrial sectors of the economy, producing a consistent positive balance of trade.  This has been due to the cost effectiveness of its processes as well as to its technological innovations.  In the 21st century the process industry faces three major challenges: increased competition in the global marketplace, pressure for keeping operating costs and product prices low, and pressure to reduce environmental, safety and security risks.  Given these competitive concerns, there is an increasing focus for optimizing and integrating the supply chain in order to achieve reduced costs and a tighter level of coordination in the operations of manufacturing facilities.  One component for accomplishing these objectives is new process operations methodologies and tools.\r\n\r\nThis grant is to provide support for the conference on Foundations of Computer Aided Process Operations (FOCAPO) that will take place on January 12-15, 2003, in Coral Springs, Florida.  The meeting will focus on the areas of supply chain management, R&D for pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, methodologies for process operations (hybrid systems, data reconciliation, safety), and optimization models and algorithms (discrete, stochastic and dynamic).  It will also provide a forum to discuss supply chain software from vendors, and industrial and academic collaborations in the area of process operations.  FOCAPO 2003 aims to attract about 150 participants, with roughly equal representation from academia and industry.  There will also be substantial international participation.  One important goal is to ensure the participation of 20 graduate students.  The grant will support invited academic speakers and panelists and the graduate students.\r\n",
