In the first year the students will all be drawn for Cornell University's Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute, a summer research experience with a very strong record of enabling minority undergraduates to pursue careers in mathematical biology. In later years, students not enrolled in MBTI will also be recruited and brought into the meeting activities and mentoring opportunities provided by this award. The PI has received endorsements and promised assistance from several professional societies, including the Society for Mathematical Biology, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis project build on efforts undertaken by MBTI and others to bring a broader range of students into mathematical biology. It will help foster the professional growth of minority students, provide a solid mentoring network for students to participate fully in the conferences, draw more underrepresented minorities into areas where mathematical biology and environmental biology overlap, and more actively engage several professional societies in ongoing efforts to broaden participation.  This program is an important step towards meeting a national need of developing a more quantitatively- prepared scientific workforce and to draw upon the full range of intellectual talent from diverse populations.\r\n\r\n",
