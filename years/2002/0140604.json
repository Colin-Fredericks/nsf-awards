 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Changfeng Gui, University of Connecticut\r\nDMS-0140604\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThe PI will work on two projects on qualitative properties of partial differential equations.  In the first project, he will study phase transitions modeled by the Allen-Cahn\r\nequation and its generalized vector equations, which are the gradient flows of the Allen-Cahn energy with either double-well potentials or multiple-well potentials of equal depths.  The objectives are to determine the existence, uniqueness and stability  of  some special configurations, and then to further study  the fine structure near the interfaces or near\r\nthe triple junction and  the dynamics of  these sharp interfaces and\r\ntriple junctions.  One of the immediate goals is to classify the optimal\r\nconfigurations of anti-phases. This  is indeed to solve a conjecture of\r\nDe Giorgi  which concerns the one dimensional symmetry of\r\ncertain entire solutions  of  the Euler-Lagrange equations of the\r\nAllen-Cahn energy.  The De Giorgi conjecture is also related to the study\r\nof  minimal surfaces, and is still open in dimensions bigger than three.\r\nIn the second project the PI will study the Gierier-Meinhardt\r\nsystems of equations arising in biological pattern formations and chemical\r\nreactions. In particular,  the proposor will try to show mathematically\r\nthe existence of  some special concentration patterns and to understand\r\ntheir stabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiffusion is a very common phenomenon, and it generates very\r\ncomplex structures when several different substances are involved.\r\nPhase transitions, pattern formations  are well observed in  material\r\nsciences, in  biological and chemical reactions, and they are closely\r\nrelated to diffusions.  Special nonlinear partial differential equations\r\nand systems are used to model these phenomena mathematically.  The\r\nproposor hope  to develop analytic techniques  to obtain  good\r\nqualitative properties for solutions of these equations, which will lead\r\nto better numerical methods for simulations.  The study will help to\r\nunderstand the finer structures and long time behaviors of phase\r\ntransitions, pattern formations, and other similar phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
