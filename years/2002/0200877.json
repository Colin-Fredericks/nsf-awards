 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators study the complex hyperbolic \r\ngeometry of the moduli spaces of cubic surfaces and cubic \r\nthreefolds.   For stable cubic surfaces over the complex numbers, \r\nprevious work of D. Allcock and the investigators gives a period \r\nmap from the moduli space to the quotient of the four-ball by a \r\nlattice defined over the Eisenstein integers, which is an \r\nisomorphism between these two spaces and which takes the subspace \r\nof moduli of singular surfaces to a configuration of hyperplanes \r\nin the ball.  The investigators now study the arithmetic \r\nproperties of cubic surfaces whose periods are Eisenstein rational \r\npoints.   For stable cubic threefolds over the complex numbers, \r\nthere is a period map from their moduli space to the quotient of \r\nthe ten-ball by a lattice also defined over the Eisenstein \r\nintegers.  The investigators study detailed properties of this \r\nperiod map in order to prove that this map is an isomorphism \r\nbetween the two spaces (after some blowing up and down) which \r\ncarries the subspace of moduli of singular threefolds to a \r\nhyperplane configuration in the ball.  The main technical point \r\nunder study is the computation of the differential of the \r\nrestriction of the period map to each stratum that parametrizes \r\nequisingular varieties.  The extension of the Griffiths residue \r\ncalculus to this situation turns out to be quite involved and to \r\nrequire new techniques in commutative algebra.\r\n\r\nThe understanding of cubic equations has been a central theme in \r\nmathematics, whith deep implications for mathematics, science and \r\nengineering.  In the sixteenth century  cubic equations in one \r\nvariable were solved by finding a formula for its solutions \r\nanalogous to the well-known formula for the solutions of quadratic \r\nequations.   This formula led to the introduction of complex \r\nnumbers, which are now a standard tool in science and engineering.  \r\nIn the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was realized that \r\nquadratic equations in any number of variables could be \r\nunderstood, and that, for a fixed number of variables,  all \r\nquadratic equations are essentially equivalent by a change of \r\nvariables.  It was also realized that cubic equations in two or \r\nmore variables are not all equivalent by change of variables.   \r\nThe different equivalence classes are now called the moduli space.   \r\nThe moduli space of cubic equations in two variables is the \r\nhyperbolic plane of non-Euclidean geometry.  This connection has led to many\r\ndiscoveries, from special functions used to solve problems in physics and\r\nengineering, to advances in number theory and cryptography.  The aim of this\r\nproject is to study the special non-Euclidean geometry that has recently been\r\ndiscovered on the moduli spaces of cubic equations in three and four\r\nvariables.   The reason for carrying this study is not only the solution of\r\nthe problems posed in the proposal, but also the expectation that this study\r\nof cubics in more variables will continue to be a point of departure for new\r\nideas that will affect other areas of mathematics, science and engineering.  \r\n",
