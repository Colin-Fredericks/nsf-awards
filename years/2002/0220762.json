 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project is designed to encourage low-income, academically talented students to\r\nmajor in computer science and mathematics and to assist them in being successful in the\r\ncompletion of their academic program. Through innovative community building\r\nactivities, the scholarship program is having a significant impact on the entire cohort of\r\nstudents enrolled in Computer Science and Mathematics programs at NJCU. This cohort of \r\nstudents are predominately female and disadvantaged minorities. New Jersey City \r\nUniversity is designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and a Minority Institution, \r\nwith a Hispanic enrollment of 30% and a total minority enrollment of 62%. The Program \r\nconsists of four components: (1)recruitment of talented, low-income students into \r\nComputer Science, Pre-Engineering and Mathematics majors; (2) targeted academic \r\nsupport initiatives, in addition to existing student support services; (3) structured \r\nscholarship community activities; and, (4) internships and cooperative education work \r\nexperiences. The overall goals of the Project are the increase in enrollment, retention and \r\ngraduation rates of high-ability, low-income students in Computer Science, \r\nPre-Engineering and Mathematics baccalaureate degree programs. These goals and \r\nobjectives are being accomplished through existing programs, services and resources, \r\nas well as through the addition of new academic support initiatives, and scholarship \r\ncommunity activities. This initiative represents a congruence between NJCU's mission \r\nand the goals and purposes of the National Science Foundation's Computer Science, \r\nEngineering and Mathematics Scholarship Program. The Project enables the creation \r\nof a sustainable system for academics, student services and career planning supports \r\nfor our diverse student population, thereby increasing the technological capacity of our \r\nnation's youth, and strengtheing and diversifying of our nation's workforce.",
