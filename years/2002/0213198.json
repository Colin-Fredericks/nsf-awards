 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecologists have long recognized that spatial heterogeneity can be crucial for the generation and maintenance of biological diversity. For example, a diverse array of species can be maintained if environmental conditions vary from place to place, and if each species has a distinct set of conditions under which it can exclude other species.  Recently, theoretical studies have also shown that diversity can be maintained even if conditions do not vary from place to place; this can occur through a process called \"self-organization.\" Self-organization is the emergence of large scale patterns of coexisting species due only to local interactions among different species.  Whether self-organized spatial heterogeneity is generated by actual ecological communities (as opposed to communities simulated by a computer) is controversial.  This research project will use laboratory communities of microorganisms to study whether localized interactions can result in self-organized spatial heterogeneity, whether self-organized heterogeneity is sufficient to promote the coexistence of populations, and how self-organized communities change through evolution.\r\n\r\nAmong the most critical challenges facing humanity are the conservation, restoration and wise management of the Earth's diverse living resources.  To meet these challenges, society requires basic information concerning how these resources are generated and maintained.  This research project will generate such information. \r\n",
