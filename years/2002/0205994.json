There\r\nis mounting evidence that many galaxies grew from smaller units, and that galactic mergers may\r\nhave played a major role in determining the shapes and dynamics of certain remnants, and perhaps\r\neven of elliptical galaxies. However, the details of this assembly remain unclear, and there are\r\nseveral competing hypotheses for the formation of ellipticals. Fortunately, a few galactic mergers\r\nstill occur in the local universe and o.er valuable clues to the past assembly process.\r\nThe 1992 discovery that globular star clusters form in large numbers during mergers of gas-rich\r\ngalaxies has opened new avenues to studying the formation and evolution of globular clusters and\r\nof their host galaxies. Questions of current interest are: Is there an evolutionary link between\r\nglobular clusters formed in mergers and old globular clusters in giant elliptical galaxies? How\r\ndo systems of globular clusters formed in mergers evolve? Specifically, how do their luminosity\r\nfunctions, metallicity distributions, and kinematics evolve? Do galactic mergers imprint cluster\r\nsystems with kinematic signatures (e.g., fast outer rotation) that can be traced along a sequence\r\nof merger remnants of increasing age?\r\nThe Principal Investigator, Francois Schweizer, proposes carefully designed observational studies\r\nto address these questions. He points out that-whereas the birth of young clusters in ongoing\r\nmergers and the properties of old globular clusters in ellipticals have been studied widely in recent\r\nyears-there is a surprising lack of knowledge about globular-cluster systems of intermediate age.\r\nYet, these systems hold great promise for directly addressing the above issues.\r\nDr. Schweizer and collaborators were among the .rst to study globular clusters formed in mergers\r\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope and to follow up with ground-based spectroscopic observations\r\nto determine their ages and chemical abundances. He will now search for globular clusters of intermediate\r\nage (1 - 7 Gyr) in about a dozen galaxies thought to be transition objects between ongoing\r\nmergers (e.g., NGC 4038/39) and old ellipticals. He will use both the Baade 6.5-m telescope at\r\nLas Campanas Observatory and the Advanced Survey Camera on the Hubble Space Telescope to\r\nobtain some of the deepest images ever taken of these transition objects and their globular-cluster\r\nsystems. Photometric analysis of these images, as well as of Hubble archival images, will yield the\r\nchronology of these cluster systems from their broad-band colors.\r\nThe same deep images will also be used to study the evolution of the globular-cluster luminosity\r\nfunction with time. The luminosity functions of fresh-born cluster systems are power laws,\r\nwhile those of ancient systems are close to lognormal. Theory predicts that as globular-cluster\r\nsystems age, their luminosity functions should evolve from the .rst to the second shape through\r\npreferential erosion of low-mass clusters. Deep luminosity functions reaching past the predicted\r\nturnover magnitudes will be measured from the images to subject this prediction to a critical test.\r\nA parallel program of multi-slit spectroscopy mainly with the Magellan 6.5-m telescopes, but\r\nalso with the northern Gemini 8-m telescope, will yield metallicities and more accurate ages for some\r\nkey globular-cluster systems of intermediate age. Measurements of radial velocities for typically\r\n40 - 200 clusters per galaxy will permit comparative studies of the kinematics of metal-poor and\r\nmetal-rich globulars within the same galaxy. This will yield valuable clues about the origins of\r\nwhat are thought to be .rst- and 2nd-generation cluster subpopulations.\r\nThese observational studies will test all proposed formation mechanisms for ellipticals and\r\nwill-specifically-focus on possible evidence for an evolutionary link between 2nd-generation globulars\r\nformed in mergers and metal-rich globulars in old ellipticals. The results from this project\r\nwill help improve our understanding not only of globular-cluster formation and evolution, but also\r\nof galaxy formation and growth and, ultimately, of the origin of Hubble's morphological sequence\r\nof galaxy types.\r\n***\r\n",
