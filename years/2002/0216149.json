 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the acquisition of an automatic load actuator system for enhancing civil engineering research and research training at an undergraduate institute.  Currently the Department of Civil Engineering at Widener University has a Geotechnical, Concrete, and Structures Testing Laboratory that houses a 50,000 lb capacity testing frame equipped with a manually operated Enerpac hydraulic ram.   The available loading system, although crude, is suitable for teaching purposes and for destructive testing of structural members under static load conditions only.  The PIs are constructing a geotechnical testing box for future research purposes.  Planning for these and other research projects makes the acquisition of a closed loop loading system suitable for dynamic testing and deflection studies highly desirable.  Some of the areas of research include: (1) responses of geosynthetic-reinforced and pile-supported foundations under dynamic loads; (2) performance of fiber-reinforced polymer piles under horizontal dynamic loads; (3) geosynthetic-reinforced slopes under dynamic footing loads; (4) use of geosynthetic to span over sinkholes, (5) load-deflection response and crack patterns in FRP-reinforced concrete beams; (6) shear capacity of FRP-reinforced concrete beams; and (7) behavior of semirigid bolted connections in steel frames.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this automatic load actuator will provide the testing facility necessary for faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students at Widener University to conduct high-quality research projects in structural and geotechnical engineering.  This advanced testing system will establish a solid infrastructure for faculty to seek research funds from governmental agencies and private sectors and research collaborations with researchers at other research institutes.  The unique combination of the load actuator and the geotechnical testing box will attract high-quality researchers to use this advanced testing system for different research purposes.   Because students in the master's degree program at Widener University are primarily part-time, working full-time during the day and attending graduate courses part-time in the evening, most research projects have significant undergraduate participation.  A closed loop load actuator with dynamic data acquisition capabilities would provide the students with valuable knowledge of state-of-the-art tools for experimental work and the analysis and interpretation of data.  With increased research funds, more full-time students (including underrepresented groups and women) can be supported to pursue advanced degrees in civil engineering.  The acquisition of a load actuator system would also allow for significant enhancement of the civil engineering/structural portion of the Summer Camp program that has a five-year track record of success to inspire local high school students' interests in engineering research and careers.\r\n",
