 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop novel sandwich structures to address the sound transmission problem in various land and air vehicles such as automobiles, airplanes, and helicopters.  The research concept is motivated by the recent findings of sandwich structures made of anisotropic materials with normal-to-shear coupling to reduce sound transmission.  The proposed research consists of an integrated effort of micro-structural material modeling, structural-acoustic analysis, and optimization of sandwich structures for minimum sound transmission.  The objectives of the project are as follows:\r\n1.\tTo develop a mathematical theory describing the static and dynamic behavior of sandwich cores made of anisotropic materials, and to provide a foundation for structural-acoustic analysis and optimization of sandwich structures.\r\n2.\tTo carry out an extensive investigation of the sound isolation mechanism of flat and curved sandwich structures with anisotropic cores, and a study of the effect of incident angle of the sound wave and curvature of the structure on sound transmission.\r\n3.\tTo conduct an optimization study of sound transmission of sandwich structures with respect to various material and geometric parameters, and to develop sandwich structures with superior acoustic performance and guidelines for material selection and manufacturing of such sandwich structures.\r\nTraditionally, one of the research foci in composites has been lightweight and high strength laminates often with poor acoustic performance.  The sound transmission problem identifies the needs for new composite materials.  The project is anticipated to develop a body of new knowledge on the physical mechanism of sound transmission through sandwich structures made of anisotropic materials, and new methods for modeling, analyzing and optimizing anisotropic structures.  The resulting technology of this project will have a broad social impact, and will likely enhance the ability of American industry to produce quieter aircraft, helicopters and automobiles.  Furthermore, this project will involve women and other under-represented minorities, and encourage students from these groups to pursue a career in engineering research.\r\n\r\n",
