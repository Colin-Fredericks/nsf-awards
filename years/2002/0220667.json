 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the program is to recruit and retain top students into the Industrial & Systems Engineering Department with an emphasis on Information Systems Engineering. Scholarships are awarded to students at the undergraduate and graduate level who are pursuing degrees in Industrial and Systems Engineering and who are concentrating in information systems engineering. The scholarships are awarded based on merit and financial need. Recruiting is done through a multitude of channels to ensure a high quality pool of candidates. The number of scholarship recipients is 6 in the first year, 15 in the second year, 24 in the third year, and 30 in the fourth year. \r\n\r\nThe scholarship program builds on other programs in the College of Engineering including a research experiences for undergraduates (REU) program, a Telecommunications Institute, and a new degree track in Information Systems. The management plan includes mechanisms for tracking students, support activities, and an effective evaluation design. The tracking mechanisms are packaged into a system that can be used by any institution to measure the retention of engineering students. \r\n",
