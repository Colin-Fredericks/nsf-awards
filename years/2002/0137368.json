 "awd_abstract_narration": "0137368  Sierra  The objective of the research is to develop a biomineralization process in high-rate sulfate reducing bioreactors applicable to the removal and recovery of heavy metals from aqueous waste or process streams. Metal immobilization will be stimulated by biogenic sulfides produced by sulfate reducing bacteria. Copper (Cu) was chosen as model metal, since this contaminant is present at high concentrations in many industrial effluents (e.g., mining, semiconductor, metallurgical and metal-finishing industries) and is a particularly toxic priority pollutant.\r\n\r\nThe project will be initiated with continuous anaerobic bioreactors to determine the most suitable electron donor for sulfide production in mesophilic and thermophilic systems. The experiments will also assess the main factors controlling Cu removal from synthetic effluents. Molecular methods based on rRNA detection, electron microscopy and X-ray spectroscopy, will be used to evaluate the structure and function of the microbial population and to determine the speciation and distribution of the minerals in the anaerobic biofilm system.  The knowledge gained will be applied to elucidate the underlying mechanisms-and identify the key microorganisms responsible for Cu removal in sulfidogenic bioreactors.  In addition, a chemical equilibrium model will be developed to simulate Cu partitioning and removal in the bioreactors in order to facilitate process optimization. In the final part of the project, the treatment of a Cu-contaminated stream generated in semiconductor manufacturing (i.e., chemical mechanical planarization (CMP)) will be investigated to determine the efficiencies of Cu removal under practical conditions.  CMP effluents were selected because of their significance to the host institution's State and to enhance collaboration with the NSF/SCR Center.  It is anticipated that this research will lead to improved scientific and technological understanding of the potentials of sulfate reducing bioprocesses for metal decontamination.\r\n",
