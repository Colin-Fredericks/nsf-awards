 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NLANR Distributed Applications Support Team is focused on supporting\r\nresearchers and research communities in the use of resources embedded within\r\nhigh-performance networks and the middleware-based Grid environments that\r\ndepend on those networks. This proposal sets forth a plan for the next stage\r\nfor this leading edge team, building on previous efforts and assisting in\r\nthe maturing of user communities in the use of distributed resources\r\nconnected by advanced networks. This includes the development and extension\r\nof end-user and network engineer oriented tools for both high-bandwidth\r\noptical networks and low-bandwidth wireless networks, which will be the\r\ncritical network components for advanced applications in the next several\r\ndecades. Support functions will evolve from a focus on specific\r\nprojects to being a community support organization fostering the\r\ndevelopment, support, and growth of a global community of network engineers\r\nand network support staff working to advance networking in support of global\r\nscience. Outreach efforts will be expanded in raising awareness\r\nin new and emerging communities, such as those associated with major NSF MRE\r\nfunding, of the dependencies these projects have with respect to networking\r\ntechnologies.\r\n",
