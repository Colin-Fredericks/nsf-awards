 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to develop shape memory polymer (SMP) reinforced nanocomposites, a new class of materials for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS).  The fundamental scientific challenges to be addressed by the proposed research include the dispersion of nanoscale reinforcements in polymer matrix materials, fabrication of micron scale MEMS from nanocomposites by micro-casting and photopolymerization, and the realization and characterization of functional shape memory properties at micron scales.  The research will also investigate the size scale and geometrical limits on the processing of nanoreinforced SMP-based MEMS composites.  The effect of volume fraction and type of reinforcement on strain recoverability and stiffness (important for self-actuation) will also be characterized and modeled.  Mechanical characterization will be accomplished by using novel test structures/materials that can be deformed by micro-actuation via a micro-indentor or similar tool.  Nanomechanical modeling that incorporates the material nanostructure and unique polymer matrix properties will be used to guide processing and mechanical characterization studies.  Nanostructural characterization, necessary to provide a property-processing link, will be accomplished using electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, the proposed research on SMP-based nanocomposites in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) will have impact on micro scale actuation in complicated environments for many biomedical and microsensor applications.  The primary goal of the research is to develop fundamental tools/knowledge for the simultaneous engineering of nanomaterials and microdevices as these are intrinsically linked, and can not be attacked independently.  The work will provide processing routes for microcasting and photopolymerization of nanocomposites, and models that can be used to guide the fabrication and design of nanocomposites.  The research will also draw undergraduate and high school students into science and engineering via the unique interaction between design, nanomanufacturing, and characterization of functional SMP nanocomposites.  The research on these \"active\" nanomaterials will also be integrated into the Summer Multicultural Access to Research and Training (SMART) Program for underrepresented undergraduate students.\r\n\r\n",
