 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators organize an international conference on\r\nmathematics in biology.  The theme of the conference is\r\n\"Interdisciplinary Connections and Living Systems.\"  The goals of\r\nthe meeting are to highlight current top-level research, to\r\nprovide a perspective on future research areas, to provide\r\nopportunities for career development to junior researchers, and\r\nto foster interactions between established researchers and junior\r\nresearchers.  The conference is linked with a short course on the\r\nmathematics of biological complexity designed for biologists, in\r\norder to provide opportunities as well for new collaborations to\r\ndevelop between empirical researchers and theoreticians.\r\n     Quantitative approaches are becoming central to all\r\ncomponents of research in the life sciences.  With the rapid\r\nexpansion of bioinformatics, computational biology, and\r\nproteomics, the underlying mathematical approaches that are\r\nessential to these fields are recognized as critical to further\r\ndevelopments.  Applications of mathematics to many areas that\r\ndirectly affect humans allows us to better evaluate the impacts\r\nof alternative management of natural systems, develop new\r\ntechniques useful in biotechnology, and design more appropriate\r\nresponses to health problems.  The rapid developments in these\r\nareas require opportunities in particular for young researchers\r\nto gain perspective on the broad range of subjects that now\r\ndefine mathematical biology.  The conference provides a method to\r\ncarry this out as well as allowing younger researchers to\r\nparticipate in a formal mentoring program designed to enhance\r\ntheir ability to pursue a successful scientific career.\r\n",
