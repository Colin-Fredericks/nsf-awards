 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13)\r\n\r\nThis project continues work begun under Award No. 9950551.\r\n\r\nThe project is developing, evaluating, and disseminating educational devices, software, and curriculum materials that center on the nature of light, optics, color, and perception. The major innovation of the project is the introduction of \"homelabs\" about light into college science courses. These inquiry-based, quantitative laboratory experiences are designed for students to perform in their own homes. Many of these activities take advantage of the unique properties of computers, allowing students to use inexpensive optical materials to manipulate, explore, and study the light coming from their monitors. In the Project LITE \"proof-of-concept\" phase (funded through NSF Award No. 9950551), the investigators conducted the initial development and testing of a number of these homelabs.\r\n\r\nThe basic educational goal of the homelabs is to encourage individualized hands-on (and \"eyes-on\") learning. The use of homelabs also seeks to alleviate a major resource problem faced by many large, introductory-level, non-majors university science courses, arising from the limited availability of laboratory space, equipment, and teaching assistants.\r\n\r\nProject LITE materials are being developed and tested at Boston University. The national impact of individual homelabs is being extended by integrating them into community college, university, and high school courses in astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, and psychology, as well as into science courses for pre-service teachers. The homelabs are also useful for distance education, home learning, and adult continuing education.\r\n",
