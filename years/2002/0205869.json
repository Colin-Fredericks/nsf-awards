Streator, Georgia Institute of Technology\r\nYip-Wah Chung, Northwestern University\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nTo meet the demand for ever-increasing density of information storage, new recording technologies must be developed.   For example, a stated goal of the National Storage Industry Consortium is to achieve a storage density of 1 terabyte per square inch (1 Tb/in2) by 2005.    In this vein, researchers at Georgia Tech and Northwestern University propose a collaborative effort to investigate the viability of a new magnetic domain architecture for achieving ultrahigh recording densities.   The novel architecture consists of a patterned perpendicular recording media with discrete, electrically insulated magnetic domains that are slightly recessed below the disk surface.  The discrete nature of the domains prevents the thermal instabilities associated with continuous media and the superparamagnetic limit.  Having the domains slightly recessed 1 to 2 nanometers--as opposed to protruding 10-12 nanometers as with conventional patterned media concepts--is expected to provide much better flying characteristics through reduction of spacing modulation.  In addition, by having the domains electrically insulated, potential corrosion problems, which become increasingly likely with decreasing overcoat thickness, are virtually eliminated.   Fabrication of the patterned media will be accomplished in two ways:  (1) via nanosphere lithography and (2) via a focused ion beam (FIB) technique.   The nanosphere lithography will employ an array of monodispersed nanospheres as a lithographic mask, while the FIB method will involve direct high-resolution mask-less etching.   Characterization and evaluation in the proposed study will include topographical measurements, flyability studies and corrosion monitoring.  In addition, the investigation will involve numerical simulation of slider flight as well as fabrication process modeling.  Execution of this research plan will involve close collaboration between the two research groups.  If successful, the study will provide a blueprint for developing a cost-effective and robust means of meeting the high-density storage demands of the information storage industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
