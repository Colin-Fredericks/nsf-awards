 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports meetings and other activities of the National Academy of Science's Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA).  The role of the Board is to identify important new developments at the scientific forefronts, foster interactions with other fields, strengthen connections to technology and facilitate effective service to the nation by the scientific community.  Members of the BPA are drawn from universities, industry and federal laboratories.  Meetings are devoted to evaluating activities being carried out under its auspices, discussing critical issues and developing new initiatives.  In general, studies initiated by the BPA focusing on particular areas of physics and astronomy are carried out by ad hoc groups of experts in those areas.  Reports produced by these groups will have considerale impact in shaping the future directions of the field.",
