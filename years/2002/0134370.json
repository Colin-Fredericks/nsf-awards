Researchers have identified three mechanisms of earthquake-induced deformation in slopes: (1) sliding displacement along a localized shear surface, (2) deformation resulting from densification of unsaturated materials, termed seismic compression, and (3) distributed deformations resulting from accumulation of plastic strains in highly stressed regions of a slope, termed cyclic straining. While researchers have studied a number of issues related to sliding displacement, little effort has been devoted to understanding and developing analysis procedures for computing the magnitude and location of distributed deformations in slopes.\r\n\r\nThe research component of this career development plan employs physical models to study seismically induced distributed (versus localized) deformations in slopes. It uses both 1-g (shaking table) and centrifuge physical modeling methods, complemented by numerical analyses. The project also consider issues related to the reliability and repeatability of physical model experiments, and explores ways of increasing use of physical modeling in engineering practice. It also involves collaboration with physical modeling researchers at the Port and Airport Research Institute of Yokosuka, Japan.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives include: (1) Investigate the mechanisms of cyclic straining and seismic compression in slopes. (2) Understand how various earthquake, slope (topographic), and soil parameters influence the relative contributions of the three deformation modes to total slope deformation. (3) Develop systematic analysis procedures for computing the magnitude and locations of distributed slope deformations. (4) Assess the reliability of model test results, and to develop a reliability-based framework for interpreting model experiments. (5) Investigate ways of increasing engineering practitioners' use of physical modeling.\r\n\r\nThe educational component addresses the integration of physical modeling into the geotechnical engineering curriculum at Drexel University. Models are used for demonstration and experimental (laboratory) purposes. A wealth of educational psychology research suggests that physical models will improve students' understanding and comprehension of geotechnical engineering. The educational component also includes initiatives to encourage student intellectual growth through classroom instruction; involve undergraduate students in research; and expose school students to the concepts of experimental discovery.\r\n\r\nThis career development plan reflects the PI's long-term goals of using physical models to study, and ultimately, to reduce worldwide exposure to seismic hazards.\r\n-",
