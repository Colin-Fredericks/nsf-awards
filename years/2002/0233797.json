This Workshop on Opportunities in Materials Theory will focus on scientific areas identified by members of the materials theory community as fields in which there is high potential for significant progress and impact.  The workshop will highlight some of these areas.  Travel stipends will be provided to assist young faculty and postdoctoral associates in attending the workshop.  Sessions will also be held, particularly for young researchers, on opportunities for funding and on proposal preparation and evaluation.  A public lecture is also planned.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports a workshop to be held on October 14-16, 2002, at Georgetown University and the National Science Foundation.
