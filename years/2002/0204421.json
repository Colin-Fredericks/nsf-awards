 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: DMS 0204421.\r\n\r\nIn this project we will continue to study the deformed equivariant Dirac\r\noperators on open manifolds. We will use the nice spectral properties of these\r\noperators to construct new invariants of manifolds. In particular, we introduce\r\nthe regularized cohomology of equivariant holomorphic vector bundles over open\r\nKaehler manifolds. One of the goals of the project is to extend the vanishing\r\ntheorems and the semi-continuity theorem to non-compact setting. The\r\napplications will include the non-compact versions of Witten's holomorphic\r\nMorse inequalities and of the formula for the cohomology of the Mumford\r\nquotient, as well as new proofs of these results in the compact case. We also\r\nintroduce an analogue of the Quillen metric on the determinant of the\r\nregularized cohomology and are planning to study this metric. This will shed a\r\nnew light on the properties of the Quillen metric on compact manifolds. In\r\nparticular, in a joint project with A. Abanov we suggest a mathematically\r\nrigorous description of the non-linear sigma-model describing the\r\nsuperconductivity. Jointly with P.-E. Paradan we a planning to use the deformed\r\nDirac operator in the study of discrete series representations of Lie groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elliptic operators on compact manifolds have very nice properties. In this\r\nproject we introduce a class of operators on non-compact manifolds with similar\r\nproperties. The study of these operators not only leads to a generalization of\r\nmany theorems from compact manifolds to non-compact ones, but also provides new\r\nresults and methods in the theory of compact manifolds. The applications of\r\nthese results and methods range from the mathematical theory of\r\nsuperconductivity to representation theory and complex geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
