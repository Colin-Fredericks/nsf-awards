 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Stephen Crews at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to purchase a high speed Drosophila embryo sorter.  The Sorter allows large numbers of mutant organisms to be isolated for biochemical and molecular experimentation.  The overall goal of the research at UNC-Chapel Hill involves using genetics and the study of mutant strains of Drosophila to understand the molecular and cellular basis of animal development and physiology.  By comparing biochemical and cellular phenomena in mutant vs. non-mutant Drosophila strains, it can be determined how observed differences contribute to the biological process being studied.  In this way, it is possible to understand, in great detail, how molecules work together to generate complex biological structures and phenomena.  However, one major problem that has hampered progress is the inability to isolate sufficient numbers of mutant embryos for molecular and biochemical analyses.  The recent development of the embryo sorter, which combines the technologies of flow cytometry and the use of Green Fluorescent Protein transgenic Drosophila strains, now allows the isolation of sufficient numbers of embryos for biochemical studies.  The embryo sorter also allows high-throughput screening of mutant and transgenic embryos for the identification of novel mutants and genes.\r\n\r\nThe Drosophila group at UNC-Chapel Hill consists of 8 labs focused on the molecular genetics of embryonic development and physiology.  All of the labs are committed to understanding biological processes using a comprehensive array of technologies involving genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology.  Labs are interested in nervous system development, cell adhesion, hormonal control, cell signaling, cell cycle control, RNA splicing, gene transcription, and DNA repair.  Large numbers of embryos will be run through the COPAS Select to isolate pure populations of mutant embryos.  These embryos will be analyzed for changes in: (1) RNA populations and gene expression, and (2) protein levels and modifications.  This will provide important insight into the biological role that the mutant gene normally plays.  In addition, the COPAS Select will be used to sort through tens of thousands of embryos looking for those that have exceptional properties indicating the existence of novel genes, transgenic insertions, cellular markers, and mutations.  These new entities will allow the expansion of research efforts into promising new directions.\r\n\r\nDrosophila research has a number of benefits to the public involving novel insight into basic biological processes, human health, and agriculture.  One of the most important lessons learned during the past 20 years of biological research is that the genes carrying-out important biological processes in humans are conserved in Drosophila.  This includes many disease genes.  The same is true for insect pests.  Because of the advanced genetics of Drosophila, it is advantageous to initially study basic biological processes in Drosophila and then continue study in other species, including humans.  There are currently a number of biotechnology companies that are utilizing Drosophila to study problems in applied science.  It should also be emphasized that besides applied research, work on Drosophila has proven to be one of the best experimental systems for understanding how biological organisms function.  This basic knowledge is one of the cornerstones of 20th century science (5 Nobel prizes have been awarded to Drosophila researchers), and promises to provide spectacular results in the 21st century.  Further significance of the funded work concerns the educational mission of the University of North Carolina.  The Drosophila labs are active training grounds for postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students.  Use of sophisticated equipment, such as the COPAS Select, to solve complex scientific problems will enhance the education and productivity of these students.\r\n",
