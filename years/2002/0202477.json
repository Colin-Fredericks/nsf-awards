Viaclovsky's project has three parts. \r\nThe first part is joint work with Gang Tian, \r\ndealing with orbifold compactness of Bach flat \r\nmetrics in dimension 4. The second part is joint work \r\nwith Matt Gursky, and is about curvature functionals and \r\nconformal deformation of curvatures in dimension 3. \r\nThe third part deals with existence of solutions \r\nto some fully nonlinear equations in conformal geometry.  \r\nThe first project is to understand compactness properties \r\nof the moduli space of critical points of the L2 norm \r\nof the Weyl tensor in 4 dimensions. The Euler-Lagrange \r\nequations are known as the Bach equations, and there are \r\nmany known solutions, for example, metrics that are locally \r\nconformally Einsten, and self-dual or anti-self-dual \r\nmetrics. Since it is known that these metrics exist in \r\nabundance, it is an interesting problem to understand \r\nthe moduli space of solutions. The project of Viaclovsky \r\nand Tian is to show that, with certain geometric \r\nconditions, one may compactify this space by adding \r\nmetrics with orbifold singularities. The other parts \r\nof the project deal with fully nonlinear equations in\r\nconformal geometry. The goal is to conformally deform a \r\nmetric so that the kth elementary symmetric function of the \r\neigenvalues of the Schouten tensor is constant. This may \r\nbe viewed as a fully nonlinear generalization of the \r\nwell-known Yamabe problem. An application of this is to \r\nimprove the curvature by conformal deformation. For \r\nexample, given an initial metric, conditions are found so \r\nthat the metric can be conformally deformed to positive \r\nsectional curvature. \r\n\r\nThe project with Tian generalizes some well-known \r\nresults for Einstein metrics. Einstein metrics are \r\nparticularly interesting from the connection with Eisteins's \r\ntheory of general relativity, and the Bach equations \r\nare a natural higher order generalization \r\nof the Einstein equation. The work in conformal \r\ngeometry is naturally conformally invariant \r\nand also has applications in physics through \r\nconformal field theory. Firthermore, new notions of mass \r\narise for these equations, and this is also \r\nof interest in general relativity. These equations \r\nalso have applications to determining the topology \r\nof 3-manifolds, given some geometric constraint \r\non the curvature. \r\n",
