 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to explore the vapor-phase oxidesulfurization (ODS) of various organosulfur compounds found in petroleum feedstocks and to upgrade those compounds to valuable chemical products.  Simultaneously, a basic understanding of ODS catalysis will be investigated.  Preliminary studies have revealed that such organosulfur compounds can be selectively oxidized to valuable chemical intermediates (e.g., phenol, maleic anhydride, and formaldehyde). The objectives of the fundamental scientific ODS studies are to determine the: (1) molecular nature of the active surface sites present in model supported metal oxide catalysts, (2) number of surface sites required for the various reactions, (3) role of surface redox, acidic and basic sites, (4) role of the specific oxide support (ligand effect),  (5) fundamental kinetics and mechanisms and (6) molecular structure-reactivity/ selectivity relationships for ODS. \r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, the advantages offered by an ODS process are: (1) the use of free oxygen, rather than expensive hydrogen, (2) eliminates the need for costly reactor units for methane steam reforming, water-gas shift and Claus reactions, (3) production of significantly lower amounts of global warming carbon dioxide due to the minor unselective oxidation reaction pathways, (4) direct production of sulfuric acid that can be used in the alkylation processes in the petroleum refinery and (5) a supply of relatively inexpensive sulfur-containing feedstocks for the production of valuable chemical intermediates. The educational aspect will be the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students.  Thus, an ODS process to remove sulfur from fuels is a potentially attractive pollution control strategy. It is environmentally benign with low emissions.\r\n",
