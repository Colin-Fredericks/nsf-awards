 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czech materials research project involving Ctirad Uher of the University of Michigan and his Czech partner, Petr Lostak at the University of Pardubice, will build upon their recently reported observation of long-range ferromagnetism in a class of ansiotropic semiconductors based on antimony telluride [Sb2Te3], doped with a minute amount of vanadium.  They now plan to study the effect of transition metal ions incorporated in the crystal lattice of Sb2Te3 single crystals with the goal of identifying dopants that enhance the Curie temperature beyond the vanadium-doped value (~25K).  Specifically, the researchers will examine the role of chromium, manganese, iron, nickel and cobalt.  The collaborative effort benefits from the Michigan group's expertise in transport and magnetic properties of tetradymite-type structure semiconductors and the Czech partners' strengths in growth of single crystals and characterization of these materials.  Results in this area of diluted magnetic semiconductors may lead to applications in information technology given the promising dual features of charge carrier transport and spin manipulation in thin films.   \r\n\r\nThis collaborative project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
