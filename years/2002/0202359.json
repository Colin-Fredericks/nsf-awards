 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an interdisciplinary mathematics and science program that engages students and faculty in real world technology projects. The goal is to improve core mathematics and science education in an effort to better prepare remedial two-year college students for higher-level coursework and careers in technical fields. Instructional innovations integrate basic mathematics, elementary algebra, introductory physics, and basic reading, writing, and study skills. Activities include curriculum adaptation and implementation, industry field experiences for community college faculty and students, and professional development opportunities for regional community college instructors and K-12 teachers.\r\n\r\nAt its heart, this project remedies basic skill deficits and fosters motivation for the pursuit of technical careers among a regional student population increasingly under-prepared for college-level work in mathematics and science. To accomplish this mission, this three year effort: 1) establishes a year-long interdisciplinary mathematics and science learning community for developmental two-year college students that emphasizes problem solving and collaborative learning strategies; 2) integrates faculty internships and hands-on class projects into the curriculum to ensure workplace relevancy and enhance student motivation; and 3) facilitates regional training and dialogue activities for K-12 teachers and community college faculty, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary teaching methods, technology applications, and success strategies for underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nChabot College has established critical partnerships with the University of California, Davis, Edward Teller Education Center (ETEC), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and the Hayward Unified School District to support this initiative. ETEC and the national laboratories actively participate in curriculum modifications, faculty internships, and hands-on student class projects in robotics, optics, and laser technologies. Additionally, ETEC and the Hayward Unified School District collaborate on the project's faculty enhancement activities. \r\nThe project's underlying mission is to increase students' educational and career options through challenging, applications-oriented curriculum. Working collaboratively, this project revitalizes core mathematics and science education at Chabot College and serves as a model for developmental reform efforts.\r\n",
