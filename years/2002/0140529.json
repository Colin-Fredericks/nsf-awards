The removal and adhesion forces of slurry particles are greatly affected by the polishing, cleaning, rinsing and drying processes that follow the particle initial contact with the surface. In this proposed international collaboration between Hanyang University and Northeastern University, the interaction between slurry particles and wafer surfaces will be investigated by electrical characterization of the particles and wafer substrates and by measuring the removal and the adhesion forces of these particles. The goal of the project is to understand particle adhesion and removal mechanisms for submicron particles. Hydrodynamic removal forces and the effect of the zeta potential on slurry particle adhesion and removal will be investigated. The study will also determine the effectiveness of the cleaning techniques for each particle/film systems.\r\n",
