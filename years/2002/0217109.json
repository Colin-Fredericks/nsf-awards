 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will produce a one-hour general audience television program for Ohio and\r\nthe surrounding region designed to raise the awareness of the viewing audience to the \r\nproblemof gender inequity in our sciences, mathematics, engineering and technology \r\nworkforce. Wewill engage our audience by tracking the root cause of this inequity back \r\ninto our schools by examining the research done by NSF on women in SMET and exploring\r\nthe ways that teaching methods can be either a window of opportunity to young women \r\nor a closed door.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the attention of this general TV audience, the problem will be presented as a\r\nfast-paced mystery, why are we missing all this human potential in SMET? A top-selling\r\nmystery writer, Les Roberts, will host our audience in this investigation and he will be \r\nassistedby a young woman of high school age. His special guide in this quest will be \r\nDr. Kathryn Sullivan, the first woman to walk in space.  The program will examine\r\nNSF-identified researchthat will introduce and examine the problem. We will then \r\nexplore a variety of efforts by school, community, and businesses to correct this\r\ninequity. The program will conclude with suggestions on what the viewing audience -\r\n- parents, community members, business, and educators -- can do to channel the future \r\npotential of girls into SMET.  Once it has been broadcast in this region, The Case of\r\nMissing Human Potential will be offered to the national PBS network for national\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nAn interactive Web site designed to provide further information, suggestions for\r\nimproving the situation, and links to existing summer camps and programs will be\r\npromoted during the show. All participating stations will be encouraged to set up \r\n\"call-in\" sites staffed by local SMET teachers and researchers to address questions\r\nfrom the viewing audience. This special effort will be addressed during pauses in the\r\nbroadcast and will be designed to help the audience take action as a result of the\r\ninterest stirred up by this broadcast.\r\n\r\nTo draw new viewers we will publicize the show on all the PBS stations in Ohio; use\r\nthe state designated TIMSS Consortia of schools (representing about 500,000 Ohio \r\nstudents) to advertise the importance of this problem to parents and community \r\nmembers and to invite their involvement; highlight the upcoming show through \r\nOhioDL one of the primary communications means for schools using distance \r\nlearning in Ohio; and advertise the problem of gender inequity and the need for \r\nfamily and community action revealed in this TV program via the communication \r\nnetworks of the Ohio Mathematics and Science Coalition.",
