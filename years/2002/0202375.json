The materials will be targeted for the 11th and 12th grade levels and\r\nwill be designed to develop a comprehensive technical foundation for post-secondary\r\ncommunity college technician education. The materials will be designed to be delivered\r\nusing a constuctivist approach that utilizes a series of technological problem solving\r\nactivities. ProBase will provide pre-technical high school students with a comprehensive\r\ncurriculum, designed to prepare them to enter community college technician programs.\r\nProBase will develop and field-test curriculum materials designed to fill the gap between\r\n(a) the curriculum content standards developed at the national level (i.e., Standards for\r\nTechnological Literacy, the National Science Education Standards, and the Curriculum\r\nStandards for School Mathematics) and (b) the entry-level knowledge and skills needed\r\nby students entering community college technical education programs. This curriculum\r\nwill focus on core concepts identified in the Standards for Technological Literacy as well\r\nas a set of Bridge Competencies identified by the Community College consortium\r\ninvolved in the project. The materials will be produced and disseminated by the\r\nInternational Technology Education Association.",
