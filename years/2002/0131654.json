 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the brain there are cells called glial cells that are intimately involved with the functions of neurons (nerve cells), and astrocytes form a whole class of glial cells.  In mammals, astrocytes and neurons in an area called the arcuate nucleus show sexual dimorphism; during development, the cells in males become structurally different from the cells in females.  This differentiation is hormonally mediated by the steroid hormone estradiol, even though the astrocytes lack molecular receptors for estrogens, and there is evidence that the neurotransmitter compound GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) is involved.  This project uses biochemical and molecular approaches to test the hypothesis that estradiol modulates the release of GABA, which in turn modulates calcium influx, promoting the formation of gap junctions throughout the population, so the whole population can differentiate together despite the lack of estrogen receptors.\r\n   Results from this work will have an impact beyond neuroendocrinology, including developmental neuroscience and cell biology, and the relatively new area of glial neurobiology.  In addition, the project continues the PI's excellent record of training graduate students and community outreach.\r\n",
