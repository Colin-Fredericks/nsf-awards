 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will allow 23 scientists from U.S. universities to participate in an international conference on \"Southern Hemisphere Temperate Ecosystems and Biota: Contributions towards a Global Synthesis\" to be held January 2004 in Cape Town South Africa.  This conference will constitute the IV Congress of the Southern Connection, an organization of approximately 400 scientists with an interest in comparative studies of the biota and ecosystems of the southern hemisphere temperate latitudes.  The Congress will include plenary addresses, symposia, oral contributed papers, contributed posters, special discussion sessions on chosen topics including technical workshops, and field trips.  Works to be presented and discussed at the conference will describe the results of original research in fields such as ecosystem ecology (primarily terrestrial ecosystems but also marine ecosystems), evolutionary ecology, landscape ecology,  paleontology, plant-animal interactions, phylogeny, evolution, paleoecology, ecological and historical biogeography, biological invasions, vegetation history, and ecosystem restoration and sustainable management. This workshop is co-funded through Ecosystem Science; Ecology; Geography and Regional Sciences; and the Office of Science and Engineering.",
