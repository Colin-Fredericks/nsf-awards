 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nRecently, there has been growing interest in legume-rhizobia associations as\r\nmodel systems for studying mutualisms, but a central obstacle is that little is known about\r\nthe genetic structure of native communities. We know that associations can be specific\r\nor promiscuous, but very few studies have described spatial or temporal variation in\r\nnative rhizobia-legume communities. We intent to examine levels of spatial and\r\ntemporal variation in communities of rhizobia and legumes in natural environments. We\r\nwill compare associations at various geographic scales, from within nodules to between\r\ncanyons. We will measure how associations change over time, considering variation\r\nbetween months, seasons, and years. By considering specificity of associations and the\r\ngenetic structure of a native community, our goal is to better understand the potential for\r\ncoevolution to shape this mutualism. The proposed work uses sequences from 1329\r\nstrains from 15 plant species to characterize the effect of plant taxa, microhabitat\r\ndifferences, and seasonal differences on rhizobial genetic variation and specificity of\r\nassociations. We will contribute to the understanding of this imporant mutualism by\r\nseeking to describe natural systems in detail, characterizing rhizobial genetic diversity,\r\nand measuring the extent that specialization and generalization is achieved in naturally\r\nevolving populations.",
