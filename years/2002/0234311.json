These invariants appear to be closely related to gauge-theoretic\r\n(Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten) invariants, except that they have the\r\nadvantage of being more combinatorial in nature than their gauge-theoretic\r\npredecessors, and hence easier to calculate. To illustrate their strength,\r\none can reprove some results in four-dimensional differential topology\r\nwhich were obtained previously using gauge theory. These invariants also\r\nhave new topological applications which go beyond gauge theory. For\r\ninstance, they can be used to give new restrictions on knots whose\r\nsurgeries give lens spaces. The author hopes to further extend this\r\ntheory, to see what further insight they may give to topology in\r\ndimensions three and four.\r\n\r\nThe proposal deals with studying the intrinsic structure of three- and\r\nfour-dimensional spaces. The study of four-dimensional spaces was\r\nrevolutionized by Simon Donaldson in the early 80's by his introduction of\r\n\"gauge-theoretic techniques\". These techniques associate to a space the\r\nspace of solutions of certain partial differential equations (which come\r\nfrom mathematical physics). Course properties of these solution spaces are\r\nthen used to give insight into the finer structure of the underlying\r\nspaces on which the equations are defined. The proposal deals with efforts \r\nat circumventing these (often difficult to identify) auxiliary spaces of \r\nsolutions, to give more directly combinatorial approaches to understanding \r\nthe way three- and four-dimensional spaces fit together.\r\n\r\n",
