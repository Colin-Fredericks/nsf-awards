The work undertaken focuses on conceptual and empirical research that will extend the European project -- and which is done in close collaboration with a network of European and North American scholars. The PIs intend the work outlined here, in both substantive and organizational ways, to help the field of STS speak to vital public concerns about the role of technology in society.  More specifically, the project is intended to generate new knowledge about technology's role in 20th-century Europe, greater visibility and coherence for European studies of technology in the U.S., and a better comparative understanding of U.S. developments.   These collaborative efforts may serve as a model for STS research that is transnational in topic, organization, and method.\r\n\r\nSpecific activities include the following: [a] coordination and integration of the European project as a whole, with a goal of refining concepts and methods for conducting detailed empirical research related to \"big\" questions about technology in complex historical processes; [b] work on the \"cities\" theme of the larger project -- involving research, coordination, workshops, and publications; and [c] similar work on the \"colonialism\" theme of the project. The PI and co-PI are already deeply involved in the European network; through workshops and other efforts, the project seeks to encourage broader participation by other U.S. scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
