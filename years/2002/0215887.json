The work includes measuring motion at up to 250Hz using a marker-based motion capture system, acquiring dense range images, recording speech and contact sounds, and measuring forces and pressure distributions due to human contact. The facility will make a broad range of research activity possible. Multisensory models of objects will be developed; it will then be possible not only to see images of a virtual object, but to feel its stiffness and surface texture using a force feedback haptic device, and to hear its sound when hit. Multisensory models of human conversational behavior will be developed by tracking lip and arm movements at the same time as recording voice. \"Interaction capture\" will extend motion capture, the current state of the art for realistic computer animation. Hence, it will be possible to not only transfer and transform the motion of an animated character, but also the forces and sounds produced when the character interacts with the world. Moreover, the computing infrastructure needed to support interaction will be investigated. Multisensory interaction imposes new constraints on system behavior, particularly latency, and could lead to new designs of computer operating systems and communication networks. The instrumentation will enable more students to be educated about multisensory simulation and interaction, and to use multisensory environments in new ways to stimulate learning and discovery. Funds are requested for\r\n1. Sensor systems for interaction and measurement,\r\n2. Acoustical environment of experiment,\r\n3. Audiovisual displays, and\r\n4. Computing.\r\n",
