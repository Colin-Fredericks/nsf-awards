 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS- 0203637\r\n\r\nThe object of this proposal is to continue our research on the topics below using \r\ntechniques such as complex analysis, spectral theory, non-linear analysis and \r\nergodic theory: i) Spectral theory of the Laplacian on functions and forms - connections \r\nwith ergodic theory. ii) Global injectivity theorems. iii) Topology of umbilics. \r\niv) The generalized Hilbert theorem. Topic i) is a collection of problems coming from \r\n(and relating to) spectral and ergodic theory, dynamics, vanishing theorems and the \r\ntopology of manifolds of non-positive curvature. Topic ii) is an outgrowth of our efforts \r\nto understand embeddedness of minimal surfaces. It centers on the problem of \r\nfinding conditions for a local diffeomorphism between non-compact manifolds to be injective.\r\nThis type of question arises in areas of mathematics as diverse as algebraic geometry and \r\nmathematical economics. Our methods here come from geometry, topology and global analysis. \r\nTopic iii) is a classical problem in differential geometry namely, understanding the \r\ntopology of umbilical singularities. The plan is to continue studying this problem as a \r\nquestion about the blow-up of certain hyperbolic partial differential equations. \r\nTopic iv) is also a classical problem, dealing with isometric immersions of hyperbolic \r\nspaces. As in iii), we plan to approach this question as a blow-up problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our approach to research, starting with the earlier work on minimal surface theory, \r\nwe have always sought to achieve a balance between technique and creative mathematics. \r\nThis proposal is full of problems and ideas coming from diverse areas, such as spectral \r\ntheory, dynamical systems, hyperbolic equations, algebraic and Riemannian geometry. \r\nWe have already contributed to all these questions. Given the variety of topics, we would \r\nlike to believe that this proposal advances the \"internal\" conversation of mathematics. \r\nOn the other hand, the work on Global Inversion is potentially of interest to applied \r\ndisciplines, since it addresses the question of solvability of systems of non-linear \r\nequations.",
