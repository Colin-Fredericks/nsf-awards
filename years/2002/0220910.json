 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project, Fighting Engineers: The U.S. Navy and Professional\r\nMechanical Engineering, 1842-1900, investigates nineteenth century Navy social\r\nhierarchy, engineering style, and engineers. Navy engineers were few in number before\r\nthe Civil War, but the engineering corps expanded several fold during the war. Social\r\nconflict developed between combat and engineering officers, known throughout the\r\nsecond half of the century as the line-staff dispute. At stake was authority and prestige;\r\nline officers were unwilling to share either with shipboard engineers and fought against\r\nany encroachment on their traditional privileges. For their part, engineers rallied support\r\nin Congress, academia, and industry to gain the respect they felt they deserved.\r\nThis dissertation connects to a broader historical theme: government sponsorship\r\nof technology, an American phenomenon that often has a military genesis. From 1865 to\r\n1890, the U.S. Navy created modern mechanical engineering at the Naval Academy. The\r\nformation of this new body of technical knowledge had dramatic and unforeseen\r\nmultiplier effects for the nation. By century's end, Navy engineer veterans directed the\r\nlargest industrial corporations in the country and taught at its finest universities. They\r\nwere one critical but overlooked factor in nineteenth century American economic\r\ndevelopment.  Funds for this project support research at the National Archives in Washington, D.C.\r\n",
