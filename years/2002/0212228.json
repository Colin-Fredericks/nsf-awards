 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Kenneth E. Sassaman and colleagues will investigate the circumstances surrounding abandonment of the middle Savannah River valley (Georgia and South Carolina) by the fourth millennium  BC Stallings Culture. As part of the Shell Mound Archaic, Stallings Culture developed over several centuries to include stationary riverine settlements, an intensive, aquatic-based subsistence economy, and numerous technological innovations, including the first pottery in the North America.  Around 3500 years ago, major habitation sites were abandoned as groups dispersed into the adjacent uplands to resume a mobile lifestyle.  Archaeological research on foragers shows how local resource abundance contributes to sociopolitical complexity, but we know comparatively little about the sustainability of such institutions relative to the ecological conditions that enabled them.  The proposed work is designed to ascertain the local environmental impacts attending increasingly intensive land-use and the extent to which such impacts contributed to regional abandonment.  Over the past decade, excavations at four Stallings habitation sites in the middle Savannah region have yielded a large inventory of paleoecological and artifactual data spanning the rise, florescence, and demise of local Stallings communities.  Analyses of the animal and plant remains, wood charcoal, land snails, and material culture from these sites are designed to test five hypotheses: (1) subsistence economies over the course of Stallings prehistory diversified; (2) diversification resulted from diminishing returns on high-ranking resources; (3) diminishing returns on high-ranking resources resulted from overexploitation by Stallings communities; (4) overexploitation resulted from permanent use of local environments; (5) technological innovations contributed to, rather than alleviated, economic stress.  All analyses will be conducted by graduate research assistants under the supervision of faculty consultants in archaeobotany, zooarchaeology, malecology, and prehistoric technology.  The relevance of the proposed work is manifold.  Stallings prehistory represents one of the few cases worldwide of a truncated historical sequence of increasing sociopolitical complexity.  Whereas archaeologists have devoted much attention to the transition from foraging to farming, and thence the rise of the state, virtually no studies have been conducted to examine the failure of increasingly intensified forager economies and societies to \"evolve.\"  A related issue is changing perceptions of human ecology.  Ethnographic foragers have long been conscripted as evolutionary ideals whose patterns of mobility, food-sharing, and simple technology were a keen adaptation to preagricultural conditions. A growing body of evidence shows that some ancient forgers engaged in land-use practices that irrevocably changed entire ecosystems and historical trajectories.  This, in turn, bears relevance on modern environmental restoration policy. Just as there are arguably no \"pristine\" foragers in the ethnographic present to model pre-Western society, there are arguably no \"pristine\" ecosystems over the course of human history for which to model environmental restoration efforts.  Accurate portrayal of both ecosystem and cultural diversity requires deep historical context, and the Stallings archaeological record offers an unparalleled opportunity to assemble a detailed ecological history for comparative uses in anthropology, conservation, and environmental policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
