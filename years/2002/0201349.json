 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cable-Stayed bridges are commonly exhibiting large-amplitude vibrations of the main stays, frequently associated with the simultaneous occurrence of wind and rain.  These vibrations are of concerns because they potentially induce fatigue in the cables and cable anchorages.  Past research on excitation mechanisms has generally been conducted using wind tunnels, and several distinct aerodynamic mechanisms have been proposed.  While considerable progress has been made in understanding and mitigating these vibrations, the state of the art has still not enabled the prediction of field behavior based on a set of supplied parameters, nor does a plausible, accepted model exist for the phenomenon.  This research effort is building upon previous findings and the wealth of full-scale data collected in past projects in order to develop an understanding of the mechanics of stay-cable vibration at a more fundamental level and to enable the recommendation of more effective and economical mitigation strategies.",
