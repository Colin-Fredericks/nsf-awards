 "awd_abstract_narration": "COMPACT-AGEP PARTNERSHIP\r\nThis proposal seeks to expand a pilot project begun two years ago between the Minority Graduate Education (MGE) program and the Compact for Faculty Diversity's Institute on Teaching and Mentoring. The proposed project would continue and expand Institute participation to all AGEP programs, as well as provide the full array of program activities and services that have contributed significantly to the Compact' s success.\r\n\r\nThe Compact is a nationwide program initiated in 1994 involving three regional organizations, the New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE), the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), and the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). The goal of the program is simple; to increase the number of minority graduate students who earn the doctoral degree and seek careers as college and university faculty.\r\n\r\nExtending the experiences of the pilot group to scholars in every AGEP program and expanding the services these scholars receive is what this initiative will accomplish.  Specifically, the proposed Compact/AGEP partnership will achieve two broad goals: 1) provide AGEP scholars with knowledge, skills, academic mentoring, and support that will increase the likelihood of success in graduate school; and 2) enhance preparation for a career as a college or university faculty member. The project has five key objectives:\r\n\r\nObjective 1: To provide an array of direct support services to AGEP scholars that will increase the likelihood of completion of the doctoral degree. These services include regular contact by staff; review of student progress and grades; a newsletter; academic counseling and advocacy; mentoring, and professional development opportunities.\r\nObjective 2: To provide training in skills and techniques of succeeding in a Ph.D. program in SEM.\r\nObjective 3: To prepare AGEP scholars for successful transition from graduate school to a faculty position.\r\nObjective 4: To provide expanded networking and academic community building support to AGEP scholars.\r\nObjective 5: To provide training to the faculty mentors of AGEP scholars in effective mentoring techniques and practices.\r\n\r\nThe Compact's annual Institute on Teaching and Mentoring is clearly the \"centerpiecel\" of Compact activity. This three-day, fall meeting of more than 500 participants provide a forum for students and faculty mentors to discuss issues critical to success at the doctoral level. Attendees participate in workshops and seminars that range from how to survive graduate school to what is expected of a junior faculty member, with particular attention given to enhancing research, teaching, and mentoring skills, career preparation, proposal writing, negotiating the first job, and networking. With the majority of Compact scholars representing science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) disciplines, particular attention is paid to the issues specific to scholars and faculty. \r\n",
