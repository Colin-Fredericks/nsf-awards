 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the potential for augmenting damping in\r\ncomposite structures by taking advantage of the energy dissipation between\r\ndensely packed, highly interconnected networks of multi-walled carbon\r\nnanotubes (nano-films) . The novel, nano-engineered damping films\r\ndeveloped in this project are expected to offer several advantages: \r\n1) Nano-films show no degradation in structure/properties upto 600 deg C \r\nand are expected to offer superior performance and reliability for high\r\ntemperature applications. 2) Nano-films do not exhibit resin penetration\r\nwhen co-cured within composite structures and could potentially be\r\nseamlessly integrated into heterogeneous systems. 3) Nano-films offer\r\nmulti-functionality in terms of enhanced stiffness in addition to damping\r\naugmentation. The specific stiffness of nano-films are expected to be an\r\norder of magnitude greater than commercially available viscoelastic\r\npolymer films. This research project is directed towards further exploring\r\nand developing these concepts so as to enable the efficient synthesis of\r\nthese novel multifunctional materials into multi-scale structural systems.\r\n\r\nThe project involves strong interdisciplinary collaboration between\r\nmaterial science (patterning and assembly of nanostructures) and\r\nmechanical engineering (damping and stiffness increase in composites). \r\nThe project will contribute to the training of 1 Ph.D student and several\r\nundergraduate students (under the Undergraduate Research Projects - URP\r\nProgram) at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. \r\n\r\n",
