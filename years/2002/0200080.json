 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the areas of harmonic analysis and\r\nwavelets concerning the mathematical theory of multi-\r\ndimensional wavelet expansions. One of the fundamental\r\nproblems of the subject is how to construct higher dimensional\r\nwavelet bases with desired characteristics, e.g., wavelets with\r\ngood time-frequency properties. These areas of research have\r\nseen significant progress due to the contributions of I.\r\nDaubechies, R. Coifman, and Y. Meyer, along with many others.\r\nHowever, the majority of research has been concentrated on\r\nisotropic theory, leaving many questions involving non-\r\nisotropic wavelet theory unanswered. The proposer will\r\ninvestigate this theory of non-isotropic wavelets from three\r\ndirections. The first is to study non-isotropic analogues of\r\nthe standard function spaces associated with expansive dilations.\r\nIn particular, to examine characterization by wavelet expansions\r\nof Calderon-Zygmund operators associated with non-isotropic\r\ndilations. The second is to construct orthogonal wavelets with\r\ngood time-frequency localization for large classes of non-\r\nisotropic expansive dilations. The third is to identify non-\r\nisotropic expansive dilations for which the construction of\r\nwell-localized wavelets is impossible.\r\n\r\nMore generally, this proposal represents work on wavelet\r\nanalysis which is a powerful technique in harmonic analysis.\r\nThis technique has produced wide-ranging applications to signal\r\nand image processing, such as the JPEG 2000 image compression\r\nsystem. It is expected that further research on multi-\r\ndimensional non-isotropic wavelets will continue to produce many\r\nother contributions in pure and applied mathematics.",
