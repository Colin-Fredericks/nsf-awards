 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS - 0200810.\r\n\r\nOne motivation for this project comes from F theory/heterotic string\r\nduality. In this duality, given the data of an elliptically fibered\r\nCalabi-Yau manifold, a principal bundle over it with the appropriate\r\nstructure group and connection, and a B-field, which is roughly like a\r\nholomorphic 2-form, one expects to find a new Calabi-Yau manifold fibered in\r\nelliptic K3 surfaces over the same base. A second motivation is to\r\nunderstand some of the mathematical issues raised by the first question, in\r\na purely mathematical framework. These issues lead to a rich set of\r\nquestions concerning two or more commuting elements in compact Lie groups,\r\nconjugacy classes in semisimple algebraic groups or complex Lie algebras,\r\nthe moduli space of semistable principal bundles over elliptic curves, and\r\nthe geometry of del Pezzo surfaces and K3 surfaces.\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with the study of certain geometric structures\r\narising in mathematics and physics. One goal of this study is a mathematical\r\nunderstanding of the relation between two physical theories of elementary\r\nparticles arising from string theory. The relationship is best expressed\r\nmathematically by relationships between several geometric structures. These\r\nrelationships, and various generalizations, are also very interesting from a\r\nmathematical point of view, because they are connected with the possible\r\nsymmetries of spaces in any number of dimensions and with geometric\r\nstructures connected with these symmetries.\r\n",
