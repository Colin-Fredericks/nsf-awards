 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2002.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. \r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Retrieving novel bacterial genes involved in aromatic compound degradation from natural environments using  Acinetobacter as a host.\"  Many naturally-occurring aromatic compounds are broken down by microbes via the beta-ketoadipate pathway.  This research manipulates the genetic system of a naturally transformable soil bacterium and uses it as a vehicle for understanding the versatility and diversity of this ecologically important pathway in uncultivated natural bacterial assemblages.\r\n",
