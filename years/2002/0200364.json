 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on the Theory of Symmetric Functions and its \r\napplications to Representation Theory and Combinatorics.  The \r\nconnection between Representation Theory and the Theory of \r\nSymmetric Functions is provided by the Frobenius map which \r\nrelates group characters to symmetric functions. Combinatorics  \r\nplays a role in that multiplicities of irreducibles are  often \r\nobtained by counting tableaux, paths, trees and a growing variety \r\nof newly emerging  discrete structures. In the more than ten years \r\nsince its discovery, the Macdonald basis has progressively emerged \r\nas a central element in these connections.  For more than a decade \r\nof research in the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials, the \r\ninvestigator and M. Haiman  have been led to a variety of \r\nconjectures in Representation Theory, Algebraic Geometry, \r\nCombinatorics and  Symmetric Function Theory. Efforts in proving \r\nthese conjectures have yielded fundamental facts and methods  in \r\neach of these areas.  More recently the investigator discovered a \r\nvariety of summation formulas (PNAS V. 98 (April 2001) 4313-4316) \r\nwhich permitted the proof of the first significant positivity \r\nresult in the Theory of Macdonald Polynomials. In joint work with \r\nJ. Haglund the investigator proved a beautiful combinatorial \r\nformula (conjectured by J. Haglund) for a rational function which \r\nhad come to be known as the $q,t$-Catalan. The investigator in \r\ncollaboration with students and associates plans to use his \r\nrecently discovered symmetric function identities for a direct \r\nattack of some of the conjectures that are still unresolved.\r\n\r\nThe Theory of Symmetric Functions is a powerful symbolic \r\nmanipulation tool. The reason for this is that non linear problems \r\nmay often be linearized by the introduction of an infinite number  \r\nof variables. Now it develops that the change of bases matrices  \r\nof Symmetric Function Theory  may be used to \"mimic\" the presence \r\nof infinities within a finite device, thereby permitting the \r\nlinearization and solution of many a computational problem. \r\nDiscoveries in the theory and applications of symmetric functions, \r\nshould also turn out to be of significant impact in the various \r\nareas of mathematics in which symmetric function methods  have been \r\nshown to be effective.  This given, we can see how important it is \r\nto pursue investigations in the  Theory of Symmetric functions \r\nthat extend and deepen the computational power of the theory.  \r\nThis is the foremost goal of the present project.",
