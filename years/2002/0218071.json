 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a conference on social science disciplines and American Indian peoples. The conference (a) integrates existing knowledge of Native psychology and develops a research agenda for advancing such knowledge, (b) exchanges information on strategies and tools for teaching Native social science and developing a model for such courses and curricula, (c) examines ways to better integrate social research, teaching and practice with the needs and goals of Native communities, and (d) plans strategies for enhancing links between social science and Native communities. \r\n\r\nNative communities and individuals face a variety of unique problems and opportunities. Effective scientific assistance is needed to help address those problems and opportunities.  Skills and expertise from social science could play a critical role in assisting with such important issues as Native economic advancement, educational attainment, community and individual health, and management of tribal resources and services. The potential value of psychological science to these outcomes especially exists because many past efforts to execute applied projects in Native communities have floundered as much or more due to human factors (such as factional infighting, poor planning, poor leadership, or inadequate skills) as because of financial or technological inadequacies to the projects. Social science has only scratched the surface in investigating the unique dynamics of Native cultures, Native social patterns, and Native psyches. This project will 1) summarize the state of social science knowledge of Native individuals and communities. 2) Develop a social science research agenda.  3) Promote exchanges and development of collaborations among social science researchers who focus on Native issues. 4) Plan a curriculum to teach Native Psychology and create an educational pipeline and an educational structure to develop Native Psychology scientists. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",
