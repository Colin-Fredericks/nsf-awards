The objectives are to integrate fluorescent and phase-contrast microscopy into all levels of the Wartburg College biology curriculum and to enhance student access to the instrumentation and their ability to use microscopic techniques in student research projects. Students are introduced to the use of fluorescent and phase-contrast microscopy in the introductory Biology course, and gain expertise in subsequent courses, Microbiology, Microbial Ecology, Cell Biology, and Student Research. These courses provide other opportunities for the use of these microscopes in inquiry-based labs and undergraduate research. Inquiry-based lab exercises are being developed as adaptations from the contemporary research literature. The students are also be trained in still-frame and video-capture techniques so they can document, present, and publish their results. The impact of the project on student learning is being assessed using cumulative digital image portfolios and lab practicals. The results of the assessment and student-generated projects will be disseminated through a Web site and presentations at national meetings.\r\n\r\n",
