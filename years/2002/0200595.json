 "awd_abstract_narration": "A graph is perfect if for every induced subgraph, the chromatic \r\nnumber is equal to the maximum size of a complete subgraph. The \r\nStrong Perfect Graph Conjecture (SPGC) of Berge from 1960 asserts \r\nthat a graph is perfect if and only if it has no induced subgraph \r\nisomorphic to an odd cycle of length at least five, or the \r\ncomplement of such a cycle. A related open question is whether \r\nperfectness can be tested in polynomial time.  The PI and his \r\ncolleagues are pursuing a strategy for proving the SPGC. They \r\nhave formulated several conjectures about graph decomposition\r\nthat together with earlier conjectures and results imply the SPGC, \r\nand are working toward establishing the validity of those \r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\nThis work falls within the area of graph theory, and is closely \r\nrelated to theoretical computer science and mathematical \r\nprogramming (operations research). A graph is an abstract \r\nmathematical notion used to model networks, such as telephone \r\nnetworks, transportation networks or the Internet. Within graph \r\ntheory the class of perfect graphs is important for several \r\nreasons. For instance, many problems of interest in practice that \r\nare intractable in general can be solved efficiently when \r\nrestricted to the class of perfect graphs. Also, the question of \r\nwhen a certain class of linear programs always have an integer \r\nsolution can be answered in terms of the perfectness of an \r\nassociated graph. Thus the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture is \r\nbelieved to be an important open problem, and its resolution\r\nis likely to have implications in the design of efficient \r\nalgorithms of interest to theoretical computer scientists and \r\noperations researchers.\r\n",
