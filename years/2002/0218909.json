Fortier\r\nUniversity of Massachusetts at Dartmouth\r\n\r\nTitle: \"Collaborative research: Computerized Decision Aid for Acute Care Nursing\"\r\n\r\n   This project addressed problems associated with building Decision Support Systems to serve nursing. Most healthcare environments call upon nurse clinicians to make complex decisions on a contiual basis. Automated decision support systems backed by evidence-based knowledge and standardized guides, such as clinical algorithms, are capable of supporting clinical nursing decisions. However, effective real-time access is limited. This project addresses this problem by delivering current clinical knowledge via an off-the-shelf handheld computer using wireless access to a central server.  Innovative data mining and knowledge discovery algorithms, using a combination of case based and rule based learning with added confidence measures, permit bi-directional inferencing based on individual client data. This technology provides real-time decision support for the multiple cases and sequential decisions characterzing present nursing practice. Nurses are able to consider a full range of alternative explanations, determine addtional data needs, find, isolate and examine patient case outliers for additional diagnostic data or verify the appropriateness of a  selected strategy. A fully developed system may have the capacity to maintain a history of series of decisions and outcomes thereby, overtime, improving the case base and rule bases used for decision support. Outcomes of this real time decision support may include timely health care, less biased decisions, and improved patient outcomes.",
