 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nMany aquatic communities have been shown to be under top-down control, while most systems\r\ndominated by vascular plants are assumed to be controlled by bottom-up forces. For nearly\r\n50 years, the prevailing paradigm in salt marsh ecology has been that bottom-up forces,\r\nsuch as nutrient availability, are the primary determinants of marshgrass production. In\r\nthis proposal, we show that the standing crop of the dominant plant in western Atlantic\r\nsalt marshes is reduced wholesale and the substrate completely denuded when predators do\r\nnot suppress densities of the most common grazing invertebrate in southeast marshes, the\r\nperiwinkle Littoraria irrorata. Before these results can be generally accepted, however,\r\nthe apparent contradiction between our observations that Littoraria graze extensively on\r\nlive Spartina and the current paradigm which holds that Littoraria is the most important\r\ndetritivore in the marsh system must be resolved. To do this, we present a detailed\r\nresearch plan to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the Littoraria - live Spartina\r\ninteraction. Results from this study will likely force us to reevaluate our current\r\nunderstanding of marsh systems and add critical information to the ongoing debate as to\r\nwhether or not vascular plant communities are susceptible to run-away consumer effects.",
