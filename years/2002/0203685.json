It is the goal of the proposed project to pursue a unified approach to all of these insights in an effort to put software architectures of linear algebra libraries for this domain of operations on a solid scientific footing.  We will undertake a one year pilot project that will demonstrate the following: (1) The systematic approach can be used to derive highly efficient kernels for specialized dense linear algebra operations that are encountered in sparse direct methods; (2) The abstract program interface that has been demonstrated to allow high-performance implementation of dense linear algebra operations will be extended to apply to sparse matrices that are viewed as hierarchical matrices; (3) We will lay the foundation for a mathematical description of sparse matrices as hierarchical matrices which we believe will allow the derivation methods to be extended to operations on hierarchical matrices. \r\n\r\n",
