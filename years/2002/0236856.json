 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Anna-Louise Reysenbach of Portland State University and Dr. John Heidelberg of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) have been awarded a grant to sequence the entire genomes of two new heat-loving (thermophilic) microorganisms. The project will be completed in 1 year and serve as an educational template for a K-12 teachers workshop. The data will be publicly available.\r\nThese two microbes are of interest as they are closely related but one (Persephonella marina) was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent in the Pacific Ocean and the other (strain Az-Fu1) from a terrestrial hot spring on the island of Sao Miguel, Azores. They both use inorganic chemicals for their energy and their source of carbon. In their natural environment, members of this group are often associated with mineral precipitates such as iron sulfides, pointing to their potential role in removal of contaminating metals from the environment. Furthermore, the deep position of these isolates within the eubacterial domain on the universal tree of life suggests that they may be good models for studying the features of early evolution of life on Earth. This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture.\r\n",
