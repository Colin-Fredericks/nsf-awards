 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with questions related to the behavior of\r\nsolutions to nonlinear wave equations under perturbation. In particular we\r\nare concerned with geometric PDEs such as wave maps and Schrodinger maps.\r\nThese equations can be viewed as constrained motion in space where the\r\nconstraint  forces the solution to lie on a subspace such as a manifold or\r\na metric space.  This leads to  singularly perturbed  wave and Schrodinger\r\nequations.  We propose to study the relationship between the wave map\r\nequations  and the constrained motion in terms of convergence and in terms\r\nof the dynamics of solutions. Specifically we propose to study: 1)\r\nConvergence of the constrained motion when the data are  not \"well prepared\"\r\nleading to  rapid oscillations;  2) the persistence of periodic,\r\nquasi-periodic, and homoclinic orbits  that asymptote to quasi-periodic\r\norbits;  3) wave maps into the Heisenberg Group, as a metric space; and\r\nfinally 4) the relationship between Schrodinger maps and wave maps, where\r\nthe wave map is considered as a constrained motion on a Lagrangian\r\nsubmanifold of the Schrodinger map into a Kahler manifold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of many physical systems can be described by geometric\r\nevolution equations.  For example dynamics of the magnetization field  in a\r\nferromagnetic material is described by the Landau-Lifshitz equation;  the\r\nstudy of a vibrating membrane in a crystalline structure  where there is a\r\nuniform distribution of  dislocations,  is described by wave equations into\r\nthe Heisenberg Group (which also arises in other physical applications such\r\nas control theory, and the motion of robot arms).  These geometric evolution\r\nmodels need not be exact, but should be considered as a limit of a\r\nsingularly perturbed system.  The general questions that we propose to study\r\nare: What relationships exist between solutions of the geometric equations\r\nand the singularly perturbed equations?  How much of the rich dynamical\r\nstructure (periodic, quasi-periodic, and breather type solutions) that the\r\ngeometric equations have  will persist under this type of singular\r\nperturbation? One of the major goals of our work is to develop analytical\r\nmethods to deal with convergence questions related to this type of\r\nperturbations.  Another important goal is to develop and use infinite\r\ndimensional dynamical systems techniques in conjunction with analytical\r\nmethods to answer the persistence question and  ultimately to bridge the gap\r\nbetween finite dimensional  dynamical systems and  PDEs.\r\n",
