 "awd_abstract_narration": "0213187\r\nHooper\r\nThe search for patterns of community assembly has occupied the last 25 years in\r\ncommunity ecology and remains controversial today. A commonly sought assembly rule is that\r\nspecies coexistence in communities will be enhanced by differences in traits related to\r\ncompetition for limiting resources (i.e., that niche overlap is minimized). Put another way, do\r\nspecies from complementary guilds or functional groups have a better chance of persisting than\r\nthose with strong overlap in resource use characteristics? Evidence for the role of\r\ncomplementarity among plant groups in structuring communities is sporadic. The balance\r\nbetween rates of external stochastic processes (such as disturbance or priority effects of\r\ncolonization) compared to internal community dynamics (such as competition or facilitation)\r\nmay be critical in determining the degree to which internal assembly dynamics are manifested.\r\nGaining further insight into this question is critical for understanding how communities might be\r\nstructured, and for the implications of that structure for ecosystem dynamics.\r\nWe propose a five-year experiment to assess the roles of initial plant composition and\r\nfunctional complementarity in structuring communities of serpentine annual grasslands. We\r\nseek to test several hypotheses centered on the following questions, generally grouped into two\r\nthemes: 1) Does the initial composition of a community shape its subsequent development? If so,\r\nfor how long? Are there different stable endpoints? 2) To what extent does complementary\r\nresource use (i.e., niche differentiation) versus dominance among plant species govern patterns\r\nof community development? Are other factors, such as seed input or climatic conditions more\r\nimportant in determining community composition? Our goal is not to prove or disprove the\r\npredominance of assembly rules, but rather to better understand the conditions under which they\r\nmight strongly influence community composition versus be overwhelmed by other factors.\r\nWe will use as our experimental system a series of California serpentine grassland\r\ncommunities that vary in functional group composition and richness. Functional composition\r\nhas been maintained since the plots were established in 1992. In fall 1999 and 2000, seeds of six\r\nadditional species (3 species each from two groups) were added to test the effects of functional\r\ncharacteristics and diversity on invasibility of ecosystems. Thus we now have a system with\r\ntreatments that differ in initial functional composition, that have had common seed sources for a\r\nnumber of additional species, and that will be subject to continuing seed rain from surrounding\r\ngrasslands. Our plan is to track changes in community composition over the next five years as\r\nthe communities develop from their initially different starting points.  Monitoring of vegetation changes in these experimental communities through the next several years provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into interactions among a variety of processes that help shape ecological communities.",
