 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general area within which this research is performed is known as\r\ncomputational learning theory.  The starting point for research in this\r\narea is typically the definition of mathematical models of what the term\r\n``learning'' may mean in a variety of settings.  The concept of learning\r\ncaptured by these models is then formally analyzed, frequently leading\r\nto algorithms for solving learning problems within the models as well as\r\nto proofs that certain problems cannot be solved.  These\r\nlearning-theoretic models and results lend support to more applied work\r\nin machine learning, which in turn has demonstrated utility in\r\napplications ranging from e-commerce to advanced research on vehicles\r\nthat drive themselves.\r\n\r\nThis project adds to the existing body of learning-theoretic knowledge\r\nin a number of ways, including analysis of a relatively new model called\r\nProbably Exactly Correct learning, development of an algorithm that\r\nlearns arguably the broadest class of functions yet shown to be\r\nlearnable (majority of AC0 functions), and work toward extending\r\nhardness results for learnability of a fundamental class, the class of\r\nparity functions.  The key tool used in these and other project tasks is\r\nFourier analysis of classes of functions.  While the primary purpose of\r\nthe Fourier analysis is to support research into learning questions, a\r\nside benefit is the enhancement of our understanding of several\r\ninteresting classes of functions, such as majority of AC0.  Furthermore,\r\nthis project provides a stimulating research experience to undergraduate\r\nand master's students at a university that, from an NSF perspective, is\r\nlargely an undergraduate institution.\r\n",
