The principal investigators, Harry L. Stern in the US, and Jerome Weiss in France, lead a team\r\nof researchers with expertise in the fracture of geophysical materials and motion and deformation of Arctic Sea ice.  The objectives of this collaboration are to characterize the variability of sea ice deformation, understand its connection to stresses and coastal conditions, test the fracture mechanisms independent of spatial scale, and improve sea ice models.  Heterogeneity and scaling laws associated with the process of deformation will be modeled in order to study the dynamics of the Earth's lithosphere. A major source of data for the studies is from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System. \r\n\r\nThe US team brings to this collaboration expertise in remote sensing of deformation and dynamics of sea ice cover and applications to oceanography and climate.  This is complemented by French expertise in fracture of geophysical material of the Earth's interior and their development of multifractal and wavelets analyses. The collaboration advances understanding of the dynamics of the Arctic Sea ice cover and will improve existing models. Arctic sea ice dynamics are important to monitor because of potential consequences for global climate, marine life and commerce.  The collaboration contributes as well to research and education infrastructure.  Students will benefit through advanced training and participation in an international team effort.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and his students. The CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United States. \r\n",
