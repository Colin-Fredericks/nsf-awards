 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growing pressure to collect information on the Internet has created a need for\r\nmore sophisticated ways to characterize privacy rights and balance them against\r\nlegitimate commercial and law enforcement objectives.  A wide range of businesses\r\nnow rely on their ability to collect information about online customers as a\r\nfoundation of their added value in the market place.  The use or potential use of\r\nthe Internet for purposes such as child pornography and planning of hate crimes\r\nand terrorism have heighted interest in (and loosened regulations on) network\r\nmonitoring.  Theft of intellectual property has led to the development of\r\nnumerous protection mechanisms; these often involve registrations and involuntary\r\nmonitoring of various kinds.  In order to make security easier (and explore a\r\nlucrative business model), a number of companies seek to act as third-party\r\ncaretakers of private information such as keys, authentication secrets, and\r\ncredit card numbers.  Arrayed against these trends are many citizens incensed by\r\naggressive means used to collect information from them and a variety of groups\r\nthat champion privacy rights.\r\n\r\nThere have been many advances in technologies both to aid information gathering\r\nand limit it.  One important trend is toward more advanced systems for creating\r\nand managing digital credentials and authorization databases.  In current\r\npractice credentials are sometimes `pushed' (like presenting a ticket to get into\r\na movie theater) sometimes `pulled' (like getting access to an airplane seat with\r\na `paperless' ticket) and sometimes both (like making a purchase at a store with\r\na credit card whose validity is confirmed online).  These approaches have\r\nInternet-based analogs, and technical advances have increased the range of\r\noptions considerably in recent years.  For example, work on public key systems\r\nhas advanced techniques for delegation based on chains of `pushed' credentials\r\nand increased the automation of credential collection.  Another important trend\r\nis toward more advanced systems for protecting privacy using anonymizing\r\ntechniques.  Tools such as onion routers and anonymous web publication servers\r\nprovide some support but other techniques directly aid fine-grained mechanisms\r\nfor obtaining privileges without exposing information unnecessarily.  \r\n\r\nThis work aims to develop formal support for characterizing privacy in the\r\ncontext of these advances.  Efforts to improve access control systems and\r\ncredential distribution have paid little attention to privacy mechanisms so far,\r\nresulting in systems that are good at propagating credentials reliably, but not\r\ntuned to do so within well-understood privacy constraints.  This collaboration\r\nwill build on our work in credential distribution and anonymity to create an\r\nintegrated architecture and protocols to provide advanced access control within\r\nthe limitations of privacy constraints.",
