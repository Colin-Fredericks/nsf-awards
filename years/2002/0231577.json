 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Croatian workshop on biocomplexity and sustainable ecosystem management will take place in Dubrovnik, Croatia, during October 1-6, 2002. The U.S. organizers are Carl Hershner and Anamarija Frankic from the College of William and Mary Virginia Institute of Marine Science.  Their Croatian counterparts are Vera Zutic of the Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, and Adam Benovic of the Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries, Dubrovnik.  The workshop goal is to define an interdisciplinary approach to research on and management of biologically complex ecosystems in the Adriatic Sea, where natural and human systems are interdependent. \r\n\r\nThe Dubrovnik meeting will bring together U.S. and Croatian researchers who have direct knowledge of the Adriatic and the Chesapeake Bay and possess complementary expertise in coastal and marine ecosystems research or social and economic sciences. Workshop discussions will feature: 1) the functioning of large scale coastal ecosystems, 2) sustainable human interaction, 3) biodiversity changes, and 4) socio-economic implications of management options.   Results are expected to lead to a refined theoretical framework for innovative collaborative projects that integrate field studies and employ suitable biological, hydrologic, and socio-economic models for the purpose of understanding and managing similarly complex marine systems around the globe. \r\n. \r\nThis biocomplexity workshop project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and South Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
