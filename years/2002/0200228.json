 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2002.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. \r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Role of histone deacetylases in the virulence of a plant pathogenic fungus.\"  Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are important regulators of many cellular processes.  Four HDAC genes have been identified in the maize pathogen, Cochliobolus carbonum, and one of them has been shown to be important for virulence.  Biochemical, immunological, and genetic techniques are being used to study the role of these HDACs in development and pathogenicity.\r\n",
