 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determinants of Toeplitz matrices have arisen in many branches\r\nof mathematics and physics. For example, they describe the\r\nspin correlation between two sites in the classical Ising\r\nmodel of a two-dimensional magnet. More recently, they have\r\nbeen used to describe statistical properties of random \r\nmatrices, whose eigenvalues model complicated systems. \r\nThe asymptotic behavior of determinants of Toeplitz matrices\r\nis described using the Strong Szego-Limit Theorem and its\r\ngeneralizations. Recently, this theorem was improved in the\r\nsense that a new identity was found for the determinant that\r\nallows one to find very good estimates for the error in the\r\nSzego expansion of the determinant. The major purpose of\r\nthis project is to extend this identity to other classes of\r\nmatrices and operators. This has applications such as finding \r\nthe distributions of linear statistics in random matrix theory,\r\nas well as  finding the level spacing of the eigenvalues. \r\n\r\nMany physical systems possess such complicated behavior that\r\nexact predictions become impossible, so instead average\r\nproperties of these systems are studied. For example, the\r\nenergy level of a particle of a compound nucleus in a slow\r\nnuclear reaction has complicated unpredictable behavior.\r\nRandom matrix theory provides mathematical models that allow\r\na simulation of the energy levels of the particle. \r\nOne of the tools that is used to study the statistical behavior \r\nof the random matrices and thus of the energy levels, \r\nis a determinant of a Toeplitz matrix. A determinant is a \r\nnumber that yields important information about a square \r\narray of numbers. These Toeplitz determinants occur in many\r\nbranches of applied mathematics. One classical use was to\r\nstudy the properties of models of two-dimensional (or very\r\nthin) magnets. Determinants are often hard to compute.\r\nHowever, there is a result, called the Strong Szego Limit\r\nTheorem, which yields an estimate for such a determinant.\r\nRecently, this estimate was improved so that error terms\r\ncould be calculated more easily. One major goal of the\r\nproject is to extend these results to other classes of\r\ndeterminants. This will yield information about the energy\r\nlevels of complicated systems in other types of models, \r\nnot covered by the Toeplitz case.",
