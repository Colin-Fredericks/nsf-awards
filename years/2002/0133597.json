Results from quantitative real algebraic geometry are the basic \r\ningredients of better algorithms in semi-algebraic geometry and play an increasingly important role in several other areas of computer science: for instance, in bounding the geometric complexity of arrangements in computational geometry, computational learning theory, proving lower bounds in computational complexity theory, convex optimization problems  etc.\r\n\r\nThe first goal of this project is to design optimal algorithms for several important problems of semi-algebraic geometry including the problems of computing the homology groups and stratifications of semi-algebraic sets.\r\nSecondly, the methods and techniques of algorithmic real algebraic geometry will be applied to investigate \r\nseveral open  problems in discrete and computational geometry and to explore new connections, especially \r\nin the area of computational topology.  At the same time, several emerging applications of algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry will be investigated, especially in the area of constraint databases.\r\nAdditionally, practical implementations will be undertaken, in order to build a system able to compute topological invariants (such as the number of connected components, the Euler characteristic, the Betti numbers, the full homology groups) of given semi-algebraic sets. This will aim at bridging the current gap between the theoretically best algorithms, and the best practical implementations available.\r\n\r\nThe educational component of the project consists of developing an integrated cross-disciplinary \r\ncurriculum suitable for advanced under-graduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics and computer science.  This would require no pre-requisite beyond college-level calculus and linear algebra, so that that the students can quickly absorb the mathematical background necessary for this line of research, and at the same time be in a position to make efficient implementations, which would make them\r\nattractive to both industry and academia.\r\n\r\n",
