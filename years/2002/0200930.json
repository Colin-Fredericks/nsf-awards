 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application requests support for the 19 th Gordon Research Conference on the\r\nChemistry and Biology of Tetrapyrroles, to be held at Salve Regina University,\r\nNewport, RI, from July 14-19, 2002. The specific aims of this conference are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n1) To provide a forum for discussion of recent unpublished data by scientists with\r\ncommon interest in the study of the chemistry and biology of tetrapyrrole compounds.\r\n\r\n2) To promote the exchange of ideas between established and new investigators from a\r\nwide variety of scientific disciplines (e.g., chemists, biochemists, clinicians, plant\r\nbiologists, microbiologists, biotechnologists) by providing ample discussion time\r\nfollowing formal presentations, by holding poster sessions which serve as a focus for\r\nthe discussion of common interests.\r\n\r\nThis biennial interdisciplinary conference has stimulated collaborations between basic\r\nbiologists, chemists and clinicians interested in tetrapyrroles for more than three\r\ndecades. In association with proteins, tetrapyrroles serve diverse roles as biological\r\nredox catalysts, in the harvesting of light energy, in the activation and delivery of\r\noxygen, and as signaling molecules. Free tetrapyrroles are also essential nutrients\r\n(e.g., vitamin B12), serve as regulators of gene expression (e.g., hemes), and are being\r\nutilized as therapeutic agents (e.g., photodynamic cancer therapy, target delivery of\r\nradionuclides). Owing to their photodynamic activity, toxicity and lipophilicity, the\r\naccumulation of tetrapyrroles (e.g., porphyrins, bilirubin) is associated with numerous\r\npathologies of the skin, liver and brain. For these reasons, this conference represents\r\nan important venue for exchange between basic and applied researchers on\r\ntetrapyrroles and for refinement of new tools and therapies for development by the\r\nbiomedical industry. Funds requested in this application are targeted to support 10\r\nyoung investigators who have not previously had the opportunity to attend this\r\nconference and for travel of two young ioprimarily undergraduate institutionle\r\nresearchers. The sessions, which highlight recent technological progress, will include\r\n22 invited speakers, a plenary lecturer and 14 discussion leaders. All of these\r\nindividuals have been selected for their scientific excellence, recent innovative work\r\nand contribution to the breadth of the program. The remaining 100 conferees will be\r\nchosen to ensure a broad representation of women, ethnicity and young scientists from\r\nvarious disciplines in academia, medical research institutions and industry. Strengths\r\nof this ongoing Gordon conference are its high disciplinary diversity, integration of\r\nresearch from basic chemistry through practical and clinical applications, focus on\r\nnew unpublished work, time for discussion, informal atmosphere, and ban on\r\ndissemination of conference proceedings, (which it is essential to assure\r\nconfidentiality when discussing unpublished results).",
