The investigator\r\nfocuses on fast new algorithms for the three key issues of\r\nimplicit representations:\r\n   1.  Fast accurate multiresolution methods that extract\r\npiecewise-smooth contours with tightly controlled geometry.  These\r\nmethods alternate between global topology resolution and local\r\ndifferential-algebraic boundary value problems, and solve\r\nindustrial problems ranging from machine tooling to horizon\r\nfinding.\r\n   2.  Efficient implicitization methods that build a\r\ndistributed implicit representation from given curves or\r\nsurfaces.  These methods, which invert contouring, are essential\r\nto modeling moving material interfaces such as the solid-liquid\r\ninterface in melt growth of silicon crystals.\r\n   3.  Fast stable deferred correction methods for the accurate\r\nsolution of ordinary and partial differential-algebraic initial\r\nand boundary value problems that control local geometry.\r\nDifferential-algebraic problems occur widely in engineering, and\r\nchallenge existing numerical methods.  For example, automated\r\nvehicle piloting requires real-time solution of differential\r\nsystems with constraints that keep the tires on the road.\r\n     Computer models of complex interlocking physical objects\r\ndominate technological processes ranging from semiconductor\r\netching to surgery planning, from computer animation to\r\ncomputer-controlled machine tooling.  Key steps in these processes\r\ninvolve operations such as evolving, navigating, intersecting and\r\nblending on these objects.  The investigator and his students are\r\ndeveloping efficient new computational tools for simulating these\r\noperations in robust user-friendly ways.  This highly\r\ninterdisciplinary enterprise combines mathematics and computer\r\nscience to benefit scientific endeavors ranging from cartography\r\nto crystallography.  The research objectives intertwine with an\r\ninterdisciplinary educational program, training future scientists\r\nand engineers through web-enabled courses,\r\nmath/science/engineering seminars, and individual student\r\nresearch mentoring.\r\n",
