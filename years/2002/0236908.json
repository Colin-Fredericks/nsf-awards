In order to address the goal the following questions will be addressed:\r\n\r\n-What S&T trends are most likely to yield products to benefit national security?\r\n-What S&T trends are likely to pose dangers to our society? \r\n-How are the important trends likely to evolve and what indicators will herald new and significant capabilities or threats?\r\n-Who will be the most likely producer of the necessary capabilities and threats?\r\n-Are there roadblocks in the way of scientific or technological progress that may deter these capabilities and threats?  \r\n\r\nAt least six S&T areas will be examined during the conduct of this project: Advanced Materials; Nanotechnology; Life Sciences; Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; Energy; and Information Technology.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study will feed into a larger study (under multi-agency sponsorship) aimed at suggesting ways to improve the quality of science and technology information involved in making decisions on S&T-laden issues at the national security level.  This will significantly enhance the nation's ability to develop strategies and policies on issues with important scientific and technical content.\r\n",
