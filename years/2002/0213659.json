 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large columnar cacti, such as the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea), are prominent features of\r\nmany ecosystems. Because of their extensive distribution and abundant production of large\r\nsucculent fruit they play an important role in structuring food webs and ecosystems. Up until\r\nnow, however, researchers studying the ecological and evolutionary aspects of plant-frugivore\r\nmutualisms have largely ignored this important group of plants. These succulent fruit may be\r\nparticularly important in hot deserts where high air temperatures and water scarcity may\r\nconstrain animal behavior as well as the timing and investment in reproduction. The saguaro's\r\nfruit are available during the driest and hottest period (June-July) of the summer in the Sonoran\r\nDesert, before the onset of monsoon rains.\r\nIn this research, I use a two-faceted approach to assessing the importance of a unique\r\nresource, the saguaro, to a community of avian consumers. The proposed research has several\r\nfeatures that set it apart from earlier studies examining plant -animal interactions: 1) it combines\r\nobservational data of resource use by individual consumers with direct measurements nutrient\r\ntransfer between the plant resource and a community of consumers using stable isotopes as\r\ntracers; 2) it quantifies both temporal changes in fruit availability and changes in avian\r\nabundance, diversity, and productivity and 3) it directly manipulates resource availability,\r\nthrough fruit removal, while quantifying changes in consumer abundance, diversity, and\r\nproductivity. Taken in concert, these studies provide a unique approach to assessing the\r\nimportance of presumed irkeystonely or irfoundationlr resources by: 1) directly quantifying the\r\nflux of nutrients between a primary producer and individual consumers and 2) through a fruit\r\nremoval experiment, examining the effects of the fruit resource on consumer abundance,\r\nbiodiversity, and productivity.\r\nI expect this research to produce an extensive array of new insights into: 1) the water and\r\nenergy balance of desert birds; 2) the role of cacti as consumer resources in arid and semi-arid\r\necosystems; 3) frugivory and nutrient transfer rates between plant-consumer interactions and 4)\r\ncommunity dynamics as it relates to changes in resource levels. This work will also quantify how\r\ndifferent consumer groups (seed predators versus seed dispersers) interact with the plant to affect\r\nthe plant's reproductive potential. It will provide the first comparative analysis of traditional\r\nmethods of studying resource use to the newer techniques using stable isotopes.\r\nAt the same time, it will be among the first studies to quantify the effects of removal of a\r\npresumed irKeystone Plant Resourcele on the abundance, diversity and reproductive output of an\r\nentire animal community. This research will also be the first to quantify the importance of a\r\nsingle resource to the nutrient and water balance of multiple species of different body sizes,\r\nforaging modes and dietary guilds in any ecosystem. This work should also provide important\r\nnew empirical evidence on how home range size and foraging mode affect individual\r\nexploitation of a resource system.\r\nFinally, this research will bring all facets of the scientific process to a large number of\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students. Twenty undergraduate students and 1 graduate student will\r\nobtain extensive research experience working on this project and it is likely that many more will\r\nbe trained through the REU program. This research is bound to have a major inpact with the\r\npublic as well, because of my association with the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. Research\r\nresults from this project will be the basis of a centerpiece display at the museum that explores the\r\nscientific process and the interactions of saguaros with the other inhabitants of the Sonoran\r\nDesert.",
