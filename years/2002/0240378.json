 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attention to the development of interdisciplinary education programs that engage the interest of students of all ages, but especially at the undergraduate level, is critical to ensure leadership in the area of nanotechnology.  The NSF Workshop on Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education is jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Science, and the Directorate of Engineering.  The workshop focuses on new examples of introductory undergraduate courses that are presented through the development of text, software, laboratory and demonstration experiments, and web-based resources; the development and dissemination of new teaching modules for nanoscale science and engineering that can be used in existing undergraduate courses;  and the incorporation of undergraduate research opportunities based on nanoscale science and engineering into the curriculum at any level, particularly during first and second year studies.  The workshop will involve participants from various scientific disciplines involved in nanotechnology and from all levels of undergraduate education to present and discuss ways to enhance the education and training of undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the workshop is driven for the demand for nanotechnology workers in at least three industrial sectors.  First are the established industries that traditionally use micro- and nanotechnology, such as microelectronics, information storage, optoelectronics, and others.  Second are the industries that have been newly created by this technology, among which are the micro-electromechanical industries and the emerging nanobiotechnology and nanoelectronics start-ups.   The third driving sector is composed of the major industries that have never used this technology but are now actively embracing it.  Among these are giants such as the pharmaceutical and chemical industries.  The emergence of nanobiotechnology, the application of the tools and processes developed for micro and nanofabrication to create devices to explore biology, may have a greater impact than has already been realized in the electronics industry.  In addition to these product-producing industry sectors, there is a growing workforce demand coming from micro- and nanotechnology research centers housed in industry, universities, and national laboratories that are advancing understanding of this new field of science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will also discuss the need for outreach activities to promote nanotechnology education and career opportunities at the K-12 level, and to provide professional development opportunities in nanotechnology for educators at all levels, including pre-service teachers.   Meeting the need for a skilled nanotechnology workforce will thus require that larger numbers of K-12 students in general pursue science, mathematics, engineering and technology education, especially students from traditionally underrepresented groups. \r\n",
