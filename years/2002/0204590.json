In recent years these equations have attracted \r\na lot of attention and significant progresses have been made to understand\r\nthese equations and related geometric problems. In this project, the principal\r\ninvestigator will continue his research in this direction. The problems to \r\nbe investigated in this project include isometric embeddings of metrics of \r\nnonnegative curvature; questions about hypersurfaces of nonnegative constant \r\nGauss curvature with boundary in Euclidean space and more general Riemannian \r\nmanifolds, including existence, uniqueness and regularity; spacelike entire \r\ngraphs of constant Gauss curvature in Minkowski space; Minkowski type problems\r\nof finding closed convex hypersurfaces of prescribed Weingarten curvatures;\r\nregularity of solutions to degenerate Monge-Ampere equations in non-convex \r\ndomains; regularity of pluricomplex Green functions and existence of \r\nholomorphic functions in Kahler manifolds; Hessian equations on Riemannian \r\nmanifolds and applications in geometric problems; hypersurfaces in hyperbolic \r\nspace of constant mean curvature (or Weingarten hypersurfaces) with prescribed\r\nasymptotic boundary at infinity; and evolution of hypersurfaces by curvature \r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEquations arising from most of these problems are highly nonlinear. These \r\nequations also model various phenomena in sciences and engineering. Solving \r\nsuch equations heavily depends on establishing apriori estimates up to second \r\norder derivatives. For many of the proposed problems in this project, these \r\nestimates alone are often not enough to lead to existence of solutions; there \r\nare other obstructions from geometry and analysis. These all impose \r\nchallenging questions. Research on these problems may also develop methods of \r\nnumerical approximations to the solutions that are useful in engineering and\r\nscience.\r\n",
