Haynie\r\nOhio State University\r\n\r\nResidential Mobility and Adolescent Risk Behavior\r\n\r\nThis research seeks to explain why a family's residential mobility tends to have a negative impact on their adolescent children.  Changing schools is correlated with a variety of risky adolescent behaviors and negative outcomes such as delinquency, sexual activity, suicide, and poor academic achievement.  This study attempts to identify the mechanisms that explain these outcomes. Peer social networks may be especially important since low status, often deviant, peer groups may be more receptive to new, entering students.  The analysis will use new longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) that include measures of  both outcomes and peer networks.  The project holds promise for developing  theories of social control and social networks, and for informing parents and school officials as they deal with the stresses experienced by adolescents when they move to new communities and schools.",
