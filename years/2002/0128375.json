 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will establish a method to quantitatively predict the  level of micromixing and mass transport in single-phase and multiphase fluid systems that are generated by a novel low-frequency acoustic technology.  The primary Phase I objective is to demonstrate the feasibility for development of a theoretical understanding of the governing mechanisms for the transformation of high-intensity, low-frequency, acoustic energy radiation into useful work for mixing and mass transport applications in multi-phase fluids.  A secondary, but essential, objective will be to develop the transfer functions coupling the acoustic transducer to the radiated acoustic energy in the fluid.  The models will be accompanied by experiment methods that will correlate classical micromixing amd mass transport techniques with acoustic field experiment data.  The proposed work will result in establishing a fundamental understanding of the governing mechanisms for acoustically-driven, single-phase and multiphase fluid processes, as well as fluid-particle interactions.  The analytical models are essential for exploitation of the industrial market by innovative low-frequency acoustic mixing methods that are emerging. \r\n\tMixing is the most common operation encountered in the Chemical Processing Industries.  In North America alone, the conventional industrial mixer market is between $200 million and $250 million annually.  Other industries reliant upon mixing and mass transport include food, petroleum, mining, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper, water treatment and municipal waste water treatment.\r\n",
