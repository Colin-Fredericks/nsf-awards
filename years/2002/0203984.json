Dongarra University of Tennessee  Component-based Frameworks for High-Performance Distributed Scientific Applications \r\n\r\nScientific computer applications are continuing to evolve to solve more complex physical problems.  The result is an increase in composite applications that are built from smaller element applications, each of which model a simpler physical problem.  As composite applications are generally large, they tend to be built by teams.  In addition, these composite applications tend to be distributed over a number of computers using a combination of data-parallel and task-parallel designs.  They typically share data via files and databases.  More sophisticated designs will include message passing, remote event signals, and other distributed computing techniques.\r\n\r\nTo realize this vision, we must overcome significant scientific and technical obstacles.  The proposed project includes research on a programming model for large, composite, scientific applications that are targeted to run in computer Grid environments.  This research will focus on developing efficient techniques to program and execute these applications including support for managing behavioral aspects of integrating element applications into a composite application.  This research will be use to develop a component-based framework where a clear, concise, and accurate description of such applications can be created and used to execute the application in a high-performance, distributed environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
