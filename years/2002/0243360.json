 "awd_abstract_narration": "Force-induced conformational transitions in single polysaccharide molecules by AFM\r\nPyranose ring-based molecules are of extraordinary importance to biological systems (e.g.\r\nglucose). Many biologically important polysaccharides are composed of pyranose rings and they\r\nare placed under tensile stress in a wide variety of cellular structures such as the cell wall of\r\nplants or the extracellular matrix (ECM) in animal tissues. Mechanical stress is thought to\r\nregulate assembly and physiological properties of these complex elastic systems. The\r\npolysaccharides respond to that stress by mechanical rearrangements of their components but\r\nthe underlying mechanism is not well understood. The simplest view assumes that\r\npolysaccharides are entropic springs and the pyranose ring structure is typically portrayed as\r\ninelastic and locked into a stable conformation. The development of single molecule AFM\r\ntechniques allowed for critically examining these views. AFM instruments can stretch\r\nmechanically single molecules and have superb length and force resolution. Stretching of\r\npolysaccharides by AFM revealed that they do not behave as simple entropic springs but that\r\nthey display yielding phenomena. The origin of these elastic deviations was pinpointed to the\r\npyranose ring that was found to undergo, upon stretching, conformational transitions such as\r\nchair-boat or chair inversion. These forced transitions change, in a step-wise fashion, the\r\nseparation of the glycosidic oxygen atoms, and therefore affect the contour length of the\r\npolysaccharide chain and its elasticity. Axial glycosidic bonds were found to drive those\r\ntransitions by acting as atomic levers. The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand,\r\nat the atomic level, the mechanism of these force-induced conformational transitions in\r\npolysaccharides. During the second grant period single molecule AFM techniques will be\r\ncombined with the tools of computational chemistry to examine in detail force-induced\r\nconformational transitions in the pyranose ring. The mechanical properties of the ring and its\r\nmechanical conformational transitions will be probed by pulling on the ring from various\r\ndirections and by different attachment points.  \r\n\r\nThese studies will determine the contribution of each type of the monomer to the\r\ncomplex elasticity of a mixed chain and will be valuable in interpreting the molecular elasticity of\r\nmany native polysaccharides. The experimental and theoretical findings of this proposal will be\r\nintegrated to develop an AFM-based methodology for identifying individual polysaccharide\r\nmolecules in solution from their unique force-extension spectra. Such a methodology will be an\r\nimportant addition to the arsenal of analytical tools for carbohydrate research.",
