Global eddy variability will be quantified by calculating energy levels and intrinsic length scales (Eularian and Lagrangian) to allow comparison with global or near-global coverage (drifters, altimetry, and floats). Meridional heat transports, their components, and divergence and time variability will be calculated. Particular emphasis will be placed on eddy heat transports.  The western boundary current and tropics will be regions of interest for the analysis of the characteristics, generation and dissipation mechanisms, and dynamics and property fluxes associated with mesoscale eddies.  The studies will be coordinated with those of the Kuroshio Extension System Study (KESS).  Mixing rates along isopycnals will be computed from the model eddy and dispersion statistics and then will be compared with rates obtained from the Southern Ocean Floats on Isopycnal Experiment (SOFIE).  A web-based autonomous extraction system will be set up to disseminate subsets of model output to help facilitate collaborations and community use.\r\n\r\n",
