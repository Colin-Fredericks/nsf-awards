 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is often claimed that the idea of significant biological differences existing between racial groups has all but disappeared from science, if not from the minds of the American public. Yet some observers challenge this depiction, arguing instead that many scientists continue to understand race to be a human biological marker. This dissertation research project, \"The Nature of Race,\" addresses this debate by posing two broad research questions: How do scientists today define and conceptualize race? What kinds of concepts of race are transmitted by scientists to the public? Drawing on the sociology of knowledge and on relevant existing research findings, a series of hypotheses concerning the relationship between social location (e.g. gender, age, academic discipline) and racial conceptualization are also assessed.  Funds support the collection of data, which will occur through interviews conducted with approximately 100 U.S.-born faculty and undergraduate students at two universities. Faculty respondents are randomly sampled from departments of anthropology and of biology; undergraduates from among those who have declared majors in anthropology, biology, or other fields. Qualitative content analysis is used to characterize respondents' definitions of race and the types of\r\narguments, claims, evidence, images and metaphors they use to support and elaborate these understandings. Quantitative analyses including descriptive statistics and chi-square testing are used to explore patterns of variation in racial conceptualization according to social status. The project findings are particularly relevant for educators at all levels. Both academic scientists and other educators have demonstrated ethical concern that scientific research relating to human diversity be conveyed to the public in a manner that does not exacerbate but rather attenuates racism. But blanket statements assuring that biological race is an unscientific concept may need to be re-evaluated if the scientists whose legitimacy is being evoked in anti-racist public education in fact hold a markedly diverse range of beliefs on the matter. This project provides a careful assessment of how scientists in different disciplines understand race and racial difference.\r\n",
