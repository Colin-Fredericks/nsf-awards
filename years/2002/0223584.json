 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sesame Workshop, in collaboration with the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum and the Beijing Planetarium, is planning a planetarium show and complementary materials for preschool-age children and their families, teachers and other caregivers.  The planetarium show will be designed for use in the United States and China and will have the following goals:\r\n\r\n-- promoting positive attitudes among young children towards science;\r\n-- providing age-appropriate information about astronomy in an engaging, entertaining format; and\r\n-- fostering am understanding of one another among children in the two countries.\r\n\r\nDuring the planning phase, there will be three face-to-face meetings among the principals: at the Beijing Planetarium, at Sesame Workshop in New York, and at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.  The purpose of these meetings will be to determine:\r\n\r\n-- What is the appropriate educational content for the show and complementary materials and what does research with children say about it?\r\n-- How does this type of project best reach preschool audiences?\r\n-- Is there a need or opportunity for producing alternative language or dialect versions of either the English or Mandarin versions of the show and complementary materials?  \r\n-- What issues or problems affect the design of the show and complementary materials?\r\n-- What are the implementation issues?\r\n\r\nParticular attention will be given to exploring how the project might include cross-cultural information in the show and complementary materials, and how the cross-over characters (Da Naio appearing in the English version; Big Bird in the Mandarin version) might be included in the design.\r\n\r\n",
