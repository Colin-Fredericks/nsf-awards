 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dependability of critical systems is an increasing source of\r\nconcern.  Modern software systems are routinely composed of millions of\r\nlines of source, including \"legacy\" code from previous generations and\r\nother vendors, yet critical Internet services and financial systems are\r\nexpected to exhibit \"four nines\" or \"five nines\" (99.99% or 99.999%)\r\navailability.  Vast prior evidence suggests that despite our best\r\nefforts at achieving a correct design, complex systems can and will fail\r\nin unpredictable ways, often resulting from unforeseen interactions\r\nbetween well-tested components not designed to be used together.  The\r\nmeasured effects of such failures in the Internet arena are staggering,\r\nand in mission-critical systems the costs could be measured in human\r\nlives, as was nearly the case with bugs in the Patriot missile guidance\r\nsoftware used in the Gulf War.\r\n\r\nSince unexpected failures do in fact occur even in the most careful\r\ndesigns, this work proposes a new approach in which system design\r\nfocuses not only on fault avoidance, but on rapid recovery from\r\nunexpected faults.  In many cases, fault detection and recovery can\r\nexploit relatively simple, well known techniques that have been proven\r\nto work in keeping Internet systems highly available---despite their\r\nvery large scale, stressful workloads, and requirements of continuous\r\nuptime in spite of high levels of software churn and integration of\r\nlegacy code.  Software watchdogs and timeouts can catch unexpected\r\nexceptional conditions; reactive or prophylactic process- or node-level\r\nrestarts can recover from or prevent transient errors resulting from\r\naging-related state corruption or unreclaimed resources; virtual machine\r\ntechnology can effectively contain faults in complex software systems.\r\nAlthough these mechanisms are simple, the challenge lies in determining\r\nhow software must be structured so that the mechanisms can be applied.\r\nSimilar techniques are well-known in the Internet protocol design\r\ncommunity and embedded-systems community, prior work from which has\r\ninspired this approach.\r\n\r\nBrown and Patterson have proposed the term \"Recovery-Oriented Computing\"\r\n(ROC) to broadly describe the above philosophy.  The primary goals of\r\nthe proposed work include the systematic investigation of ROC\r\nengineering techniques to reduce MTTR (mean time to recovery) in complex\r\nsoftware systems, characterization of the properties of software systems\r\nthat make them amenable to ROC, and a set of design rules and\r\n(re)structuring techniques for applying ROC to software systems.\r\nEvaluation will include quantification of the trade-offs between\r\nimprovement in service availability and quality of service delivered to\r\nusers.  Testbeds for the work include a ubiquitous computing environment\r\nco-developed with the Stanford Interactivity Lab, and a prototype\r\nCOTS-based satellite ground station network co-developed jointly with\r\nthe Stanford Space Systems Development Lab.\r\n\r\nThe research is complemented by new course offerings and revision of\r\nexisting course offerings, at the graduate and undergraduate levels, to\r\nrefocus the software engineering curriculum on models closer to\r\nindustrial practice for building complex critical-infrastructure\r\nsystems.  A new joint graduate course being co-taught with Prof. David\r\nPatterson at UC Berkeley focuses on applying ROC to a variety of student\r\nresearch projects across many domains.  Proposed revisions to\r\nadvanced-undergraduate courses present Internet software systems\r\nengineering as it is practiced in the field.  In both cases, recognized\r\nindustrial researchers and practitioners are contributing both their\r\nexperience and concrete data that currently is nowhere published about\r\nhow complex systems really fail in the field.\r\n",
