Notions of convexity have \r\noften proved fruitful for solving problems in this area, specially those which involve \r\noptimizing various quantities.  Those aspects of the principal investigator's work dealing \r\nwith shadows on illuminated surfaces is motivated in part by a study of soap films and\r\nmay lead to applications for computer vision. Further, the investigations on knot\r\nenergies may be of interest in studying the DNA. The primary motivation of the\r\ninvestigator, however, is based on aesthetic considerations and the intuitive\r\nvisual appeal of low dimensional geometric problems.\r\n",
