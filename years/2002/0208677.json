 "awd_abstract_narration": "The next generation of computers will be multi-threaded,\r\nallowing the simultaneous execution of several programs.\r\nMost computer workloads are difficult to recast into\r\nmulti-threaded form, under-utilizing multi-threading capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis research studies a new approach to program translation:\r\nAssist Threads.\r\n\r\nAn assist thread is a specialized version of an application program that,\r\nwhen run as an independent thread, assists (and optimizes) the application.\r\nRoles for assist threads include program profiling, monitoring, pre-execution,\r\nand memory management.\r\n\r\nExperiments show that assist threads\r\ncan effectively implement garbage collection.\r\nAn assist thread mimics an application's execution,\r\ntracking memory accesses and recycling unused memory as it is recognized.\r\nThe main application thread ignores memory management concerns,\r\nbecoming simpler, faster and more reliable.\r\n\r\nOther varieties of assist threads execute slightly in advance of an\r\napplication program, precomputing and preloading needed data values.\r\n\r\nThis research makes both theoretical and practical contributions to\r\ncompiler technology. It explores how to generate the computations\r\nnecessary to implement assist threads. It also experiments with a variety\r\nof assist threads, evaluating their effectiveness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this research opens new avenues of application for multi-threaded\r\nprocessors, making them more effective in supporting the needs of a wide\r\nvariety of computer users.",
