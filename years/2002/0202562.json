The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Sandra J. Shefelbine to work with Dr. Lutz Claes at the University of Ulm's Institute of Orthopaedic Research and Biomechanics, in Germany.\r\nThe purpose of this project is to combine Quantitative computer tomography (QCT) and Finite element analysis of a fracture callus in a rat femur in order to predict bone stiffness during fracture healing.  This will be done by: the development of a model of fracture healing in the rat femur; imaging the healing fracture using micro computer tomography (CT); creating a finite element model of the healing fracture to predict bone strength and; validating the finite element predictions with mechanical testing of the bones in bending and torsion.  The combination of QCT and finite element modeling in determining the bone strength in fracture healing will be a powerful technique for determining detailed, quantitative information during the healing process.\r\n\r\nThe Institute is a well-known lab for experimental biomechanics.  Dr. Claes' lab focuses on the effects of mechanics on fracture healing and has a wide range of experimental facilities.\r\n",
