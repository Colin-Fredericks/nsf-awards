 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop the technology for fabrication of M50 bearing steel coatings that are superhard, adherent, nanocrystalline, homometallic (an integrated layer without interface), and resistant to scratch and corrosion. These homometallic coatings will be similar in composition to the metallic substrates onto which they will be deposited. However, their nanocrystalline structures will provide enhancement in important properties such as hardness, toughness, and wear and corrosion resistance, without the brittleness, poor adhesion and other problems associated with conventional ceramic coatings. Prior research has demonstrated that nanocrystalline (3-40 nm grains) Co-Cr deposited onto Co-Cr-Mo substrates possesses hardness close to that of some ceramics (18-26 GPa, 400% increase) without the associated problems with adhesion to metallic substrates, and that fabrication of nanocrystalline (<40 nm crystals) Ti, with hardness of 12-14 GPa, can be accomplished.  \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in the manufacture of aircraft, boats and ground vehicles.\r\n\r\n",
