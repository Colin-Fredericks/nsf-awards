The jets take different forms on each planet; Jupiter and Saturn have about\r\ntwenty jets each (ten eastward and ten westward), whereas Uranus and Neptune have only\r\nabout three jets each. The jets are correlated with spatial variations in the temperature\r\nand cloud abundance, suggesting that the full problem is a coupled one involving all the\r\ndynamical variables. The question of what causes these jets is one of the most important\r\nunsolved problems in planetary atmospheres.\r\n\r\nDr. Adam Showman of the University of Arizona will investigate the dynamics and formation processes of the giant-planet jets using a fully nonlinear numerical model of atmospheric motion. Two distinct, yet related, numerical investigations will be conducted. Both are aimed at\r\nelucidating the role of small-scale convection in pumping the jets. The first problem\r\nuses a realistic parameterization of the convection and will focus predominantly on\r\nelucidating the dynamics near the cloud level. The second problem adopts a simpler\r\nrepresentation of the convective forcing and investigates whether extremely deep jets can\r\nbe driven from the upper regions where the moist convection is expected to occur. These\r\nstudies are the first fully-nonlinear numerical simulations of Jupiter's cloud layer that\r\naddress the problem of Jovian jet formation using a model with many vertical grid points.\r\nAs a result, they will be groundbreaking in their ability to address the vertical\r\nstructure that results from plausible jet-formation processes. The research will use\r\nestablished numerical codes that Dr. Showman is experienced in using.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
