The primary goal of the project is to increase the number of underrepresented students enrolled in engineering degree programs.\r\n\r\nThe planning group will develop the new curriculum by investigating best practices in engineering education through consultations and visits with exceptional programs throughout the country. Because Texas has no approved engineering community and junior college curriculum (approval is dependent upon credits accepted by the transfer institution), collaboration with university partners is critical to the success of the program. Ultimately, the program will serve as a model that can be replicated by colleges and universities throughout Texas and will set the standard for engineering transfer programs. The program will offer its greatest benefits to the underrepresented students who will find new career opportunities, and to the engineering industry, which will have an expanding pool of well-educated, successful employees.\r\n\r\n",
