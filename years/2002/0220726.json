 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing a new scholarship for Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholars. Recipients are being chosen from candidates majoring or planning to major in Computer Science, Engineering Technology, or Mathematics (CSEM). Scholarships are available to students in both Associate of Science and Associate of Arts programs. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the program are to:\r\n1. Annually provide scholarships to 30 academically talented, financially disadvantaged CSEM students, including those from underrepresented groups.\r\n2. Provide support to CSEM scholars, enabling a minimum of 70% of the recipients to maintain or exceed a 2.5 grade point average and persist until associate degree achievement.\r\n3. Provide job placement assistance to 100% of the project participants who complete requirements and desire employment in CSEM disciplines.\r\n4. Provide transfer assistance to 100% of students who complete program requirements and desire to enroll in a four-year institution.\r\n\r\nThe program build upons existing recruitment, support and career placement activities at the college and integrates new programs to provide a complete infrastructure. Candidates are being recruited through existing college recruitment efforts as well as the College Board Tutoring Partnership, a program providing college readiness tutors to local high schools, and the Jacksonville Urban Systemic Initiative. In addition to existing student support programs present on the four campuses and three centers of the College, each scholar is paired with a faculty mentor to assist the scholar and provide guidance. The College also has a CSEM counselor who is responsible for coordinating all support services college-wide for the scholarship recipients. The counselor works closely with the mentors and assures all support services are fully accessed by the scholars. In the area of career services, the scholars have access to all existing career services. Industry partners provide internship activities and mentoring to students wishing to seek employment upon graduation with an A.S. degree. An innovative support structure is being established built upon existing programs and partnerships improving the success of students in these demanding disciplines.",
