 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several recent meetings have highlighted the growing interest in the\r\nbiological, ecological, environmental, and other research communities\r\nin the development and deployment of large distributed systems for\r\ninformation collection, aggregation, analysis, simulation, predictive\r\nmodeling and realtime analysis within their respective disciplines.\r\nLikewise, recent events have caused concern and raised interest in the\r\nneed for similar systems in the context of homeland security.  It seems\r\napparent that a structured discussion of the needs for these systems\r\ncould create opportunities for synergistic efficiencies between the\r\nvarious user communities. To date, however, no such discussions have\r\nbeen held among these differing user communities, nor among these\r\ncommunities and the groups providing and developing technologies to\r\nsupport their needs.\r\n\r\nIt is with the possibility of identifying such potential synergies\r\nthat the Multi-Sector Crisis Management Consortium (MSCMC) is\r\norganizing a series of workshops to discuss the design, development\r\nand deployment of such systems \"From Sensor to Supercomputer and Back:\r\nSystems for Information Collection, Aggregation, Analysis, Assessment\r\nand Realtime Simulation.\" To begin exploring these synergies, MSCMC is\r\nproposing the following workshop.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this workshop is to summarize the current and projected\r\nstates of sensor, communication and power technologies for collection\r\nand communication of information from distributed sensor systems with\r\nlarge numbers of nodes, and to survey the present and expected needs\r\nfor such systems in environmental, facility, medical, crisis\r\nmanagement, public safety and national security arenas. A succinct\r\nsummary of the current and projected technologies mapped to current\r\nand projected user requirements is envisioned to result from this\r\nworkshop.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together experts in field sensor, processing,\r\nwireless, field power source technologies, to structure solutions for\r\nthe common problem of collecting and communicating data, including\r\nfrom remote field locations, by cost-effective, scalable, integrated\r\ndevices and networks.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will examine the user needs and technologies involved in\r\nfield deployable systems for information gathering including\r\nsensors, wireless communications and power supplies, up to the local\r\naggregation point.  While the integration of \"locally\" gathered\r\ninformation into larger infrastructures for purposes of analysis is\r\nalso required, such integration is beyond the specific focus of this\r\nworkshop.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that this two day workshop will produce:\r\n\r\n     (1) understanding by participants of the current state of the art\r\n     and availability of technologies of sensors, power, integrated\r\n     circuits, and wireless, and how they may be employed in our\r\n     society.\r\n\r\n     (2) determination of current and future needs for better\r\n     capabilities\r\n\r\n     (3) suggested courses of action to integrate available\r\n     technologies into scalable, reliable, cost-effective devices and\r\n     networks of value to meet those needs, including for both the\r\n     general scientific and research community and to government\r\n     agencies seeking better ways to protect the public from chemical\r\n     and biological incidents\r\n\r\n     (4) proposed design and production of devices not now available\r\n     or suitable for the above purposes\r\n\r\n     (5) recommendations for regulatory relief, especially for design,\r\n     manufacture, and use of workshop-proposed wireless technologies\r\n     for the above purposes\r\n\r\n     (6) recommendation for further work in these ares, and\r\n     identification of potential collaborations and partners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
