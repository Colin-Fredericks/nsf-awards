 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable design professionals and their clients to produce concise and accurate statements of project requirements. The initial work will be done for the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry.  The proposed requirements definition tool empowers businesses to develop on-line user needs and analysis statements according to customers' preferences and to model, in real-time, the type of constructed project desired. With superior understanding of clients' needs, designers can shorten the product delivery cycle and provide an end product with greater customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe potential market for this innovation is since it can be used in any segment of the AEC industry such as industrial, office, commercial, residential, hotel, and education. Firms producing large, complex products-such as aircraft, flight simulators, and telecommunication systems-have the same need for early, accurate identification and statement of requirements.\r\n",
