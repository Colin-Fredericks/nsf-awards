 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to elaborate an elegant and comprehensive \r\nspecification language and semantics for interactive computational \r\nproblems and explore the corresponding logic, --- the set of valid \r\nprinciples of interactive computability expressible in that language. \r\nSuch a logic provides us with a powerful tool for systematically \r\nstudying computational tasks and automatically generating solutions to \r\nnew problems from known solutions to old problems. Other applications \r\ninclude the possibility to base on this logic knowledge- and resource-\r\noriented automatic reasoning systems. \r\n\r\nThe intuitive notion of interactive computational problem is formalized \r\nas a game between two players: the machine and the environment (user). \r\nMoves of the game represent actions/choices by these agents, and \r\npositions represent states/situations that emerge in the course of \r\ninteraction. A game is considered winnable (and hence the corresponding \r\nproblem solvable), if there is a computer program that wins it against \r\nany possible environment.  The language of the logic of interactive \r\ncomputational problems suggested by the investigator is a non-disjoint \r\nunion of the languages of classical, intuitionistic and linear logics, \r\nwith logical operators interpreted as certain, --- most basic and \r\nnatural, --- operations on games. Validity of a formula is understood \r\nas winnability for every game/problem interpretation of its atoms. The \r\nrestriction of winnability to the classical fragment of the language \r\nturns out to be equivalent to the classical concept of truth, which \r\nmakes classical logic a natural syntactic fragment of the logic of \r\ninteractive computational problems. The same is conjectured to be the \r\ncase for the intuitionistic logic and (a version of) linear logic. This \r\nway, the logic of interactive computational problems can unify, within \r\nthe framework of one general semantics, the classical, intuitionistic \r\nand linear logics, with their seemingly unrelated or even antagonistic \r\nphilosophies. Verifying this conjecture, along with finding an \r\naxiomatization for the logic of interactive computational problems, is \r\namong the main technical objectives of this research. \r\n\r\n",
