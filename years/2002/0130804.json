Control of the proper timing of this switch is vital. In plants the transition from vegetative to reproductive development is also of agronomical importance as seeds, the storage reserves which human sustenance largely depends on, are the product of the reproductive phase. \r\nThe transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) is a key regulator of the floral transition, a central step in the switch from vegetative to reproductive development. Later in the reproductive phase LFY controls flower patterning. Despite its central role in these processes, events downstream of LFY are poorly understood. Only two direct targets of LFY are known. Genetic evidence indicates that additional LFY-controlled target genes play critical roles in reproductive development. We will employ genomic molecular approaches to identify these unknown LFY-regulated target genes. The proposal is based on posttranscriptional activation of a LFY fusion protein that allows identification of genes whose expression change rapidly in response to LFY activation. Biological significance of the identified novel LFY-regulated target genes will be investigated.\r\n\r\n",
