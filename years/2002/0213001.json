 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA central question in community ecology is how species diversity will typically respond to\r\nthe removal of a one or a few species. Are species highly redundant so that the loss of one species\r\nis easily compensated for by other, functionally equivalent species? Or, do species tend to play\r\nunique functional roles so that the loss of one species can propagate out to cause a catastrophic\r\nloss of diversity. These questions assume ever greater practical importance as the global wave of\r\nextinctions accelerates. And, although some progress has been made in simple model systems, we\r\nstill have a vague understanding of more complex communities with dynamics that evolve over\r\nlarge temporal and spatial scales. It is not clear whether anthropogenically induced extinction of\r\nindividual species will generally cascade across these communities. Most notably, we have little\r\nability to predict how the mounting loss of the largest mammals to hunting is likely to affect\r\ndiversity in tropical forests, which are home to a large proportion of the world's species.\r\nThe primary focus of this study will be the collection of empirical data linking the ranging\r\nbehavior of terrestrial mammals to tree species diversity in a Congo forest. The study site typifies\r\ntropical forests worldwide in that its  mammals act both as seed dispersers for a species rich guild\r\nof spatially rare trees and seed predators of a species poor guild of spatially aggregated trees.\r\nEven though mammals of many body sizes disperse and predate the same tree species, they may\r\nnot be functionally redundant because mammalian body size is highly correlated with ranging\r\nscale. Thus, large mammals are particularly mobile seed predators that are drawn to dense stands\r\nof the species poor guild from great distances. Large mammals also tend to disperse seeds over a\r\ngreat area, which provides a number of benefits to mutualists in the species rich tree guild,\r\nincluding escape from predators & pathogens. Consequently, local extinction of large mammals\r\nmay well tip the competitive balance between guilds, triggering a loss of diversity in the species\r\nrich tree guild that propagates out through a myriad of dependent plants and animals, including\r\nsmaller mammalian seed dispersers.\r\nThis project will include both animal and vegetation studies and use a combination of ground\r\nand remote sensing methods. Aerial video and satellite imagery at several resolutions will be used\r\nto develop detailed maps of the distribution of the two tree guilds over a large scale. Line transect\r\nmethods will then be used to quantify how the spatial grain of mixing between the two tree guilds\r\ninfluences both fruit availability and the spatial distribution of mammals varying in body size\r\nfrom mice to elephants. Trapping studies on rodents, the first GPS telemetry study on several\r\nduiker species, and the first telemetry study of any kind on red river hogs will quantify how body\r\nsize influences the spatio-temporal pattern of fruit availability within an animal's home range.\r\nAnd an attempt will be made to identify a set of individual tree species using high-resolution\r\ndigital photography and aerial videography. If this proves successful, it will allow the first large-\r\nscale scale study of tropical tree distribution and phenology. The empirical data collected in the\r\nstudy will be used to parameterize coupled, spatially explicit models of animal ranging and\r\nvegetation dynamics with the goal of predicting how large mammal extirpation is likely to affect\r\ntree species diversity.\r\nIn addition to addressing basic theoretical issues, data collected in this project will be of\r\ndirect value to wildlife management, both guiding management at the study site and informing\r\npark planning and sustainable hunting programs across the region. Remote sensing methodologies\r\ndeveloped in this project will also provide the tools for studying how the wave of logging\r\ncurrently sweeping Central Africa is likely to affect tree species diversity. And African personnel\r\ntrained and employed in the study will bolster feeble research and management capacity in the\r\nregion.",
