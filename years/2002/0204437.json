 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to study various aspects of inverse scattering \r\nproblems arising in wave propagation and in quantum mechanics \r\nand their applications.  These include wave propagation in a \r\nnonhomogeneous and absorptive medium and the determination of\r\nthe nonhomogeneities and absorptivity of the medium, X-ray \r\nreflectometry and the determination of material properties of\r\nstratified thin films by probing them with X-rays, focusing of \r\nwaves at target locations and the determination medium properties\r\nby using wave focusing, developing exact quadratures to analytically \r\ncontinue a reflection coefficient from an interval to larger \r\ndomains and their numerical implementation, and solving inverse\r\nscattering problems in order to recover functions with slower \r\ndecay conditions at infinity.\r\n\r\nThe inverse scattering problems investigated have important applications in many\r\nareas such as materials science, nondestructive testing, acoustic \r\nimaging, and remote sensing.  The principal aim is to determine\r\nproperties of a target in a remote fashion: send a wave onto the\r\ntarget, analyze the scattered wave, and infer the properties of the\r\ntarget from the scattering data.  In addition to its practical \r\nimportance in physical sciences, engineering, and other applied \r\nareas, the research will contribute mathematical techniques to \r\nvarious areas of mathematics and it will also help to train \r\nsome graduate and undergraduate students in applied mathematics.\r\n",
