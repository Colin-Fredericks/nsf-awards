 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exhumation in the northern California Coast Ranges, and orogens in general, results from\r\nthe interplay of geodynamic processes that drive uplift and surface processes that respond to the\r\nrates and patterns of uplift. A variety of approaches have been used to determine patterns of\r\nexhumation, but placing robust, quantifiable constraints on these estimates is difficult because of\r\nthe feedbacks and linkages among large scale geodynamic, thermal, and landscape evolution\r\nprocesses. There is a critical need for a technique to constrain the trajectory of rocks at shallow-\r\ncrustal (low-temperature) levels to constrain uplift and exhumation in active orogenic belts. Most\r\nrecently, (U-Th)/He thermochronometry has been identified as a potential tool to help\r\nquantitatively constrain exhumation and uplift. The (U-Th)/He system has the advantage of a low\r\nclosure temperature (~ 60-70 C for apatite) and thus in principal it records the last few\r\nkilometers of unroofing. As a low-T thermochronometer the same characteristics that make (U-\r\nTh)/He so appealing for geomorphic studies also raise questions about its utility in regions of\r\ncomplex thermal and/or tectonic histories. It is uncertain whether this tool can extract meaningful\r\ninformation from a complex signal that incorporates both the exhumation history and the\r\ninevitable thermal feedbacks driven by that exhumation. In this project we will apply (U-Th)/He\r\nthermochronometry coupled with landscape evolution, thermal and geodynamic modeling, to\r\nevaluate if (U-Th)/He dating can be confidently applied in regions of active tectonism that are not\r\nin thermal or geomorphic steady-state.",
