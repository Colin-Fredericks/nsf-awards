 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad  goal of this  proposal is to gain a deeper understanding of the adult human mathematical mind by  studying  its  development  in  infancy.  A major  goal  is  to test the hypothesis that infants rely on analog magnitude  representations of number similar to those used by  adults,  young children, and non-human animals.  Previous studies suggest that infants may rely on two distinct systems for representing number; an object-file system for representing small values and an analog magnitude mechanism for representing  large numerical  values.    This  hypothesis  will  be  tested  by  studying  the psychophysics of number discrimination over a wide range of numerical values, testing whether  infants  are  sensitive  to  ordinal  relations  between  numerosities,  and  taking  the first step to determine  whether the enumeration process(es) that infants use involves serial or parallel processing. The proposed experiments will use the time that infants look at various displays and the location of infants. eye movements as dependent measures.  The results of the proposed studies should  provide a strong foundation for the development of a  coherent model of the development of non-verbal numerical representations  and  will  contribute  to  the  principal  investigator.s  long-term  goal  of studying both the evolution and the development of numerical cognition. \r\n",
