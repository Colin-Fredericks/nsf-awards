This model was chosen by the teachers and administrators of the participating districts.  Supporting the Ventures implementation, as well as the other objectives, the project leaders plan to conduct professional development for in-service teachers, and include pre-service student teachers in the activities as well.  The project will also provide modest funding for extracurricular content-focused activities for students, and to better involve parents, as well as contracting for services to increase the cultural content in the curriculum.\r\n\r\n",
