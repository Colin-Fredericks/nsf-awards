 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an international conference organized by the American Quaternary Association (AMQUA) in Anchorage, Alaska on August 5-7, 2002 entitled \"Paleoclimate, Environmental Change, and Human Migrations in the North Pacific Basin.\" The purpose of the conference is to bring together international experts, practitioners, and students to share the latest developments in North Pacific paleoclimatology.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, funds will provide an undergraduate assistant to help with organizational logistics, travel support for 15 students who will present posters on their research projects, and travel support for 7 experienced professionals who will be invited to provide presentations that synthesize the latest research in their area of expertise.\r\n\r\nThe scientific themes of the various conference sessions are compatible and relevant to research projects supported by the Paleoclimate Program and include Late Holocene high-resolution climate studies, Quaternary paleoecology, and paleoclimatic teleconnections between high and low latitudes. \r\n\r\nA final report synthesizing and summarizing the conference findings will be posted on public websites for reading by the wider scientific community.",
