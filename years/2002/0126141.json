 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's Bronislaw Czarnocha and Vrunda Prabhu, will conduct two year-long cycles of\r\nteaching experiments to introduce the intuition of \"indivisibles\" into calculus instruction and\r\nintegrate it with standard ways of instructing via Riemann construction. They plan to study\r\nclosely the conceptual and computational development of students who receive this instruction. It\r\nAs part of this project, the PI's will investigate:\r\n(1) What is the process of transformation and development of the intuition of lines (the\r\nindivisibles) into a precise, mathematical concept?\r\n(2) Does the introduction of the W-C construction based on indivisibles, the interplay of that\r\nconstruction with the standard Riemann construction, and the instruction that integrates both,\r\nstrengthen students' understanding of the concept of the definite integral?\r\nIn the proposed project, they will conduct and coordinate Calculus instruction at six\r\ninstitutions, assess students' performance via tests, essays and clinical interviews, collect data\r\nresulting from the different assessment and analyze the data in preparation for a refinement of the\r\nteaching strategy. As a general framework they will adopt Vygotsky's theory with its emphasis\r\non the cognitive processes in the zone of proximal development, which dictates important\r\nconsequences on the instruction and assessment. Students will be guided by the activities of the\r\nclass to enable them to experience the process of mathematical thinking and to reveal its content\r\nto the teacher. The role of the instructor will be to provide systematization of their spontaneous\r\ndevelopment grounded in the precise mathematical understanding of the concept in question. The\r\ndirections their spontaneous thought processes take, will be under investigation during the course.\r\n\r\nThe project is a balance between various aspects: (1) the natural intuition of the learner vs.\r\nthe academic instruction, (2) computational mastery vs. conceptual understanding, (3) teaching\r\nand research.",
