 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researcher would conduct studies of the educational attainment of Asian Americans of different generations from existing longitudinal data bases of high school and college students.  School performance includes the outcome of science, mathematics, English, and social studies learning. The intent of the study is to help understand whether and how Asian immigrants and their succeeding generations achieve educational mobility in particular to help identify factors that contribute to the differential outcomes of science and mathematics learning among different generations.  The study should help inform policies regarding the role of public education institutions in providing education for new Americans.  This project will produce papers that will be published in academic literature and distributed to government agencies.  It will be of interest to the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\r\n\r\n",
