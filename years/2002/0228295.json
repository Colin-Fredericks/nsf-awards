 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arguably the largest scale-up of an educational program occurring in the United States at the \r\npresent time is the implementation of standards-based accountability (SBA) in all 50 states as a \r\nresult of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). SBA involves several elements \r\nincluding content and performance standards, aligned assessments, and a set of consequences \r\ntied to assessment results. The utility of standards-based accountability was demonstrated in a \r\nfew pioneering states in the 1990s, and a number of studies suggest that SBA systems may \r\ninfluence both student learning and instructional practices. The government cited the success of \r\nthese accountability systems as justification for requiring SBA in all states. This investigation is \r\ndesigned to identify factors that enhance the implementation of SBA systems, foster changes in \r\nschool and classroom practice, and promote improved student achievement.  It addresses four \r\nbroad questions: \r\n \r\n What strategies are used in implementing SBA at the state, district, and school levels?  \r\nWhich state, district, and school implementation strategies are associated with \r\nchanges in classroom practice?  \r\n How valid are the standards-based test scores as indicators of changes in student \r\nachievement? \r\n Which features of SBA implementation are associated with student attainment of \r\nacademic standards?   \r\n \r\nThe study involves three states that vary in their approaches to SBA.  Data will be collected from \r\nstate and district officials, principals, and teachers using a combination of questionnaires, \r\ninterviews, and artifact examination. The data collection approach is longitudinal, and is \r\ndesigned to provide information on SBA implementation at all levels, as well as on factors that \r\ninfluence implementation, such as the clarity of the standards and the methods for promulgating \r\nthem, teachers. and principals. understanding of the SBA policies, and the professional climate \r\nof the school.  Student achievement data will also be collected to address the third and fourth \r\nresearch questions.  The evaluation of the validity of standards-based test scores involves \r\nexamination of the content and format of test items as well as a comparison of score trends on \r\nthe standards-based test and on other tests such as the National Assessment of Educational \r\nProgress (NAEP).  Relationships among implementation, practices, and student achievement will \r\nbe explored using longitudinal multilevel modeling techniques.   \r\n \r\nAnswers to the four research questions will help policymakers, educators, and researchers \r\nunderstand the ways SBA policies are implemented at all levels of the system; explain \r\nrelationships among implementation, instructional practices and student achievement; and \r\nidentify successful practices that can be promulgated to make SBA function more effectively. \r\nOver the next three to five years, SBA will affect every public school student in the country, so \r\ninsights gained from this research will have wide applicability.",
