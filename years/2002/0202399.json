 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Milwaukee and the State of Wisconsin too few high school graduates transition into technical careers. A gap exists between the existing supply of graduates and the high wage technical jobs available. The 21st Century Urban Technical Education Project, funded in 1999 by the National Science Foundation, has responded to this problem by creating a new approach to technology education. Focusing initially on the construction trades during Phase I, the current initiative focuses on the application of this technology education model/design to Energy and Power and Transportation. Phase II begins to diffuse this technology education model at three district high schools in the Milwaukee Public Schools in an effort to bring about systemic change in the future. The project continues to prepare technical high school students for technical career opportunities through an articulated 2+2+2 approach and the development of an integrated/connected education model.\r\n\r\nThis project refines and assesses the template for standards-based educational reform designed and developed in Phase I as part of the construction technology cluster. Phase II addresses the areas of curriculum reform, faculty development, diversity, marketing and recruitment, partnerships, and the integration of applied technology in education. The major partners in Phase II include the Milwaukee Public Schools, the Milwaukee Area Technical College, the University of Wisconsin-Stout, Wisconsin Energy Corporation, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Association of General Contractors of Greater Milwaukee, and various business, industry, and labor organizations.\r\n\r\nPhase II curriculum for grades 11-14 in Energy and Power and Transportation is being aligned to state and national standards. A coordinated secondary and post-secondary teacher training initiative, which is based on the successful NSF/WASDI (Wisconsin Academy for Staff Development Initiatives) project, is being established in collaboration with business and industry for ongoing faculty development. A committee of partners, using a shared decision-making model, is guiding and overseeing technical education initiatives and providing technical training opportunities for staff and students. A career development model and a marketing plan are also being developed and implemented. In addition, research and implementation strategies are breaking down barriers for women and minorities in non-traditional technical careers and supporting and increasing involvement by underrepresented populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
