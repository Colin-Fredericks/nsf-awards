 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for \"Contact geometry, complex analysis and imaging\"\r\nDMS- 0203705\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein's research proposal contains projects in four distinct areas: (1)\r\nInvariants of contact structures, (2) Problems in CR-geometry, (3)\r\nMulti-parameter perturbation theory, (4) Magnetic resonance imaging. The\r\nproposed work in (1) will likely be done in collaboration with Richard Melrose.\r\nThey intend to use their prior work on the Heisenberg calculus to find\r\ninvariants of contact manifolds. A problem of particular interest is to use\r\nspectral flow invariants of Toeplitz operators to distinguish contact\r\nstructures with homotopic hyperplane fields. The work in (2) is part of\r\nDr. Epstein's ongoing project on embeddability of CR-manifolds, he proposes to\r\nconsider CR-structures in dimensions greater than 3 to understand why some\r\nCR-functions are unstable and why some are stable under deformation of the\r\nunderlying CR-structure.  The project described in (3) concerns the problem of\r\nanalytically parameterizing the eigenvalues and eigenspaces of a \"self adjoint\"\r\nanalytic family of matrices.  In broad terms Dr. Epstein would like to see what\r\nthe modern theory of functions of several complex variables has to say about\r\nmulti-parameter perturbation problems. Preliminary investigations show that\r\nreal progress is now possible in this field. His main goal is to find\r\nreasonably simple and explicit analytic spaces on which the eigenvalues and\r\neigenspaces of a self adjoint family are analytically parametrized.  Finally\r\n(4) is an entirely new direction for Dr. Epstein's research.  He plans to study\r\nthe feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging using inhomogeneous background\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nDr. Epstein's work is in the application of analysis and algebra to problems in\r\ngeometry. A principal focus of his research is the geometry and analysis of\r\ncontact manifolds. These arise is many contexts from several complex variables\r\nto differential geometry to topology to partial differential equations. Using\r\nthe tools developed in collaboration with Richard Melrose, Dr. Epstein hopes to\r\nelucidate the analysis and geometry of these ubiquitous spaces. Dr. Epstein\r\nalso plans to investigate the feasibility of magnetic resonance imaging using\r\ninhomogeneous background fields. This is largely beyond the capabilities of\r\npresent day technology. If it proves feasible it would allow many new\r\napplications of MR imaging and should also lead to less expensive equipment.\r\nThis is a multifaceted problem with significant mathematical and\r\nengineering aspects.\r\n",
