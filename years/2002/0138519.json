Conlon, University of Michigan\r\nDMS-0138519\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n                   \r\n   This project is concerned with elliptic and parabolic partial differential \r\nequations and their applications in statistical mechanics. The first part of the\r\nproposal is concerned with elliptic and parabolic equations in divergence form \r\nwhere the coefficients are random variables. The author intends to study the \r\nregularity properties of the expectation value of the Green's function, and the \r\nrate of convergence of the solution of the equation to the solution of the \r\nhomogenized equation. The second part of the proposal is concerned with the \r\napplication of ideas from the theory of divergence form parabolic equations with\r\nrandom coefficients to Euclidean field theory. The relationship between elliptic\r\nand parabolic equations with random coefficients and Euclidean field theory was\r\ndiscovered recently by Helffer and Sjostrand. It was then more fully developed \r\nby Naddaf-Spencer. The author intends to apply some ideas he and Naddaf have \r\ndeveloped for random elliptic equations to the Euclidean field theory situation.\r\nIn the third part of the proposal  the author proposes to study nondivergence \r\nform elliptic equations with random coefficients, in particular an\r\nequation corresponding to Brownian motion with a random drift. It has been\r\nshown by Sinai that in one dimension diffusion with random drift is strongly\r\nsubdiffusive for large time. It has been conjectured that in dimension larger \r\nthan 2 the scaling limit of diffusion with random drift is Brownian motion. The \r\nauthor has found a connection between this conjecture and certain combinatorial\r\nproblems concerning the existence of cycles in graphs. He plans to continue his\r\nprogram to solve these combinatorial problems. The final part of the proposal is\r\nconcerned with uniformly elliptic equations with deterministic coefficients.\r\nThe coefficients can oscillate arbitrarily rapidly however. The author plans to\r\ncontinue his work to obtain estimates on the underlying diffusion which are\r\nindependent of the degree of oscillation of the coefficients. This part of the\r\nproposal is related to the previous parts since random equations have\r\ncoefficients which are rapidly oscillating.\r\n   The goal of the proposal is to understand properties of the solution to a\r\npartial differential equation when the only information one has is that the\r\ncoefficients of the equation are bounded in some  way. Within this goal there\r\nare two sub-themes: (a) understanding worst possible behavior, (b)\r\nunderstanding \"on average\" behavior -given our knowledge of the coefficients.\r\nThe sub-theme (a) is the subject of the final part of the proposal. It is\r\nintimately related to problems of stochastic control theory. Examples of\r\nstochastic control theory abound in the world of engineering and finance. To \r\ntake a financial example, consider the problem of valuing a stock option. The\r\nclassic work of Black and Scholes shows that the value of the option depends\r\nonly on the stock volatility. For a stock with constant volatility they have a\r\nformula for the value of the option in terms of the volatility. The formula is\r\nthe solution to a partial differential equation in which the volatility is a\r\ncoefficient. (a) is therefore related to the problem of estimating worst\r\npossible scenarios for option values when one can only assume some bounds on \r\nstock volatility. The sub-theme (b) has similar applications to (a). The most\r\nexciting of these to this author is that it offers a way of beginning to\r\nunderstand the problem of turbulence in fluids. Turbulence is roughly speaking\r\nthe onset of random behavior in the velocity of a fluid.  It is well known that \r\na fluid will undergo turbulent behavior when subject to a sufficiently large\r\ndisturbance. The mathematical problem of understanding turbulence is well\r\ndefined. One simply needs to understand the solutions of a partial differential\r\nequation known as the Navier-Stokes equation. To date there is not even the\r\nbeginnings of an understanding how to derive turbulence in a mathematically\r\nrigorous way out of the Navier-Stokes equation. The reason is that the fluid\r\nvelocity is a coefficient of the equation. In the turbulent regime therefore\r\nthe Navier-Stokes equation is like a partial differential equation with a\r\nrandom coefficient. The sub-theme (b) is then concerned with the \"typical\"\r\nbehavior of the fluid velocity in this situation. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
