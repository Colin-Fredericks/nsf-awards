 "awd_abstract_narration": "While a large body of educational research advocates active learning, practical constraints hinder changes in large introductory courses. Online homework systems help bypass some of these constraints by integrating easily into common course structures, automatically grading of student assignments, and providing timely\r\nfeedback. However, the online assignments continue to be largely quantitative problems. This proposal is creating a variety of interactive online homework activities that is enhancing students' conceptual learning and increasing their interest in science. These problems pose goals more closely resembling the work of practicing chemists, focus on designing simple experiments, and put chemical concepts into meaningful, real-world contexts. This work is impacting students in introductory courses since homework serves as the primary means through which students practice applying new concepts. This project builds on previous NSF-funded work that has produced a Virtual Lab, now used by three universities and 500 students to date, and a set of authoring tools (CREATE) to facilitate interactive educational software development. We are developing 5-10 problems, varying in difficulty, for each of at least 10 chapters of introductory chemistry. The quality of these materials is being ensured through intensive assessment -- first by interviewing students to identify likely difficulties and later by including conceptual and attitude questions in the online homework system to compile ongoing data across universities. Dissemination through several course management systems, our own web site, a CD, and professional meetings are enabling instructors to browse the problems, their solutions, and their difficulty.\r\n",
