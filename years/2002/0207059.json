 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal pertains to a conference on Designs for Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to be organized by the Department of Statistics, University of Florida, and the Statistical Engineering Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The meeting will be of a three-day duration (April 18-20, 2002) and will be held on the NIST campus in Gaithersburg, MD. The Conference will feature leading active researchers in the field of GLMs. One goal of the conference is to provide a forum for interaction among people working on diverse areas of GLMs. The second goal is to provide a stimulus to young researchers and graduate students working in the design area of GLMs.\r\n\r\nFunding from this proposal will provide travel grants for eight doctoral students and junior scientists to attend the Conference. Special efforts will be made to solicit applications from members of under-represented groups (persons with disabilities, minorities, and women). Priority will be given to Ph.D. students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. It is hoped that the grant awardees will benefit from the interaction with the invited speakers, who can provide mentoring and role modeling for the awardees.\r\n",
