The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).\r\nThe partners include Northwestern University (Lead Institution), Illinois Technology Enterprise Corporation and the Women's Business Development Center, Evanston Township High School, Truman Community College, Young Women's Leadership Charter School of Chicago, Abbott Laboratories, Accelerated Business Solutions, Biotron Group, Counseltech, cue BIOtech, Piper Rudnick LLC, Springboard Enterprises, Wellspring Communications, Women Advancing Bioscience, Association for Women in Science. The program will increase the participation of young women of all backgrounds in science and innovation and document the partnership's activities so that similar partnerships interested in women-focused life science economic development can benefit from the experiences and lessons learned.\r\n\r\nThe program has the following goals: (1) increase the number of women-owned and managed life science start-ups in the Chicago region, (2) increase the number of women receiving SBIR and STTR awards, (3) increase the percentage of venture capital raised by women-owned businesses, (4) create wealth through additional high paying life sciences technology jobs, (5) broaden under-served young women's life science knowledge and participation, and (6) create a documentation study emphasizing the people, tools, and activities needed by similar partnerships interested in related activities.\r\n\r\nThere will be an increase in the number of new sources of higher-paying jobs, especially among underrepresented populations in the region, by creating woman-owned and managed life science companies.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
