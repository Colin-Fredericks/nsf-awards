 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division and the Polymers Program in the Division of Materials Research make this award to Pennsylvania State University to design and synthesize four different types of hybrid polymers containing poly (organophosphazenes).  With this award, Professor Allcock will synthesize poly phosphazene containing hybrid block polymers, and polymers with poly phosphazene linear or cyclic side chains and phosphazene rings connected by organic chains.  Different reaction chemistries such as ROMP and ADMET polymerizations will be used to prepare these multifunctional polymers, and they are expected to exhibit a combination of properties not amenable by each class of polymers separately.  Functional properties of these polymer hybrids may find applications in drug delivery systems, fuel cells, and solid-state energy storage and electro-optical devices.  Strengthened education and outreach programs in polymer sciences will be another outcome of this award.   \r\n\r\nWith this award, hybrid materials containing polyphosphazenes will be designed and synthesized, and these polymers are expected to find applications in drug delivery systems, fuel cells, and solid-state energy storage and electro-optical devices.  A number of polymerization chemistries will be used to prepare these multifunctional hybrid materials with improved performance and functionalities.  In addition, research and educational opportunities in polymer sciences will be provided to students with this award.",
