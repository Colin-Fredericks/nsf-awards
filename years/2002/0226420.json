The Small Grants Program (SGP) will be the foundation of a second phase of IAI programmatic development, leading to the establishment of new long term research networks that will succeed the current Collaborative Research Network, supported in part by a separate NSF grant. High priority has been given in this selection to high-quality science and the participation of new/young scientists from IAI member countries.\r\nAfter an open call and a merit-based peer-review the IAI has selected the following activities:\r\n--A. Research (10 awards):\r\n1. Esteban Jobbagy, ARGENTINA: \"Climate and Land Use Controls on Ecosystem Functioning: Understanding Processes and Developing Tools for a Sustainable Use of Temperate Ecosystems\" (Other Countries: Uruguay and USA) $29,820\r\n2. Arturo Sanchez, CANADA: \"Connecting Satellites to the Human and Ecological Dimensions: Sustaining Tropical Forests for the Future\" (Other Countries: Costa Rica and Mexico) $28,360\r\n3. Claudia Wagner-Riddle, CANADA: \"Carbon Sequestration Monitoring in Rubber-tree Plantations\" (Other Countries: Brazil and USA) $29,980\r\n4. Roberto J.
