 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Birds in the Hood\" or \"Aves del Barrio\" builds on the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology's (CLO) successful Project Pigeon Watch, and will result in the creation of a web-based citizen science program for urban residents.  The primary target audience is urban youth, with an emphasis on those participating in programs at science centers and educational organizations in Philadelphia, Tampa, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.  Participants will develop science process skills, improve their understanding of scientific processes and design research projects while collecting, submitting and retrieving data on birds found in urban habitats.  The three project options include a.) mapping of pigeon and dove habitats and sightings, b.)  identifying and counting gulls and c.) recording habitat and bird count data for birds in the local community. Birds in the Hood will support CLO's Urban Bird Studies initiative by contributing data on population, community and landscape level effects on birds.  Support materials are web-based, bilingual and include downloadable instructions, tally sheets, exercises and results.  The website will also include a web-based magazine with project results and participant contributions.  A training video and full color identification posters will also be produced.  The program will be piloted at five sites in year one, and then field-tested at 13 sites in year two.  Regional dissemination and training will occur in year three.  It is anticipated that 5,000 urban bird study groups will be in place by the end of the funding period, representing nearly 50,000 individuals.",
