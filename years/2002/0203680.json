 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0203680\r\nJennifer C. Schultens\r\n\r\nThe proposed research concerns the study of 3-manifolds.  The notion\r\nof a 3-manifold constitutes the 3-dimensional analogue of the\r\n2-dimensional notion of a surface.  The 2-dimensional notion of\r\nsurface is to be understood in a rather broad (and rather technical)\r\nway.  It includes the 2-dimensional sphere (that tends to be pictured\r\nas all points in 3-space at distance exactly 1 from the origin), the\r\ntorus (often, jokingly, described as ``the icing on a doughnut''), the\r\nKlein bottle, and many others.  The study of 3-manifolds is\r\nconsiderably more complex than that of surfaces.  Surfaces are\r\ncompletely classified, 3-manifolds are not.  In fact, it is at present\r\nunknown whether 3-manifolds can be classified (in an algorithmic\r\nsense).  It is known that 4-manifolds cannot be classified.  The\r\nresearch here endeavors to employ different types of surfaces lying in\r\n3-manifolds and their relation to each other in a structural study of\r\n3-manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research grows out of a study of the relation of Heegaard\r\nsplittings to Haken decompositions.  It turns out that the lessons\r\nlearnt in that investigation have applications to a wider range of\r\nproblems in 3-manifold topology ranging from additivity properties of\r\nthe generalized bridge numbers of knots and additivity properties of\r\nthe width of knots to questions about the genus of a Heegaard\r\nsplitting that is a common stabilization of two given Heegaard\r\nsplittings.  The methods for this investigation include a counting\r\ntechnique developed by M. Scharlemann and the P.I along with the\r\nnotion of an orbifold Heegaard splitting.  The methods further include\r\nthe notion of untelescoping of Heegaard splittings, Cerf theory, thin\r\nposition arguments, and the analysis of foliations induced by Morse\r\nfunctions corresponding to Heegaard splittings or untelescopings of\r\nHeegaard splittings.  The proposed research also includes a strategy\r\nto obtain a more structural theory of surfaces in knot complements.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
