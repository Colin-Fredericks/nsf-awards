 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.  The research component will employ eye tracking and other means to infer the cognitive processes of people engaged in particular tasks, and will develop a computational framework, called mind-tracking architecture, for mapping observed actions to the unobserved thoughts that produce them.  This work will draw upon existing psychology and engineering research and synthesize these efforts into a unified methodology.  The project will employ two frameworks at different levels to achieve mind tracking: the production-system architecture ACT-R and cognitive grammars that represent behavior as rules from intentions to actions.  Three specific application areas will motivate, demonstrate, and test the methodology: intelligent tutoring, automobile driver assistance, and assistive technology for the disabled.  The educational component will develop a new human-computer interaction curriculum and an outreach program to foster communication among students, researchers and industry professionals.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award recognizes and supports the early career-development activities of a teacher-scholar who is likely to become an academic leader of the twenty-first century.  Each of the three application areas has the potential for significant benefit to members of the general public: students, drivers, and the disabled.\r\n",
