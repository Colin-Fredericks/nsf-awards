In fact, they parameterize all the\r\nlocal data at a point. Local phenomena in complex variables, \r\nsuch as the singularity of a plurisubharmonic functions \r\nor the rate of convergence of an orbit to a fixed point,\r\ncan be effectively studied by observing the behavior along\r\ndifferent approaches to the point. Valuations constitute a\r\nvery powerful tool for this study. The success of the\r\napproach depends on the fact that the set of all valuations\r\nat a point in two dimensions is a set that can be understood:\r\nit is a tree in the sense of an infinite collection of real \r\nintervals welded together at branch points so that no cycles\r\nappear. This tree is a complicated but manageable object\r\nand its one-dimensionality has striking applications.\r\n\r\nDynamical systems are mathematical models that are widely \r\nused in virtually every science for any situation that\r\nundergoes a time-evolution. Sir Isaac Newton invented\r\ncalculus, or mathematical analysis, for the study of the\r\nplanetary system, a prime example of a dynamical system.\r\nMuch of mathematics has developed as a respond to the need\r\nto model and understand the world around us.\r\nIn this proposal the principal investigator will use a tool\r\nfrom a different field of mathematics in order to understand\r\ncertain dynamical systems. One example of a system\r\nthat can be studied arises from numerical (iterative) \r\nalgorithms, and the study of the dynamical systems in \r\nthis proposal will give information on the performance of \r\nthe algorithms.\r\n",
