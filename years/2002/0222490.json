Preliminary research has demonstrated that such locales can be identified using this method, which utilizes a combination of social/cultural, biological, remote sensing and geologic data.  Glaciers and ice patches are melting at an unprecedented rate, because of the current high rate of arctic warming.  It is anticipated that increasingly older and significant artifacts, paleontological and other materials will be exposed in the resulting thawed areas.  An estimated 10% of the world's land surface is covered by perennial snow, glaciers and icefields.  Organic remains locked within these environments remain largely unexplored.  Results obtained during preliminary work on these regions include recovery of rare and unique artifacts that can potentially make significant contributions to our understanding of human colonization and adaptation.  The apparent acceleration of global warming, and the consequent melting of continental ice, creates an urgent need to develop the means to locate and preserve such frozen remains before the newly exposed materials decompose or are otherwise destroyed.   The proposed research addresses this crucial issue.",
