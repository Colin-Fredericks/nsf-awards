The Dartmouth College will provide a match consisting of 50% of the expected cost of the instrument.  The TIMS instrument will be the primary research tool in the new radiogenic isotope geochemistry laboratory in the Department of Earth Sciences. Ultra-high precision osmium and neodymium isotopic ratios will be determined using the new TIMS with the aim of addressing issues related to the origin and evolution of Earth and other planetary reservoirs. In addition, high sensitivity measurements of rhenium, osmium, iridium, samarium, neodymium, uranium, thorium, lead, rubidium, strontium, and iron isotopes will be performed. The new TIMS facility will provide an exciting new dimension to research at Dartmouth, complementing the extant strong research programs in the Department of Earth Sciences, which include K-Ar geochronology, organic geochemistry and paleoceanography, hydrogeochemistry of watersheds, climate change, landscape evolution, stratigraphy and basin analysis, hydrology and geomechanics, and tectonics. Many of these programs have a radiogenic isotope component and require access to a state-of-the-art TIMS facility. Additionally, other researchers and students at Dartmouth and in New England region will be able to use the new facility, resulting in further growth of research and education in geochemistry and in physical sciences.  \r\n",
