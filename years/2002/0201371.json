 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will focus on the analysis of the dynamic behavior and wave propagation characteristics of cellular solids with deterministic periodic architecture.  The resulting periodic assembles generate frequency bands and directions where elastic waved do not propagate (stop bands) and the corresponding vibrations and sound radiation are substantially reduced.  The scalable geometry of deterministic periodic architectures allows for their application as innovative vibration control/hazard mitigation systems both to small-scale and large-scale structural systems.\r\n\r\nParticular emphasis will be placed in the analysis of honeycombs with re-entrant architectures.  Their unique mechanical properties will be fully investigated emphasizing their potential for vibration hazard mitigation as well as impact energy absorption.  Efficient use of the intervening space will be also addressed for improving performance.\r\n\r\nThis award is a multidisciplinary and collaborative research effort, where analytical computational and experimental work will be interlaced.  The PIs will collaborate throughout the duration of the project in teaching common courses and in developing a new advanced course in Passive and Active Structural Control.  This team effort will foster both civil and mechanical engineering students' multidisciplinary background.  The concept and the results of this award will be progressively introduced in several courses of instruction in order to expose the students to innovative research ideas and their applications.  The student will be given hands-on experience that will contribute to the growth of their technical and professional skills.\r\n",
