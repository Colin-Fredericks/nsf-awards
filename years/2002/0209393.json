 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support Pacific island scholars attendance at the joint meeting of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics (PME) and its North American Chapter (PMENA) to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii in July, 2003.  The Pacific island scholars will be selected mathematics specialists from the departments and ministries of education and college level mathematics instructors from the colleges and universities in Hawaii and on the U.S. affiliated Pacific island communities of American Samoa, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands and the Republic of Palau.  NSF support will enable the Pacific island scholars to engage with the PME community for the first time, thereby enhancing national and international collaboration among mathematics educators.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific island scholars and mathematics specialists will be introduced to the international mathematics education community at a reception to be held in conjunction with the opening of the conference.  Following the delivery of the first plenary, which will be given by a Pacific islander, the Pacific scholars and mathematics specialists will present an overview of their islands' culture and the challenges faced in teaching mathematics in their island communities.  During the conference a special panel discussion will give the participates the opportunity to obtain feedback from the international community of mathematics educators concerning these challenges.  Daily \"Theory to Practice\" sessions will provide opportunities for the Pacific scholars to actively contribute and receive professional development throughout the conference.  The Principal Investigators will attempt to establish a Pacific Network of Mathematics Educators as a result of the conference activities.\r\n",
