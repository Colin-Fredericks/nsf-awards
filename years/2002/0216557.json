 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquisition of a Digital Imaging System to Support Research and Research Training in Applications of Molecular Biology\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to Dr. Kirk Cammarata and colleagues at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC) to acquire a digital imaging system for sensitive detection of multicolor fluorescence, radioactivity and chemiluminescence data generated by a variety of DNA- and protein-based research techniques.  The imaging package includes blue, green and red fluorescence excitation capabilities, bandpass emission filters, 10 um-resolution optics and microarray slide holder, storage phosphor cassettes and phosphor image eraser, and data analysis software. The instrumentation will support molecular biological studies on the health of the Gulf of Mexico coastal environment.  The research will explore the mechanisms by which aquatic organisms respond to environmental contaminants such as endocrine disruptors and toxic heavy metals, and how DNA- and protein-based molecular techniques can be used to monitor environmental impacts.  The Gulf coast hosts a diversity of uses including fisheries, wildlife, industry and recreation.  But it is also a sensitive collection point for environmental contaminants originating from approximately two-thirds of the continental United States.  Knowledge of how aquatic organisms respond to pollutants, in conjunction with molecular assay methods to measure these responses, will result in a cause and effect understanding that may support risk-based environmental assessment and regulation.   \r\n\r\n The research facilitated by the imaging system will support the empowerment of regulatory agencies to make rational, fact-based decisions regarding environmental impacts of pollution.   Moreover, the mission of the College of Science and Technology at TAMU-CC is, in part, to increase minority participation in the sciences.  The research training and teaching needs of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) in South Texas will be enhanced because the instrumentation will enable research projects not previously possible in the region.",
