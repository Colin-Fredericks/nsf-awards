Special emphasis will be put on\r\ngeometry and topology of cohomogeneity one manifolds, i.e. manifolds on which a\r\nLie group acts with one dimensional quotient. In our previous proposal we \r\nconjectured  that every cohomogeneity one manifold has a metric with \r\nnon-negative sectional curvature. A particularly interesting case are the \r\nKervaire spheres which are exotic in many dimensions. We will try to construct\r\nmetrics with nonnegative curvature on these Kervaire spheres. A further goal is \r\nto classify all cohomogeneity one manifolds with positive sectional curvature\r\nin the hope of finding some new examples, with good candidates available in \r\ndimension 7 and 9. \r\nWe will also study variational properties of homogeneous Einstein metrics. In \r\nour previous proposal we showed that a partial Palais Smale condition is \r\nsatisfied which enables one do carry out Morse theory and Lusternik Schnirelmann \r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nA subject of major interest in global  Riemannian geometry is studying manifolds \r\nwhose curvature have special properties, in particular those whose curvature has \r\na fixed sign. Manifolds with positive curvature or nonnegative curvature have \r\nbeen studied since the beginning of global Riemannian geometry. Very few \r\nexamples of this type are known and new ones seem to be difficult to construct. \r\nA main objective of our proposal is to construct such knew examples. Of \r\nparticular interest are exotic spheres, which are manifolds that look\r\nlike spheres but on which ordinary calculus is quite different. These objects\r\nwere discovered 40 years ago by Milnor and ever since then geometers were\r\ninterested in finding a geometric description of them where the natural local\r\ninvariants look like spheres, i.e. where the curvature is positive or \r\nnon-negative. Whether they have metrics of positive curvature is in fact one of \r\nthe major open problems in the subject.\r\nAnother subject of major interest in global Riemannian geometry is the existence \r\nof Einstein metrics, which have many applications in physics in particular to \r\nbuilding new models of Kaluza Klein theory. In this context homogeneous Einstein \r\nmetrics have been studied a lot by various physicists. We develop a general \r\nvariational theory for homogeneous Einstein metrics which enable one to find \r\nmany new examples without having to solve the algebraic equations which the \r\nEinstein equations reduce to in the homogenous case and which can be quite \r\ndifficult or impossible to solve explicitly.\r\n",
