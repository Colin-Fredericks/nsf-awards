 "awd_abstract_narration": "The parameters defining the life history of an organism, for example,\r\nsurvival rates at different stages in life, birth rates, germination\r\nrates and dispersal rates, vary with the physical environment, such as\r\nweather, and also with the biological environment defined by the\r\ndensities of organisms of different sorts.  A general mathematical\r\ntheory of life-history evolution will be developed that takes into\r\naccount the interacting effects of a varying environment and organism\r\ndensities. Mathematical models will be developed and investigated using\r\nprobability theory, dynamical systems theory, and computer simulation.\r\nParticular emphasis will be placed on annual plant germination, growth,\r\nsurvival and reproductive relations in perennial organisms, and seasonal\r\nvariation in growth of perennial plants.\r\n\r\nThe life history of an organism is fundamental to the way it relates to\r\nits environment, and therefore the life history is fundamental to\r\npredicting what will happen to the organism as conditions change either\r\nthrough human intervention or natural causes. The complexity of the\r\nsubject means that effective study requires a theoretical framework to\r\ngenerate hypotheses, which can then be tested empirically. Although\r\nseparate theories for the effects of a varying physical environment and\r\norganism densities have been developed previously, there has been very\r\nlimited attention to their interaction.  The results of the study should\r\nhave wide applicability to wild organisms (flora and fauna, pests, weeds\r\nand fisheries), with some applications also to crops and domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n",
