 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe University of Kentucky will to establish a demonstration project called the Girls\r\nin Science Program (GIS), to encourage young women from rural southeastern Appalachian\r\nKentucky to pursue careers in science, math, engineering and technology (SMET). This three-\r\nyear project, to begin in September 2002, targets 120 girls entering the seventh-grade \r\nfrom 21 rural Kentucky Appalachian counties, parents of these girls, and a minimum of \r\n30 rural Kentucky Appalachian middle school teachers from these 21 county school \r\ndistricts. This project targets a select group of middle school girls with a program that \r\ninvolves: 1) Weeklong Summer Institutes for each girl at the University of Kentucky campus\r\nfor two years, 2) Saturday/After-school sessions throughout two academic school years,\r\nand 3) Mentoring relationships with University scientists and community mentors. The \r\nproject also the project targets middle school math and science teachers through \r\nprofessional development courses focused on engaging each girl in science and math for \r\ntwo years. This project will include parental involvement with a series of workshops.\r\nThe project team will also develop and disseminate a model middle school curriculum \r\nmanual focused on institutionalizing the program in rural Appalachian Kentucky.  Girls and\r\nteachers who enroll in the program will be the primary beneficiaries; however, the program \r\nis designed to have a broad-based impact on other students, teachers, relatives, and \r\nultimately rural Kentucky and Appalachia.",
