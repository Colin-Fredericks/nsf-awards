 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator intends primarily to pursue the goal of \r\nattacking some of the fundamental problems of the Langlands program by \r\nmeans of analytic methods. He is most interested in the case of base \r\nchange for holomorphic forms on GL(2) where a non-soluble base change is \r\ninvolved, but the proposed methods should work much more generally. \r\nAt present the intention is to permit the use of the Riemann Hypothesis \r\n(in an appropriate setting) to achieve this goal. A second goal of the \r\nproposal is to study some of the fundamental analytic questions on \r\nL-functions. \r\n\r\n      This proposal is ultimately concerned with finding methods to solve \r\nequations. Since the nineteenth century it has been known that certain \r\nequations have formulas (like the quadratic equation and the cubic \r\nequation) but that most do not. The cases that interest me are the \r\nequations with ordinary integer coefficients. It has become apparent in \r\nthe last fifty years that there should be a completely different way of \r\nstudying these general equations by using methods from analysis \r\n(i.e. derived from calculus) rather than by using methods from algebra. \r\nThe idea is to describe and prove many properties of the solutions (which \r\nstill exist even though there may be no formulas for them). \r\n",
