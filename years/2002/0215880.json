 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. John V.H. Constable, Jerry G. Chmielewski, and Dean M. DeNicola at Slippery Rock University to purchase four controlled environment plant growth chambers.  The requested chambers include control over temperature and illumination and will be configured as described below to maximize utility for all users.  The configuration of the first pair of chambers includes a high light output option that provides illumination to approximately three-fourths of full sun level, control over humidity through linked humidification and dehumidification systems, and the control of CO2 concentration using CO2 injection and an integrated infrared gas analyzer.  The configuration of the second pair of chambers are identical to those above, but lack the high light output option and control over CO2.  Acquisition of these chambers will expand the future research efforts of John V.H. Constable; Jerry G. Chmielewski; and Dean M. DeNicola in the Department of Biology.  The growth chambers will also expand Slippery Rock University's primary mission of excellence in undergraduate education in the classroom, the laboratory and independent faculty-supervised student research.  \r\n\tThe chambers will provide the capability for a diverse array of projects to be studied according to the primary research interests of the investigators. The goals of all proposed studies are to enhance our understanding of mechanistic relationships in biological systems.  Dr. Constable's studies address the mechanistic relationship between nitrate and carbon assimilation at elevated CO2 that will enhance our predictive ability on the long-term growth response of vegetation to elevated CO2.  Dr. Chmielewski's studies develop the understanding of evolutionary trends in reproduction between weedy and non-weedy aster species. Dr. DeNicola's investigations seek to build a predictive model of benthic algal succession based on growth form and potential colonizing taxa; and (ii) the determination of the effects of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) on benthic algal community structure and primary production in order to improve remediation efforts in AMD impacted streams.\r\n",
