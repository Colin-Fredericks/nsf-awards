 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Web-based Integrated Science Environment (WISE)was founded in 1997 with a 3-year grant from the National Science Foundation.This invited proposal for an Accomplishment Based Renewal (ABR)describes planned WISE activities for 3 additional years at the current rate of funding.Our document conforms to the four-page ABR proposal limit;much more can be learned about WISE activities at http://wise.berkeley.edu.\r\nWISE capitalizes on the synergies between Internet connectivity and integrated science to advance our understanding of inquiry science instruction.In the first 3 years,WISE has created the following elements of inquiry:\r\no The WISE learning environment that incorporates recent cognitive and social research and gives new authoring partnerships a headstart on effective inquiry designs.\r\no Over 30 WISE projects that meet our design criteria and can be used by teachers everywhere.\r\no The WISE mentored professional development model that guides teachers to implement inquiry practices.\r\no WISE server technology that collects and stores both student work and teacher activities such as lesson plans, contributions to discussion, and reflection notes.\r\no WISE Knowledge Integration Assessments that measure progress in inquiry and can be used to detect transfer from the topic where inquiry was taught to new topics.\r\no WISE science, technology, and language literacy measures, and connections to standards-based measures of inquiry from NAEP,TIMSS,and state testing programs to establish broader impacts.\r\nThe proposed ABR will research how these elements of inquiry instruction jointly contribute to sustained improvement of science learning.We prepare to address four research themes:(a)What is the longitudinal impact on students of one or more WISE projects?(b)What are typical trajectories of teachers from diverse schools (urban, rural,and suburban)who adopt inquiry practices such as WISE?(c)What value do new technologies for visualization and modeling, including our new grant of Palm technologies, bring to inquiry instruction with WISE? And (d)How do Curriculum Design Partnerships progress in response to the design review and classroom trials of their curriculum projects?  Establishing and sustaining technology-enhanced inquiry science instruction requires a powerful learning environment that takes advantage of cognitive and social research as well as effective professional development,rigorous design of urriculum and assessments,and continuous monitoring of student progress. Our research will characterize trajectories of teachers as they adopt WISE inquiry projects and identify ways to make professional development more effective.\r\n\r\nWe will refine our design principles and test their effectiveness in guiding partnerships that design new WISE curriculum.We will incorporate emerging technologies into the WISE learning environment,adjust professional development practices,and test the effectiveness of these improvements on student learning. We will research the impact of WISE projects on students,both immediately and longitudinally,as a function of the expertise of the teacher and the extent of exposure to WISE projects. We will look specifically at the needs of diverse learners and identify ways to ensure that all students succeed in WISE. Proposed studies will inform the design of curricula,professional development,and science assessment. Our work will inform the setting of policy for equity and assessment.\r\n\r\nTo communicate our findings,we plan a book-length monograph,research publications,and conference presentations, as well as workshops for teachers, netcourses, and extensive on-line materials. We have already attracted over 3000 teachers to join our web-based community. As participating teachers provide information about their customizations and insights into inquiry teaching,we expect this community to grow. We will connect teachers to mentors according to our WISE mentoring model for professional development.  We appreciate the contributions of our advisory board over the past 3 years and have identified some continuing and some new advisors for the ABR. The longitudinal impact theme will be advised by Paul Holland,ETS,and will continue to draw on the methodological expertise of Mark Wilson, University of California, Berkeley; David Rogosa, Stanford University; Robert Linn, University of Colorado, and Lorrie Shepard, University of Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe teacher trajectory theme will be advised by Jane Bowyer, Mills College;and Louis Gomez, Northwestern University who both have experience with urban systemic reforms. The value of new technologies theme will benefit form collaborations with CILT Post Docs Eric Baumgartner,Michelle Spitulnik,and Yael Kali;in addition,we will be advised by computer scientists Michael Clancy,UC Berkeley,and Elliot Soloway,University of Michigan;and by Nancy Songer,University of Michigan. The Curriculum Design Partnership theme will be advised by Philip Bell,University of Washington; Louis Gomez, Northwestern University; Roy Pea, Stanford University; and Nancy Songer, University of Michigan,all of whom bring experience in forming and sustaining partnerships.\r\n",
