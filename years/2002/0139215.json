 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nFunding from the National Science Foundation will bring seven undergraduates to the California Academy of Sciences for an 8-week summer session in the Academy's Summer Systematics Institute.  Recruitment will be on a national level, with selection emphasis given to female students and students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the biological sciences.  African-Americans, Native-Americans, and Latinos are especially encouraged to participate.  Participants will receive a stipend, housing allowance and travel funds to and from his/her place of residence.  Each prospective intern will apply to work with an Academy research scientist on a research project.  Successful applicants will participate in formal lectures in systematic biology, tours of each of the Academy's nine research departments, and research seminars in systematic biology.  Students will work on directed projects that provide them with an introduction to the problem and organisms to be studied and introduce them to the data collection, interpretation, and dissemination aspects of research in systematic biology.  Each student will produce a manuscript of the project's results, in the form of a scientific paper, and make an oral presentation of their results to their peers.  Evaluations of interns and participating Academy staff will be conducted each year with a view towards improving the Institute for succeeding years.  \r\n\r\n",
