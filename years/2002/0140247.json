 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Plasmid Biology 2002 Conference will be held in Pittsburgh in June 2002. Plasmids represent a unique group of genetic elements found in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and archaeon. In addition to their use as models for basic biological studies, plasmids are also important tools in the biotechnology industry, including their use in applications relevant to medicine and agriculture. Plasmids are a major source for genetic diversity amongst various organisms and are responsible for the spread of a variety of genes in nature.  Plasmid Biology 2002 represents a continuation of the symposium held to discuss the highlights of major advances in this field every two years.  This meeting deals with all aspects of plasmid biology, including their replication and maintenance, transfer, their role as a source of a horizontal gene pool, evolution, and ecology.  Approximately 200 scientists are expected to attend. There is no similar meeting that has an in-depth discussion of the various areas of plasmid biology. This meeting serves the international plasmid biology community and provides an excellent forum for exchange of ideas that are critical for the continued advances in the field. Participants in the meeting have traditionally included leaders in the field as well as younger scientists such as graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  Oral presentations by young scientists are encouraged and are designed to stimulate their enthusiasm for this field. NSF funds will help defray travel expenses of graduate students and postdoctural fellows.",
