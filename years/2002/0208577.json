 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational information theory is concerned with techniques (such as\r\nchannel coding) for achieving channel capacities.  The field has\r\nachieved dramatic scientific breakthroughs in recent years, and codes\r\nthat come close to theoretical limits have been discovered.  Today,\r\nthe development of coding and information theory is closely related to\r\nthe explosion of information technology, with applications to the\r\nInternet and the next generation of networks technologies.  The rapid\r\ndevelopment of a myriad of networked devices for computing and\r\ntelecommunications presents new and exciting challenges for coding and\r\ninformation theory. \r\n\r\nThis project will explore interconnections among coding theory,\r\ntheoretical computer science, information theory, and related areas of\r\ncomputer science and mathematics in order to deal with research\r\nchallenges arising from optical/magnetic recording and optical\r\ntransmission, the interface between information theory and symbolic\r\ndynamics, the development of network information theory, advances in\r\nhigh speed data transmission in wired channels, the connection between\r\ncoding theory and related mathematical approaches (especially using\r\ndiscrete mathematics), the role of compression in all layers of data\r\nnetworks, and exploiting the connections between algorithmic\r\ncomplexity and notions of entropy and randomness.\r\n\r\nResearch efforts will be carried out by ``working groups'' that will\r\ncome together at DIMACS for several meetings aimed at catalyzing\r\ncommunications and collaborations. Subgroups will investigate problems\r\nof interest. The working groups will be concerned with Data\r\nCompression in Networks and Applications and with Optical/Magnetic\r\nRecording and Optical Transmission.\r\n\r\nThe project will integrate research and education through a series of\r\nworkshops aimed at identifying areas for research, involving large\r\ngroups of researchers in the field of computational information theory\r\nand coding, and introducing many people (including outstanding junior\r\npeople and students) to the field.  Workshops are\r\nplanned on the topics of High Speed Data Transmission in Wired\r\nChannels, Network Information Theory, Complexity and Inference,\r\nInformation Theory and Symbolic Dynamics, and Coding Theory and\r\nDiscrete Mathematics.\r\n\r\n",
