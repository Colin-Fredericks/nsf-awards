 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nConservation of the earth's biological diversity is a pressing problem that excites and\r\nmotivates students from a wide range of institutions and disciplinary backgrounds.\r\nConservation biology is widely taught now, but it is seriously hampered by a lack of\r\nresources that capture its potential for inquiry-based learning. To foster changes in course\r\ncontent, curricula, and educational practices in conservation biology, The Center for\r\nBiodiversity and Conservation (CBC) at the American Museum of Natural History, the\r\nState University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-\r\nESF), and the University of Maine (UMaine) have formed a partnership to link faculty,\r\ngraduate students, and undergraduates with practicing professionals to generate an\r\nextensive set of classroom-tested, inquiry-based-learning materials. Each completed draft\r\nmodule will be evaluated in a classroom situation at UMaine and SUNY-ESF as well as\r\nat several pilot sites: Antioch New England Graduate School, Holyoke Community\r\nCollege, Lehman College, City University of New York, Long Island University,\r\nWoodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, Prescott College, and Columbia\r\nUniversity. A distinguishing project feature is its self-sustaining dissemination.\r\nDistribution of materials to undergraduate instructors will happen through three media: 1)\r\nan edited volume published by a commercial publisher; 2) CD-ROMs distributed by the\r\nCBC at cost; and 3) via an internet portal website hosted by the CBC. Over three years,\r\napproximately 50 instructors and 50 students will work directly on developing materials;\r\nabout 20 instructors in 25 diverse courses will test modules with at least 600\r\nundergraduate students at pilot sites and provide feedback.",
