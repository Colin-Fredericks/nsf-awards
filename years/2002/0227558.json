 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education (CAEE) at the University of Washington is advancing the scholarship of engineering learning and teaching through a partnership with Stanford University, Colorado School of Mines, the University of Minnesota, and Howard University.  CAEE is a multifaceted Higher Education Center for Learning and Teaching clustered around three core elements:  Scholarship on Learning Engineering, the Program for Enhancing Engineering Teaching, and Annual Engineering Education Institutes.   The Center's Scholarship on Learning Engineering includes cross-institutional longitudinal research studies on learning to engineer focusing on the development of engineers from undergraduate education through entry into the engineering workforce and targeted studies of core competencies and concepts central to engineering.  Professional development activities under the Center's Program for Enhancing Engineering Teaching (PEET) include the identification of resources to help engineering faculty address teaching challenges, thematic and research-to-practice workshops for future and current faculty, an engineering teaching portfolio initiative for graduate students, and the development of the Engineering Teaching Source, a web-based tool to enable engineering educators and instructional developers to locate high quality teaching resources.  Annual Engineering Education Institutes for engineering faculty and graduate students build and sustain the community of engineering education scholars.  The Institutes are advancing the engineering education research infrastructure by increasing the number of people able to conduct rigorous research and to become leaders in engineering education research and change agents in engineering education.  This project is jointly funded by the Division of Undergraduate Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Division of Engineering and Education Centers in the Directorate for Engineering.",
