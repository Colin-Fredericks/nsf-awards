 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pervasive Information Communities Organization (PICO) is a framework to\r\ncreate mission-oriented dynamic communities of software agents that perform tasks\r\non behalf of users and devices.  PICO provides automated continual services to\r\nimprove quality of life, and to utilize resources efficiently by enhancing\r\nexisting Internet services. PICO enabled Internet will be used effectively\r\nin many dynamically changing time-critical applications that demand\r\nproactive real-time collaborations among physical devices, software agents,\r\nand personnel in heterogeneous environments.\r\n\r\nThe main components of PICO are software entities, called delegents\r\n(intelligent delegates) and hardware entities, called camileuns (connected,\r\nadaptive, mobile, intelligent, learned, efficient, ubiquitous nodes).\r\n\r\nThe novel features of PICO include: i) creation of mission-oriented dynamic\r\ncommunities of software agents, ii) QoS management for just-in-time\r\ncommunication and proactive collaboration among communities, and iii)\r\nadaptability to dynamic environments through context- and\r\nlocation-awareness.\r\n\r\nAs a pervasive computing paradigm, PICO has applications in many domains\r\nsuch as telemedicine, the military, crisis management, and many day-to-day\r\nactivities. In this project the researchers focus on the design and development of PICO,\r\nand investigate its applicability as a platform for distributed\r\ncollaborations.  Through telemedicine applications, the researchers demonstrate the full\r\npotential of PICO as an Internet enhancement framework that is not only\r\nunique, simple, and versatile, but can also work with current and future\r\nhardware/software tools. Specifically, the proposed tasks include: formal\r\nspecifications, design, and development of PICO architecture; requirements\r\nanalysis for telemedicine scenario; QoS and resource management; PICO\r\nprototype development; and validation, performance evaluation and\r\nbenchmarking. PICO-enabled pervasive environments will revolutionize the way\r\nthe Internet is being used, enhance quality of life and promote user-centric\r\napplications. The PICO project will result in the training of students in\r\npervasive computing, high quality masters and doctoral theses, and transfer\r\nof technology to health care providers, professionals and other researchers.\r\n",
