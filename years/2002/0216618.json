 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to Western Washington University under the supervision of Drs. Peterson, Moyer and Young of the Biology Department to support the acquisition of\r\ncore instrumentation and software required for DNA sequencing, genotyping,\r\nand analysis.  The ease with which DNA can now be sequenced, coupled with\r\nadvances in molecular biology and computer science has revolutionized the\r\nbiological sciences. This technology is now central to basic research in\r\nmany disciplines, as well as integral to the training of future researchers\r\nand science educators.\r\n\r\nFunding from this proposal will facilitate primary research in eleven\r\ndifferent labs with current and pending funding.  A broad array of fields\r\nwill be supported by this instrumentation, including Conservation Biology,\r\nMicrobial Diversity, Evolutionary Biology, Plant Functional Genomics,\r\nDevelopmental Genetics, and Protein Biochemistry. State of the art\r\ninstrumentation will further enable grant procurement and renewal by\r\nallowing us to perform rigorous research using modern techniques. This core\r\ninstrumentation will also enhance our ability to attract and retain capable\r\nprofessors/researchers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to establishing and maintaining externally-funded research\r\nprograms, we are dedicated to the integration of research and training\r\nthrough the mentoring of undergraduates in faculty research labs. This\r\ntraining will allow our students to continue to be recognized regionally\r\nand nationally with jobs in the biotechnology industry, admission to\r\ngraduate and professional schools, and pre-doctoral awards.  Furthermore,\r\nwe are revising our core biology curriculum with a primary focus on the\r\nintegration of molecular biology approaches at all class levels.  In all,\r\nover 500 undergraduate students per year will directly benefit from this\r\ninstrumentation through instruction in the Biology Department. Through\r\nWWU's Integrated Laboratory Network the equipment supported by this grant\r\nwill be accessible to affiliated programs in the College of Arts and\r\nSciences and the Huxley College of Environmental Studies, as well as to\r\nfuture K-12 science educators enrolled in the Woodring College of\r\nEducation. In all, a broad spectrum of people, ranging from faculty and\r\nundergraduates to K-12 science students will benefit. Access to automated\r\nDNA sequencing and genotyping technologies will enhance student education\r\nand professional opportunities while furthering fundamental science\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n",
