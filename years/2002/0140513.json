The main goal of the project is\r\nto investigate \"higher rank\" dynamical systems. In\r\nparticular, the investigator will study actions of discrete\r\nand continuous higher rank abelian groups, which are natural\r\ngeneralizations of diffeomorphisms and flows on smooth\r\nmanifolds. Higher rank dynamical systems appear naturally in\r\nthe study of various geometric and algebraic objects. The\r\nprime examples of these systems include hyperbolic and\r\npartially hyperbolic actions by automorphisms and\r\ntranslations on compact cosets of Lie groups. Using dynamical,\r\nanalytic, and group theoretic methods the investigator\r\nwill study rigidity properties of such systems. The examples\r\nof possible rigidity properties include description of\r\ninvariant measures, regularity of measurable isomorphisms,\r\nand existence of smooth isomorphisms to the algebraic models.\r\n\r\nDynamical systems and ergodic theory is a relatively new field\r\nof mathematics which studies the evolution of physical and\r\nmathematical systems over time, for example planet systems,\r\nair and fluid flows. This field originated from the classical\r\nstudies in differential equations and celestial mechanics.\r\nDynamics and ergodic theory introduced new mathematical tools\r\ninto these areas of physics and mechanics, such as the study\r\nof the qualitative behavior in the long run as well as various\r\nanalytic and probabilistic methods. New ideas and concepts in\r\ndynamics, such as fractals and chaos, have not only affected\r\nthe field itself dramatically, but also fundamentally changed\r\nour understanding of the world. The influence of the studies\r\nin dynamical systems nowadays goes as far as meteorology, \r\nbiology, and computer science. \r\n\r\n \r\n",
