 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel Resonant-Enhanced Crystallization (REC) Process. REC technology is similar to conventional impeller stirring crystallization but with enhanced mass and heat transfer, low shear or reduced crystal breakage, and improved crystal size distribution. Purification and separation by crystallization is a multicomponent mass transfer phenomenon of the crystallizing solute and impurity solutes. Mass and heat transfer in crystallization process are key factors affecting crystal growth rate, size distribution and habit. However, in conventional crystallizers, the mass transfer coefficient is maximized when crystals are in their terminal velocity and increased agitation results in significant crystal breakage. The proposed technology will further increase mass transfer even in cases where crystals are in suspended status. Due to the low shear associated with the acoustic agitation, crystal breakage will be minimal. The second nucleation will also be reduced and therefore, crystal size distribution will be improved. The objective of this proposed research is to incorporate low-frequency acoustic agitation to the crystallization process to greatly enhance mass and heat transfer. This is expected  to improve crystal growth rate, size distribution and quality. \r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project are in the area of pharmaceutical separation and purification.",
