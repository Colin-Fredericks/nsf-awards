 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research places dependability analysis in a formal, software engineering process. This process is integrated with the analysis phase, when analysts and domain experts are interacting to\r\nformalize models of the artifact, environment and requirements of the  system.  The research focuses on building accurate, useful, robust models of the environment. The general approach is to look to existing modeling methodologies that center on exploring the environment. Those that show promise, e.g., the strand space methodology used in security models, will be retooled and integrated into the HDCP/MDS testbed.\r\n\r\nThe research also focuses on the environmental assumptions that are made during modeling as a basis for dependability of the deployed system. The research explores the link between assumptions made at analysis time, i.e., the assumptions made about the environment for the system to function correctly, and the actual environment behavior seen at run time (or testing/simulation time).\r\n\r\nThe evaluation of the research will be conducted on a series of projects taken from the HDCP/MDS testbed. Each project will be selected to highlight a separate modeling issue of the environment.\r\n",
