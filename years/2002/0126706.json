 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThis project is a multidisciplinary effort to integrate stable isotope analytical techniques into the science curriculum at Keene State College as a means to (1) motivate student learning; (2) involve them into the process of scientific investigation and develop their scientific and technical skills; and (3) increase their understanding of important concepts in the biological, geological, and environmental field. The project is designed to promote science education for students who at Keene State College are composed of a large proportion of first generation students, and in Biology, Geology, and Environmental Studies have 54 % women. Adapting exemplary models from several other institutions (Dartmouth College, Saint Louis University, and University of Utah) and the literature, student centered inquiry-based field and laboratory exercises are being designed that use stable isotopes to address scientifically interesting questions and highlight the interconnection between classes such as Ecology and Evolution, Environmental Geology, Glacial Geology, Stratigraphy, Hydrogeology, Paleontology, Geochemistry, Physiological Ecology, and Community and Ecosytems Ecology. In addition, stable isotope analysis is a critical component in student-faculty cooperative research projects through Independent Study and the Environmental Studies Junior/Senior Seminar. The acquisition of an isotope ratio mass spectrometer along with vacuum sample preparation lines is necessary because it allows us to complete the stable isotope analysis within the timeframe of a course (commercial analysis can take 4-12 months) and enables students to participate in the entire process of the investigation. The project is being evaluated using a combination of pre- and post-course questionnaires as well as a team of experienced external evaluators.",
