 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of a distance coaching system for foreign language learners using the tandem method through electronic media (eTandem).  The objectives of the proposed research are to establish a fundamental understanding of issues and parameters affecting eTandem distance coaching and to demonstrate feasibility of an eTandem distance coaching system.  Language learners lacking access to foreign language learning opportunities will be targeted.  Rural and disadvantaged learners are key target groups.  Tandem is an autonomous form of language learning where two native speakers of different languages form a reciprocal learning partnership.  Tandem coaching was conceived, researched and demonstrated to improve the effectiveness of the tandem learning process.  Since 1994, Tandem has been practiced using electronic media (eTandem) with great success.  The concept of distance coaching for eTandem learners, not previously researched, offers high potential to advance language learning and intercultural exchange for an international audience.\r\n     Parvis proffers a system, eTandem coaching, with potential for a dramatic impact on distance foreign language learning worldwide, serving a wide range of possible customers from K-12 to adult education.\r\n\r\n",
