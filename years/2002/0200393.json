 "awd_abstract_narration": "These research projects address problems in the model theory of\r\ndifferential fields and the model theory of the field of real\r\nnumbers with exponentiation.  The model theory of differential\r\nfields is a fascinating area requiring a sophisticated mixture of\r\nideas from stability theory, differential algebra and algebraic\r\ngeometry. The work of Buium and Hrushovski has shown that these\r\nideas have important consequences in Diophantine geometry.  In\r\nparticular, the principal investigator will study the model\r\ntheoretic behavior of solution sets of families of algebraic\r\ndifferential equations.  This line of research on the model\r\ntheory of the field of real numbers with exponentiation is\r\nexpected to concentrate on the relationship between global\r\nsolutions to differential equations at infinity and formal\r\nsolutions in the field of logarithmic-exponential series.\r\n\r\nModel theory is a branch of logic that explores mathematical\r\nstructures such as the real numbers together with their\r\narithmetic operations and ordering relation, analyzing the degree\r\nto which the basic rules or axioms for a collection of objects\r\nand their operations determine the shape of that collection.  The\r\nmethods and results of model theory are cast in terms of\r\ndefinable sets and functions, where a construction is definable\r\nexactly when it can be expressed by first-order logical formulas\r\nin the language of the structure. Model theoretic methods for the\r\nfield of real numbers with exponentiation have been remarkably\r\nsuccessful in proving new results on the geometry of exponential\r\nvarieties and sets defined from them. This work has already found\r\napplications in asymptotic analysis, control theory, microlocal\r\nanalysis, and neural networks.  The model theory of differential\r\nfields has had significant applications in number theory.\r\n",
