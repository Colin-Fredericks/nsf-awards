Its principal goal is the investigation of the dynamical and geometric \r\nstructures of \"higher rank\" systems.  Such systems naturally appear both in dynamical \r\nsystems and geometry.  In particular, the principal investigator will study \r\nrigidity properties of actions of higher rank abelian and semisimple Lie groups \r\nand their lattices with the ultimate goal of classifying such systems under \r\nsuitable geometric or dynamical hypotheses.  In particular, he will study higher\r\nrank hyperbolic abelian actions, and actions by semisimple groups and their \r\nlattices preserving affine and geometric structures. He will also investigate \r\ninvariant measures of algebraic higher rank abelian actions.  The investigator \r\nwill also investigate Riemannian manifolds (especially higher rank ones)\r\nand their geodesic flows.  Geometric, dynamical and group theoretic \r\ntools will be used in this research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamical systems and ergodic theory are relatively new fields that investigate \r\nthe evolution of a physical or mathematical system over time (e.g. turbulence in \r\na fluid flow).  New ideas and concepts from dynamics (e.g. chaos, fractals) have \r\nchanged our perception of the world fundamentally.  Dynamics and ergodic theory \r\nprovide the mathematical tools and analysis for these investigations. Dynamical \r\nsystems have had a major impact on the sciences and engineering.  Symbolic \r\ndynamics for instance has been instrumental in developing efficient and safe \r\ncodes for computer science.  Tools and ideas from smooth dynamics are used as \r\nfar afield as cell biology and meteorology. Geometry is one of the oldest fields \r\nin mathematics, and generally studies curves, surfaces and their higher \r\ndimensional analogues, their shapes, shortest paths, and maps between such \r\nspaces.  Differential geometry had its roots in cartography, and is now studied \r\nfor its close ties with physics and other sciences and applied areas (computer \r\nvision e.g.)as well as internal aesthetic reasons.  Geometry and dynamics are \r\nclosely related as some important dynamical systems originate from geometry, and \r\ngeometry also provides tools to study dynamical systems.  One main goal of this \r\nproject studies when two dynamical systems commute, i.e. when one system is \r\nunaffected by the changes brought on by the other. Important examples of such \r\nsystems arise from geometry. \r\n",
