 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis proposal is one part of a collaborative research effort between Dr. Yeung of Georgia Tech and Dr. Sreenivasan of Yale University (CTS-0121007) on the Reynolds and Schmidt number scalings in turbulence and turbulent mixing.  The research will include simulations and experiments.  Dr. Yeung who has access to the Teraflop IBM SP at the San Diego Supercomputer Center under NPACI will make direct numerical simulations of the flow.  With Teraflop capability, simulations will be carried out at much higher resolutions than here-to-fore.  Dr. Sreenivasan will carry out experiments in a tunnel using cryogenic liquid helium or nitrogen as the working fluid, which will result in much higher Reynolds number flows.  The data generated at high Reynolds numbers both by DNS and cryogenic experiments will be used together with existing data at lower Reynolds numbers to test the scaling laws.  Both proposals were sent to the  reviewers at the same time, and they were requested to return a single evaluation.\r\n",
