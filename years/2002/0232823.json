 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Association of America, in cooperation with the American Association for the Advancement of Science, is holding a conference of leaders in the emerging fields that integrate computer science, mathematics and the life sciences, and leaders in undergraduate education in all three areas. This conference is encouraging the nation to meet the educational challenge of producing students competent to enter these cross-cutting areas. Conference results are reports and resources for those interested in creating courses and programs. The most important product is a report to the nation for all stakeholders informing them of issues, needs, and opportunities, and what they can do.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Research and development in the life sciences have escalated as a result of: 1) the Human Genome Project, 2) national priorities to enhance and protect the health and well being of the people, and 3) the use of new technologies. The data being generated has outstripped our capability to analyze it. However, knowledge that can result from proper analysis of the data will lead to greater advances. New research initiatives lead to new ways to integrate the life, mathematical, and computer sciences. There are emerging fields of study that integrate these three disciplines, such as biotechnology, biostatistics, and bioinformatics. What is missing in this picture are the people who have the knowledge and skills to enter these new crosscutting areas. Students must be prepared for entering the workforce from all levels of undergraduate education, and students must be prepared for graduate programs in order to contribute to research and development needs.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: Reports resulting from the conference are being distributed widely to the major stakeholders and presentations are being made at professional meetings for higher education faculty in the three areas and at meetings of administrators and other educators. These presentations further bring the report and the issues addressed in it to their attention. New programs in the emerging areas at the crossroads of the three disciplines, interdisciplinary coursework, recruitment of students, and better-prepared students will be the benefits of this project. The nation will be in a stronger position to meet its priorities and further the dynamic work being done in the life and biomedical sciences.\r\n",
