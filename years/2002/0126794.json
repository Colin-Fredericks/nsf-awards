 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Materials Science (57)\r\nWe have developed a textbook and accompanying CD-ROM for a course in materials specifically designed for non-science majors. This work builds on the success of a course developed at Washington State University for non-science majors that addresses the manner in which materials impact society on a regional, national, and global scale. The course \"Materials: The Foundations of Society and Technology\" is targeted at third and fourth year undergraduates and is a \"capstone\" course in our General Education Curriculum. This textbook is based on the extensive notes we have prepared in developing the course and on research we have undertake under the auspices of this proposal. The textbook has been written in such a way that it can readily be used by the general college population. To assist faculty that decide to teach similar courses at their own institution we have developed a CD-ROM. Our CDROM has links to important educational and informational resources. In addition it contains homework problems and suggested assignments as well as background information regarding basic engineering and scientific principles.",
