 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past 6 years the principal investigators have developed a \r\nmethodology for assessing the risk associated with maritime\r\ntransportation. The methodology utilizes dynamic simulation of the\r\nmaritime transportation system, expert judgment elicitation models and\r\nprobabilistic risk assessment (PRA) techniques. The approach has proven\r\nuseful in three major maritime ports in the United States i.e. Port of\r\nNew Orleans (Mississippi River in Louisiana), Port Valdez (Prince\r\nWilliam Sound in Alaska) and Port Seattle (Puget Sound in Washington\r\nState). Two of these studies focused on passenger safety, while the\r\nother focused on oil transportation risk. The National Research Council in\r\n1998 assessed  the methodology and  concluded that representation of uncertainty \r\nin the maritime risk assessment method is lacking. \"The Prince William Sound \r\nRisk Assessment is an important step forward in using probabilistic risk \r\nassessment methods to assess the safety of transporting oil in large tankers\r\nin PWS. Because the data were very limited, the analysis results and the resulting\r\nconclusions are not robust and are necessarily uncertain [National Research\r\nCouncil, 1998].\"\r\n\r\nThis NSF project will allow the maritime risk assessment method to live\r\nup to its promise by developing a coherent theoretical framework to\r\naddress uncertainty. The truth is that we are uncertain. Therefore,\r\nspeaking the truth implies that we express our analysis results in terms\r\nof probability curves rather than fixed points estimates. [See, e.g.,\r\nKaplan, 1997]. The intellectual merit of the research stems from the\r\ndevelopment of an overarching Bayesian framework for addressing\r\nuncertainty when simulation of systems states is combined with available\r\ndata and expert judgment to assess risk and risk intervention\r\neffectiveness. The broader impact of the proposed work is primarily\r\ndrawn from its applicability to areas other than maritime accident risk\r\nsuch as e.g. maritime security risk (intentional events as opposed to\r\naccidents). The framework and methodologies to be developed will be\r\napplicable to other transportation modes, such as aviation or road\r\nsafety. Aside from aviation security and accident risk, the technique\r\nwill be directly transferable to the ever-increasing problem of runway\r\nincursions as a result of increased traffic congestion at our national\r\nairports.",
