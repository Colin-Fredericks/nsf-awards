The researchers will undertake a study of the physical and chemical properties of nanosized metal clusters on oxide surfaces.  The collaborators will correlate those physical and chemical properties measured for Au and Rh clusters of varying size with their catalytic properties.  They will stress the strengths of each group, namely, the synthesis capabilities of the Texas group and the unique characterization facilities of the Tokyo group, specifically for atomic force microscopy.  These studies are essential to understanding the unique properties of nanosized metal clusters for catalytic applications, and a key to establishing a methodology for predicting new systems and new reactions to be addressed by this exciting class of materials.\r\n\r\nThis research will facilitate the collaboration between two strong surface chemical groups with complementary expertise and capabilities, allowing an important technical problem to be addressed with a broad array of modern surface methods.  The project will offer a good opportunity to join efforts between the two countries.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of graduate students.  The researchers plan to publish results of the research in scientific journals and report on the findings at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\n",
