Tebbe\r\nLisa Grega\r\nThe College of New Jersey\r\n\r\nMRI/RUI:  Acquisition of Computational Modeling Facilities for Research and  Education in Engineering\r\n\r\nThis proposal from an REU institution, advancing the computational infrastructure of the institution (TCNJ) in Engineering, aims at improving the areas of computer aided design and numerical modeling (structural and thermal fluids) in both research and education. Three high performance workstations with 3-D graphics and visualization capabilities and expanded dynamic memory are requested along with licenses and training for two industry finite element modeling packages. The proposal addresses two strategic areas of national importance:\r\n\r\n  High Performance Computing and\r\n  Advanced Materials and Processing.\r\n\r\nThe former will be addressed through the infrastructure and training aspects; while the latter will be addressed through the research of the following topics:\r\n  Numerical Study of Transient and Interfacial Effects in Physical Vapor Transport and\r\n  Process Modeling of the Warm Forming of Aluminum.\r\nModeling will be done using commercial code such as ANSYS and FLUENT. Education and training activities are also planned. The project also addresses educational outreach and curriculum integration opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe funds requested include the equipment listed below and associated expenses.\r\n  Sun Blade 1000 workstations\r\n  ANSYS RFD upgrade license\r\n  FIDAP and Exceed software\r\n  Training for maintaining the packages\r\n\r\nThe equipment will support educational outreach programs and will be integrated with the curriculum to involve high school student, undergraduates and underrepresented groups.\r\n",
