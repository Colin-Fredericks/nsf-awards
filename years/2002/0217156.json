 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our world is composed of many ethnic communities in diaspora, each maintaining to a different degree a sense of identity related to their culture of origin. This research by cultural anthropologists studies patterns of variation in the cultural identity of Welsh communities. The current research adds two communities, one in Patagonia (Argentina) which retains the Welsh language and a variety of other cultural practices, and one in Ohio where Welsh-Americans live in self-consciously Welsh communities, but without retaining the language. The new information from this project will be integrated with that from previous studies of Welsh communities in Australia and Iowa as well as Wales. Hypotheses dealing with the importance of language, ethnic museums, performances, innovation in traditional institutions, and cultural exchange with Wales will be tested.  Using a variety of methods including in-depth interviews and consensus analysis, a statistical technique that describes patterns of agreement and disagreement among individuals, the study will advance our understanding of the cultural construction of identity among diaspora communities. The broader impacts of the research will be important as the project will allow us to better understand how identity politics works in relation to cultural visibility.",
