The organizers are Dr. Fred Wendorf, Department of Anthropology, Southern Methodists University, Dallas, Texas and Dr. Dr. Azza Mohamed Sarry El-Din, National Research Center (NRC), Cairo, Egypt.  The workshop is to exchange information between the US and Egyptian sides on: 1) specific topics in anthropological archeology including: cultural heritage management, exploration of the Nile floodplain, desert survey, desert-valley interaction, national archeological map, relationship between landscape culture and society, environs of Egyptian temples, 2) topics in physical anthropology and human paleontology including: early primates, paleopathology, prehistoric and early historic population characteristics, human genetics, including DNA studies of ancient and modern populations and populations history and migration, physical effects of urban environments in Egypt, and demographic and epidemiological transitions.\r\n\r\nScope: This project enables US and Egyptian scientists to participate in a workshop to discuss an area scientific importance to scientists and officials in both countries and to identify potential collaborative research where the two sides can complement each other's capabilities.  Dr. Wendorf has successfully conducted research in Egypt in this field for several years.  The NRC has a group that does considerable anthropological research in Egypt, and has the facilities to manage the workshop and to promote the resulting joint collaborative research. This project is being partially supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these joint scientific activities.  Additional funding is provided by the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.\r\n",
