 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lay Abstract:  NSF# 0132335 - CAREER\r\n\r\nUsing psychophysical and neurophysiological techniques, this research investigates several aspects of the important neural computations that are required for execution of visual orienting movements: 1) the mechanisms that mediate the transformation of sensory information into motor commands; 2) the neural computations required to decompose global motor commands observed at the level of the superior colliculus into signals required for coordinated contraction of muscles; and 3) the management of conflicting neural signals produced by the competition between motor commands and the sensory signals that are a direct result of the executed movements.\r\nSpecifically, this proposal will test the predictions of a hypothesis that states that a gaze-related command signal issued by the superior colliculus is decomposed by cells in the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) into separate eye and head control signals, and that eye-head coordination (observed during visual orienting movements) is mediated by the interactions of these signals.  The mechanisms for controlling head movements are largely unknown, and this proposal seeks to correlate cell activity with head movements during coordinated eye-head movements, during pursuit of moving targets, and during more natural movements that combine gaze shifts and pursuit movements.  This proposal will contribute to understanding how the brain accomplishes the required computations to coordinate more than 40 muscles and muscle groups to produce a smoothly coordinated re-direction of the line of sight.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this proposal will contribute to the development of courses based on the idea that students' desire to understand general principles will lead to their own investigation of the details, using in-class lectures and small group discussions.  Increased numbers of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students will participate in the laboratory research proposed, both during the academic year and in a summer undergraduate internship program.\r\n\r\n",
