 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nMany problems in science, engineering, and mathematics are inherently spatial in nature. \r\nExamples are understanding and reasoning about atoms in a molecule, the design of mechanical \r\nand electronic systems such as robots, the layout of an integrated circuit or microelectronic\r\nmechanical chip, and the transmission of tension and compression forces in a structural\r\nsystem. These problems all demand the ability to visualize and reason spatially.\r\nSurprisingly, students of science and engineering are seldom taught these skills.\r\nVisual thinking and the ability to reason spatially can be taught and learned: indeed, this\r\nis a central component of architectural design education. We teach architects to manage\r\nand manipulate complex configurations of physical elements in space, and architectural\r\neducators have developed techniques for teaching this ability. In the past, the principal\r\nmeans for teaching spatial and visual thinking has been drawing and three-dimensional\r\nmodel-making. Today interactive media and software tools augment these traditional\r\nmethods. Based on experience with teaching visual skills to architectural designers we are\r\ndeveloping a series of exercises that, as part of a course on visual and spatial reasoning, \r\ncan enhance science, mathematics, and engineering education for undergraduate students.\r\nThe exercises include drawing with pencil and paper as well as computational drawing\r\nmedia, physical as well as computer-graphics based three dimensional modeling,\r\nand techniques for shifting between computational and physical representations. We are\r\ntesting these exercises in a course taught to first-year college students and assessing the \r\nlearning experience using both formative and summative evaluations.",
