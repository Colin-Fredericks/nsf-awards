 "awd_abstract_narration": "This plan integrates research and education in the area of combustion, specifically focusing on self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) of new materials from nanocomposite reactants. The research objective is to understand the influence of reactant characteristics on the combustion synthesis process, and on the microstructure of the final product. The work has five primary phases: (1) development of techniques to process reactants, both in random media and multi-layered foils; (2) development of integrated MEMS-based sensing; (3) determination of the controlling mechanisms of reaction wave propagation; (4) characterization of the initial and final products; and (5) demonstration of a commercial application of a combustion-synthesized material. Temperature and pressure measurements of the reacting wave are made using micro-fabricated test structures with integrated sensors. Measurements of combustion behaviors are obtained using high-speed diagnostic techniques to allow imaging of combustion waves (i.e., to determine flame speeds and to observe spinning combustion or pulsating waves). Reactants and products are characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction  (XRD) analyses. A synthesized product material is tested experimentally on a commercial application with our industrial partner, Solar Turbines, Inc. The experimental effort is complemented by theoretical analysis and software development using a commercial simulation package that contains modules to numerically solve problems in heat transfer, multi-phase flow and reacting flows. \r\nThe materials developed in this plan are applied as coatings on gas turbine components to improve the performance and durability of the system. The newly developed material coatings act as a protective barrier against high-temperature oxidation and corrosion, which are the main degradation mechanisms that occur in the turbine sections. When subjected to the hot gas streams of a typical combustion environment, the newly developed coatings will resist surface attack and maintain the component's mechanical properties. \r\nThe study incorporates a \"project-based\" instruction component. Students will work in teams on projects relating to this research. They learn about fabricating nano-scale systems, perform combustion studies on the reacting samples, and characterize the final products. The project also includes a mentoring program, linking graduate with undergraduate engineers in a supportive work environment. This experience guides students in making career choices, demonstrates the relevance of their coursework to solving real problems, and contributes to their overall preparedness. \r\n",
