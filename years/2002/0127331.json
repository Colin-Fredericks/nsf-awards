 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)\r\nHigh quality color maps that plot the location of and display analytical datasets, descriptions, images, or movies are difficult to publish in a format that facilitates their easy access, distribution and use. The need for them is clear: most professional geologic meetings start and end with map-based field trips, students are taught using them, and they form the backbone of many geologic research projects. With previous NSF funding, the PI developed a proof-of-concept solution on the Macintosh, called the Dynamic Digital Map. DDMs display data using several methods, including point-and-click at icons pin-pointing locations on maps, from lists of samples or sites, and by linked text. The data displayed by a DDM come from spreadsheets, or files created in CAD or GIS programs by any author who inserts or links it into a DDM Template, following instructions in a \"DDM Cookbook\". The finished DDM becomes a freely distributable \"stand alone\" program, running with no additional software. This project continues and accelerates the Macintosh-only DDM conversion to a cross-platform program (Win32, Macintosh, Linux) that is web enabled and allows information to be expressed at different user levels (e.g. from the professional to the junior high earth-science class) in one DDM, thus encompassing a wide audience. Dissemination is by WWW (including DLESE) and CD, with reviews and testing in several institutions. The first workshop on how to create and use DDMs is being held at the Geological Society of America Northeast Sectional meeting March 24, 2002. \r\n",
