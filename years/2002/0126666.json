 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth Systems Science (40)\r\nWe are integrating GIS technology into most field, laboratory, and classroom courses in a new Earth and Environmental Sciences (EES) program at Virginia Wesleyan College. Our project includes a request to equip an enhanced laboratory/lecture classroom and a small GIS laboratory, and acquire two pieces of environmental monitoring equipment capable of collecting digital data for import and use in ArcView . Although GIS has established itself as an important tool for the manipulation, analysis, and display of spatial data, it is not always easy for students outside of geography to gain exposure to, and proficiency with, this technology. To help narrow the gap, we are integrating GIS into nearly all courses of the existing EES curriculum. We are adapting parts of exemplary programs at Sul Ross University, Lewis and Clark University, Washington and Lee University, Richard Stockton University, and Miami University. Students just beginning their college career become familiar with only a small number of spatial manipulations in their lower division courses, benefiting mostly from the visual aspects of GIS, whereas EES majors close to graduation become quite proficient in all aspects of spatial data analysis.\r\nBecause the available data exist in almost limitless variety, equally diverse classroom situations are being employed to encourage hypothesis building and testing, discussion of cause and effect, and cooperative learning. Future K-12 teachers and students taking EES courses to fulfill general studies requirements are also discovering that GIS components in lecture and lab make the experiences more interactive, visually\r\nstimulating, and fun.\r\n",
