The funds requested will be used to encourage wider participation in the\r\nconference by young chemical engineering faculty and promising graduate students by\r\nproviding partial support for travel expenses and conference fees.\r\n\r\nThe program for the conference has four sub-themes: 1) Biomolecules at Interfaces, 2)\r\nSelf-Assembly at Interfaces, 3) Consequences of Colloid Forces and 4) Charge Effects in\r\nNonaqueous Media. 22 speakers and 20 discussion leaders have been invited and agreed to participate in the oral program. In addition to the invited talks, posters are encouraged\r\nto be submitted from all conference participants, especially from those not invited to\r\nspeak. A 30-minute time slot is included in the morning program each day for oral\r\noverviews. The Vice-Chair will select between 3 and 6 posters to be summarized orally\r\neach day in this time slot. Full examination of all posters will be conducted in each\r\nafternoon's poster session. A final report will be prepared and submitted to the National Science Foundation. \r\n",
