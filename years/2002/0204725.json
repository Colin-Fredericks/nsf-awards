We propose to apply an abstract  \r\nsetting we previously formulated and studied to rigorously prove\r\nthe existence of non-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors\r\nin certain systems of ordinary differential equations, including a modified\r\nsystem of van der Pol and certain periodically excited systems experiencing\r\nHopf bifurcations. We also propose to analytically establish the fact that\r\nnon-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors naturally arise when\r\nan asymptotically stable periodic solution of a given system\r\nof ordinary differential equations is periodically excited by generic\r\nexternal forcing. These non-uniformly hyperbolic strange attractors have \r\nproperties that include most of standard mathematical notions associated\r\nwith chaos: positive Liapunov exponents, positive entropy, SRB measure,\r\nexponential decay of correlation, nice symbolic coding of orbits etc.\r\nWe also propose to study the geometric structure of the integral manifold\r\nof the spatial four-body problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis research proposal is mainly on the subject of non-uniformly hyperbolic \r\nstrange attractors. In general an attractor is a state to which a system will \r\neventually evolve. One of the most important way of studying systems in nature \r\nis to first model then study them as solutions of certain differential \r\nequations. We propose to apply a theory we previously developed  \r\nto prove the existence of a class of strange attractors in some systems of  \r\ndifferential equations arisen from various scientific disciplines including \r\nin the studies of turbulence, fluid mechanics and plasma mechanics. The \r\nattracting states we propose to study have very complicated dynamical \r\nproperties and sophisticated geometric structures. They were observed in\r\nmany numerical and laboratory experiments but their existence were rarely \r\nestablished mathematically in the past. We also propose to study the geometric\r\nstructure of the integral manifold of the spatial four-body problem. This is a \r\nlong standing mathematical problem with potential applications on orbit design\r\nfor artificial celestial objects. \r\n\r\n",
