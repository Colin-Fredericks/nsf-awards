 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal:\t\t\t\tDMS-0204823,  DMS-0204845\r\nPrincipal Investigators:\tBenji Fisher,  David Rabson\r\n\r\n\t\t\tA B S T R A C T\r\n\r\nFisher and Rabson are classifying the symmetry types of quasicrystals\r\nin two and three dimensions and studying the physical consequences of\r\nthese symmetries.  The classification generalizes the work begun in\r\nthe nineteenth century on space groups of crystals.  The investigators\r\nfollow the Fourier-space approach to crystallography, which has the\r\nadvantage of avoiding space groups in higher dimensions.  Thus the\r\nclassification starts from the known list of finite subgroups of the\r\northogonal groups O(2) and O(3).  They introduce techniques of group\r\ncohomology, some of which have long been used in \"direct space,\" to\r\nthe Fourier-space formulation.  These techniques lead to both\r\ntheoretical simplifications and efficient computational methods.  One\r\nimportant application of these ideas is the description of certain\r\ngauge invariants in terms of group homology.  The two simplest types\r\nof homology class are connected with known physical phenomena:\r\nsystematic extinctions in diffraction patterns and crossing of\r\nelectronic bands (\"band sticking\").  The next simplest type first\r\noccurs in a rank-five tetragonal modulated crystal and should be\r\nconnected with some similar phenomenon.  Tiling models are produced,\r\nand the ideas are also extended to magnetic and color groups.\r\n\r\nCrystallography underlies and informs much of physics, chemistry, and\r\ngeology. The present research has applications to recent experiments\r\nin liquid crystals (related to the popular LCD displays on\r\nwristwatches and other electronic equipment), plasmas, and modulated\r\ncrystals, highly symmetric systems that cannot be described by the\r\nclassical theory of crystals.  Ever since 1784, when the French abbot\r\nRene Just Hauy deduced the microscopic structure of crystals, it had\r\nbeen believed impossible for a crystal to have the symmetries of an\r\nicosahedron (or a soccer ball).  Precisely 200 years later, such\r\nmaterials, called \"quasicrystals,\" were discovered, and much research\r\nhas ensued into their properties.  Quasicrystals possess strange\r\nelectronic and physical properties and have already found application\r\nas high-quality, non-stick coatings on electrosurgical blades.  The\r\npresent research aims to classify the symmetry types of crystals and\r\nto study physical properties associated with these symmetries.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences\r\nand the Division of Materials Research.",
