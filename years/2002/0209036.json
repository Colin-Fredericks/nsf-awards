 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embedded systems require maximum performance from a processor within\r\nsignificant constraints in power consumption and chip cost.  Using\r\nsoftware pipelining, high-performance digital signal processors can\r\noften exploit considerable instruction-level parallelism (ILP), and\r\nthus significantly improve performance. However, software pipelining\r\nsometimes fails to utilize the processor efficiently and may hinder\r\nthe goals of low power consumption and chip cost.\r\n\r\nThe problems with software pipelining can be ameliorated by using\r\nadvanced compiler loop transformation techniques.  However, current\r\nmethods for applying loop transformations are lacking. Metrics for\r\napplying loop transformations do not model high-performance digital\r\nsignal processing (DSP) architectures and the effects of software\r\npipelining effectively. \r\n\r\nThis research will address the above problems by developing\r\nand experimentally validating the following:\r\n\r\n1) A performance metric that accurately models software-pipelined\r\nloop performance on high-performance DSP architectures. \r\n\r\n2) A prediction of the register pressure of a software-pipelined\r\nloop before high-level loop transformations are applied.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this research, more ILP will be exploited in DSP\r\napplications, resulting in an increase in performance and a savings in\r\nthe overall energy required to execute an application. Improvements in\r\nperformance and energy usage will allow better and more\r\ncomputationally expensive algorithms to be used in embedded systems.\r\n",
