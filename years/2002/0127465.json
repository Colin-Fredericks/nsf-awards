 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric Sciences (41)\r\nA visually-realistic virtual tornadic supercell thunderstorm is being developed with data probe capabilities, providing students from K-12 through graduate with opportunities to learn as scientists learn in a constructivist manner. The virtual storm is a proof-of-concept for later creation of other virtual geoscience systems. The virtual storm addresses the NSF goal of providing all students access to excellent undergraduate science education, with learning based upon direct experience with methods and processes of inquiry. This research is being built upon a simple prototype of the virtual storm, already developed with internal funds at Iowa State University. Although the prototype storm, lacking data probe capabilities, was developed in a fully-immersive virtual CAVE, a version has been disseminated to linux-based PCs, improving student access. We are creating a Windows-based version for wider dissemination. The numerous small-scale details within a super cell thunderstorm that reflect the wide range of important atmospheric processes occurring make the storm an especially useful model to serve as a proof-of-concept. An assessment of the impact the virtual storm has on science education is being made by comparing student answers to questions on the topic in a large-lecture introductory course in year 1 (no exposure to the virtual storm) to those from year 2 when students are exploring the virtual storm. Successful completion of the project should demonstrate that exciting laboratory-type experiences of phenomena previously off limits to students within classroom laboratories can be brought to students everywhere by virtual reality simulations.",
