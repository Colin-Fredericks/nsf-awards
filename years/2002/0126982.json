 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99) Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThis project is implementing the use of atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) in the chemistry and environmental science curricula. Recent internal and external assessments of the chemistry program as well as the recent implementation of the environmental sciences program have demonstrated a gap in curricula as a result of students not using AAS in the laboratory. AAS has been established as a fundamental technique in the quantitative determination of trace metals. In order to implement AAS into six courses of the chemistry curriculum and one course of the environmental science curriculum, a number of experiments are being adapted and modified from the educational literature. Students are using AAS in general chemistry laboratory, environmental analytical chemistry laboratory, and then the intermediate laboratory I/II and advanced laboratory I/II sequence. In the ES program, AAS is used in the advanced environmental science laboratory. In addition, seniors are able to use AAS in their senior research projects that are required for graduation. Students learn the theoretical basis of AAS and also have extensive hands-on experience. This ensures proper training in AAS for chemistry and environmental science majors who go on to graduate school or are employed in the private or public sector.",
