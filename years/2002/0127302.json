 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ancient Andean empires were communications dinosaurs; information and \r\ndecision-making traveled only as fast as a human could, and the Andean \r\npeoples did not know writing.  Lacking the administrative technology of \r\ncontemporaneous European or Asian states, the native empires of the Andes \r\nwere forced to develop alternative modes of statecraft, and other \r\nprinciples to integrate their subject populations. Archaeologists have long \r\nsuspected, based on Spanish eyewitness accounts of the Inka empire, that \r\none of the crucial integrative mechanisms of prehispanic statecraft was the \r\nelaborate mortuary practices of the politically important.  In the Inka \r\nempire, the carefully kept bodies of deceased rulers served as material \r\nsymbols of dynastic succession and political continuity.  Through periodic rituals and\r\nfine mausoleums mummies were the setting for public communication of \r\nmessages of political legitimization and imperial authority.  While the \r\nrole of the dead in Inka statecraft has been well studied, much less is \r\nknown about this topic in early Andean empires, such as the Wari; in some \r\nways a fore-runner of the Inka that dominated the highlands between AD 400 \r\nand 800.  Ms. Charlene Milliken's doctoral dissertation project, conducted \r\nunder the direction of Dr. Marc Bermann, will investigate the site of Conchopata, \r\nPeru.  At its height, Conchopata was a secondary center of the Wari empire \r\n(A.D. 600-1000) and consisted of residential zones, public plazas, pottery workshops, \r\ntemples, and specialized mortuary complexes. Excavation will center on \r\nresidential contexts associated with two mortuary \r\ncomplexes, and research will test the hypothesis that these mortuary complexes were \r\nused by Conchopata elites in the veneration of important ancestors. \r\nConchopata is a particularly good location for this research because \r\nseveral intact mortuary structures have been uncovered; normally these \r\nkinds of facilities were looted or destroyed long ago. This project will \r\nprovide the first investigation of the potential role of mortuary activity \r\nin Wari political statecraft as one native means by which authority is \r\nconstructed and expressed in non-literate, non-Western populations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
