These microparticles are self-contained micrometer-scale reactors capable of performing genetic analysis without expensive instruments. The new composite beads, with temperature stability, solvent resistance, controlled buoyancy and other properties, will find applications  in many diverse markets. The Sphericule methodology combines layers of natural and synthetic polymers, metals, ceramics and other chemicals to produce new composite beads, fibers and coatings.  In contrast, multifunctional latex beads using a surface coating of antibody on a micron sized fluorescent particle are labor intensive to produce. Particle batch processing results in aggregation, uneven surface treatment, and loss of signal molecules. This Phase I project proposes a novel method for synthesizing uniform particles using micro-scale systems in a continuous process. In this process, the chemistries of bead formation, optical reagent incorporation and surface modifications are expected to be straightforward, stoichiometric and predictable. \r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project are in the areas of biomedicalresearch, diagnostics, electronics, and defense.",
