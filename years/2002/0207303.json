 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of the project is the observation of the dynamics of subaqueous volcaniclastic sedimentation from eruption-fed density currents, and the characteristics of the resulting deposits.  Since the processes in question are almost impossible to observe in the field, an alternative approach will be employed here: the use of laboratory tanks to perform experiments that reproduce the deposits.  The experiments have been designed to model as accurately as possible three settings: a) lacustrine turbidites of the Taupo volcano, New Zealand, b) submarine hyaloclastites consisting of limu shards and c) eruption-fed density currents of the style of Pahvant Butte.  The results will be used to extend existing numerical models of turbidity currents to the case of 2-D and 3-D currents laden with vesiculated grains of variable size and density as well as hot water.  The numerical models will provide new predictive tools for the study of volcaniclastic stratigraphy.\r\n\r\nThis research represents a collaborative effort between Gary Parker of the University of Minnesota (turbidity currents) and James White of the University of Otago, New Zealand (subaqueous volcaniclastic deposits).\r\n\r\n",
