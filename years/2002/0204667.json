The first way is to study the potential function of\r\nthe Bergman metric of a polarized compact   Kaehler\r\nmanifold.  For the application in the Kaehler-Einstein\r\ngeometry, one needs to estimate the potential function from\r\nbelow for a family of manifolds. The problem is related to\r\nthe stability of manifolds in the sense of Geometric\r\nInvariant Theory. The second way is to study the relation\r\nbetween the K stability and the Mumford stability.  Such a\r\nrelation, if exists, would give one new insights of the\r\nrelations  between the Kaehler-Einstein geometry and the\r\nstability of manifolds. The third way  is the geometry of\r\nmoduli space of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds.  A Kaehler\r\nmetric on the moduli space has been defined  and was found\r\nthat the Ricci curvature of such a metric is negative away\r\nfrom zero by the proposer. In order to introduce geometric\r\nanalysis to the place, one needs to prove a version of the\r\nmaximal principle on the moduli space, even if the moduli\r\nspace, in general, is not smooth.\r\n\r\nEinstein's general theory of relativity is a theory that\r\ninterprets the concept of gravity into the geometric\r\nproperty of the space.  Recent development  of in physics\r\nshows that the universe may be  of dimension ten, with three\r\ndimension in space and one  dimension in time plus a tiny\r\nsix  dimensional space called  Calabi-Yau threefold. One of\r\nthe main mathematical tool to study the geometry of the\r\nspace is differential geometry. Since the discovery of the\r\ngeneral relativity, differential geometry becomes crucial to\r\nboth mathematicians and physicists. The project is one of\r\nthe main field in differential geometry. It will help a lot\r\nin understanding one of the basic force of the universe: the\r\ngravity and ultimately understanding the space we are living\r\nwith. It is difficult to believe that without an extensive\r\nstudy of fundamental sciences such as general relativity,\r\nmodern technology like the use of atomic energy can come\r\ntrue. By the same reason, today's fundamental study will not\r\nonly enlarge our knowledge but eventually benefit people's\r\nlife as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
