 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nComparative Anatomy, Phylogeny and Biogeography of Fossil and Living Gonorynchid Fishes\r\n\r\n\tThe family Gonorynchidae is an extant family of primitive ostariophysan fishes with a long, and well-preserved fossil record dating over 65 million years. Ostariophysi (e.g. carps, minnows, catfishes) in turn, is one of the largest groups of fishes on earth (75% of all freshwater fishes). An understanding of this basal fish group, (i.e., Gonorynchidae) will provide vital information necessary to better understand the complicated history of the Ostariophysi as a whole. This study contains three clearly defined objectives. First, The comparative osteology and development of extant species will be examined. It is necessary to understand Recent forms first before including fossil taxa. Fossil taxa are often incompletely preserved and developmental stages are often not available. Second, based on the data generated from objective 1, a phylogenetic or evolutionary analysis of all gonorynchid species will be conducted. Third, data generated from the phylogenetic analysis will be used in a study of Historical Biogeography. If one assumes that the earth and its biota evolved together, than an understanding of the evolutionary patterns of the biota should lead to a better understanding of the history of the earth. This project thus has broader application to those interested in earth history and global change.\r\n\tThe significance of this project is multifaceted. This study will cross disciplinary lines and combine paleontology and neontology into one project. It will provide the first phylogeny for Gonorynchidae that is based on a thorough comparative examination of all fossil and living species. Results from this study will ultimately result in a better understanding of one of the most important teleost fish groups known, the Ostariophysi. Because of the well-bounded nature of this study, it will be used as a training tool for undergraduate and Masters students at Loyola University and the Field Museum. Students will have hands-on experience to all aspects of this project from the preparation of both fossil and extant taxa to data collection and computer analyses. Funds from this grant, along with matching funds from Loyola University, will expose students to both the complexities and the intellectual rewards of doing comprehensive anatomical phylogenetic work, and contribute to the long-term health of comparative morphological studies in general. This project thus extends beyond the limits of ostariophysan systematics and will be of interested to developmental biologists, biogeographers and systematists in general. The goal of this project is not only to provide vital information to colleagues, but also to help assume the responsibility of educating and training students to a field of biology fundamental to other disciplines. \r\n",
