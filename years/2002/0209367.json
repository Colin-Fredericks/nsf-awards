 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project provides funds for a block travel grant for U.S. sociologists to attend the XVth World Congress of the International Sociological Association in Brisbane, Australia, July 7-13, 2002.  The major conference of the International Sociological Association, the World Congress occurs at four-year intervals and attracts approximately 5,000 participants.  Support for travel  of U.S. sociologists permits continued growth of international exchange and collaboration in sociology.  An activity of this type is particularly timely given the necessity to promote international collaborations on challenges arising from global social processes and transformations, including those stemming from global interconnectedness, the new technolgies associated with the internet, and the growing hybridization of cultures.  Evaluation  of indiviudal requests for travel awards, selection of recipients, and  the distriubtion of funds will be the responsibility of the American Sociological Association.  Competitive criteria for an award include an iinvitation or acceptance of a paper, the scientific merit of the paper,  and qualifications of the applicant.  The selection process will seek to ensure a presence at the World Congress of junior scholars and sociologists underrepresented in international scholarly meetings.",
