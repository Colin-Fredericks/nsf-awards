The Science Policy Dialogues occur under the auspices of the National Science Foundation of the United States (NSF) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). The principal objective of the decade of science policy dialogues is to explore issues facing the United States and China that have significant implications for the vitality of science and engineering in the borderless, knowledge-based economy of the 21st century.  Funds provided in the first phase supported an initial seminar in October 1999 in Beijing under the theme Enhancing Links between the Production, Dissemination, and Application of Research and a second major seminar on in December 2000 entitled U.S.-China Forum on Biotechnology and Biomedicine held on the campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, and will be used to support the Technical Innovation Workshop that will be held in Washington in March 2002. The second phase will include four major events: 1) the Policy/Strategy Workshop (i.e., the meeting of the Advisory Council), Beijing, June 2002); 2) the U.S.-China Seminar on Engineering Education for the Global Economy, Shanghai and Beijing, October 2002; 3) a trilateral U.S.-Japan-China seminar on Ethics and the Internet (tentatively targeted at spring 2003); 4) and a seminar on a yet-to-be-determined subject.  The Advisory Council envisioned in the first phase will be fully implemented in the second phase to guide the selection of topics and to monitor progress toward the overall objectives.\r\n",
