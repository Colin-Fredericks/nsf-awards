 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animals interact with their local environment in ways that determine their reproductive success and survival.  By looking at how climate, topography, and vegetation interact with the physical properties of the animal, including its metabolic rate and heat gain and loss, a basic model can be developed.  The current model uses global climate data, digital elevation maps, vegetation maps and animal properties to calculate available microclimates, animal energetics, behavior, activity patterns, food web structure, community structure and potential for and food-borne pathogen and pesticide exposure. New work will extend the model's availability by providing a graphical user interface and web accessibility, as well as by extending the database of information on animal reflectivity and morphology.\r\n\r\nThe model can be applied to a wide range of questions from the appropriateness of environments for relocating endangered species to the impact of climate change on animal population dynamics and environmental impacts of pesticide spraying or forest burns or other management activities.  Informed decision making is improved and a wide range of collaborators and students help to spread the use of the \r\n",
