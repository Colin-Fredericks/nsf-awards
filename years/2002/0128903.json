Stern of the Boyce Thompson Institute at Cornell University and Silva Lerbs-Mache of the University Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, France.  They lead a collaborative program involving reciprocal visits of postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, and faculty researchers.  The project utilizes a multi-faceted approach to the study of transcription in organelles, specifically, mitochondria and plastids.  The objectives are:  (1) to use reverse genetic approaches in maize cell cultures and in Arabidopsis plants to reveal the functions of proteins in organelle transcription and plant development; (2) to reconstitute the active polymerase through overexpression of putative components; and (3) to use proteomics approach to discover any unknown subunits.  The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in reverse genetics in maize to discern organelle protein function.  This is complemented by French laboratory strengths in Arabidopsis and RNA polymerases biochemistry.  Reciprocal visits of junior faculty and students are emphasized to add an international dimension to their activities and to develop international connections early in their careers.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the US investigators, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students.  The CNRS will support visits to US of the French participants. The collaboration will advance understanding of organelle biogenesis and plant development. \r\n",
