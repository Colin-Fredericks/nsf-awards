The goal is to build awareness in the mathematics community that programs with the identified characteristics can enhance student academic experiences, improving student performance as well as aiding in attracting and retaining students.\r\n\r\nThe workshop agenda is to identify and showcase effective mentoring methods to improve attraction and retention of underrepresented minorities in mathematics, utilizing expertise form institutions that have demonstrated successful mentoring and nurturing. The workshop will include programs directed toward undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students. \r\n\r\nBy identifying successful practices and disseminating these findings by way of the AMS website and other professional society communications, and through participating institutions, the PI anticipates that mathematics departments will be motivated to initiate programs with mentoring components, which is expected to improve departmental environment.\r\n\r\n",
