The goal of the project is to provide power and data communication capability over the abandoned ANZCAN telecommunications cable, which will be moved 26 kilometers to the existing site of the 13-year ALOHA time series.  The cable comes ashore on Oahu, and it will be managed from University of Hawaii's Manoa campus.  It will enable a major increase in experimental capability at and near the site, with a kilowatt of power and 2 mbaud data rate available to support instruments and ocean experiments in physical, chemical, biological and geological oceanography as well as meteorology, ocean optics, biogeochemistry and other fields.  A moored profiler will provide continuous monitoring of the physical properties of the full water column, with operator control to respond to ocean events.  An acoustic modem capability will be included to allow deployment and communication with experiments that are not physically attached to the cabled junction box.  The cabled observatory will have Internet connectivity, allowing researchers to observe and control their experiments, and providing links to the observatory and to related educational sites for students at levels from grade school to graduate school. University of Hawaii will provide cost-share support equal to more than 30% of equipment costs, per MRI Program guidelines for development proposals undertaken at Ph.D.-granting institutions.\r\n***\r\n",
