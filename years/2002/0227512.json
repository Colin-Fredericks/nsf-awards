 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the workshop to discuss various materials aspects related to their utilization in extreme environments encountered in Alaska. The funding will enable around 30 participants from various countries to attend the workshop. This is the second in series with the first workshop conducted in Alaska in February 2001 where potential research areas were identified that would benefit Alaska with emphasis on manufacturing and materials aspects. In this second workshop, specific materials and manufacturing aspects will be discussed in detail. A major objective of the workshop is to bring together leading experts in materials research and manufacturing. Items that are to be discussed include materials issues in extreme environments, such as sub-zero temperatures and remote locations with particular attention to stimulate ideas to direct new or existing materials into commercial products such as those needed for transport surfaces, pipelines, entertainment, and communication. The goal of the workshop is to draft a short and long-term plan for Alaskan materials development and manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThere are many challenging issues related to materials and manufacturing aspects pertaining to the extreme environmental conditions and remote access in Alaska. Roads, harbors, and buildings in arctic environments are generally built on permafrost and seismically unstable locations, and thus must function at sub-zero temperatures. There is a need for technological development of materials with regard to the special needs of the extreme arctic environment such as the effect on the landscape, energy consumption, and potential accidents. The preservation of the Alaskan environment is paramount in any commercial development. The workshop enables participation of experts from academia, government and industrial institutions in Alaska, surrounding countries and other parts of the United States. Efforts will be made to invite and recruit minorities. The organizers of the workshop will review the abstracts and potential candidates with possible collaborations will be given priority. This grant supports the travel and registration of around 30 selected participants.\r\n",
