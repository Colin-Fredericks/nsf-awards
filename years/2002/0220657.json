 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program provides scholarships to low-income, academically talented students in architectural technology, civil engineering technology and electronics and mechanical design technology programs. Our efforts are expanded to recruit individuals from groups underrepresented in CSEM fields, including women, ethnic/linguistic and racially underrepresented groups and students with disabilities. Strong and varied student supports are in place to retain scholarship recipients through services such as academic support, counseling and mentoring activities. The College has successfully administered similar scholarships and fellowships and this scholarship program compliments existing resources. MATC and the MATC Foundation are providing additional funds and services to enhance the program. Our main objectives of the ACE'M program are to increase enrollment of underrepresented students, including women, minorities and persons with disabilities in CSEM programs at MATC, monitor their progress to promote and assure timely completion of their programs, increase overall graduation rates and achieve either full employment for CSEM graduates related to their program or continuing on to a four-year college within six months of graduation.",
