 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in manufacturing processes for low-cost, multi-functional composite materials that have marine, rail and other ground transportation safety applications. The key steps will involve (1) development of innovative manufacturing methods using out-of-autoclave processes, that are derivatives of liquid molding approaches, to co-infuse resin systems in multi-layered composites of simple shapes representative of structures and (2) production of a number of fiber ply/metal foam combinations and measurement of  mechanical and physical properties of these combinations to assess potential improvements in structural performance such as damage tolerance and high fatigue life. \r\n     Existing materials designed to protect against flying debris or provide impact protection in vehicles tend to be heavy and to be appendages on structural systems. The new materials produced here, which consist of a metal foam surrounded by facing plies of resin-infused glass, carbon, or aramid fibers, will be designed to integrate affordability and functionality. Improved properties will lead to new markets with a focus on enhanced passenger protection in aviation, marine, and ground vehicles.\r\n",
