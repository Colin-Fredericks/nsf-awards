 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theme of this research is the development of a molecular and macromolecular basis for generating desired surface structure and function that avoids post-manufacturing processes such as plasma treatment. To this end, the synthesis and utilization of Dual Function Macromonomers (DFMs) will be carried out. DFMs are difunctional low molar mass copolymers having conventional end groups (e.g., alcohol) and containing  (a) semifluorinated sidechains and (b) functional sidechains. It is proposed that semifluorinated \"nanoballoons\" will bring desired functionality to the surface in operations such as solvent casting or melt processing. Thus, the DFM concept leverages the well-known tendency of fluoropolymer groups to surface-concentrate. However, in so doing, copolymer structure causes functionality that would ordinarily be in the bulk to be brought to the surface. The DFM concept will be applied first to polyurethanes. The plan is to prepare (a) surface active DFMs, (b) PUs incorporating DFM soft blocks, and (c) blends using a conventional polyurethane as major component and DFM PU as minor component. The resulting material properties are controlled at the nanostructure and microstructural levels. The DFM PU is employed for controlling surface function while a conventional bulk PU provides independently controlled mechanical properties. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work focuses on a new and potentially economical method for introducing chemical functionality specifically at the surface of polymeric materials. The proposed control of surface chemistry is anticipated to improve adhesion and durability of manufactured items, to facilitate long-term function of biomedical materials, and to bring into existence new materials for destroying dangerous pathogens on contact.\r\n",
