 "awd_abstract_narration": "Qing Huo Liu\r\nDuke University\r\n\r\nThis research aims to develop a novel framework for rapid and accurate processing of\r\ngeophysical subsurface measurements in multilayer media. At present, only 2-D mappings\r\n(i.e., the low-resolution images on the ground surface) are available, greatly limiting the target\r\ndepth information. Due to the excessive computational demand, previous inverse scattering\r\nalgorithms for these sensors have been developed, but only for objects in a homogeneous\r\nbackground medium. This new computational framework is expected to dramatically improve\r\nthe way environmental site characterization is being performed.\r\nThe investigator will develop rapid and accurate computational algorithms for the process-\r\ning of some of the arguably most important measurements in environmental site characteriza-\r\ntion and oil exploration, namely electromagnetic induction (EMI), ground penetrating radar\r\n(GPR), surface seismic, and borehole sonic imaging measurements in 3-D heterogeneous,\r\nmultilayer media. These algorithms, coupled with large-scale computing and visualization\r\nplatforms, form a novel framework for current and future environmental site characterization\r\nwhere 3-D subsurface structures can be directly investigated, and sensor arrays can be adap-\r\ntively optimized. The main contributions of this research are: (1) Rapid inversion methods\r\nbased on accelerated extended Born/Rytov approximations in layered media; (2) High-fidelity\r\nimaging algorithms based on preconditioned contrast source inversion methods in a multi-\r\nlayer background; (3) A 3-D imaging and adaptive optimization framework using these fast\r\ninverse scattering algorithms for multi-sensors. These approaches are expected to yield a\r\nhigh resolution because they account for the important multiple scattering effects that cause\r\nthe resolution degradation in previous linear inversion methods. The development of the al-\r\ngorithms for objects embedded in multilayer media represents significant advances in inverse\r\nscattering and its applications in environmental site characterization and oil exploration.",
