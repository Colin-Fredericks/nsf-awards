 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for a three year program that will: 1) complete\r\ndevelopment of a small-scale, portable solid-state retrodirective wireless\r\npower transmission (WPT) demonstration system; 2) use the solid-state phased\r\narray transmitter and rectenna (rectifier + antenna) developed in task 1 for\r\nground testing to determine the phase control of the transmitter. This\r\nprogram will provide a path for the first US non-laboratory demonstration of\r\nbeamed power in which the transmitted beam will be controlled by a pilot beam\r\nfrom the receiving antenna (a retrodirective system). The program will\r\ndemonstrate key components of an integrated microwave wireless power\r\ntransmission system: a phased array transmitter, rectifying receiving antenna\r\n(rectenna) and the retrodirective control system. The transmitter will\r\noperate at a frequency of 5.8 GHz and will consist of 4 panels, which will\r\nallow beam steering in two dimensions. The array will consist of 640\r\nelements, arranged in 10 subarrays with 64 elements in each subarray.\r\nMicrostrip patch antenna will be used for low cost fabrication, lightweight,\r\nplanar structure, and good performance. The patch antennas will be located on\r\none side of the ground plane and the microwave and electronic circuits will\r\nbe on the other side. The signals are coupled from the circuits to antenna\r\nelements through equal-phase microstrips. The distributing microstrip\r\ncircuits and power dividers are fed by a coaxial line connected to the center\r\nof the subarray. The beam control subsystem will use photonics to distribute\r\nreference phase information. A circular polarized rectenna will be\r\nconstructed. Since the power density level at the rectenna array will be\r\nfairly low for the proposed experiment, techniques using low breakdown\r\nvoltage diodes or multi-antenna rectenna elements per diode will be\r\ninvestigated. The ability of the retrodirective phase control system to\r\nmaintain tight beam steering can be measured by the use of simple receivers\r\nlocated around the rectenna. The measured performance will be compared with\r\ntheoretical predictions for error sources (phase jitter, phase bias,\r\nmechanical misalignment, and amplitude variations) systematically introduced\r\ninto the system. Beam patterns including side lobes and grating lobes will be\r\nmeasured.\r\nThe project will provide a practical demonstration of wireless power\r\ntransmission as an enabling technology for space solar power for both\r\nterrestrial and extraterrestrial application. The program will be coordinated\r\nand managed by the Center for Space Power (CSP) at Texas A&M University\r\n(TAMU) and conducted by a team that includes researchers from the Department\r\nof Electrical Engineering and the Johnson Space Center (JSC). NASA support\r\nfor this program will include laboratory and test facilities at NASA Johnson\r\nSpace Center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
