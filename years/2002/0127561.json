 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology - Biological (71)\r\nThe Mind Project is developing a rich array of interactive, web-based curriculum modules in the cognitive and learning sciences. Each module is designed for students who have no prior knowledge of the cognitive and learning sciences. Given the interdisciplinary nature of the cognitive sciences, many modules are suitable for use in a variety of different subjects, even at the freshman level. This strategy of \"cognitive science across the curriculum\" is providing a way of introducing students to this exciting field early in their academic careers. When linked together in sufficient numbers, the growing number of completed modules can be used to create an entire introductory course to cognitive science.\r\nOne of the central design features of many of the modules is their capacity to introduce students to a particular research methodology and to provide interactive experiences that invite the student to employ that methodology first-hand. Rather than merely reading about what cognitive scientists do, students can actively engage in scientific inquiry, exploring the nature of mind and cognition with newly acquired methodological skills. Because the research expertise is built into the modules, a single instructor is able to teach an introduction to cognitive science with the kind of serious commitment to a variety of research methodologies that is typically found only in team-taught courses. \r\nThe modules are being housed and maintained in The Mind Project Archive, the official repository for the Consortium on Cognitive Science Instruction CCSI). This archive uses a powerful server, allowing instructors to create customizable tables of contents (with the underlying materials) for use in specific courses. This project seeks to make it possible to integrate Mind Project modules and any other resources stored in the Archive.\r\n",
