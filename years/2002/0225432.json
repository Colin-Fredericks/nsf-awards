 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective-Oriented Mobile Heterogeneous Sensor Networks for\r\nCoordinated Control\r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on a comprehensive study of large, mobile ad hoc\r\nreconfigurable networks for coordinated control, using coordinated\r\nautonomous flight as a guiding example problem. State estimation\r\nprovides a link between control and communications which admits\r\nheterogeneous sensors, that is the combining of dissimilar or\r\ndifferent accuracy data using concepts which underpin data\r\nfusion. Management of complexity and preservation of design principles\r\nare keys to the development of workable, tunable, mission-oriented\r\nsystems with many components.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this collaborative research proposal hinges\r\non the drawing together of cognate and disparate elements from\r\ncoordinated control, dynamic state estimation, ad hoc network\r\nmanagement, resource assignment, and fault tolerance. Its aim is to\r\nprovide a formalism in which the methods of sensor networking may be\r\nintegrated as part of a systematic design process focused on achieving\r\na specific control objective. This provides a framework for the\r\ndevelopment of methodologies for embedding a sensor network in a\r\ncontext of control performance.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research is that it ties together tools and\r\ntechniques from distinct areas using concepts of information\r\nquality. The team is multi-disciplinary across a gamut of Systems\r\nEngineering and the problem area impacts a range of fundamental\r\nproblems in the individual areas of specialization. This linkage\r\nacross communications, control, networking and estimation is a\r\nperceived bottleneck of current design techniques.\r\n",
