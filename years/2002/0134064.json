 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER proposal combines a research program on the fundamental\r\nmechanics of web handing systems with  two curriculum development projects.\r\nThe research development plan in web handling is motivated by the needs of\r\ncompanies in many industries, including 3M, Kodak, Procter & Gamble, and SRS\r\nTechnologies, to better understand and more rapidly process thin, flexible\r\nmaterial.  These handling processes produce a wide variety of products such\r\nas carpet, fabric, shrink-wrap, diapers, and paper towel.  Universal issues\r\nthat prevent more efficient operation-such as slip in wound rolls,\r\nwrinkling, creasing, and vibration-will be studied.  The fundamental\r\nquestions answered by this research will allow companies to more rapidly and\r\nefficiently produce their products.  The curriculum development plan has two\r\nmajor thrusts.  The first thrust will be the development of two unique\r\ncourses concerning the mathematical modelling of solids and structures.\r\nThese courses will expose students to modelling issues that occur in the\r\nstudy of web handling systems and throughout engineering.  The second thrust\r\nwill be an extensive overhaul of Penn States required undergraduate\r\nvibrations course.  One section will be combined with the optional\r\nvibrations laboratory class.  Additionally, the studio concept, combining\r\nlecture, laboratory and recitation into one educational experience, will be\r\nintroduced.  Along with traditional lectures, small teams of students will\r\nuse classroom computers to complete activities, allowing them to more\r\nthoroughly learn the subject.\r\n",
