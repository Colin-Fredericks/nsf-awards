 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the core of the next generation of networking applications \r\nand technologies lies the potential of embedding sensing and \r\nactuating capabilities in the network so as to support a \r\nvariety of monitoring and controls applications.  In this \r\nproposal we target applications that require stringent \r\nquality of service guarantees, e.g., applications needing \r\nglobal snapshot(s) of the state of a physical attribute,\r\nor requiring correlating various such attributes.  For example, \r\none might jointly track the wind speed and the density of \r\na given pathogen to create evolution models.  To support such \r\napplications while achieving high sensor utilization we \r\npropose to investigate two complementary problems:\r\n(1) What are fundamental characteristics and requirements of\r\nestimation and control applications\r\ndrawing spatio-temporal data from networked sensors; and\r\n(2) What types of network support, e.g., sensing `primitives' \r\nand resource/traffic management mechanisms will be \r\ncritical to enable wide-spread shared usage of such networks.\r\nDue to the expected heterogeneity of sensor networks\r\nand possible mismatch between a sensor's `capacity' to process\r\nqueries and the network bandwidth delay product,\r\nachieving timely coordinated responses from a potentially large\r\nset of sensors shared by multiple users may be difficult.\r\nThis is exacerbated by the inherent asymmetry of communications \r\nassociated with such sensing activities, i.e., one-to-many queries \r\nresulting in many-to-one sensor responses.  As a result one can \r\nexpect unpredictable bursts of traffic, network hot spots, and \r\ndegradation in performance. As part of the proposed research\r\nwe will investigate these problems from the perspective of\r\nthe applications, the network and the sensors. \r\n",
