 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Materials program in the Division of Chemistry and the Electronic Materials program in the Division of Materials Research make this joint renewal award to Colorado State University.  With this award, Professor Ellen Fisher will study detailed chemical and physical mechanisms of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and plasma etching, and will evaluate surface interactions of radicals produced during plasma processing using spatially resolved laser-induced fluorescence.  The PI will evaluate the interactions between plasma and surfaces during processing of integrated circuits using dual beam imaging; will quantify and characterize the radicals formed during this processing; and will develop detailed chemical mechanisms for plasma etching and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition on different substrates.  Use of dual beam imaging will be enable to identify and quantitate a number of different processes that are taking place during the plasma processing, and will be able to develop a knowledge base to be useful to the plasma processing and modeling community.  The research project will provide excellent opportunity to graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry and material sciences. \r\n \r\nThis project will use dual beam spatially resolved laser-induced fluorescence imaging method to provide quantitative data on radicals produced at surfaces of different substrates during the plasma processing.  Information generated will be useful to plasma processing and modeling community for the development of improved and high performance integrated circuits.   In addition, the research activity in plasma processing will provide new opportunity to graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry and materials sciences.",
