With the presence of such\r\nstructures, the proposal aims to introduce new versions of Gromov-Witten\r\ntheory, Seiberg-Witten-Floer theory, and to apply the resulting\r\ninvariants to String Theory  as well as  Real Algebraic Geometry.\r\nAnother aspect of the project will study related analytical problems\r\non manifolds that possess open conical singularities.\r\n\r\nReal Algebraic Geometry concerns the real solutions of real polynomials\r\nwhich arise naturally in many real-life applications. Despite the\r\nfact that this is one of oldest Mathematical branches, we have so far\r\nmade very little progress in understanding it. Our project will attempt\r\nto fill the gap partially by using new machinery following from the\r\npioneer work of Donaldson, Floer, Taubes etc. It was Einstein's dream\r\nto unify all four fundamental forces in the nature. Through Quantum\r\nMechanics, it is possible to unify the strong force, the weak force and\r\nthe electro-magnetic force. However the unification with the fourth\r\nforce, the gravity, has eluded some of the greatest thinkers of our time.\r\nNowadays it is commonly believed that String Theory offers the best hope\r\nto achieve this last unification. Complex manifolds with real structure\r\nare called orientifolds in String Theory. These are popular but\r\nstill poorly-understood objects for Physicists. A purpose in the project\r\nis to lay down a rigorous mathematical foundation for Gromov-Witten\r\n",
