 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project addresses an integrated research and education plan for a new generation of mechanical engineers in interdisciplinary design in biotechnology and biomedical applications (i.e., BioMEMS) using Microelectromechanical systems technology.   The research objectives of this CAREER project are to experimentally:  (1) evaluate the ability of electrowetting actuation to precisely transport and manipulate nano-liter to femto-liter discrete droplets in a discrete moving manner in BioMEMS devices; (2) determine how the design parameters and fabrication variables affect the performance of electrowetting-actuated discrete droplets in BioMEMS devices; and (3) determine an interdisciplinary design methodology for BioMEMS applications.  Integrating the proposed research with education, the PI will incorporate MEMS education with existing curriculum in mechanical engineering, develop a new MEMS design course in mechanical engineering, organize a MEMS seminar at Iowa State University, advise graduate and undergraduate students through the proposed research, and work with a high school student and teacher on the proposed research during summers. \r\n\r\nThe research studies of the fundamental issues associated with the electrowetting actuation will enable us to precisely, quantitatively and flexibly control the movement of nano-liter to femto-liter discrete droplets, transport it to any designed destination, and manipulate it to any designed size.  The most significance of this project will enable us to further reduce sample consumption to the range of nano-liter to femto-liter volume, improve the overall performance, and achieve the current unachievable functionality of BioMEMS devices.  This project will impact the current MEMS design methodology and promote the commercialization of MEMS applications.  The educational activities of this project will take place at several levels (K-12 students and teachers, and undergraduate and graduate students majoring and non-majoring in mechanical engineering).  Through this CAREER project, the PI will facilitate these audiences to succeed in the technology-based world of tomorrow.  \r\n\r\n",
