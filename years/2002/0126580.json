 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nWe are using temperature-programmable, computer-controlled gas chromatographs (GCs) equipped with TCD detectors to refine, adapt and incorporate a comprehensive set of experiments in the general and organic chemistry sequences. The enhanced throughput of the computer-controlled GCs provides access to the acquired data and powerful data analysis software anywhere on the campus intranet. The experiments extend our innovative inquiry-driven model for General Chemistry and Chemical Equilibrium to Organic Chemistry. Students are first introduced to GC instrumentation in General Chemistry through an analysis of fats and oils as part of our current topical module on fats and nutrition. In the Organic sequence, several key experiments are run in an investigative, \"what if\" fashion by individual students. For example, detailed examination of the conditions and mechanistic details of the hydroboration reaction by observing the effect of different solvents, alkenes, and hydroboration reagents are investigated by students. In another experiment, students compare E1 vs. E2 elimination of 2-bromobutane to give cis- and trans-2-butene. Since the isomers can be resolved by the GC system, the relative yields lead to insights about the mechanism. Finally, the GCs are also being used in an inter-disciplinary course on perfumes and in community outreach activities in a Howard Hughes-funded program for \"Girls and Women in Science,\" where sixth grade girls and their teachers perform \"hands-on\" GC analyses of gasoline and other common materials. We are carrying a comprehensive assessment of the project by an on-site specialist in chemical education. We will disseminate the results of the project nationally through the web sites and links to the NSF-funded ChemLinks Coalition, as well as through articles in The Journal of Chemical Education once they become available.\r\n",
