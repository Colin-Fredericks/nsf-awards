 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues study problems in the overlap\r\nof algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. A major goal\r\nis to understand the structure of minimal free resolutions\r\nof homogeneous ideals, particularly those defining \r\nzero dimensional schemes. Ideals of interest range from ideals \r\nof fat points (motivated by their intimate connections to questions \r\nabout linear systems on projective varieties),\r\nto ideals of generic forms (work on which is closely connected to\r\nwork on the Weak and Strong Lefschetz properties \r\nfor Artinian algebras, and, via Matlis duality, to work on \r\nfat points), to ideals whose quotients are Gorenstein rings (and \r\nhence involve problems on arithmetically Gorenstein subschemes \r\nof projective space, and Gorenstein liaison). This broad range of \r\nmethods and motivations is a significant hurdle that young and \r\nfuture researchers must overcome to do productive work\r\nin this area. This grant aims to advance the training and career \r\ndevelopment of young investigators and graduate students by providing\r\ntravel support to attend and interact with leaders in the field at \r\nan international conference addressing the research cited above.\r\n\r\nComputational issues underlie much of this research, and machine \r\ncomputation is both an important tool in the research described \r\nabove and the object of some of this research. However, work in this \r\narea can easily outrun the capability of any conceivable computer, so \r\ntheoretical studies are essential not only for understanding the results \r\nof machine computations, but to achieve results beyond the reach of brute \r\nforce computation. This is, for example, a significant issue for applications \r\nof the research described here to interpolation. Large data sets are a\r\ncommon feature of modern life, whether in science, technology or business.\r\nSuch data sets often involve functional relationships among various\r\nvariables. Among the most tractable functions are the polynomials.\r\nIf one wants to model relationships with polynomials it is helpful to know \r\ntheoretically how complicated the worst case such polynomial might be\r\n(as measured, say, by degree), whereas it might be expensive or impossible to\r\ndetermine this directly. Such theoretical results about polynomials\r\nare what researchers aim for in studying minimal free resolutions\r\nof homogeneous ideals. \r\n\r\n",
