 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Judith K. Gwathmey has given exceedingly personal attention to her mentees from the time she identifies them. She is said to frequently identify a \"diamond in the rough,\" who she supports through their formal education and into their careers. Gwathmey currently heads the Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases and Muscle Research Institute, and holds a faculty position at Boston University School of Medicine, as well as adjunct or lecturer positions with Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine. Along with her active research, teaching, and consulting activities, she is an active mentor, described as personally generous with time and financial resources to support her mentees. Gwathmey has provided students with financial support for tuition and books from her personal income.\r\n\r\nHer direct, \"hands-on\" mentoring style provides students with research opportunities, guidance on presenting research outcomes, and lessons in how to compete successfully in academic science. Those she has mentored include high-school students through doctoral students and faculty; fifty-six persons mentored. She has demonstrated a keen interest in students from underrepresented groups, and has employed a diverse, multi-national staff in her laboratory. Although her efforts are not aligned with the programs of a traditional education institution, she has had broad success with many individuals who are likely to replicate her mentoring in their own careers.\r\n",
