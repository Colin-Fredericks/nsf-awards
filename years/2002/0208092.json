 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sauer\r\n0208092\r\n     The investigator studies computational aspects of nonlinear\r\ndynamical systems, emphasizing the role of chaotic dynamics in\r\nthe interpretation of long-time simulation outcomes and data from\r\ncomplicated dynamical processes.  The work on simulation is an\r\nongoing study of subtle biases occurring in deterministic\r\nmodeling that have macroscopic effects on outcomes.  It is an\r\nopen question whether it is possible in principle for long-term\r\ncomputer simulations of typical nonhyperbolic chaotic systems to\r\napproximately match true system behavior.  The second major area\r\nis ongoing work on the interpretation of physical and biological\r\nexperiments that generate aperiodic data.  There is a long history\r\nof applying random modeling to time series and spike timing data\r\ncollected from laaboratory and natural processes.  The\r\ninvestigator syudies ways to use dynamical systems techniques,\r\nincluding embedding theory and spike train reconstruction, to\r\nextend the power of deterministic modeling for experimental data.\r\n     Computer simulation is a critical ingredient of modern\r\nscience.  It is important to know whether solutions of a\r\nmathematical model used for simulation can be expected to be\r\naccurate qualitative and quantitative representations of the\r\nnatural phenomena being modeled, in the face of small modeling\r\nerrors, and whether computer solution of the model can represent\r\nsolutions of the model, in the face of small floating point\r\nerrors.  This reseach builds a foundation for answering questions\r\nlike this for physically relevant models.  In particular the\r\ninvestigator is involved in isolating and quantifying the\r\nlimitations of deterministic representations, especially for the\r\npurpose of long-term modeling.  The second major focus of the\r\nproject is the interpretation of data collected from experimental\r\nsystems and nature when no first-principles mathematical or\r\ncomputer model is available.  If time traces of physically\r\nrelevant quantities can be measured from the process, techniques\r\nexist to attempt to reconstruct the dynamical behavior of the\r\nprocess, with potential to predict or control the process.\r\nComplex deterministic time series are being identified in\r\nphysical, chemical, engineering and biological/medical settings.\r\nThe investigator has made previous progress on expanding these\r\nconceptual foundations and developing related computational\r\nimplementations, and is working to increase their power for the\r\nstudy of complex systems in scientific and engineering-related\r\ncontexts.\r\n",
