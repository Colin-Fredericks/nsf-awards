 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Nancy E. Rawson at the Monell Chemical Senses Center to purchase a confocal microscope with associated hardware and software.  The Monell Center is a nonprofit research institute focused on acquiring a fuller understanding of the chemical senses.   Recent studies have revealed that cell-cell interactions play an important role in modulating the output of a variety of sensory receptor cells.  The confocal microscope permits us to directly observe intracellular processes and interactions between different cell types in preparations that more closely reflect those of the intact organism.  In addition, chemosensory cells undergo regeneration throughout the life of the animal.  In order to better understand this capability, studies of growing cells are carried out using methods to identify the different stages in the cells' lifespan and evaluate the effect of drugs or other treatments on the growth process.  \r\nThe confocal microscope will be used in projects aimed at addressing a variety of questions ranging from understanding how individual receptor cells detect and respond to chemical stimuli; how experience influences the ways that organisms respond to chemosensory stimuli;  how odor qualities are encoded in neural activity patterns in the brain; how stem cells divide and differentiate into mature sensory receptor cells; and how these sensory systems recover from damage.  These projects utilize standard histology, lectin and immuno-histochemistry, in situ hybridization of fixed tissue specimens, and biophysical methods to study live tissue.  These techniques provide a variety of kinds of data, ranging from protein and mRNA localization in peripheral and central components of the taste, olfactory and trigeminal systems to dynamic extra- and intracellular signalling in tissue slices, cultures and cell ensembles.  The system will also be included as one educational component in our Minority Student Research Apprenticeship Training Program, which has provided summer research experiences for over 300 high school and college undergraduates since its inception.\r\nThe ability to examine cells in ensembles, such as whole taste buds, or thick tissue sections will dramatically improve our ability to understand how the sensory systems of taste, smell and chemical irritation function in the intact organism.  The confocal microscope will also enhance our ability to provide state-of-the-art training experiences for students participating in our high school, college, graduate and post-doctoral training programs. \r\n",
