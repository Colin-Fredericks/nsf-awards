 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\tSturgeons, paddlefishes and their fossil relatives form a small\r\ngroup of fishes from the Northern hemisphere called Acipenseriformes that\r\nis believed to have split off from other ray-finned fishes (the\r\nactinopterygians) some 150 million years ago. The morphology of living\r\nsturgeons (25 species) has remained largely unchanged since they first\r\nevolved. Although there have been many studies of sturgeon morphology,\r\nthere never has been a study that is detailed or comprehensive enough to\r\nallow modern studies of their evolution. The new study of the skeleton of\r\nfossil and living sturgeons by Hilton, Grande and Bemis has two main goals.\r\nThe first objective is to describe in detail the skeleton of the shortnose\r\nsturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), a small species of sturgeon found in\r\ncoastal rivers of eastern North America. This study will be based on\r\nseveral types of specimens, including dry skeletons, hand cleaned skeletons\r\nthat are stored in alcohol, and cleared and stained skeletons (in which the\r\nsoft tissue is made clear, cartilage is stained blue and bone is stained\r\nred). Specimens representing all life history stages will be studied, from\r\nthe earliest embryos to the oldest specimens available. Such an approach\r\nallows observations of changes of morphology due to growth and development\r\nof the skeleton. The results of this study will be published in a large\r\nformat monograph, illustrated with photographs for documentation and line\r\ndrawings for interpretation, accompanied by clear text descriptions. The\r\nintention is that this monograph will serve as a lasting contribution to\r\nthe knowledge of the anatomy of sturgeons and a standard reference for\r\nanatomical studies of primitive ray-finned fishes.\r\n\tThe second part of this study concerns tracing evolutionary\r\nrelationships among living and fossil sturgeons. Most fossils that are\r\nidentified as sturgeons are very fragmentary, and only after a detailed\r\nstudy of the living members of a group can such specimens be properly\r\ninterpreted. Additionally, new comparative data generated during the first\r\npart of the study will be used to formulate new hypotheses of\r\nrelationships. All previous morphological studies of the relationships of\r\nsturgeons are inadequate for various reasons. For instance, many studies\r\nhave looked only at relationships of sturgeons from a particular geographic\r\nregion or country. Evolution has not occurred within political boundaries,\r\nand Hilton, Grande and Bemis' study will be the first to incorporate\r\nmorphological data for all sturgeons on a worldwide scale. All species of\r\nsturgeons are afforded some form of protection, with many listed as\r\nendangered. The precarious conservation status of many sturgeons make\r\nstudies of their evolutionary history even more critical.\r\n",
