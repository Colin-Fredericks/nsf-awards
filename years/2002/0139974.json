 "awd_abstract_narration": "0139974\r\nGriffiths\r\n Much of modern technology, including computers, lasers, and magnetic\r\nresonance imaging, utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics, the\r\nphysicist's most fundamental theory of nature, and would not be possible if\r\nthis theory had never been invented.  Given this success, one might suppose\r\nthat quantum mechanics would by now be as well understood as other foundation\r\nstones of modern science, such as thermodynamics and relativity theory.  On the\r\ncontrary, as Richard Feynman, one of the great physicists of the 20th century,\r\nonce put it, \"Nobody understands quantum mechanics.\"  The lack of a clear\r\nunderstanding, to which Feynman was referring, has not, obviously, prevented\r\nquantum mechanics from being applied to a vast range of technological devices.\r\nBut students are frustrated when they try and learn the subject from teachers\r\nand textbooks whose lack of clarity illustrates the truth of Feynman's remark.\r\nClearing up the conceptual mess in its foundations would certainly not detract\r\nfrom, and might even assist in, the technological applications of quantum\r\nmechanics, and could well prove important for future developments in areas such\r\nas quantum computation and quantum cryptography, where impressive advances are\r\naccompanied by equally spectacular gaps in our current understanding.\r\n\r\n        This research project, as indicated in the title, has a double focus.\r\nOne is the use of quantum histories - a promising approach developed by various\r\npeople including Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel laureate who at one time was\r\nFeynman's colleague at Cal Tech - for addressing and clearing up the conceptual\r\ndifficulties in the foundations of quantum theory.  Several major paradoxes,\r\nincluding the famous double slit, have been resolved using the histories\r\napproach, and this method gets rid of mysterious long-range influences that are\r\npresent in some older interpretations of quantum mechanics, and which are hard\r\nto reconcile with relativity theory.  However, up till now these new\r\ndevelopments have been confined to the technical literature, and they need to\r\nbe moved into classrooms and textbooks if they are to make the subject more\r\naccessible to the next generation of scientists.  There is plenty of work to be\r\ndone, both in making abstract mathematical formulations more understandable\r\nthrough simple physical examples, and in convincing teachers and textbook\r\nwriters that students deserve something better than the traditional\r\n(\"Copenhagen\") approach, the one Feynman could not understand.\r\n\r\n        The second focus of this research is quantum information theory, the\r\nfundamental science behind both quantum computing and quantum cryptography.\r\nClassical information theory was developed half a century ago by Claude\r\nShannon, and plays an important role in the modern theory of communication, as\r\nin the efficient use of weak radio signals to transmit information from distant\r\nspace probes to the earth.  Quantum information theory generalizes Shannon's\r\nideas to situations where quantum effects are important, and while it has had\r\nsome notable successes, it has also run into the following difficulty:\r\nShannon's formulation is based on the use of probabilities, but incorporating\r\nprobabilities into quantum mechanics in a consistent way is the source of many\r\nof the conceptual difficulties that troubled Feynman.  The histories approach\r\nresolves the problem of quantum probabilities in a consistent manner that\r\nallows an immediate extension of many of Shannon's ideas into the quantum\r\ndomain.  Whether this provides a satisfactory foundation for quantum\r\ninformation theory remains to be seen, but it looks promising.  If it succeeds,\r\nthere will be a double benefit: a clearer understanding of what quantum\r\ncomputing and cryptography can and cannot do, and a new way to think about\r\nquantum mechanical processes in terms of the generation and transmission of\r\ninformation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
