Smith, MIT\r\n\r\nPartial travel support for the speakers at the U.S. - Germany Joint Meeting on Nanoscale Science and Engineering to be held at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on December 5 and 6, 2001.  The objectives are to evaluate new trends in research and education and exchange information among leading research centers in both countries, to promote the exchange of researchers and establishment of joint projects, to introduce younger investigators to nanotechnology, and create opportunities for long-term collaboration.  The main list of topics includes self-organization, molecular electronics, nanotubes and applications, nanoparticles, nanomechanics, catalysts, polymers and pharmaceutics.  Representatives of the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (NSEC) from U.S. and Centers of Excellence in Nanotechnology from Germany, as well as leading experts and young reserachers from both countries will participate.  The meeting is co-organized by MIT (U.S.) and the University of Munster (Germany).  About 60 participants, half from U. S. and half from Germany will have the opportunity to participate in presentations and discussions during the two-day meeting.  A website will be created to post the program and contributed papers.  Visits at the MIT and Harvard nanotechnology laboratories will be organized.",
