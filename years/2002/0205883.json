 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Educational Develpoment Center (EDC) and National Institute on Out-of-School Time (NIOST), in collaboration with science centers in AZ, MA, TX, NY, NC and CA, will develop and implement a science curriculum for informal audiences targeting children ages 8-12.  Each science center will work with six community centers that serve youth in after-school programs.  Science center staff will train after-school program leaders from the 36 community centers at monthly sessions, in addition to holding monthly events for families.  Curriculum development will use interesting topics aligned with national standards and structure investigations as games using simple materials.  The units will enable children to work in teams, and include follow-up, discussion and extended investigations using websites.  It is anticipated that each child will complete 4-6 related investigations.  While the six science centers will provide the content expertise, EDC and NIOST will develop the training and assessment program and provide additional technical support for the community centers.  The result will be a model to support out-of-school programs that combines science centers and community resource people, centered around an activity-based curriculum focused on inquiry. Up to 1,000 children will be involved in field tests each summer.  This proposal builds on \"Design It!\"  (ESI 98-14765), which created an informal science curriculum focused on engineering principles.",
