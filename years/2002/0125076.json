 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Chemical (53)\r\nSoftware simulations enable students to actively explore and understand scientific and engineering concepts through visualization and an iterative approach to problem solving. Our project will add major capabilities to our existing software simulation prototype, The Reactor Lab. Existing modules are simulations of chemical reactors, but the software framework is discipline-independent. Our first objective was to add a \"lab construction kit\" that has enabled students and faculty to build new simulations. The software will be integrated with the Internet to allow distribution of modules for use on- and off-line, to allow sharing of new modules, and to support communication and collaboration between students and faculty. \r\n\r\nThe new modules that have been added will complete those needed for a first course in chemical reaction engineering. The final objective of our work was to establish and evaluate a prototype community of lab builders and users. This community will expose faculty and students to the collaborative working environments that are an increasingly important result of the Internet. The initial impact of this project was to enhance the education of chemical engineers and chemists about reactor analysis and design. Additionally our work should impact the design of efficient and safe chemical reactors, which is important in fields as diverse as pharmaceutical production and semiconductor fabrication. Dissemination is being done via annual meetings of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society for Engineering Education. Our software has also been listed with the National Engineering Educational Software Database. Articles will be prepared for publication in Chemical Engineering Education. Web based data will be collected to evaluate the number of hits.\r\n",
