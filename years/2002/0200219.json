The results\r\nobtained recently with Hugo Woerdeman on this problem will be\r\nused to investigate the properties of stable two variable\r\npolynomials. A two variable polynomial is said to be stable\r\nif it is non vanishing inside and on the bicircle.  Results\r\nobtained from these investigations will then be applied to the\r\nconstruction of two variable wavelets, two variable filter\r\ndesign, and image processing.\r\n\r\nAn important problem with many applications that was solved\r\nearly inthe twentieth century was the problem of factorizing\r\npositive trigonometric polynomials. A trigonometric polynomial\r\nof degree n in x is a polynomial that can be written as linear\r\ncombination of sines and cosines of integer multiples of the\r\nfrequency x. It was shown by Fejer and Riesz that such a\r\npolynomial can be written as the magnitude squared of another\r\npolynomial. This result has had many useful applications in\r\nthe area of filter design for electrical circuits, prediction\r\ntheory, and more recently in wavelets.  \r\n",
