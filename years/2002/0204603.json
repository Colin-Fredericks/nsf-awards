 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0204603\r\nYakov Eliashberg\r\n\r\n\r\n  The proposal is devoted to    Symplectic Field Theory  (SFT) whose\r\n  framework was recently described by A. Givental, H. Hofer and the \r\n  author of this proposal. SFT is a large project which lies  on the \r\n  borderline between Symplectic Geometry, Hamiltonian Dynamics, \r\n  Enumerative Algebraic Geometry, Low-dimensional Topology, Theory of \r\n  Integrable Systems in Mathematics, as well as String Theory and \r\n  Mirror Symmetry in Theoretical Physics. Among the goals of the theory:\r\n  - definition of new, SFT-based invariants of symplectic and contact \r\n    manifolds and their Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds;\r\n  - applications  to the  Low-dimensional topology;\r\n  - development of  new tools for proving enumerative  results about \r\n    periodic orbits of   Hamiltonian systems;\r\n  - understanding of the appearance  of integrable hierarchies in \r\n    Gromov-Witten theory.\r\n \r\n  Symplectic Field Theory has already proved to have  important                  \r\n  applications. In particular, the ideas of the SFT were\r\n  instrumental in the solution of several old outstanding questions\r\n  in Symplectic Geometry and Hamiltonian Dynamics. There is a hope \r\n  that some current research in the SFT may bring some breakthrough \r\n  in the low-dimensional topology. Further development of the theory \r\n  should also bring new applications not only inside Mathematics, but  \r\n  possibly in some areas of Theoretical Physics, including String \r\n  Theory and Mirror Symmetry. Besides developing new applications the \r\n  work under this project will also concentrate on building the \r\n  rigorous foundations of the SFT.\r\n  \r\n",
