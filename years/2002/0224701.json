 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern innovations in computer based monitoring, protection and control of electric power supply systems, coupled with the availability of wide-band high speed communication channels have made it possible to bring about the development of very highly secure electric supply networks.  The ability to bring about such a supply network requires a multi-disciplinary team of students and faculty members who are established researchers in the fields of electric power engineering, communication systems, and new sensor developments.  The present proposal is offered by such a team consisting of Virginia Tech and Arizona State University personnel, along with a plan of work which will make significant progress in achieving these goals.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the research team recognizes the importance of the electric supply system to the social and economic well-being of modern societies.  These issues are also addressed in the proposal.  An important part of the proposal is the development of a metric to measure the societal and economic dependence on electricity supply, as well as the cost of insecurity of the supply system to the society.  The research team is convinced that disseminating the results of their research to students - and particularly to minority and under-represented groups - is a very important societal responsibility.  To this end, the research plan contains a significant effort towards creating educational modules which can be broadcast on the internet, and with a special emphasis on reaching the minority and under-represented communities.\r\n",
