Cole and Bryan Pellom, University of Colorado, and Dr. Nestor B. Yoma at the University of Chile, in Santiago, Chile.  Co-support is provided by the Digital Government Program and the NSF-CNPq Collaborative Research Opportunities Program.\r\n\r\nThe goal of their project is to provide a foundation for collaborative research and development of advanced dialogue systems in the U.S. and Chile, resulting in the deployment of working systems as test beds for research.  Advanced dialogue systems are human computer interfaces that support natural, unconstrained conversational interaction in specific task domains.  Researchers from both sides will collaborate on topics such as dialogue engineering, large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems and text-to-speech engines.  The main idea is to set up the Colorado University Communicator system as test bed at LPTV for advanced joint research.  This will be the basis for  research that will enable people in the Americas to access online information over telephone networks, and will thus provide real data from real users to evaluate system components.  Advanced dialogue systems will be developed and deployed in Santiago enabling access to useful information via telephones and cellular phones.\r\n",
