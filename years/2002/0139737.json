 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator applies tools from group representation\r\ntheory to study deformations of representations of profinite\r\ngroups and of complexes of modules for such groups. The\r\ninvestigator's main theme is to examine problems and\r\napplications related to generalizations of the deformation\r\ntheory of group representations developed by B. Mazur. The\r\ngeneralizations are extensions of this theory to (1)\r\ndeformations of objects in derived categories, and (2)\r\ndeformations of representations whose images lie in various\r\nlinear algebraic groups, such as orthogonal groups. The\r\ninvestigator studies applications of these theories to certain\r\nembedding problems. The second theme is to determine for finite\r\ngroups the ring structure of the universal deformation ring of\r\nan irreducible modular representation, using only the local\r\nstructure of the finite group. The investigator also works on\r\none other project which concerns moduli spaces of representations\r\nof finite dimensional algebras. The goal is to use the rich\r\nalgebro-geometric structure of moduli spaces to obtain a better\r\nunderstanding of the geometric behavior of algebra automorphisms.\r\n\r\nGroups are abstract mathematical objects by which one may encode\r\nand study symmetry, for example in chemical molecules, crystals, networks,\r\nor abstract mathematical structures. Representations of groups provide\r\na way to extract information about the internal structures of a group.\r\nRoughly speaking, representations can be thought of as \"linearized\r\nsnapshots\" of the group which are given by explicitly described\r\nmatrices. In this project, the investigator studies deformations of\r\nrepresentations. The deformations of a given representation form a\r\nfamily of representations which are associated to this representation\r\nin a certain way. In case there is a single deformation which can be\r\nused to describe all deformations, one talks about a universal\r\ndeformation. Universal deformations provide universal constructions which\r\ncan be used to solve certain problems all at once, which otherwise would\r\nhave to be solved in a case-by-case fashion. It is the goal of this\r\nproject to study certain generalizations of deformations of\r\nrepresentations which in turn should lead to more powerful applications\r\nin different areas.",
