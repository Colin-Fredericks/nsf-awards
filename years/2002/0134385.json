Crone, Assistant Professor\r\nEngineering Mechanics Program, Department of Engineering Physics\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin - Madison\r\n\r\nShape memory alloys (SMA) constitute a unique class of materials that have\r\nalready proven to have wide-ranging applications in the biomedical,\r\naerospace, microelectronics, and automotive industries. These materials\r\nhave a crystallographic structure that can change reversibly and\r\nreproducibly, allowing the material to display dramatic stress-induced and\r\ntemperature-induced recoverable deformations.  One key hurdle to their use\r\nis the development of reliable SMA materials and structures, in which the\r\nmaterial's microstructure is well understood and its resistance to fatigue\r\nand fracture can be reliably predicted.  Critical topics to be investigated\r\nin this research involve:  determining the effect of process-induced\r\nmicrostructure on fracture and fatigue behavior; exploring the effect of\r\ngrain refinement on the fracture behavior for grain sizes ranging between\r\nthe micron and nanometer scale; and developing experimentally-based models\r\nthat delineate the mechanisms influencing fracture and fatigue in NiTi and\r\nCu-based SMAs.  In conjunction with this research, education initiatives\r\nwill be undertaken to develop widespread training at the undergraduate and\r\ngraduate levels in superelastic behavior and shape memory materials, via\r\nnew course material in the areas of nanomaterials, micromechanics and\r\nfracture mechanics. Not only will the expanded course material provide\r\nstudents with an introduction to topics where mechanics has been developing\r\ninfluence and making critical contributions to new technologies, it will\r\nalso have international impact via Smart Materials Exemplar of the\r\nWorldwide Universities Network, an international network of\r\nresearchers/educators. \r\n\r\n",
