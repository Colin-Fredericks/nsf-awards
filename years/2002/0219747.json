 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research project aims to explore several unanswered questions in the area of differentiated services for next generation  Internet. In particular, the issue of routing SLAs in the presence of multiple alternative physical paths is a topic that has been seldom researched\r\nupon. It is an important issue since the objective is to maximize the probability of success for an SLA without opting for over-provisioning. Also, in the presence of multiple physical paths, which is typical in large networks, there is a need to choose the optimal path based on appropriate criteria. The proposed research directly addresses this critical issue. Currently, there are no standard schemes for hierarchical QoS routing. One of the most crucial problems in hierarchical QoS routing is to make intelligent decisions in the presence of out-of-date or stale network stateinformation. The proposed research will address this issue by making use of local statistics collected at each router and obtaining a time history of the network state information. Furthermore, every domain will have a finite traffic handling capacity. This capacity is bound above by the domain topology and the maximum link bandwidth. For computing feasible paths, current QoS routing schemes take only the individual link bandwidth into account as a constraint but not the domain capacity as a whole. The research will address this shortcoming by incorporating the domain capacity as a constraint in the path computation algorithms. Additionally, this research project will also study the problem of splitting aggregated flows in a transit domain with the goal of maximizing the domain resource utilization. The motivation comes from the fact that splitting of aggregated flows will lead to better utilization of the network bandwidth.\r\n\r\n",
