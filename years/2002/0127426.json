 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty members attempting to create materials for collections of engineering education\r\ncontent in a digital library face several challenges. Lack of training in sound pedagogical\r\npractices, a shortage of training in the effective use of educational technology, short\r\nsupply of required resources and time to produce completed and tested works, and a lack\r\nof emphasis on improved teaching in the university faculty rewards systems are the major\r\nobstacles to materials development. To remedy this situation, this project endeavors to\r\ncreate an active, engaged, and sustained virtual community of engineering educators who\r\nenergetically contribute to and share materials from a common collection of courseware.\r\nThe virtual community is taking form as an incubator in which faculty are trained in\r\nsound pedagogical practices e.g., developing learning goals and assessment techniques.\r\nNext, participants are schooled in the effective use of technology in many different\r\nteaching/learning situations including: classroom presentation, self-study, distance and\r\ndistributed learning, experiential learning, etc. Once trained, faculty then develop a\r\nportion of a collection of courseware modules in their area of expertise. Guidelines are \r\nprovided so that modules can be integrated with each other from both the standpoint\r\nof technology mix as well as the pedagogical approach being used. Members of the virtual\r\ncommunity of contributors subsequently become the testers of the courseware modules,\r\nwith each of the contributors using a subset of modules to conduct courses at their\r\nhome campuses. As soon as a baseline collection in a topic area is established the project \r\npersonnel will present national workshops on how to adopt and adapt the materials in the collection.\r\nNEEDS will be used to catalog and make the collections available.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Virtual community, NEEDS, digital library",
