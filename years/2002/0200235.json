The first project considers\r\nthe correction due to the self-generated \r\nmagnetic field in the Thomas-Fermi theory of large atoms. \r\nThe optimal magnetic field obtained from a variational\r\nprinciple is spatially inhomogeneous. The second project aims at\r\nderiving nonlinear self-consistent evolution equations \r\nfrom the quantum dynamics of many particles\r\ninteracting via weakly coupled Coulomb force. The quantum statistics of the\r\nparticles determine the scaling and the limiting\r\nclassical equation (Hartree or Vlasov). The last project\r\nstudies the long time dynamics of noninteracting\r\nelectrons in a random environment in the diffusive regime.\r\nOn the  shorter kinetic time scale the Boltzmann\r\nequation has been established earlier.\r\nThe goal is to determine the quantum corrections to the\r\nclassical diffusivity obtained from the Boltzmann equation\r\nand verify some predictions of the celebrated scaling theory\r\nof conductance.\r\n\r\nThe physics of charged particles governs all electric phenomena.\r\nFrom theoretical point of view, these particles can be accurately described \r\nusing  many-body quantum mechanics.  In practice, however, \r\nthe fundamental equation of quantum\r\nphysics, the Schr\\\"odinger equation, is too complicated. Typical electronic\r\ndevices contain a huge number of electrons and it is impossible to\r\ndescribe their precise microscopic behavior \r\neven with the current computer technology.\r\nThe Schr\\\"odinger equation is usually replaced with\r\nmuch simpler equations that are computationally more feasible.\r\nThese equations do not contain all information about the complex\r\nelectronic system, but they may describe certain quantities\r\nof interest with a sufficient precision. The proposal\r\nstudies three  complex quantum systems: \r\n(i) a large atom in a self-generated magnetic field; \r\n(ii) many charged particles with a weak interaction;\r\n(iii) a single electron in an impure medium.\r\nThe goal is to find the correct  approximating equations\r\nand to justify rigorously that \r\nthey are consistent with the Schr\\\"odinger theory in certain limits.\r\nHeuristically, some of these equations can  be guessed based upon\r\nclassical mechanics. Quantum mechanics, however, may modify\r\nthe classical picture. The proposed work identifies the quantum \r\ncorrection effects in the classical description of these three basic models.\r\n\r\n",
