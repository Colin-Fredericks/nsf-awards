 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2002.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. \r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Bacterial-fungal interactions: novel signals and response mechanisms that influence development of bacterial communities in the presence of fungi.\"  In the natural environment, many microorganisms construct complex communities known as biofilms.  This research focuses on signaling interactions between bacteria and fungi in the context of biofilms through characterization of multiple bacterial-fungal pairs.  Genetic techniques and microarray analyses are being used to identify genes involved in dual-species interactions, in order to define signaling mechanisms important to bacterial-fungal communities.\r\n\r\n",
