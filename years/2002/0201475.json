 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will study the use of fiber optic sensors for health monitoring, for continuous data collection, and for sensor-based operational control of the elevator movements to ensure safety and improved performance during earthquakes and during abnormal events such as a terrorist-induced emergencies. Both analytical and experimental studies will be conducted. Several Fabry-Perot Interferometric sensors, especially developed for this task, will be installed on the guide rail system of the counterweight and the car. The dynamic sensor information will be used to make a decision about the operation of the elevators. The fiber optic sensors for temperature measurements will also be developed to aid the rescue operations in case of fire-induced emergencies. All sensors will be multiplexed.  New technology for effective multiplexing of a large number of optical sensors will be developed.  Experimental setup will be used to verify the effectiveness of the sensor and data acquisition and processing systems.  The completed system will be able to collect technical data of much use during future earthquake occurrences.  A sensor-based robust control scheme will be developed for operational control of the elevators.  The control scheme will be based on the dynamic characteristics of the elevator-building systems and would include the uncertainties associated with the ground motion, uncertainties in the system parameters, and reliability of the sensor system",
