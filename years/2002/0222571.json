 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal builds on early work in developing and deploying an on-line credential service, MyProxy.  MyProxy was created in 2000 to solve the problem of credential delegation and was specifically targeted to support web portal requirements. Grid entities, must be able to dynamically manage and select the most appropriate security credentials in order to support or complete the application or work.  \r\n\r\nThe project has a three-phased approach to create the persistent credential management support needed for production middleware.  In the first phase, MyProxy will be redesigned to become more robust.  In the second phase, additional functional will be created, tested and deployed to support multiple authentication mechanisms.  In the third phase, the middleware will be expanded to include Web Services and Open Grid Services Architecture.  Overall, the project expands Grid computing will contribute to the national and international Grid infrastructure by making Grid computing more secure and easier to use. \r\n\r\n",
