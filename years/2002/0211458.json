 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator aims to complete the nascent theory of\r\noutput-sensitive algorithms in real algebraic geometry.\r\nOutput-sensitive in this context means that the complexity of the\r\nunderlying algorithm depends mainly on intrinsic geometric\r\nparameters, e.g., the number of connected components of the\r\nunderlying solution set, as opposed to extrinsic parameters like\r\nthe degrees of the input polynomials.  Such algorithms are faster\r\nthan the traditional methods of computational algebra by a factor\r\nexponential in the dimension, but have so far been discovered\r\nonly in various isolated contexts.  So a unified algorithmic\r\napproach has a broad impact.  Furthermore, the underlying\r\napproach takes numerical conditioning into account from the\r\noutset, thus providing algorithms that are certifiably precise\r\neven when applied to approximate data.  Another novelty is that\r\nthe underlying theory applies in the even broader arena of real\r\nand p-adic analytic functions.  The algorithmic aspects of p-adic\r\nanalytic functions are almost completely unexplored, so a\r\nsecondary focus of this project is to elaborate and apply this\r\nnew theory to equation-solving over finite fields and motivic\r\nintegration.\r\n     The investigator combines advanced techniques from numerical\r\nanalysis and algebraic geometry to provide a new approach to a\r\nfundamental problem occuring in many applications: solving\r\nanalytic inequalities.  For example, finding the optimal\r\nallocation of resources in a large organization (e.g., an army,\r\nan airline, or a large business) has long been known to reduce to\r\nsolving linear inequalities.  From a different direction, it is\r\nknown that the complexity of certain neural net architectures\r\n(which are useful in training automated bomb-sniffers and pattern\r\nrecognition systems) depends critically on understanding the\r\nsolutions of nonlinear polynomial inequalities.  Both these\r\nexamples are special cases of analytic inequalities, and this\r\nproject provides new algorithms for their solution that are\r\nmagnitudes faster than current algorithms.  Furthermore, these\r\nnew algorithms provide certifiably precise solutions --- a\r\nfeature which is especially important when facing uncertain\r\nphysical data.  Another novel aspect is the principal\r\ninvestigator's recent discovery that the underlying techniques\r\napply to an even broader context, which can provide new solutions\r\nto many problems in the design of cryptosystems.",
