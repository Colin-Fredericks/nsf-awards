 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology - Biological (71)\r\nStudents in psychology and physics need inquiry-based experiences to prepare them for the \r\nincreasing use of technology in graduate research and clinical work. Students at Northwest \r\nNazarene College in Idaho have used electrophysiological recording equipment in an undergraduate laboratory that has successfully fostered hands-on student learning and faculty-student research. This project is adapting this laboratory and creating a joint-use electrophysiological recording laboratory for students in the Psychology and Physics departments at Calvin College. This laboratory is based on The Neurodata Model 15 Amplifier made by Grass Instruments -- designed for recording electroencephalograph (EEG) data and event-related potentials (ERP). We are revising and expanding the laboratory courses beyond the initial adaptation in psychophysiology to include undergraduate research in cognitive and motivational psychology. The lab is also being used to study the physical properties of physiologically generated electrical potentials. Electrophysiological recording has become an essential element in many medical, human service, and research settings. \r\nPhysics and biology students are being introduced to the laboratory through the study of physics for the health sciences. Students will continue to use the laboratory in advanced research\r\ncourses, and through student-faculty research projects. Our goals are to foster greater technical competency and enhance the learning of theory and applications in the classroom. Specific outcomes include revised laboratory manuals, Web-based dissemination of laboratory exercises, student research presentations, and student-faculty publications.",
