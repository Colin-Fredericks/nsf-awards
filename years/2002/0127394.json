The investigators are testing a \"pencil-and-paper\" version with carefully constructed scenarios and well developed scoring rubrics on 100 students. Finally, they are evaluating the use of a neural network to predict student classification. In order to evaluate their tool, they will compare their results to those derived from follow-up interviews and a \"triangulation\" process that combines many measures to estimate the true outcome. They plan to describe their results at major engineering education meetings and, if warranted, they will publish in archived journals.",
