This grant will enable the participation of students, \r\npostdoctoral fellows and and other junior scientists in the \r\nInternational Conference on Complex Systems (ICCS). Sessions will \r\nfocus on unified conceptual and mathematical strategies and their\r\napplications to physical, biological and social systems. The \r\nconference includes pedagogical sessions for students and topics of \r\ninterest and concern to the public that will serve as vehicles of \r\neducation and communication for a broader audience. A special \r\ntopical day will address recent advances in the study of evolution\r\nand several sessions will focus on biocomplexity, ecology and\r\nmultiscale patterns coupling biological, physical and social systems.\r\nVarious conferences and workshops have addressed aspects of these \r\ngrowing efforts to understand complex systems. However, the ICCS \r\nis the only major international conference series to bring the wide \r\ndiversity of research together, demonstrating the interdisciplinary \r\nyet integrative and coherent nature of these efforts. This conference \r\nseries is organized by the New England Complex Systems Institute \r\n(NECSI).\r\n\r\n",
