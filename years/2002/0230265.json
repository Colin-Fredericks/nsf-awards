 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: An Integrated Interior Infill System for Mass Customized Housing\r\nAbstract\r\nIn the future, homes will contain the most complex activities of any building type. With the aging of the\r\nbaby boomers, homes must become centers for proactive healthcare, distributed energy production, work,\r\ncommerce, learning, etc. Homes must become agile environments that accommodate rapidly changing\r\nneeds, activities, and technologies. They must respond to demands of sophisticated, affluent baby\r\nboomer generation who want choice and tailored solutions that closely reflect their values and needs. But\r\nplaces of living are poorly prepared for this future. Most new apartments are generic, low-grade, low-tech,\r\ninflexible, disruptive to upgrade, high maintenance, and ill-designed. Architects and engineers play no\r\nsignificant role in the creation of places of living, except at the very high end of the market. Most housing\r\nresearch is focused on cost reduction - not on preparing places of living to meet new requirements in the\r\nfuture.\r\nThe objective of this research project is to conceptualize and assess the viability of a new approach that that may result in high-value, customized, reconfigurable, adaptable, multifamily housing. The  three coordinated thrusts are as follows.\r\n1) The development of design concepts for the use of prefabricated, volumetric module ioshellslc of a\r\ndimension that can be efficiently and affordable shipped to the jobsite, combined with the application\r\nof a mass customized cabinetry-like integrated interior infill (I 3 ) system for apartment fit-out. Modular\r\nconstruction is the fastest growing segment of the housing market, but its potential is limited by a\r\nnarrow range of design possibilities, its failure to take advantage of modern manufacturing\r\ntechnologies, and the labor intensive operations required to connect modules at the site. This\r\nresearch will employ modular construction for what it is most suited for - structural shells with building\r\nservices that can be rapidly assembled. \r\n2) The development of concepts for automated, web-based, consumer design tools based on\r\nparametrically defined I 3 components. This effort will take advantage of prior work developed at MIT\r\nand in industry for user customization of apartment design and cabinetry.\r\n3) The development and testing of an I 3 production methodology. The following issues will be\r\ninvestigated: Can an I 3 system allow mass-customized components to be manufactured efficiently and\r\nwith the same quality as identical mass-produced units? Can the controlled and precise fabrication of\r\nintegrated components allow new materials such as advanced polymers, composites, and special-\r\npurpose metals to find their way into the home? Can delicate electronics and devices be more easily\r\nintegrated into I 3 components than with conventional construction? Can parallel manufacturing of the\r\nmodular shell and interior components reduce production cycle time?\r\nIn summary, this research will give the homebuilding supply chain, suppliers, factory producers, and\r\nbuilders a vision of the future - and an approach to the design tools and lean production systems that can\r\nmake that vision a reality. The research will attempt to leap beyond incremental improvements in the\r\nconventional process, to an agile and adaptable system of mass-customization using technologies\r\nprocesses that could be put into effect in the near term. The research will also have important academic\r\nimpacts. It will provide two Masters thesis topics and multi-disciplinary research experiences for two\r\nundergraduate research assistants. The class project in EIN 3314 Work Measurement and Design,\r\ninvolving lean manufacturing in local industry, will provide valuable, team-based, real world learning\r\nexperiences for about 30 undergraduate engineering students.\r\n\r\n",
