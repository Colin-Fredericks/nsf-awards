 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at developing efficient algorithms for multicast communication within the optical networks based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). The following research activities will be particularly pursued. First, the research team will work on the WDM simulators particularly suitable for multicast applications based on WDM. Effi-cient specific multicast tree construction problems will be formulated and their computa-tional complexity will be analyzed.  Second, this project will include more general multi-cast problems and seek the appropriate solutions, such as when the set of senders and re-ceivers in the multicast group vary. Finally, a part of the research will be devoted to the problem of constructing multicast trees in heterogeneous networks with different optical node architectures as well as the fault-tolerance and Quality-of-Service (QoS) problems related to optical multicast built in existing Internet environment and with application-level requirements. This project will include undergraduate students in research and will thus have substantial impact on their preparation for graduate education as well as it will be conducted as means of creating awareness and interest among undergraduate students on the issues surrounding optical networks.",
