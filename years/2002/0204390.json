In order to decide which type of observer is \r\nappropriate for a given nonlinear system, one needs a classification of the \r\nrange of possibilities. Therefore a study of the normal forms of a nonlinear \r\nsystem under a group action that is appropriate to observer design is also \r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nA control system is a mathematical model of a real world process.  It has \r\ninputs and outputs which model the way the way the system interacts with \r\nthe external world and has state variables, which describe the internal \r\nmemory of the system.  The state evolves according to some dynamical \r\nmodel driven by the inputs and the output is some function of the state and \r\npossibly the input.  The fundamental problem of control systems is to \r\nclose the loop in such a way as to achieve stability.  We wish to use \r\nnegative feedback based on the current state to stabilize the system to \r\nsome desirable operating regime.  But usually the current state is not \r\ndirectly measurable so we must design an observer to estimate it from the \r\npast inputs and outputs.  The development of nonlinear observer design \r\nmethodologies is a paramount problem of systems theory and its \r\napplications.  There is no current approach that is effective for all \r\nnonlinear systems.\r\n",
