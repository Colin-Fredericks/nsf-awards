 "awd_abstract_narration": "0206951\r\nRebarber\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on developing techniques for sampled-data \r\nfeedback for infinite dimensional systems.  A discrete time controller can \r\noperator with only limited frequency response, and infinite dimensional \r\nsystems often have high frequency effects which cannot be ignored, so \r\nthere is not only interest in what can be done with sampled-data control \r\ndesign, but also in its limitations.  The following question is basic: can a \r\ngiven continuous-time controller be replaced by a related sampled-data \r\ncontroller, while maintaining the desired response of the closed-loop \r\nsystem?  Both idealized and generalized sample-and-hold will be \r\nconsidered. Generalized hold can be used as a design parameter, and \r\ngeneralized sampling can be used when the output is not sufficiently \r\nsmooth to accommodate point evaluations in time.  The PI will \r\ncharacterize as completely as possible those continuous-time feedback \r\nsystems which do not lose their closed-loop stability when a sampled data \r\nscheme (with sufficiently small sampling time) is applied to the feedback, \r\nand will determine whether the performance of the sampled-data system \r\ncan approximate the continuous time performance.  The performance \r\nmeasures considered are closed-loop growth rate and stability radius. \r\nTracking techniques for infinite dimensional systems will also be studied \r\nand developed.  Suppose a system has an external disturbance term which \r\nis to be rejected, or an external reference term to be tracked.  One common \r\napproach to doing this is by a low-gain controller suggested by the internal \r\nmodel principle.  The effectiveness of such a controller for a wide class of \r\nsystems will be studied, as well as its sensitivity to frequency variations in \r\nthe external signal. Sampled-data versions of tracking controllers will also \r\nbe considered.  These sampled-data and tracking results will be applied to \r\nPDEs in more than one space variable, especially coupled PDE models \r\nwith at least one hyperbolic component.  Due to the fact that these models \r\ninvolve two different of PDEs, coupled via highly unbounded operators, \r\nthe analysis has features which are distinct from the analysis for \r\nuncoupled systems.  For this problem a central concern for output \r\nfeedback design is the analysis of the input-output map, i.e. the map from \r\nthe control to the observation.\r\n\r\nAdvances in digital technology have led to an emphasis on sampled-data \r\ndesign in control engineering, but the development of sampled data \r\ncontrol for infinite-dimensional systems such as PDEs has been limited.  \r\nIn many applications output data is available in discrete time rather than \r\ncontinuous time, and a feedback controller for such a system should be \r\ndesigned to take discrete data as its input, but act in continuous time.  \r\nSince there is already an enormous literature on continuous time \r\nstabilization of PDEs, the project will involve the investigation of how to \r\nmodify continuous time controllers to obtain sampled data controllers, \r\nwhile maintaining system performance.  Also of interest are techniques for \r\ndesigning effective sampled-data controllers without reference to \r\ncontinuous time design.  Another topic to be considered is the design of \r\nactive feedback control tracking external signals and rejecting noise. As an \r\napplication, these methods will be used to design a controller to reject \r\nnoise in a PDE model which describes the interaction between sound \r\nwaves in a cavity (for instance, an airplane cockpit) and the motion of a \r\nflexible wall of the cavity.  Suppose that there is an external noise source, \r\nsuch as engine noise, which is to be rejected, and active feedback control \r\nis to be applied to smart material actuators on the cavity walls.  Then a \r\nproperly designed low-gain controller (either continuous time feedback or \r\nsampled-data) will attenuate the sound pressure at and near finitely many \r\npoints of the cavity.\r\n",
