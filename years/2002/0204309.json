 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports simultaneous mathematical and numerical study of\r\nvarious low Reynolds number sedimentation flows.  These systems are\r\ncomplicated by the long range nature of the fluid flows generated by\r\nindividual solid particles as they fall, requiring efficient\r\nalgorithms for particle simulations, introducing variable nonlinear\r\ncoefficients of different dependencies into model continuum partial\r\ndifferential equations, and leading to nontrivial distributions in the\r\nstatistical mechanics of the interacting particles.  In this work,\r\nefficient algorithms specialized to dilute wall-bounded sedimentation,\r\npreviously developed to investigate the scaling of velocity\r\nfluctuations in monodisperse sedimentation, will be used to provide\r\nquantitative data for comparison with existing and newly-developed\r\nkinetic and fluid models.  The simulations will be generalized to\r\ninclude effects due to inclined channels, polydispersity,\r\nnon-spherical particles, and small non-zero Reynolds numbers.\r\n\r\nInteractions between solid particles sedimenting in a fluid are\r\nimportant in many natural and industrial processes, including the\r\nsettling motions of silt in rivers and dust in the air, and in\r\napplications which use centrifugal or gravitational separation such as\r\nthose for proteins, minerals, waste water, and recyclable plastics.\r\nWhile the mathematics describing the interactions between individual\r\nparticles and the suspending fluid are well known, simulations of\r\nlarge scale flows based on these rules are computationally\r\nprohibitive.  It would be far preferable to use macroscopic models\r\nwhich are less costly to solve because they neglect the detailed\r\nmotion of individual particles.  Unfortunately, existing macroscopic\r\nmodels for sedimentation have very limited ranges of validity.  This\r\nwork will consider restricted classes of sedimentation systems in\r\nwhich efficient computation of the interactions between large numbers\r\nof particles remains possible because of simplified geometries and\r\nlimits for the mathematical rules describing particle motion.  Results\r\nwill be used to help identify improved macroscopic models to describe\r\nboth these restricted classes and more general sedimentation flows.\r\nUltimately, this work will lead to improved equations for modeling\r\nsedimentation flows in nature and for better design of separation\r\nprocesses based on sedimentation.\r\n",
