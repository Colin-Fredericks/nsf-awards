 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the synthesis of new perovskite related oxides by solid state reactions for powder synthesis and the use of high temperature solution reactions for crystal growth to yield new classes of oxide materials with important chemical and physical properties. These chemical compounds can be selectively modified to exhibit desirable physical and chemical properties. Improved methods for designing and synthesizing these materials in desired physical forms such as powders or as single crystals allow one to investigate their electronic and magnetic properties, and to explore their utilization in a variety of applications. To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are being trained in cutting edge techniques for synthesizing and characterizing these materials using state of the art instrumentation such as high-temperature and high-pressure reaction vessels, magnetometers and charge coupled device based single crystal diffractometers. The strong educational aspect of this research assures that highly trained men, women and underrepresented minorities can enter the workforce to meet industrial needs for scientists.\r\n\r\nPerovskite oxides are known for important and interesting magnetic and electronic properties that include superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and ionic conductivity, and also for compositional flexibility enabling  the development of new electronic devices, data storage materials, battery components and superconductors.  Undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers trained in these cutting edge synthetic and characterization techniques will be very competitive for industrial and academic jobs. \r\n\r\n",
