 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site that will host a total of ten students during twelve weeks of summer research each year for two years. Students will be working with researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) located in Woods Hole, MA.  Students will also participate in a series of seminars and workshops exploring issues related to marine science. The program recruits juniors and senior undergraduate students nationwide.  These students are able to pursue research in a broad range of marine science, environmental science and marine engineering fields. WHOI provides significant matching funding in this proposal. The program has an excellent record of success with past groups of students. The number of scientists involved in the program and potential research projects for students is excellent.  The proposal is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers. Students selected for participation in this program gain a significant appreciation for the scientific process and often pursue a career in a scientific field.",
