 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nRadulescu\r\nRadulescu will investigate in this project a range of problems in the structure theory of von Neumann algebras.  He will concentrate on the harmonic analysis of the von Neumann algebras arising in connection with discrete groups, free probability and in deformation quantization theory. The goal is to determine  the structure of the von Neumann algebras that reflect the properties of  non commutative probability, and to relate this structure to the representation theory of Lie groups  and their discrete subgroups. Radulescu intends to investigate the problem of  characterizing the factors of discrete groups by computing their invariants, using ideas  of Murray and von Neumann, related to the  fundamental groups of such an algebra, the set of all index values for subfactors or the structure of convex sets of non-commutative moments. He will investigate also Connes embedding conjecture via tensor products on operator algebras.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this research is to discover  non-commutative aspects of the real word  hidden in \"quantum\" structures. Non-commutativity is a true aspect of the nature: for example two matrices do not necessary commute when multiplied. The famous Heisenberg's Uncertaneity principle reveals the same non-commutative aspect of nature. Von Neumann has developed a class of \"continuous\" matrices, that, while keeping some of the properties of usual matrices, are subtle enough to encode many of the aspects of quantum mechanics.  Recent developments by Jones have proven that aspects of  such von Neumann algebras are intimately related to aspects of topology, knot theory and ultimately biology. Likewise recent work by Voiculescu has proven that the there is a non-commutative probability theory encoded by the same type of objects. The aim of this research project is to contribute to the understanding and classification of some of the structural aspects of von Neumann algebras.\r\n_________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\n>\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\n",
