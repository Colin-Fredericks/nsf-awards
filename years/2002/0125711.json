 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe power and versatility of modern NMR spectroscopy make it an essential tool for chemists. The Department of Chemistry is adapting a variety of experiments from the research and educational literature that uses nuclear spin to obtain structural information and implementing them as discovery-based experiments. These experiments are providing the context for introducing NMR techniques in a sequence that gradually increases the difficulty of relating molecular structure to spectral information.\r\n\r\nOrganic chemistry students are being introduced to NMR early in the first semester through C-13, DEPT, and HETCOR experiments, followed by the characterization an organofluorine compound, using 2-D NMR to identify an unknown ester, probing the stereospecificity of a reduction reaction using NOE, and investigating the conformational dynamics of DEET. Students in Organic Spectroscopy are characterizing non-trivial unknowns using a variety of complementary spectroscopic techniques. Students in advanced courses are investigating phosphorus-phosphorus coupling and characterizing structures of enzyme inhibitors, among other laboratory projects. These discovery-based experiments require a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer with multinuclear capability and possessing the resolution and flexibility required by such experiments. Research in a variety of areas has become an integral part of the training of our undergraduate students and the high-field NMR is finding numerous applications.\r\n\r\n",
