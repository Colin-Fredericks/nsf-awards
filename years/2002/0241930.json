 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT:\r\nThis proposal deals with various aspects of discrete Schroedinger equations\r\non the one dimensional lattice with deterministic potentials. So far, in \r\ncollaboration with Jean Bourgain and Michael Goldstein, the author has \r\nconsidered quasi-periodic potentials given by ergodic shifts on tori, \r\npotentials obtained by means of the skew-shift on the two torus, as well as \r\npotentials defined in terms of strongly mixing dynamics, such as the doubling \r\nmap on the circle or hyperbolic automorphisms on the two torus. In each of \r\nthese cases, positivity of the Lyapunov exponent, regularity  of the \r\nintegrated density of states, and Anderson localization were studied. \r\nAt this point, we are planning to address several remaining questions, \r\nincluding the following ones:\r\n1) Is the Lyapunov exponent positive in case of skew-shift potentials \r\n   for small disorder ? \r\n2) Is it possible to obtained detailed information on the nature of the \r\n   eigenfunctions in the quasi-periodic case assuming only positivity of \r\n   the Lyapunov exponent ? In fact, do the non perturbative techniques\r\n   allow the definition of the essential support as described in the \r\n   perturbative regime by Sinai and Froehlich, Spencer, Wittwer ? \r\n  These questions are intimately linked with Y. G. Sinai's recent work on \r\n   \"anomalous transport in quasi-periodic media\", and would provide better\r\n   and more precise information on the subdiffusive behavior of the random\r\n   walk considered by Sinai. \r\n3) Is it possible to extend the  nonperturbative methods to strips, or the \r\n   two-dimensional plane ?\r\n4) Is the integrated density of states Holder continuous in the case of \r\n   several frequencies or the skew-shift ? \r\n5) What can be said about the statistics  of the level-spacings of the eigen\r\n   values for the case of the skew-shift ?\r\n\r\nHistorically, the study of random Schroedinger operators started with Phil\r\nAnderson's work in the late 1950's, for which he received the Nobel prize.\r\nBefore his work it was believed that small random impurities in a crystal\r\nwould not significantly change its conductance. Anderson, however, showed \r\nthat this is not the case: Arbitrarily small random impurities occurring\r\nindependently at each lattice site turn a conductor into an insulator. Since\r\nhis work, which was not mathematically rigorous, the development of a precise\r\ntheory of \"Anderson localization\" has been pursued by many mathematicians. \r\nIt turned out that there were connections with deep results from several \r\nareas of mathematics. For example, Fuerstenberg's theorem on products of \r\nrandom matrices was a crucial tool in the development of the theory. \r\nThese works attracted the attention of physicists, particularly experts in \r\nstatistical mechanics. To this day, there is an active and fruitful exchange \r\nof ideas between mathematicians and physicists in this subject. In fact, the \r\ninterest in random phenomena and methods has intensified quite notably in \r\nphysics in recent years, as many important problems posed by statistical \r\nmechanics have proved to be rather deep mathematical challenges whose \r\nsolution has lead to significant advances of probabilistic techniques.\r\nIt is our hope that the projects set forth in this proposal will further\r\nadvance our insight into the models of statistical mechanics as well as \r\nproviding useful tools for mathematicians working in ergodic theory, analysis, \r\nand mathematical physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
