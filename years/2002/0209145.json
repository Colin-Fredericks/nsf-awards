 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finding sequences similar to a given query sequence in a large data set\r\nis a fundamental problem in many database applications including\r\ncomputational genomics and proteomics, computational finance, audio, text\r\nand multimedia image processing.  This proposal considers proximity search\r\nproblems for strings and sequences in such applications where existing\r\nmethods typically employ distance functions based on character edits only\r\n(commonly unweighted edit distance) and modify off-the shelf index\r\nstructures to improve search efficiency.  However, in many applications\r\nblock edit operations such as translocations, deletions and copies, as well\r\nas linear transformations on strings are as common and important\r\nas character edits.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, computation of distance measures that allow block edits\r\nare generally known to be NP-hard.  Thus the investigators propose to work\r\non practical methods for approximating the block edit distances and performing\r\napproximate searches under such measures.  These measures are many times\r\nnot symmetric (transforming a long sequence to a short one may be\r\nperformed through a single deletion whereas transforming the short\r\nsequence to the long one may require many copy operations) or do not\r\nsatisfy the triangular inequality (string space under edit operations is\r\nfundamentally different from Euclidean space) and thus do not provide a metric.\r\n\r\nHowever many of them can be proven to be almost-metrics, i.e.,\r\nthe symmetry and/or the triangular inequalities may be satisfied within\r\nmultiplicative constants. This property can be fundamental in sequence\r\nproximity search as it seems possible that known distance based indexing\r\nmethods for metric spaces could be extended for use in almost-metric\r\nspaces.  Thus a main component of the proposal is the investigation of\r\nthe limitations and extendibility of distance based indexes for\r\nalmost-metrics and other string/sequence measures which may be\r\nnon-symmetric or fail to satisfy the triangular inequality because they\r\nallow block edits.\r\n\r\nAn alternative/complementary approach to distance based indexing is based\r\non approximate random mappings of the space of items to be searched to\r\nEuclidean spaces. This general strategy has received considerable\r\nattention in the context of vector spaces. The mappings used guarantee\r\n(with high probability) to reduce the number of comparisons during search\r\nfrom linear to poly-logarithmic, provided some error of approximation can\r\nbe tolerated in the answers obtained. This approach was later generalized\r\nto sequence spaces through a mapping of sequences under block edit distance\r\nto binary strings under Hamming distance. The error tolerance is not\r\nvery practical. Thus a second component of this proposal is to obtain\r\nnovel mappings of sequence spaces to Euclidean spaces within smaller\r\napproximation errors. The goal is to generalize such mappings to both\r\ncharacter and block based edit distances, especially those which assign\r\nweights to edit operations (that reflect the likeliness of that\r\nparticular edit).\r\n\r\n",
