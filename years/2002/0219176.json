 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding for the development of modeling data structures for representation and design of three-dimensional heterogeneous objects, with special application to tissue engineered structures.  Representation of three-dimensional solid models is accomplished with a novel constructive heterogeneous solid geometry algebra and a heterogeneous boundary representation data structure. Heterogeneous structure design is accomplished by an adaptation of discrete optimization techniques that, when given a set of unit cellular structure primitives, determines the optimal (or satisfying) internal configuration of the three-dimensional solid that achieves engineering requirements.  The approach introduces a graph theoretic optimization framework that exploits properties of heterogeneous representation elements to create structures that satisfy multiple criteria of anatomical fitting, structural integrity, biological function, and manufacturability.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will deliver new techniques and tools to represent, design and develop heterogeneous tissue scaffolds. It will lead to fundamental and integrative computer science and engineering advances that span engineering design, solid modeling, computational geometry and algorithms, computer-aided design and manufacturing, and tissue engineering. This project actively engages industry and government, including collaborations with the developers of international standards and the data transfer protocols for heterogeneous structures, a major computer-aided design software vendor, a leading biopharmaceutical manufacturer, and a major medical center with expertise in tissue scaffold and replacement application. This research links the state-of-the-art in geometric computing and commercial computer-aided design and manufacturing software with the needs of the non-traditional materials found in biomedical tissue engineering. Therefore, it will enable new applications. This research also produces joint curricula, spanning mathematics, computer science and engineering to educate future generations of students who will design, manufacture and develop software for heterogeneous material applications.",
