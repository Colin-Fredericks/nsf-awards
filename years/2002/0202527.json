 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty of Florida Community College in Jacksonville (FCCJ) and Gulf Coast Community College (GCCC) are adapting and implementing curricula developed by the Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Center in Dayton, Ohio (AIM Center). The project enables students to have virtual work experiences, and provides faculty development for regional college instructors and high school teachers. The new curricula, adapted to the Florida Community College System, features a modular design that allows students to complete their education in a compressed time while gaining real world experiences in new laboratories. Existing collaborations with industry groups, state universities, public schools, and workforce development organizations are helping to recruit and retain students, particularly those from underrepresented groups. Faculty professional development opportunities are being provided through the new Advanced Technology Center developed at the Downtown Campus of the College and with partner universities and the AIM Center at Sinclair Community College. Follow-up activities at FCCJ and GCCC involve both academic and technical faculty in collaborative curriculum development and implementation of supportive learning opportunities, such as integrated problem-based learning and learning communities congruent with the AIM Center's modular, competency-based approach.",
