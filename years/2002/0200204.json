 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) is one of the most critical steps in the production of multilayer silicon microelectronic devices. The goal of the research project  is to develop a framework for environmental modeling which combines mechanical-chemical modeling of CMP tool components, environmental impact factors and cost of ownership (CoO) based upon competent variable sensitive process models of material removal in CMP. This work will extend earlier work to more detailed process capable models within an integrated process assessment framework. We focus here on the continued development of models for the mechanical interactions as well as models of the chemical effects and influence on the process. We expect to determine the dependency of material removal (both at a specific point and over the wafer surface) on process variables such as slurry, pattern density, wafer material, etc. The model will be able to offer information on designing new or novel pad geometries to facilitate \"environmentally efficient CMP.\" \r\n\r\nThe work at UC, San Diego, on chemical removal mechanisms, is added to prior work at Berkeley. The resulting software will link process models to higher-level tools for assessing the environmental impact of the process and the upstream and downstream energy, consumable and waste requirements. A result of this model-based \"environmental analysis tool\" will be quantitative suggestions to process engineers and product and tool designers to enable them to insure that energy, waste and consumable use is minimized while maintaining the capability of the process and high product standards - that is - Environmentally Benign Manufacturing.",
