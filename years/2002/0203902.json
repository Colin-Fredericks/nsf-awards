Specifically, the goal is to\r\nresolve the conjecture that a Gromov-hyperbolic group with space at\r\ninfinity a 2-sphere has a cocompact, properly discontinuous action on\r\nhyperbolic 3-space. The investigator and his collaborators are\r\napproaching the conjecture from the point of view of proving\r\nconformality of certain recursive sequences of tilings on the space\r\nat infinity of a Gromov-hyperbolic group. Previous work has indicated\r\nthat conformality of a recursive sequence of tilings might follow\r\nfrom finding an invariant conformal structure for a branched surface\r\nassociated to the recursive structure. This possibility arose from a\r\nconnection between the recursive structures and rational maps, and\r\nThurston's classification theorem for critically finite branched maps\r\nof the 2-sphere gives insight into how the theory might develop.\r\nMultiple approaches are planned for finding an invariant conformal\r\nstructure. Further work is also planned on twisted face-pairing\r\n3-manifolds. Much of the basic theory of twisted face pairings has\r\nbeen completed, but some questions remain which are central to\r\nfurther developments of the theory. Significant progress here could\r\nhelp the main part of the project, since twisted face pairings are a\r\ngood source of test examples for the conjecture stated above.\r\n\r\nThe immediate focus of this proposal is on sequences of planar\r\ntilings. Given an initial tiling and a combinatorial rule for\r\nsubdivision, one recursively obtains a sequence of subdivisions of\r\nthe initial tiling. The goal is to understand when these combinatorial\r\nsubdivisions can be realized geometrically so that the tiles stay\r\n\"almost round\" at all stages of the sequence. This problem is\r\ninteresting in its own right, but it is being studied here as part of\r\na deeper problem. It is a key feature of a program of the\r\ninvestigator and his collaborators to resolve the hyperbolic case of\r\nWilliam P. Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture. The Geometrization\r\nConjecture, which is the central outstanding problem in\r\nlow-dimensional topology (it includes the Poincare conjecture as a\r\nspecial case), states that every compact 3-manifold can be naturally\r\nsubdivided into geometric pieces. The techniques being developed for\r\napproaching this have potential applications in other disciplines.\r\n\r\n",
