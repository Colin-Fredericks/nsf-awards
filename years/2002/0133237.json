 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Raina Maier, an environmental microbiologist, Jeanne Pemberton, a surface chemist (both of the University of Arizona) and Cynthia Larive, an analytical nuclear magnetic resonance expert (of the University of Kansas) are funded by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities for the investigation of microbial surfactants and their role in the surface chemistry of soils.   This problem is to be addressed in an extensive interdisciplinary research program involving batch and flow-through column and micro-organism culturing, and analyses including FTIR, NMR, XPS, AFM and PCR.  The goal is to sort out the interaction of biosurfactants in natural and model soil systems that are both contaminated and uncontaminated.  \r\n\r\nBiosurfactants released by microbes play an unknown role in the transport of metals in the soil environment.  In addition to aiding in questions of transport of metals (both natural and pollutants), the work may help provide new methods for bioremediation and/or elimination of contamination in soils.  A unique cross-training of graduate and undergraduate students is in place in conjunction with the research.\r\n",
