 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is a public, Hispanic-serving, two-year associate degree granting college charged with advancing the state's economic development by educating a skilled workforce. The vast majority of the residents in the College's service area are of Hispanic origin, reflecting the College's 87% Hispanic student population. Students receive an associate of applied science degree in one of four areas: Biomedical Engineering Technology, Electro Mechanical Engineering Technology, Electronic Engineering Technology, and Telecommunications Technology.\r\n\r\nAward recipients are being selected on the basis of a submitted application, interviews, a written statement on choosing an engineering related field, and assessment of career goals. A campus National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarship Committee selects qualified students for awards. Awarded students maintain a 3.0 GPA and if they continue in an engineering-related field until graduation, they remain eligible for the scholarship award.\r\n\r\nThe scholarship awards are being integrated into the overall recruitment and retention efforts of the college. As a result of additional funding, specific initiatives for outreach and recruitment to Hispanic families, Texas Workforce Commission, and parental involvement centers are ready to be implemented. Intensive retention strategies such as assessment methods using the Noel-Levitz Retention Management System, intrusive academic advising, a structured first year student success course, supplemental instruction, tutoring and mentoring, and the establishment of learning assistance centers provide awarded students with a strong retention infrastructure for student success as measured by persistence until graduation.\r\n",
