 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics of the University of Michigan will administer a Research Experience for Undergraduates program at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. This Laboratory is home of the world wide web and a leading high energy physics center, viewed by many as the world's premier international scientific laboratory.  Approximately nine students will be competitively recruited nationally to participate in the program. They will spend an orientation week at the University of Michigan prior to their journey to Geneva. During that week they will take computing courses, and hear lectures on CERN, high energy physics and research ethics. During their period at CERN they attend daily lectures given by experts in areas such as physics, cosmology and computing. Each day they also work with assigned mentors on current physics problems. An onsite Coordinator is present at CERN to assist the students with any matters related to program or personal needs. Each student must give a final talk on their accomplishments and participate in the program evaluation. \r\n\r\n",
