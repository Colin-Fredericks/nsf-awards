This is necessary in order to prepare future mechanical engineers to solve problems in emerging technologies such as micro/nanotechnology and biotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe proposed reforms will be focused around four major tasks. (1) The first task is the introduction of emerging knowledge of multi-scale, multi-physics and non-linear phenomena in the areas of the curriculum where it is not already taken into account appropriately. For example this includes address topics such as \r\nproblems which cover a wide range of time and/or length (nano-, micro-, nano-) scales, and  coupled phenomena, such as the coupled elastic and electric response in the piezo-electric effect. The understanding of these non-traditional phenomena and the associated analytical and experimental tools necessary to reach that understanding are becoming increasingly important in the emerging technologies of today, in particular in microelectronics, MEMS, nanotechnology and bioengineering. The second task concerns the elimination and/or reduction of emphasis on certain classes of problems, illustrative examples and solution techniques which predate, and are largely made irrelevant by, the existence of powerful new computational and visualization environments. The third task is to replace these legacy materials with problems and examples and techniques which exploit the modern computational environment, and are used to illustrate basic concepts in a more dynamic and illustrative way than they were before; this will necessarily train the students in at least one of a variety of available computational and visualization environments. The fourth task is to explore and take advantage of some of the more modern teaching methods, such as active learning, multiple representation, multimedia presentation, web-based materials, and mentoring.\r\n",
