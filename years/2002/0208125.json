 "awd_abstract_narration": "0208125\r\nDavis\r\nIt is widely agreed that invasion ecology theory needs to become more mechanistic,\r\nquantitative, and predictive and that field experiments and better models are required to help\r\naccomplish this goal. The initial goal of the proposed project is to test a recent mechanistic\r\nhypothesis of invasibility and to develop a quantitative empirical model that can be used to\r\npredict the changing invasibility of an environment over time. The hypothesis tested proposes\r\nthat a mechanistic relationship exists between invasibility and resource availability, and that\r\nchanges in invasibility are often due to changes in the competition intensity from resident\r\nvegetation, which in turn result from fluctuations in resource availability. This project will be\r\nconducted in a native grass environment located on a Minnesota sand plain. Thus, a second goal\r\nof the project is to increase our understanding of the invasion dynamics associated with\r\ngrasslands and woodland/grassland ecotones in semi-arid environments. These goals will be\r\naccomplished in a study consisting of three parts.\r\nDuring the first stage, an empirical model of invasibility will be developed using data\r\nfrom a field experiment in which temporal patterns of resource availability (water) will be\r\nmanipulated in plots being experimentally invaded. During this stage, data from the field\r\nexperiments will also be used to directly test predictions of the fluctuating resource availability\r\nhypothesis. Water was selected as the resource to be manipulated because previous studies of\r\nseedling establishment at Cedar Creek have shown that establishment success of herbaceous and\r\nplants was most strongly correlated with soil water conditions. During the second stage, an\r\nexisting mechanistic soil water model will be used to produce season-long soil water profiles at\r\nthe study site under a variety of climatological (temperature and rainfall) data sets, including\r\nclimatological data recorded at the study site during the project, historical climatological data for\r\nthe region, and various hypothetical temperature and precipitation regimes that might occur in\r\nthe future if the climate changes. During the third stage, the season-long water profiles produced\r\nby the mechanistic model will be used as input for the empirical model of invasibility. The\r\ninvasibility predictions produced by the integration of the empirical and mechanistic models will\r\ncompared to invasibility data obtained from a separate field experiment conducted during the\r\nstudy. If the integrated model is successful in its predictions, then it will be used with the\r\nhistorical and hypothetical climatological data to determine the extent of annual variability in\r\ninvasibility of native grasslands in the past, and the extent to which invasibility may change in\r\nthe future if temperature and/or precipitation regimes change.\r\nThe goals of the proposed study are both to advance ecological theory and the ecological\r\nunderstanding of specific environments. In addition to testing a recent mechanistic theory of\r\ninvasibility, the study will develop a method to model and predict invasibility that is intended to\r\nbe transferable to other environments. Recent evidence has shown that grasslands and old fields\r\nare more responsive to fluctuations in precipitation than other biomes and that water limited\r\nenvironments such as grasslands and savannas are likely to be some of the biomes most affected\r\nby future climate change. Thus, by testing a specific mechanistic theory of invasibility in the\r\nwater limited grassland-forest ecotone at Cedar Creek with an experimental study culminating in\r\nthe development of a model of invasibility, this study will contribute to the important pool of\r\nknowledge that will be necessary to predict and prepare for the possible ecological consequences\r\nof global environmental change in these environments.",
