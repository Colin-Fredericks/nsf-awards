 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe goal of this project is the design of joint power control, rate control, and base station assignment for multimedia wireless networks.  Two key aspects of the multimedia network will be considered that have been given short shrift in the past: the requirements of data and system dynamics.  The project will consider 4th generation Direct-Sequence Code-Division Multiple-Access (DS-CDMA) networks.  The goal is to implement dynamic assignment of downlink transmit power, data rate, and codes to each mobile in accordance with the ability of each application to use the resulting QoS.  The focus is on network-wide behavior, and therefore network-wide performance measures will be considered, jointly optimized between physical and networking layers.  Three main thrusts will be considered: \r\n(a) Use of multiple state automata hybrid systems models as a novel tool to control wireless network dynamics. \r\n(b) Design and analysis of resource allocation algorithms using novel pricing theory. \r\n(c) Design and analysis of parameter estimation algorithms to achieve robust network behavior. \r\nThe first thrust is intended to provide a powerful tool for generating control algorithms for systems with both discrete and continuous parameters and switching costs.  It will be used in this project for controlling power, data rate, and handoffs.  The research in this area will extend the dimensionality of a previously studied hybrid systems approach to handoff control.  The second research thrust is the construction of joint power control, data rate control, and base station assignment algorithms. This research will be based on economic theory for resource allocation, and implemented using hybrid systems.  The final thrust will address the reliance of many resource allocation schemes upon unknown communication parameters such as received SINR.  Three investigators will work together: an expert in hybrid systems, an expert in resource allocation, and an expert in multiuser spread spectrum wireless systems.\r\n",
