Other academic institutes and private corporations participate as associate members in research projects.  The Center is a regionally focused organization with the mission to gather new information about earthquakes in southern California, integrate knowledge into a comprehensive and predictive understanding of earthquake phenomena, and communicate this understanding to engineers, emergency managers, government officials, and the general public.  It does this through the application of research findings from the various disciplines in earthquake-related science and engineering.  Extensive data bases are being developed including seismicity, strong motion and geodetic data that are available to all users both within and outside the center through remote access such as the Internet.  The Center leads a consortium of university and government scientists in development of a fixed array of Global Positioning System stations to monitor crustal distortion in southern California.  The Center brings together scientists from core and participating institutions, a visiting scientist program, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the user community.  It is also a highly effective intellectual training ground for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows.  Earthquake hazard mitigation is also done through public information and education programs, museum displays, and the training of teachers and K-12 students.  The center is led by Professor Thomas H. Jordan as Principal Investigator/Center Director and Professor Thomas L. Henyey as Deputy Director.\r\n*** \r\n\r\n",
