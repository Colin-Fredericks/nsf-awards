Peter Scott\r\n\r\nGeometric Group Theory and the Topology of 3-Manifolds\r\n\r\nThe proposer plans to continue his joint work with Gadde Swarup on\r\nconnections between geometric group theory and the topology of\r\n3-manifolds. In the 1970's, the theory of the characteristic \r\nsubmanifold of a compact 3-manifold was completed. Starting in the\r\nmid 1980's, it began to be apparent that there were analogues of \r\nthis topological result in the purely algebraic setting. Several \r\nauthors have worked on this in the last 15 years, but so far none \r\nof the results have been truly analogous to the topological \r\nresults except in very special cases. Now the proposer and Swarup\r\nhave produced the first true algebraic analogues of the \r\ntopological results and they plan to continue their investigations\r\nin order to see how far their results can be carried. Their \r\narguments and results have already given new insights into the \r\ntopology of 3-manifolds and led to new results in geometric group\r\ntheory. The proposer expects that further work in this area will\r\nhave a significant impact on geometric group theory.\r\n\r\nThe proposer plans to continue his joint work with Gadde Swarup on\r\nconnections between group theory and the theory of 3-dimensional\r\nmanifolds. About 40 years ago, some remarkable, and entirely \r\nunexpected, work of Stallings first demonstrated the depth of \r\nthese connections. More recently, work of several authors \r\ncontinued this theme by showing that groups can be decomposed in a\r\nfashion closely analogous to the way in which 3-dimensional \r\nmanifolds can be decomposed. The proposer and Swarup have given a \r\nnew approach to this area and they plan to continue their \r\ninvestigations in order to see how far their results can be \r\ncarried. Their arguments and results have already given new \r\ninsights into the theory of 3-dimensional manifolds and led to new\r\nresults in group theory. The proposer expects that further work in\r\nthis area will have a significant impact on group theory.\r\n",
