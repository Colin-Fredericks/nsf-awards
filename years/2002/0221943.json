 "awd_abstract_narration": "In March 1999 about 150 researchers gathered in Como, Italy for the first International Conference on \"Analysis of Microbial Cells at the Single Cell Level\". The beautiful surroundings of Como were an excellent setting for discussing the function of individual cells and how individual cells can be analyzed. The Conference participants, a mixture of biologists and engineers, addressed the three questions: \r\n\r\nWHY do we need to analyze at the single-cell level? This gives important information about cellular function, cell-cell interactions in different ecosystems, and because population dynamics, to a large extent, determines the overall function of large scale cultures used in the biotech industry.  \r\n\r\nHOW do we analyze at the Single Cell level? Through the use of flow cytometry, image analysis, and mathematical models it is possible to analyze cellular function at the single-cell level.   \r\n\r\nWHEN to analyze at the single-cell level? Both in basic research on cellular function and in applied research aimed at improving biotechnology processes.\r\n\r\nIn June 2002, the second International Conference on this theme will take place in Vejle, Denmark. At the Conference, the focus will again be on the three questions: WHY, HOW and WHEN, and the latest developments within this interesting research field will be presented. With the advances in genomics, the rigorous analysis of the phenotype becomes an important and timely issue. The Conference also aims at further strengthening and enlarging the scientific network established at the first Conference, and to promote specifically communication between biologists and engineers.  \r\n\r\nThe organizing committee plans to submit a final report of the Conference to the National Science Foundation soon after the Conference.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
