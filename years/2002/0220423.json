 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project at LaSalle University  awards a total of thirty (30) scholarships to low income, academically talented students, including twenty (20) undergraduate students and ten (10) graduate students over a 4-year period.\r\n\r\nThe target audience includes 30% women, and 10% minorities. A special effort is made to recruit additional women, particularly into the undergraduate Computer Science and Information Technology majors. The PI works with designated staff in the Admissions Office to increase the number of minority students majoring in MTH/CSC/IT by seeking transfer students from Community College of Philadelphia and from LaSalle's Bilingual Undergraduate Studies for Career Advancement Program, an innovative associate degree program for Latino students.\r\n\r\nIn addition to scholarship assistance for the student recipients, NSF funds are also used for project management and for a special Career Exploration series of guest speakers who are employed in these fields. The University provides funds from its annual budget to the Mathematics and Computer Science Department for tutorial assistance for the undergraduate CSEMS recipients.\r\n\r\n80% of the funded students are expected to receive their degrees within four years of matriculating at La Salle, and 80% are expected to attain new or advanced professional positions related to their field of study within one year of graduation. \r\n",
