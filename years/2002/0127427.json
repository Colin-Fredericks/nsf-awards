 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nCore concepts, such as Newton's second law of motion or the ideal gas law, underpin a rigorous science education. These ideas and laws come from physics, math, and chemistry; their necessity to practical and advanced science literacy is evidenced by widespread institutional standards requiring study in these disciplines by students in the sciences. Over the course of their careers, students mature in their understanding of fundamental scientific concepts, moving from memorization to analysis and synthesis of core ideas. The goal of science education at Brown University is to provide learning environments where students can become self-driven inquirers and investigators capable of scientific discovery. To achieve this growth, students require grounding in core scientific concepts and practice in the in self-driven inquiry and investigative behaviors they will use as scientists and scientifically literate citizens. To improve understanding of key science concepts and promote inquiry-based learning, we are developing a prototype Context-Rich Interactive Science Teaching and Learning System (CRISTALS) for pilot testing in 13 Brown University courses and at Rhode Island College and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The web-based CRISTALS environment provides students with information and problems facilitating the exploration of a core concept in a context rich in interdisciplinary applications and examples. The CRISTALS environment is expected to support instructors in adapting science pedagogy to better meet the needs of a diverse student population. The CRISTALS tool provides students with opportunities to improve their ability to apply core scientific concepts in problems from multiple disciplines, and encourages self-driven inquiry into fundamental scientific principles.",
