However,\r\nthere is ample evidence that quantum invariants of three manifolds\r\nexist as holomorphic functions on the unit disk that diverge\r\neverywhere on the unit circle but at roots of unity.  The investigator\r\nuses the results of her previous research to study further quantum\r\ninvariants and to find additional applications of that research to\r\nclassical 3-manifold topology. Specifically, she works on the problem\r\nof extending the parametric domain of the quantum 3-manifold\r\ninvariants beyond roots of unity. She also studies the application of\r\nquantum topology to detecting symmetries of 3--manifolds and to\r\nanswering questions relating to Dehn surgery on knots.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantum topology is a rapidly developing area of mathematics that\r\nbrings together ideas from physics, algebra, geometry and\r\ntopology. This theory has produced a wealth of new invariants for\r\nthree dimensional manifolds. Three-manifolds are objects which locally\r\nlook like the common 3-dimensional space we live in, and \"topological\r\ninvariants\" are numbers which can be associated to manifolds that\r\nencode some information about their structure and help to classify\r\nthem. The investigator works on one of the fundamental problems in\r\nthis area, namely that of finding topological interpretations for\r\nthese new invariants.\r\n",
