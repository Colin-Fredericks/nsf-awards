 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer predictions of phenomena on large or global scales, for example\r\nweather or climate forecasts, need to compromise between accuracy of the \r\npredictions and available computing resources. It is therefore a grand\r\nscientific challenge to derive global climate  models which are reliable \r\nand trustworthy. Exploiting certain geophysical balances, such as \r\ngeostrophic balance (due to earth rotation) or hydrostatic balance \r\n(due to the shallowness of the ocean and atmosphere) geophysicists derive\r\n reasonable, yet less complex, balanced models. It is therefore essential to \r\njustify rigorously the  validity of these models, for the relevant spatial\r\nand time scales. The focus  of the proposed project is on the analytical,\r\nstatistical and numerical properties of solutions to nonlinear ocean \r\ndynamics models and turbulent sub-grid models. The first aspect of this \r\nproject is to: show existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on \r\ninitial data, to some of these reduced geophysical models. In particular, \r\na two-layer zonal jet model, a planetary geostrophic ``thermocline'' model, \r\nthe lake equations with degenerate varying bottom topography and the \r\ntwo-dimensional primitive equations. This is the first and the most essential \r\nstep in validating the derivation of these  models. In order to justify the \r\nlong-time behavior of fluid dynamical models, one has to compare the statistical \r\nproperties of their attracting invariant sets, rather than compare individual\r\nsolutions. To do so, it is necessary to focus on models which include some \r\nmechanism of dissipation. This project addresses questions related to the asymptotic \r\nderivation of these models and the effect of numerical dissipation on their \r\nsolutions, which include boundary layer analysis. The second aspect of this\r\nproject is to: derive new large-eddy simulation models, the so-called alpha-models, \r\nin the context  of the  two-layers geostrophic zonal jet models. The alpha-models \r\nare asserted to reproduce the right energy spectrum for a wide range  of large \r\nscales. It is proposed to investigate  this claim using rigorous analytical tools. \r\nIt is also proposed to perform computational tests on the newly derived two-layers \r\ngeostrophic zonal jet alpha-model to verify the above assertion. Furthermore, \r\nit is proposed to explore the implementation of the alpha-models approach as \r\nsub-grid models. \r\n\r\nThe grand challenge in climate prediction is that the mathematical equations \r\ngoverning the ocean and atmosphere dynamics, are too difficult to study \r\nanalytically, and still prohibitively expensive computationally. Indeed, \r\nit is well established, based on physical grounds and collected experimental \r\ndata, that atmospheric and oceanic turbulent flows involve a broad spectrum \r\nof spatial and time scales. This in turn  makes them inaccessible  to the most \r\npowerful  and state-of-the-art computers. However, due to the rotation of the \r\nearth and other geophysical situations, such as the shallowness of the oceans \r\nand the atmosphere - in the sense that they are much wider than they are deep - \r\ngeophysicists take advantage of certain geophysical balances to derive simplified\r\nbalanced models. The first theme of this project is to: establish existence \r\nand regularity of solutions to some of these nonlinear reduced models. This is\r\na crucial step  in justifying the derivation  of these models and their\r\nconsistency with the physical observations for the relevant length  and time \r\nscales. Furthermore, in global climate prediction one is interested in the \r\nlong-time statistical features of the climate. The second theme of this project \r\nis to develop a systematic approach for deriving and studying  new averaged \r\nmodels, in the context of ocean and atmosphere dynamics, which are reliable in \r\nreproducing the correct long-term statistics.",
