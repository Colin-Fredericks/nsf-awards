 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the lack of visualization technology for advanced engineering simulation tools. Such tools routinely depend on interpolation and approximation (basis) functions for a variety of purposes, including modeling geometry via CAD/CAM tools, or for computational techniques such as the finite element method. What distinguishes advanced tools from earlier, less sophisticated tools is their dependence on higher-order basis functions, as compared to the linear functions typical of early tools. While modern simulation tools have moved to more sophisticated basis functions, visualization technology has lagged behind. Visualization technology, which plays a vital role in understanding, communicating and steering computational design, has not moved beyond supporting linear basis functions, with a few special exceptions (e.g., quadratic). This situation poses a significant problem for engineering computation, since advanced techniques of high accuracy are coupled with lower-accuracy display of results. Such an approach is error prone, and introduces significant penalties in terms of time and computer resources required.\r\n     Kitware, Inc. proffers software technology that will enable analysts to use higher-order basis functions for visualization. This technology will be available for licensing in the combined CAD/CAM and finite element market. In addition, Kitware, Inc. will build visualization applications for commercial sale.",
