The program will also have an important objective of supporting optically enabled aspects of\r\nmicrosystems, nanoscience, and other emerging fields. Specifically, the plan will incorporate development of a new\r\ncollege degree curriculum, proposing creation of new laboratories, development of courses training K-12 teachers in\r\noptical science and engineering, creation of outreach programs, identification and activation of sources of support\r\nfor minority students, and involvement of local and national industry and government laboratories.\r\n\r\nThrough the incorporation of current pedagogical learning theories concerning instructional design and\r\nassessment, the proposed new degree curriculum will support a new model that will be available for use by other\r\nengineering programs at UNM's School of Engineering and nationwide. Most importantly, the proposed degree will\r\nbridge the last remaining gap in the unique hierarchy of photonics educational programs in New Mexico, starting with the Photonics Academy at West Mesa High School supported by the Sandia National Laboratories that feeds into the Photonics Technology Associate Degree program at the Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute, and ending with the M.S. and Ph.D. programs in Optical Science and Engineering offered at UNM. The comprehensive line-up of educational and career options in optics and photonics that would be enabled by the proposed B.S. degree will permit New Mexico industry to fill its photonics-centered positions at all levels, from the technician to the advanced researcher, from a workforce trained locally. The proposed degree will, more generally, help meet the emerging workforce and educational needs of the entire US industry.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the proposed program is to create a unique and highly desired cadre of optics personnel who,\r\nbecause of their broad, advanced, interdisciplinary, and industrially relevant education and training, will be able to\r\nlead the State of New Mexico and the Nation into the optics- and photonics-engaged 21 st century.\r\n\r\n",
