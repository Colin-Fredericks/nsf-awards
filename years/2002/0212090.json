NSF funds will be used to partially defray the registration costs of advanced graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and young faculty with no other support. The physics of correlated electrons is both rich in basic science challenges and pregnant with possibilities for technological impact.  The conference will cover a broad range of topics that are among the most active in this field including, superconductivity and related properties of two-dimensional electrons in organic-molecule field-effect-transistor systems, ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors and other low-electron-density systems, and new advances in experimental and theoretical studies of oxide superconductivity.   \r\n%%%\r\nThis award provides partial support for the 2002 Gordon Research Conference on Correlated Electrons to be held June 29 - July 3 on the Campus of Colby College in Waterville Maine.

The physics of correlated electrons is both rich in basic science challenges and pregnant with possibilities for technological impact.  The conference will cover a broad range of topics that are among the most active in this field.  Conference highlights include reports on the latest advances of efforts to understand ferromagnetism in semiconductors, a phenomenon that could enable long-term information storage and information processing to occur in the same semiconductor device, and reports on superconductivity controlled by gate voltages in organic materials, a phenomenon that could lead to room temperature superconductivity.   \r\n",
