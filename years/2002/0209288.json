 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the goals of the U. S. Weather Research Program is to improve the prediction of heavy precipitation events that are often associated with frontal systems.  The objective of this research is to improve understanding of the influence of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) on atmospheric fronts.  Extensive research has been devoted to frontal dynamics and the influence of the underlying topography on them.  However, the effect of the boundary layer on the development and modification of fronts as they move over various surfaces is not well understood.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of the current proposal is to improve understanding of the influence of the planetary boundary layer on atmospheric fronts.  In his study, the Principal Investigator (PI) will utilize numerical models and data from three completed field programs.  The PI lists four research thrusts, which are to investigate the role of the boundary layer (marine and land, including topography) on:\r\n\r\n1. the evolution of fronts over topography;\r\n2. the development of marine fronts;\r\n3. the evolution of fronts that travel from the ocean to a coastal mountain range;\r\n4. the evolution of unbalanced fronts.\r\n\r\nThis study will enhance understanding of frontal development and variation that are crucial in mid-latitude weather prediction.  If the research is successful, results could positively impact the forecasting of frontal related weather (e.g. precipitation) through better numerical forecasts and better conceptual models.\r\n",
