 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Hungarian research project involves two teams led by Piers Coleman of Rutgers University, New Brunswick, and his partner Alfred Zawadowski of the Physics Institute at the Technical University, Budapest.  Their collaboration features examination of strongly correlated systems with an emphasis on quantum criticality and superconductivity in heavy fermion systems and electronic correlation effects in mesoscopic devices.  These researchers found motivation in recent experiments performed at the magnetic quantum critical point of a heavy fermion metal and in nano-science developments that enable measurements and observations of strongly correlated states in single electron devices.\r\n\r\nThe project's research plan features study of: 1) magnetic quantum critical point in the Kondo lattice; 2) superconducting order in heavy fermion compounds and 3) dynamical and out-of equilibrium properties of quantum dots.  Various numerical and analytical methods will be employed including slave particle methods and large N expansions; perturbative renormalization group techniques and e-expansions; and dynamical mean field theory calculations combined with numerical renormalization group methods.  If successful, findings should contribute to our knowledge of new phenomena on a nanometer scale that may be applicable in specially fabricated materials. \r\n\r\nThis international research project in materials theory fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the Untied States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
