This workshop will bring together workers from the US, Japan, and Russia who are dealing with understanding the same natural processes but within different politically designated intervals of this zone of subduction. The benefits are expected to extend beyond basic science to the coordinated monitoring and mitigation of natural hazards, such as those from earthquakes, tsunamis, and explosive volcanic eruptions and the sharing of information relevant to natural resources. An important role of the meeting will be to acquaint students with the broader context of their areas of  fieldwork and to facilitate direct contact with students from other countries. The intent is to stimulate international and interdisciplinary collaborations that will last throughout their careers. The meeting will also serve to inform and stimulate involvement by American geoscientists in their own island arc, the Aleutians. Although there has been rapid growth in hazards-driven monitoring and research there, the academic community of the lower 48 states has yet to take full advantage of the opportunities for basic research that the high level of activity of the Aleutians offers. The wish is to stimulate broader American participation in the volcanology of subduction, with a view toward developing a center-type initiative in the future.\r\n",
