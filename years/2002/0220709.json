 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation Scholars' Program is targeting seven academic programs. All seven are associate degree programs and two offer baccalaureate degrees. Based on a 1998 mission review, the college implemented a process calling for a broader, polytechnic baccalaureate mission. This is reflected in the expanding number of baccalaureate offerings.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the NSF Scholars Program are to:\r\n1. Enroll academically talent and financially needy students in computer and engineering technology degree programs by the end of the four-year period.\r\n2. Increase the diversity of students who matriculate into the college's computer science, engineering, and engineering technology degree programs.\r\n3. Retain 100% of the NSF Scholars through graduation (AAS or BS).\r\n4. Evaluate the outcomes of the NSF Scholars Program.\r\n5. Disseminate the results of the NSF Scholars Program.\r\n\r\nAssociated Objectives and Specific Activities are designed to achieve these goals. Among these are to: \r\n(a) increase the proportion of students who are African-American and/or Hispanic by producing advertising material in English and Spanish, and recruiting in the Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo city school districts; \r\n(b) increase the proportion of students who are female by highlighting current support for women in non-traditional programs at the college, and designing advertising material specifically addressing the needs of women; \r\n(c) increase the number of students who are financially needy by targeting the 25 poorest rural school districts as identified by the New York State Education Department; and \r\n(d) increase the retention rate of all students enrolled in targeted programs by tapping the power of peer support in a variety of ways.\r\n\r\nThe selection process is based on an essay, letters of recommendation, academic performance, extra-curricular activities, and financial-eligibility. Evaluation is designed to determine whether the quantitative goals of the project are met. The outcomes of the NSF Scholars Program are being disseminated in academic, student affairs, enrollment management, and financial aid outlets nationally and regionally.",
