 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to John J. Marchalonis, Ph.D. for studies on \r\n\"Primitive Antibodies\". This project addresses the molecular basis of \r\ndiversification of the recognition molecules that are essential for the \r\ngeneration of specific immunity. The project focuses upon the immune system \r\nof sharks because these are the most primitive vertebrates to share with \r\nhumans the combinatorial immune response. This is based uniquely upon the \r\nrecombination of gene segments to generate the variability in antigen \r\nreceptor molecules present in serum and on blood cells. Sharks, which arose \r\napproximately 450 million years ago, like humans have immunoglobulins (also \r\ntermed antibodies), T-cell receptors (TCRs), major histocompatability \r\nantigens (MHC), and recombination activating genes (RAGs) that are required \r\nto allow rearrangement of the gene segments making up the antibodies and \r\nT-cell receptors. The project will address both conserved and unique \r\nfeatures of the combinatorial system of carcharhine sharks to elucidate the \r\nmolecular underpinning of combinatorial immunity as it is expressed in all \r\nvertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe project includes three major areas of focus: The first is the complete \r\ncharacterization of the shark RAG locus with emphasis upon its evolutionary \r\nemergence and functional similarities and differences to the molecular \r\nhomologs found in mammals and other higher vertebrates. The second major \r\narea of concentration is the characterization of the genes specifying the \r\nalpha/beta and gamma/delta T-cell receptors of carcharhine sharks including \r\ntheir diversity and gene organization, and the construction of recombinant \r\nsingle chain TCRs for functional and structural analyses. Because of the \r\npronounced differences in organization of shark and mammalian antibody gene \r\nsegments, it is crucial to determine the arrangement of shark TCR genes. \r\nThe third aim tests the generality of clonal selection theory by \r\ndetermining whether sharks which have a cassette organization of antibody \r\ngene as opposed to translocons of higher vertebrates show clonal \r\nrestriction in their antibody forming lymphocytes. These studies are \r\ndirected towards applying molecular and protein chemical technologies to \r\nobtain precise answers to fundamental problems of the system as it obtains \r\nin all vertebrates, with implications for defense against invading \r\npathogens, cancers and immunological dysfunction in autoimmunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
