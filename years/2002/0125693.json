 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lunar and Planetary Institute will expand a successful pilot program in which libraries in Texas and Louisiana are used as community learning centers.  The program is two-fold and includes both \"Explore!\" resource materials and \"Fun with Science\" modules.  \"Explore!\" materials are a collection of space science posters, brochures, fact sheets, videotapes and references.  These resources are disseminated to librarians for use as part of their collections and to support the \"Fun with Science\" modules.  \"Fun with Science\" consists of eight space science modules that librarians are trained to use in after-school and summer youth programs.  Module topics include rocketry, comets, impact cratering, remote sensing and space capsule design.  Each year, 3-4 new modules will be produced.  Librarians receive training on content, activities and NASA resources in 2-3 day sessions.  The dissemination plan would enable the program to expand to include public libraries in Texas, Illinois (Chicago) and South Carolina, as well as school libraries as a secondary audience.  Rural sites will be targeted and distance learning will be used for training when possible.  CD ROMs containing the modules, training videos and a website will be developed to support this project.  \r\n\r\n",
