 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThis project builds upon the successful regional Shodor Computational Science Institute\r\n(SCSI) to create a National Computational Science Institute (NCSI). Reaching more than\r\n1000 undergraduate faculty per year for three years, NCSI offers a proven, modular set\r\nof in-person, video-conferenced, and web-accessible workshops, seminars, and support\r\nactivities to introduce the hands-on use of computational science, numerical models and\r\ndata visualization tools across the undergraduate curriculum. This project represents a \r\npartnership with the Education, Outreach and Training Partnership for Advanced\r\nComputational Infrastructure, the National Computational Science Education Consortium,\r\nthe Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and more than two dozen undergraduate institutions, high\r\nperformance computing centers and vendors. \r\n\r\nThe target audience for NCSI is teams of faculty from predominantly undergraduate\r\ninstitutions, minority serving institutions, and community colleges whose students are\r\neither the next generation of scientists and engineers, the next generation of K-12 teachers,\r\nor both. NCSI participants then assist other faculty on their own campuses and at neighboring\r\ninstitutions to introduce computational science in their own classes. \r\n\r\nThe main work of NCSI is accomplished through three synergistic but distinct efforts that\r\ncan be modeled as PULL, PUSH, and PERMEATE. Regionally distributed workshops PULL \r\nfaculty within a reasonable travel distance for a week of intense interdisciplinary training,\r\ncollaboration, and curriculum development in computational science. Participants explore\r\nthe use of modeling and visualization tools in existing courses, while stimulating creation\r\nof new courses and promoting new modes of undergraduate research. NCSI staff and\r\nparticipants proactively PUSH computational science education onto the agendas of\r\nnumerous annual meetings of professional and discipline-specific societies, by offering\r\nworkshops, conducting tutorials, presenting papers and posters, and serving on program\r\ncommittees. To sustain these efforts, NCSI PERMEATEs on-going and proposed\r\nundergraduate curriculum efforts providing interdisciplinary and discipline specific\r\nweb-accessible courses for faculty enhancement, and resources for interactive exploration\r\nincluding curriculum, problem-based modeling modules, tools, and tutorials, leveraging\r\nShodor's award-winning Computational Science Education Reference Desk. \r\n",
