 "awd_abstract_narration": "When professional mathematicians and scientists discuss the nature and\r\norigins of their own creativity, they often mention the central role\r\nplayed by visual and spatial thinking. But despite the apparent importance\r\nof visual/spatial cognition in mathematics and science education, there is\r\nstill relatively little research aimed at understanding, enhancing, and\r\nassessing spatial reasoning in math and science students. Even more, there\r\nare few efforts that seek to blend novel computational media with the\r\nsorts of spatially and mathematically rich hands-on crafting activities\r\nthat influenced and motivated earlier generations of scientists. We\r\nbelieve that progress can be made on both these fronts--on both basic\r\ncognitive research and pedagogical development--by an effort at\r\nintegration. That is: by designing playful, creative, and technologically\r\nsophisticated educational materials for exercising and enhancing spatial\r\ncognition, we can use those materials as the means to explore and\r\nunderstand fundamental issues in spatial cognition as well.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this project, then, we plan to:\r\n\r\n* Characterize the nature of spatial expertise in the understanding of\r\nthree-dimensional forms, while creating flexible assessment techniques to\r\nmeasure development of that expertise;\r\n\r\n* Devise a practical spatial curriculum of materials designed to enhance\r\nand exercise spatial cognition. This curriculum will be based on a\r\ncombination of both hands-on work and creative computational papercrafting\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n* Extend our current software research environments (HyperGami and\r\nJavaGami) to incorporate online spatial advisors that assist students in\r\nreflecting upon, understanding, playing with, and interpreting\r\nthree-dimensional polyhedral forms; and\r\n\r\n* Create new software to explore both traditional and novel realms of\r\nmathematical papercrafting, such as pop-ups, flexagons, anamorphic art,\r\nand surface models. In exploring these areas, we seek to expand the\r\nlandscape of traditional mathematical papercrafts by exploiting the\r\ncreative potential of computational media.\r\n\r\n",
