 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nAerosol science and engineering (ASE) has \"applications in several fields ranging from environmental engineering, public health, medical sciences, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, and materials science\". The National Science and Technology Council lists ASE as one of the \"Inherently Interdisciplinary\" areas. ASE is also linked to the National Nanotechnology Initiative. However, teaching of the subject matter has been primarily restricted to graduate level resulting in shortage of professionals in this field. To ensure further development in this area and to explore its true potential, it is essential that the subject be introduced in a broader manner at undergraduate level. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to develop integrated and interactive aerosol dynamics computer programs to enhance the understanding of aerosol science and engineering (ASE). To achieve this objective, three stand alone modules are going to be developed to be included in courses that cover aerosol topics, i.e. ENV 4121 Air Pollution Control Design, ChE 368 Transport Phenomena, and the dual level course ENV 518 Aerosol Science and Engineering. These modules are going to consist of (1) Cyclone for particulate control, (2) Optical Particle Counter for particle size characterization, and (3) Respiratory Deposition. \r\n\r\nCD-ROMs are going to be prepared and disseminated utilizing the network of American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR). Formative and summative evaluations are going to be conducted in addition to the pilot evaluations in several aerosol related undergraduate classes. Full development is going to be designed based on the feedback obtained from the current project.\r\n",
