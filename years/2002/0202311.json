 "awd_abstract_narration": "Del Mar College, a South Texas Hispanic-serving community college, in partnership with Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, a four year Hispanic Serving Institution, is creating the Access to Teacher Preparation at Del Mar College (ACCESS-TP). The project is increasing the number of students majoring and transferring across to four-year institutions as middle and high school Career and Technology, mathematics, and science preservice teachers. A special emphasis of the project is on those programs which mirror the modern workplace, such as computer science/CISCO academies; GIS; electronics; engineering technology; health sciences; biotechnology; or aviation technology. \r\n\r\nACCESS-TP goals and objectives include: \r\n(1) Recruit and retain Del Mar College students into technology, mathematics, and science teaching fields; \r\n(2) Give ACCESS-TP preservice teachers an understanding of teaching and modern workplace applications of Career and Technology, mathematics, and science; and\r\n(3) Position participants in the program to transfer to a four-year preservice teacher degree program.\r\n\r\nThe ACCESS-TP project is recruiting students majoring in technology, mathematics, and science into preservice teacher degree paths. Retention of participants in teaching fields and student support for academic success include mentoring and tutoring by peers and mentoring by in-service teachers. The Teaching and Learning Center provides additional support for ACCESS-TP preservice teachers. The inservice teachers who provide mentoring are former participants in the Applied Connections program, through which they created instructional materials that infuse modern workplace applications into instruction. The ACCESS-TP student participants see first-hand how these materials are used in the classroom. This project leverages other projects that focus on teacher preparation and the underserved population of South Texas.",
