 "awd_abstract_narration": "A first-order feature of the Tibetan Plateau is its triangular geometry on map view with its\r\nnorth-south width increasing from ~500 km in the west to >1500 km in the east. This asymmetry\r\nhas been explained by either eastward extrusion of Tibet or partitioning of north-south shortening\r\nin the Tian Shan and northern Tibet across the strong Tarim block. To quantify the role of lateral\r\nextrusion in accommodating intracontinental deformation during the Indo-Asian collision, we\r\nmust know the timing and magnitude of slip along major Cenozoic strike-slip faults in Asia. This\r\ngoal may be achieved by examining the termination structures of the strike-slip faults where their\r\nmotion is transferred to dip-slip structures. In this proposal, we plan to investigate the temporal\r\nand spatial evolution of one of such structures: the 220-km long, north-trending Kongur Shan\r\nextensional system in the eastern Pamirs. In the lateral-extrusion model, the Kongur Shan\r\nextensional system is the northern termination of the ~1000-km long right-slip Karakorum fault,\r\nwhich is thought to have assisted Tibet to extrude hundreds of kilometers eastward. Because the\r\nsouthern end of the Kongur Shan system is assumed to link with the right-slip Karakorum fault,\r\nthe extrusion model requires that the extensional system has progressively lengthened northward\r\nand its total magnitude of extension decreases from south to north. Alternatively, the oroclinal-bending\r\nmodel suggests that the development of the north-trending Kongur Shan system may\r\nhave been related to pure bending of the Pamir-Nanga Parbat syntaxis system during Cenozoic\r\nnorthward indentation of the Pamir promontory. This hypothesis not only explains coeval east-west\r\nextension in the Pamirs and east-west contraction in the Nanga Parbat region in the western\r\nHimalayan orogen, but also predicts specifically that the Kongur Shan extensional system should\r\nhave lengthened progressively southward and its total magnitude of extension decreases along\r\nstrike to the south. The distinctive predictions regarding the extensional-magnitude distribution\r\nand propagation direction of the Kongur Shan extensional system by the two competing models\r\nform the basis of this proposal. We plan to conduct field mapping across the extensional system\r\nin four different transects, each is about 20-40 km wide, which will allow us to construct a series\r\nof cross sections for estimating the magnitude of extension along individual segment of the\r\nsystem. Field mapping will focus on the question of whether the Kongur Shan extensional\r\nsystem is actually linked with the Karakorum fault. We will integrate field mapping with\r\nthermobarometric, 40 Ar/39 Ar thermochronologic, and U-Th-Pb ion-microprobe geochronologic\r\nanalyses to constrain the P-T-t paths for both the hangingwall and footwall of the extensional\r\nsystem. The results of this study will provide two important constraints on the tectonics of the\r\nwestern Himalayan orogen: (1) the timing and magnitude of eastward extrusion of Tibet, and (2)\r\nthe dynamic cause for the initiation and development of coeval east-west extension and\r\ncontraction in the western syntaxis system.",
