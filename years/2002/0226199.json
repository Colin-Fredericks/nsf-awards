 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating the Earth Exploration Toolbook (EET), a collection of step-by-step examples, called chapters, to guide educators at both the pre-college and college levels on how to use, in an educational context, various Earth system tools and datasets that were developed and archived by and for scientists. The examples provide the educators with enough experience with and in-depth knowledge of these resources to be able to use them in other contexts, and to help their students use them to explore and investigate issues in Earth system science. Use of the EET is being promoted through teacher workshops and presentations at professional meetings. The EET is a Web site housed at the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) at Carleton College. The EET is accessible from the DLESE Community Center Web site. The EET is integrated into DLESE, with the EET Web site, each of the EET chapters, and the associated resources being cataloged in DLESE. A search within the DLESE Discovery System brings up both the chapter and the resources used, facilitating an educator's use of those resources. In addition, the review process is using the DLESE Community Review System. Entry to the DLESE Community Review System appears in each EET chapter, facilitating educator input after testing and eventual acceptance of the EET chapter into the DLESE Reviewed Collection. In addition to developing the EET chapters, the EET team is also developing a template that serves to facilitate the contribution of additional EET chapters by members of the DLESE community, and ensure the growth of the EET after the conclusion of this project.  Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Division of Earth Sciences in the NSF Directorate for Geosciences in recognition of the importance that this collection of Earth system datasets and tools has on K-12 teachers and undergraduate faculty.",
