 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Chemical (53)\r\nWe have developed web-based Unit Operations experiments in Chemical Engineering. To help in this effort we are adapting various elements from CCLI web based experiments from existing work started by other investigators. These include CCLI 0088788 which involved multidisciplinary instruction in environmental science done by Dr. Krehbiel and his team. We are also adapting the work of Dr. Asumadu's novel Remote Wiring and Measurement Laboratory (RwmLab) CCLI 0088361. This project demonstrates how students can wire up physical electrical and electronics circuits and perform real measurements through internet access. Finally we are also using some of Dr. Kamangar's project, CCLI 9950697, where students implement a suitable hardware/ software environment for multi-platform computer-based monitor and control of the environment. We have developed two Internet-based Chemical Engineering Unit Operations experiments. The first is a non-isothermal fixed-bed adsorption remote controlled experiment as well as a dialysis unit operations experiment. For Internet-based laboratories to be successful, they must be effective learning experiences. Our plan has been to study the effectiveness of these on-line experiments relative to a hands-on experience. Building on our work and that of other researchers we hope to encourage other faculty to use of the Internet to deliver laboratory experiences. Our model, if emulated, would allow faculty to develop high quality experiments in their area of expertise and share them with the engineering community. In addition to this significant pedagogical benefit, the use of Internet-based laboratories offers the potential to reduce laboratory costs while simultaneously increasing the number of laboratories available to students. \r\n\r\nThe University of Toledo Chemical and Environmental Engineering Department and The University of Cincinnati Chemical Engineering Department are committed to maintaining the experiments along with existing Unit Operations experiments. Finally, upon successful completion of our project, we will pursue a larger effort to develop Internet-based laboratories with all of the Chemical Engineering Departments in the State of Ohio.\r\n",
