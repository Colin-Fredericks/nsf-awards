 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation RUI grant supports the acquisition of an OMICRON Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) Variable Temperature Scanning Tunneling/Atomic Force Microscope (VT- STM/AFM) and surface analysis chamber. The VT-STM/AFM, which includes an integral single cell evaporator, and the analysis chamber will complement the current array of surface spectroscopic and diffraction probes available by adding the capability to directly image structures at the atomic/nano-scale in situ during formation. The MBE source will provide epitaxial growth capabilities for ultrathin film and nanostructure fabrication. Currently available UHV sample preparation instrumentation will be integrated into the acquired analysis chamber. Through an in situ transfer mechanism samples will be transferred between the STM/AFM and analysis chambers for optimum surface preparation, imaging, and characterization. The research program will uniquely impact undergraduate education in a very significant way through a highly effective undergraduate involvement in research. The acquisition of the VT- STM/AFM will make it possible for this program to become a nationally recognized model for undergraduate materials science education.\r\n\r\nWith this experimental capability several fundamental and applied research activities will be pursued: investigations involving fabrication and chemical characterization of thin nitride films for use as a gate insulator in ULSI transistors, correlation of conductance measurements of ultrathin films with atomic-scale morphology, atomistic studies of mechanisms of interlayer diffusion in homo- and heteroepitaxial systems, studies of thin semiconductor alloy film formation as a result of electron and photon driven processes, and investigations of the role of Nb on oxidation processes of TiAlNb alloys. Also, collaborations with industrial partners will be established to efficiently convert fundamental research results into practical technological applications and provide undergraduate students with excellent work related training in applied science. \r\n\r\n",
