 "awd_abstract_narration": "CSTB will convene an expert committee to conduct a comprehensive assessment of  wireless  technology  and  application  trends  and  their  implications  for  spectrum  management  and  policy.    The committee will seek  broad  input  and  produce  a  report  with  consensus  findings  and  recommendations.    This project will be grounded in technical expertise but examine the interplay among technical, economic, and policy issues.    \r\n\r\nThe committee will deliver a  final  report  18  months  from  its  first  meeting  that  would provide analysis, conclusions, and recommendations based on input gathered  during the study and committee expertise and deliberations.  The final report will be subject to NRC review procedures and would be prepared in sufficient quantity to ensure its distribution to the sponsors and other relevant parties in accordance with NRC policy.  The report will be made available to the public without restriction.  It will be posted on the World Wide  Web  as  well  as  distributed  in  printed  form.   Briefings to key people in government, industry, academia and the nonprofit sector are anticipated.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project will flow from its examination of an arena for  research--wireless  communications--that  is  poised  for  growth.    It  will  characterize  trends and illuminate opportunities for new R&D activity.  Because the project will  relate  technical  possibilities  to  economic  concerns  and  legal/regulatory  options,  it  will also speak to opportunities for social science research.  The broader impacts of  the  project  will  also  derive  from  its  interdisciplinary  character.    The  project  will  leverage  the  technical  insight  of  the  committee  and  its  analysis  to  improve  the  quality of policy analysis in the wireless arena (spectrum management and related  policy), which will affect the public.s ability to benefit from wireless innovations and  economic  competitiveness  associated  with  production  and  uses  of  wireless  technologies.  \r\n\r\n \r\n",
