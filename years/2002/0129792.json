 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Michener at University of New Mexico to develop the informatics framework that can facilitate storage, discovery, and access to the strategic environmental information resources that are collectively held at North American biological field stations.  Project objectives will be accomplished through two integrated networking activities: (1) a research focus that encompasses five inter-related resource discovery components and (2) an intensive training component that provides field station personnel with a solid foundation in the computational and informatics skills that are critical for developing, archiving, managing, and communicating data and information resources.  In so doing, communication, discovery and exchange of data and information will be facilitated among scientists and students, integration and synthesis in field biology will be enabled, and the incipient value of the enormous data resources at biological field stations can begin to be realized.\r\n\r\nResearch activities include the development of five databases that will support discovery of biological data and information resources at field stations.  In particular, the research team will: (1) establish a North American Field Station Data Registry and Repository; (2) initiate a Thesaurus for Field Biology; (3) develop a Site Characteristics Database for North American Field Stations; (4) create a Bibliography of North American Field Station Publications; and (5) develop a WWW-accessible Database of Field Station QA/QC and Standard Methods.  The team of investigators will coordinate development of the databases in conjunction with representatives of the Organization of Biological Field Stations, who comprise the project steering committee.  In addition, the investigative team will coordinate the development of educational activities for field station personnel.  These field station personnel will also contribute to database development activities.  Education will principally focus on annual intensive (2-week) training workshops in ecological informatics that are developed around a series of course modules.  Where appropriate, training modules will be made available on a web site to broaden the potential audience throughout the community of potential users.\r\n\r\nBiological field stations represent the premier facilities in North America where the most pressing environmental challenges facing science and society can be directly confronted and understood through research and education. These challenges include maintenance of biodiversity, ecological sustainability, environmental forecasting, restoration and rehabilitation of damaged ecosystems, the outbreak and spread of diseases and control of invasive species. Research Coordination Network activities supported in this project will enable discovery of the critical information resources that are held at biological field stations.  These resources will facilitate synthesis in ecology-leading to a better understanding of our natural environment, sound natural resources management, and a more sustainable quality of life.  The project management plan and the composition of the core research team and steering committee are designed to benefit the largest possible number of biological field stations in North America and their associated field biologists and students, to amplify research results to the international community, to promote an interdisciplinary perspective in field biology, and to enhance workforce diversity.\r\n",
