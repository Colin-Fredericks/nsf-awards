Held in conjunction with the annual meeting of the German Society of Glass Technology, the workshop will be sponsored jointly by the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Glass Research, The New York State Center for Advanced Ceramic Technology, both located at the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, and the Research Association of the German Glass Industry, Germany.  \r\n\r\nHeld over a two-day period, the workshop will conclude with a panel discussion of important recent developments in the field of photonics and optical glasses.  A major goal of the workshop is to convene glassmakers and glass users engaged in research, development or manufacture of photonic devices and to provide a forum in which both groups can learn the needs and capabilities of each other.\r\n",
