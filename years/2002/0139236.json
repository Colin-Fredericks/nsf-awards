It attracts \r\ntypically 400 mathematicians and other scientists working in theoretical \r\naspects of systems theory. The symposium is interdisciplinary and attracts \r\nmathematicians, engineers and researchers working in all aspects of \r\nsystems theory. Mathematical methods which play a role in the areas \r\nmentioned above stem from a broad range of fields of pure and applied \r\nmathematics, including ordinary and partial differential equations, real and \r\ncomplex analysis, numerical analysis, probability theory and stochastic \r\nanalysis, operator theory, linear and commutative algebra as well as \r\nalgebraic and differential geometry.\r\n \r\nIn August 2002 the MTNS symposium will be held on the campus of the \r\nUniversity of Notre Dame.  Travel support will be provided by this award \r\nfor approximately twenty new researchers (graduate students and recent \r\ndoctoral recipients) and 2-3 international researchers needing special \r\nassistance to attend this conference. The symposium program will include \r\nplenary lectures, special topic invited lectures, mini-symposia, mini-\r\ncourses, special topic sessions and contributed papers. The symposium \r\nwill cover serious mathematical issues as well as some important applied \r\nareas. Several broad application areas were selected: (1) Systems theoretic \r\nquestions in biology, (2) Applications in the area of telecommunications, \r\n(3) Computational questions arising in control and systems theory and (4) \r\nSystems theoretic questions in the area of mathematical finance. In each of \r\nthese important application areas 2-3 established researchers were asked to \r\norganize a \"Mini-symposium\". This is a sub-symposium which typically \r\nconsists of a sequence of tutorial lectures as well as a sequence of invited \r\nsessions each consisting of 4 research papers. The organizers had these \r\nareas of research in mind at the time the plenary speakers and the special \r\ntopics speaker were selected.\r\n",
