 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT.  An interdisciplinary team will investigate the use of DNA as a programmable scaffolding upon which nanocomponents precisely self-assemble as  a possible basis for an electronic circuit manufacturing technology.  Rather than using the techniques of current semiconductor chip manufacturing, in which features are written onto the structure by a lithographic process, this approach will exploit programmed Watson-Crick base-pairing for precision assembly limited only by the 0.34 nanometer nucleotide separation.  The research activities in this proposal are focused on 1) Design, synthesis, and assembly of 2D DNA crystal scaffolding for the self-assembly of arrays of closely spaced Au-nanoparticles, 2) Design and synthesis of Au-DNA conjugates optimized for electron tunneling properties and for high-yield assembly to 2D DNA crystals, 3) Characterization of electronic transport properties of the DNA-assembled Au-nanoparticle arrays to establish the suitability of the DNA scaffolding, tethers, and other structural elements for use as passive host scaffolding for electronic nanocomponents.   \r\n\r\nThis study will address basic scientific and engineering challenges in the development of DNA nanotechnology for the precise assembly of components for nanoelectronics and other applications, such as nanorobotics  and  nanomaterials.  It will systematically explore basic chemical, physical, and electronic issues related  to  nanoparticle/DNA design, chemical compatibility, assembly methods,  electrostatic  interactions,  electronic  transport,  and  interactions  with  surfaces,  among  others.  The study will stimulate interactions among a highly interdisciplinary team of experts representing the fields of   Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Electrical & Computer Engineering.  This project  will  contribute  to  educational  and  human resource development by supporting three Ph.D. students.   We also expect to involve several M.S. level students in this work and provide research opportunities for undergraduate students through existing directed studies and internship programs at the University of Minnesota.  It will help to establish relationships between the University of Minnesota and New York University, as well as with industry through the interactions with Nanoprobes Inc.  Finally, this project will enhance the infrastructure for nanoscience research at the University of Minnesota by providing funding for the unique nanoscale electronic characterization system to be used in these studies. \r\n  \r\n",
