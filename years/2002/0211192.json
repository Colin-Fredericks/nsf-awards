The symposium will focus on current problems in three areas: rational mechanics, continuum thermodynamics, and kinetic theory, as they are practiced today in the spirit of the late Clifford Truesdell. The objectives of the symposium are\r\n\r\n   (1) highlight recent advances in the three topic areas;\r\n\r\n   (2) provide the opportunity for communication and collaboration between senior and junior investigators;\r\n\r\n   (3) educate young researchers and advanced graduate students and expose them to the forefronts of current research; and\r\n \r\n   (4) shape new directions of research among investigators who value an emphasis on foundations, structure, and logical implications.\r\n\r\nThe \"Journal of Elasticity and the Physical Science of Solids\" has dedicated a special volume to the papers of the symposium.  The publication of a hard-cover book is also planned.  Details about the symposium can be found on the web at http://www.ms.uky.edu/~mcsxyh/ctsymp.htm.\r\n\t\r\n",
