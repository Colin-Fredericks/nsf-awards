 "awd_abstract_narration": "The South Carolina Advanced Technological Education (SC ATE) Center of Excellence is a statewide systemic initiative designed to increase the quantity, quality, and diversity of engineering technology graduates throughout the state's 16 technical colleges.  An integrated, problem-based curriculum, collaborative teaching strategies, and extensive active learning techniques together with faculty and student teamwork form the cornerstone of the SC ATE's strategy to recruit, retain, and graduate more students in engineering technology programs.\r\n\r\nSC ATE has achieved critical milestones on the road to designing and implementing a model of faculty development, program improvement, and curriculum reform. The key to SC ATE success continues to be reform-ready faculty acting as change agents for development and delivery of innovative engineering technology curriculum and promoting program improvement.  SC ATE's critical lesson learned is the proven effectiveness of exemplary faculty leading grassroots reform.\r\n\r\nThe Center has identified four critical success factors (essential accomplishments) that is guiding its work:  \r\n\r\n(a) continuing development of pre-engineering technology and first-year engineering technology curricula; \r\n(b)  faculty development that supports the most effective teaching methodologies and creates learning environments that model the workplace;\r\n(c)  recruitment and retention of students, particularly women and minorities; and\r\n(d)  development of a statewide model to create a seamless pipeline for educational opportunities for students to become well-qualified engineering technology graduates.\r\n\r\n",
