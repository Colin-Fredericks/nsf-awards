 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Indiana nuclear physics group plans  to assume a leading role in the\r\ninvestigation of the following critical questions in nuclear physics.\r\nThe spin of the proton is an essential property that determines the\r\nstructure of matter, yet we know that only a small part of the spin\r\ncomes from the three quarks that form the proton.  The STAR-SPIN group\r\nwould definitively measure the contribution from the gluons, the\r\nshort-lived particles that hold the quarks together and which account\r\nfor much of its mass to see if that is where the missing spin\r\nresides.The measurement of the gluon contribution to the proton spin\r\nwill be carried out by adding  a special detector for high energy  gamma\r\nrays to the STAR detector located at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\r\nCollider.  The detector is now being built using separate NSF\r\nconstruction funds.\r\n\tThe force between pairs of neutrons and protons cannot, by itself,\r\naccount for the strength that binds the nucleus together.  New,\r\nthree-body forces are needed, but their form is almost unknown.  By\r\nmanipulating the neutron and proton spins when three of them come\r\ntogether, the PINTEX collaboration would produce a map to guide a theory\r\nof such three-body force. .  FY2002 will be the last year of data taking\r\nusing the intense beams and unique capabilities of the Indiana\r\nUniversity Cooler Facility to study these three-body forces.\r\n \tThe weak force between nucleons, which can change the form of matter, is still                         poorly understood.  By making a measurement accurate to one part in a billion on the                           formation of a deuteron from a neutron and a proton, the IU neutron group would measure                              the longest-range part of the weak force . The Indiana group would support studies of the                               weak force and other effects accessible using cold neutrons at NIST and LANSCE and by\r\nproviding crucial parts of the experimental apparatus.  \r\n \tThere is mounting evidence that neutrinos, one of the most ubiquitous\r\nparticles in the universe, may have mass, thus changing our most elegant\r\ntheories of matter and how it controls the expansion of the universe. \r\nThe neutrino group would check a recent observation from LANL of a few\r\ncases where neutrinos, because they have mass, spontaneously change from\r\none neutrino type into another by collecting a large enough data sample\r\nto settle this issue.\r\n \tA key component of the Indiana program will be the training of students\r\nto become the next generation of researchers.  This effort includes the\r\ninvolvement of post-doctoral associates in critical experimental roles,\r\nguiding the research of graduate students, involving undergraduates\r\nthrough the NSF-funded REU summer program and part-time employment, and\r\nreaching out to make the community aware of our scientific mission.\r\n\r\n",
