Characterization will be accomplished by developing a set of interdisciplinary tools (virtual functional anatomy - VFA) that will allow the accurate and precise measurement of 3D static and dynamic musculoskeletal anatomy.  Fast-PC MRI (phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging) will be be combined with high-resolution 3D musculoskeletal models to create subject-specific 3D total joint anatomy models, animated based on actual joint movements during volitional movement.  The initial focus will be on the musculoskeletal kinematics and kinetics of the knee joint while subjects extend and flex their knees.  Stress-strain properties of the patellar and quadriceps tendons along with their moment arms, strain within the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the contribution of each quadriceps muscle to the resultant extensor force will be determined.  Once developed, the modular VFA tool can be adapted to other musculoskeletal systems utilizing other sources of dynamic and/or imaging data.  \r\n\r\nThe educational component focuses on developing a mechanical engineering Master's level curriculum specializing in biomechanics, which would be based on two research-oriented courses-Imaging Technologies and Functional Movement Analysis--that would integrate the VFA produced through the research and be enhanced with web-based experimental programs.  Outreach programs designed to allow young women the opportunity to explore potential careers in science or engineering will continue to be supported.\r\n",
