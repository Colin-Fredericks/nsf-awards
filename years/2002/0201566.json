Schramm's process is believed to describe the scaling limit of\r\na variety of two-dimensional models, including the self-avoiding walk.\r\nThe pivot algorithm provides a fast method for simulating \r\nself-avoiding walks. Recently, the principal investigator has \r\nfound a new implementation of this algorithm that is as much \r\nas eighty times faster in two dimensions.\r\nThis will be used to test both the conjectured conformal invariance of \r\nthe self-avoiding walk and its equivalence with stochastic Loewner \r\nevolution. A version of the weakly self-avoiding walk in which the \r\npenalty for self-intersections decays with the length of the loop \r\nproduced by the self-intersection will be investigated by simulations and \r\nperturbative means. The second part of the project concerns \r\nexcited states in quantum spin systems. Recent work by the principal \r\ninvestigator has developed a method for studying the dispersion\r\nrelation of one quasi-particle states and interface states in one dimension. \r\nThe method is based on assuming a certain ansatz for the wave function \r\nof the states and then proving there is indeed an eigenstate of this\r\nform by a contraction mapping argument.\r\nThis method will be used to study interface states in two dimensions and \r\nthe excited states above these interface states. \r\n\r\nSelf-avoiding walks are random walks which are not allowed to visit\r\nthe same place more than once. They provide a model for linear polymers \r\nin a dilute solution. The interest in this model is, however, much broader \r\nsince it is one of the simplest models that exhibits critical phenomena and \r\nin two dimensions conformal invariance. Recently there has been \r\nan explosion of conjectures relating the self-avoiding walk and other \r\ntwo-dimensional models to a new two dimensional stochastic\r\nprocess, called stochastic Loewner evolution, introduced by Schramm.\r\nPart of the project will study many of these conjectures \r\nfor the self-avoiding walk by Monte Carlo simulations and \r\nby perturbative methods. The simulations will be done with \r\na recent implementation of the pivot algorithm by the principal investigator\r\nthat is much faster than previous implementations.\r\nThis fast algorithm will also be used to study versions of \r\nthe self-avoiding walk that are important in physical chemistry.\r\nAnother part of the project is devoted to studying the low energy excitations\r\nin a variety of quantum spin systems. These are models of the behavior\r\nof the electron spins in crystals. At low temperatures the electron\r\nspins tend to align. However, several domains may form within which \r\nthe spins are aligned, but between which the spins point in \r\nopposite directions. \r\nThe interfaces between these domains will be studied by an \r\napproach which has proved very successful for studying \r\none quasi-particle states. In particular, the nature of the excitations \r\njust above the interface states will be investigated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
