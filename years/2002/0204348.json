 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed, heterogeneous (DH) software systems are critical for\r\nthe operation of  modern, globalized organizations. \r\nLike all software, DH systems come under evolutionary\r\npressure as organizational needs evolve.  Adapting DH systems to meet \r\nchanging needs in areas such as security is challenging:\r\nCo-ordinated changes,  made in different languages, and on different\r\nplatforms must still preserve type-safety, and must not increase\r\ncomplexity and/or complicate maintenance. \r\nThis project investigates \r\nenhancements to standards-based  middleware (e.g., CORBA) \r\nto support  evolution.\r\nWe preserve and enhance the  core IDL-based heterogeneous \r\nphilosophy of middleware. First, \r\ninterface-description language (IDL),\r\nused  to model the architecture-level interfaces of \r\ncomponents, is enhanced to support\r\nmodeling of the evolutionary changes made to a DH systems. Location\r\nof changes, types and life-times of new information \r\nto be created are  all explicitly modeled in an \r\naspect-oriented style at the IDL level.   \r\nCode generation supports\r\na wide range of implementation choices to\r\nrealize these architectural change-models. All implementations\r\nare fully inter-operable.  Finally, change-models\r\nand implementations can be \"compononentized\", \r\npackaged up and added to existing systems. Like this research,\r\nour educational plans also span\r\nseveral topics areas, including functional programming,\r\nobject-orientation, and architecture. We \r\ndevelop practically-grounded pedagogy on software evolution,\r\ncomparing the varying approaches to separation of concerns in\r\nobject-orientation, higher-order polymorphism (including\r\nmonadic programming), connectors, and aspects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
