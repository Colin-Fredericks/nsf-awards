 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology - Cognitive (73)\r\nThis project is creating an interactive computer-based classroom for the teaching of core content courses in psychology. We are building on our previous success in revamping the Statistics and Research Methods courses, which now use exploratory computer exercises to encourage active, collaborative learning of fundamental concepts. In the present project, we are applying similar methods to incorporate a hands-on, research-based approach to the teaching of Developmental Psychology and Sensation and Perception. We are doing this by adapting materials developed primarily at Pennsylvania State University - Erie for use in our Developmental Psychology course. We are also adapting materials developed at the University of California - Riverside and Skidmore College to our course on Sensation and Perception. Our goals in this project are to (1) create a more interactive classroom environment in courses that in the past were often taught by lecture, (2) continue the emphasis on developing students' research skills that begins in Introductory Psychology and our Statistics/Research Methods sequence, and (3) guide students to focus on methodology as they critically evaluate scientific research findings. We are equipping a new computer laboratory/ classroom with 31 seats and software. In addition, this project includes a plan for assessing the impact of students' experiences in the interactive classroom on their mastery of course content, as well as their interest in and attitudes toward science. Upon completion of this grant, we will also encourage and assist other department faculty in the development of similar materials for other core courses within the department.",
