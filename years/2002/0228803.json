 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) provides funding for the classification of discrete-event simulation models involving complex entity interaction and the development of several sample models using commercial simulation packages.  Complex interactions are those in which the flow of the entities and the behavior of the resources are highly dependent on the system state.  Simulation models of these systems are characterized by having numerous \"user-defined\" wait states for entities.  In these models, resources can not be simply passive capacity maintenance mechanisms, but rather they must implement specific allocation logic.  There are a surprising number of seemingly straightforward models that belong to this class.  This class of systems will be characterized and documented and modeling methodologies for problems is this class will be developed.  In addition, a test suite of problems will be developed and models for these problems will be developed using several commercially available simulation software packages.  These models will be compared with each other and with hand-coded event-oriented models of the same systems.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the results of this research will provide methodologies for developing discrete-event simulation models of a class of systems involving complex entity interactions along with a suite of example models implemented in several commercially available simulation packages.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop an open-source simulation toolkit to specifically support the development of models for complex systems.  The result will be a freely available simulation software package along with significant educational materials.  Note that the goal of the toolkit is not to compete with the commercial simulation packages, but, rather, to supplement them and to provide tools to support the teaching and understanding of general simulation principles.  Actually, improving the understanding of general simulation principles will benefit the commercial packages by increasing the probability of success for simulation projects.",
