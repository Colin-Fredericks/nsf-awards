The purpose of the conference is to provide assistance to these awardees on critical issues and challenges related to educational reform in mathematics and science education and to explore effective and promising strategies to address these. \r\n\r\nThe conference has three major outcomes: (1) to provide for a deeper understanding of common critical issues and challenges in the region as systemic reform initiatives are implemented; (2) to examine current research and practices that address the selected issues and challenges, including the exploration of existing exemplary practices; and (3) to share information, concerns, and questions through effective networking with other regional reform initiatives aimed at building the awardees' capacity to address the issues and challenges.  \r\n\r\nThe two central topics for the conference arise from the growing need in the Southwest for a reliable supply of quality mathematics and science teachers.  \r\n\r\n",
