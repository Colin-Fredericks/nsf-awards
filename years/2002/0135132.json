 "awd_abstract_narration": "We plan to elucidate the mechanisms of atomic motion and its relationship with electron transfer in photon-induced ultrafast reactions of metal complexes using a new type of ultrafast x-ray absorption spectroscopy, ultrafast selected energy x-ray absorption spectroscopy (USEXAS) that is currently being developed in the PI's laboratory. This method enables us to more directly investigate the atomic motion in non-crystalline materials on the ultrafast timescale. The atomic and electronic motion in several exemplary chemical systems will be investigated. The outcome of these investigations can shed light on the structures of the critical transition states in those systems. We will build an experimental educational program for local high school students and help them understand chemical reactions at the molecular level. Our aim is to enhance students' ability to understand and appreciate physical and analytical chemistry at the most fundamental levels and at a young age. In this program, Internet-connected, remotely accessible, real-time chemical experiments (RARE) will be developed by undergraduate and graduate students at UC Davis. PI's lab will be used to train and prepare graduate students and undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding atomic motion during chemical reactions is critical to improving our ability to make new devices and materials such as solar cells, molecular electronic components, and drugs. We plan to elucidate the details of the interplay between atomic and electron motion in several important chemical systems using a new type of ultrafast x-ray absorption spectroscopy that is currently being developed in the PI's laboratory. This method allows us to visualize the motion of atoms during fast chemical reactions in a more directly manner. The educational component of this proposal involves the building of an experimental educational program for local high school students that will help them understand chemical reactions at the most fundamental levels and at a young age. The experiments are Internet-connected, remotely accessible, real-time chemical experiments (RARE) that will be developed by undergraduate and graduate students at UC Davis. \r\n",
