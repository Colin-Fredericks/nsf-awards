 "awd_abstract_narration": "The movement of population from rural towns to large centers remains one of \r\nthe most common but striking trends in human settlement.  Researchers have \r\nhad little trouble in formulating explanations for this population \r\nnucleation in market societies.  However, these market-based approaches \r\nhave proven of little utility in societies - - or segments of societies - - \r\nnot dominated by market institutions.  Because these societies were \r\ngenerally non-literate and left no written records, archaeology provides \r\nthe only means to study long-term demographic change in such societies.\r\n\r\nViviana Siveroni will investigate chronological settlement trends in a \r\nnon-market population of the prehispanic Andes in the Nasca Valley, Peru. \r\nRecent archaeological research has revealed massive regional changes \r\nbetween AD 550 and AD 950, including: (a) the abandonment of many rural \r\nhomesteads and settlements as people flocked to large centers; (b) the end \r\nof a long-standing ideology and ceremonial practice (including that \r\nassociated with the famous Nasca \"lines\"); and (c) an increase in social \r\nstratification even as political decentralization grew.  Nothing is known \r\nof the changes at the household or community levels that accompanied these \r\nbroad regional changes.  Siveroni will investigate potential changes by \r\nexcavating and comparing residential areas from a rural village (Las \r\nCarretas) dating to early in this period to those at a center dating to \r\nlate in the period (Huayuri).  Her work will explore community religious \r\npractices, social structure, and political organization, while focusing on \r\npotential shifts in economic activities.  One critical goal of the research \r\nis to explore the relationship dynamics between population nucleation and \r\nreorganization of the household economy.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this project is that Siveroni will assess several \r\ntheoretical models in which household and communal level processes are \r\nthemselves the cause of regional population nucleation.  This research thus \r\nrepresents an attempt to link levels of analysis in a new way.  Processes \r\nsuch as population nucleation must be observed and studied at the regional \r\nlevel, but their causes may reside at the sub-regional level, even the \r\nlevel of the household or individual actor. Documenting human motivations \r\nand social processes in a world not governed by rational market forces is \r\nan important contribution of this kind of explanatory archaeology; placing \r\nthis work squarely in current debates in locational geography and political \r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
