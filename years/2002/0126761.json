 "awd_abstract_narration": "Laser and computer technologies have revolutionized modern physical chemistry research over the past few decades as lasers now allow molecular processes and chemical reactions to be probed in unprecedented detail. Current research in computational chemistry provides a wealth of information related to molecular structure, energetics, and reactivity. Integrated laser experiments are being adapted and implemented into the physical chemistry laboratory sequence. Further, to bring relevance to the subject, the exercises are based on processes that are important in atmospheric chemistry. The specific exercises being adapted from the educational and research literature include studies of the reaction of oxygen atoms with propene and the reactions of hydroxyl radical with halocarbons. In the exercises, students are employing laser technology to make experimental measurements of the reactions followed by computational exercises and molecular modeling studies of the processes. These integrated laser, computational, and molecular modeling exercises merge research and teaching by utilization of the skills and research strengths of the principal investigators, specifically laser kinetics of environmentally important compounds and ab initio computational chemistry. Undergraduate students are employed to test the exercises and to provide feedback.\r\n",
