 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant cell walls play crucial roles in the development of plants, their resistance to diseases, and communication between cells.  A fundamental understanding of cell wall biosynthesis has potential practical applications, including the development of crops plants better able to fend off pathogens and of plants that provide enhanced nutritional attributes or new polymer products for various industrial uses. This project is aimed at understanding how hemicellulosic polysaccharides, a particular class of polymers found in plant cell walls, are synthesized.  Cell wall biosynthesis requires hundreds of enzymes, but only a few of these proteins and the genes that encode them have been identified and characterized.  Through strategies employing the tools of genomics, proteomics and bioinformatics, the principal investigators will identify candidate genes involved in the synthesis of plant cell walls and evaluate their function.  The studies will be conducted in three plant systems: cotton fiber cells during a period of development in which large quantities of primary cell wall components are manufactured; developing nasturtium seeds that store large quantities of xyloglucan, a major cell wall component; and rice tissues undergoing rapid growth.  Rice is chosen as one of the plant systems because the recent completion of the rice genome sequence will aid in matching the proteins linked to cell wall biosynthesis with their respective gene sequences.  The principal investigators expect to identify genes involved in many aspects of cell wall biosynthesis and will make their results and resources freely available to researchers in the plant biology community.  The project will provide valuable training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral research associates.  It will also provide summer laboratory experiences for underrepresented students.",
