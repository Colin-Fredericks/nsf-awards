For a few decades now, moduli spaces of vector bundles\r\nover curves have been prominent in mathematical physics.  A few \r\ninterrelated open problems are the object of this research.  \r\nIn projective space, models of moduli of vector bundles still don't have \r\nexplicit description, by equations or by classification.  The generalized \r\ntheta functions (sections of higher-rank vector bundles) are not developed \r\nto the point that one can describe flows of completely integrable \r\nhierarchies or perform the necessary calculations of quantum field theory\r\n(partition function, e.g.)  Finally, flows of commutative rings \r\nof partial differential operators (generalized KP flows) have not been \r\ndescribed explicitly.  In the proposed work: on the projective-geometry side, \r\nequations for moduli spaces of higher-rank bundles and dimensions of \r\nBrill-Noether loci will be calculated by methods of representation theory \r\nand correspondences between Grassmannians.  On the analytic side, \r\ndifferential equations for the Kleinian functions (which generalize the \r\nWeierstrass p-function) will be derived and applied  to integrate new \r\nHamiltonian systems and the generalized KP flows. A theme that runs through \r\nthe proposed research is the classical problem of reduction: Weierstrass' students \r\nKoenigsberger and Kowalevski, respectively, characterized the abelian integrals \r\nof genus 2, 3 respectively, that reduce with \"multiplicity\" 2 to an \r\nelliptic integral; since then, very little was found in general \r\n(e.g., higher genus or multiplicity).  Progress on this problem \r\nis now under way, partly due to results that revisit the Kleinian\r\nfunctions, and partly to the aid of computer algebra.  The problem  of reduction is linked \r\nwith the problem of curves with automorphisms, and the project includes applications of \r\nthe results to differential Galois theory, monodromy of ordinary differential equations, \r\nand decoding algorithms for algebraic (Goppa) codes. \r\n  \r\n\r\nElliptic functions have an \"unreasonable effectiveness\",to borrow E.P. Wigner's phrase.  \r\nThey occur when modeling harmonic oscillators, shooting billiards, measuring the \r\namplitude of ocean waves, computing the partition functions of quantum field theory.  \r\nThe word \"elliptic\" refers to the number of periods of the functions \r\n(one over the real, two over the complex numbers). Theta functions are the multi-periodic \r\nanalog of elliptic functions. Although Old Masters such as Klein,  H.F. Baker and O. Bolza,\r\nobtained equations for genus-2 (4 complex periods) theta functions, most \r\nproperties of theta functions are still inexplicit, including their dependence on the \r\nperiod lattice.  New impetus in the study of such functions came from the theory of \r\nintegrable PDEs, such as the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, and the attendant\r\nalgebraically completely integrable systems that have been intensively studied since the \r\n1970s.  This project will combine projective geometry and differential algebra to identify \r\ndifferential equations satisfied by the (Kleinian) theta functions, and apply them to \r\nfind exact solutions of Hamiltonian systems and non-linear PDEs.\r\nAt the same time the project will pursue the other major, \r\n\"non-abelian\" generalization of theta functions, by embedding moduli spaces into projective \r\nspace.  Theta functions that can be reduced to expressions in elliptic functions will be \r\ncharacterized geometrically and used in effective decoding algorithms.\r\n\r\n",
