 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses one-dimensional nanostructures on silicon surfaces extending prior re-search to the reactivity of 1-D templates with oxygen and atomic hydrogen, and the growth of various metals on Si. It is anticipated that fundamental studies of these nanostructures will enable possible applications in devices, diffraction gratings, or as growth templates. This proposed work includes the following: Reactivity studies of noble metal-induced 1-D nanostructures grown on high-index Si. Based on previous work, noble metal-induced 1-D arrays can be produced by de-positing Ag or Au on high-index Si surfaces oriented at or near Si(5 5 12). Using STM, the reac-tivity of these 1-D arrays to oxygen will be investigated for O2 exposure under both oxidation and etching conditions. The project also includes studies on preferential etching of 1-D arrays using atomic hydrogen to enhance vertical surface corrugation. Growth studies of other groups of metals on Si(5 5 12) includes the growth of metals such as Fe and the rare earths (Dy, Ho, Er), and will be studied as a function of coverage and temperature on high-index surfaces near (5 5 12). The rare earth metals have recently been found to form robust nanowires on Si(001) and may demonstrate interesting growth on the high-index templates as well. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of electronic/photonic materi-als science having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong em-phasis on education, and the integration of research and education. This research will have a sub-stantial educational impact on VCU's relatively small physics department. The PI places empha-sis on involving undergraduates in research. A majority of the M.S. graduate students are trained in the PI's surface science group in order to gain skills necessary to either enter industry or to continue with a Ph.D. degree. It is anticipated that a number of students will be involved in this work over its duration, including a full-time Ph.D. student (Chemical Physics), three or four M.S. students, and a several undergraduates.   \r\n***    \r\n",
