 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geophysical Field Research and Training Program\r\n\r\nThe proposed Geophysical Field Research and Training Program has two complementary objectives. The first is to broaden the geophysical science training facility to include field\r\nequipment for geophysical surveying. Students will participate in design and\r\nacquisition of geophysical surveys using sophisticated equipment, and in the collection of field data using a variety of geophysical methods. The purchase of geophysical equipment will strengthen the University's research and educational infrastructure in geosciences, and help faculty secure future funding for both academic and research projects. Geophysical field research and training will produce data and analysis that can be used as resources for both research and innovative course/curriculum development, hence having potential of improving faculty research productivity and providing students with a responsive learning environment. The second objective is  the complete geophysical characterization of a selected field site that will serve as a test case for seismic physical modeling and for computational modeling. It is anticipated that students coming through the proposed summer geophysical field research training program will be well equipped with knowledge and skills to conduct near-surface geophysical surveys using a variety of geophysical methods, hence broadening career paths for persons from underrepresented groups in the environmental, geotechnical, and engineering fields.\r\n",
