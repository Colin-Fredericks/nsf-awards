 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nClaflin University, the oldest Historically Black College & University in the state of South Carolina will implement the project entitled: \"Programs for the Retention and Enrichment of Science, Engineering and Mathematics Students\" (PRESEMs). This five-year project consists of a comprehensive approach to strengthen Claflin University's undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research infrastructure with the goal of broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM disciplines and workforce.  \r\n\r\nPRESEMs will focus on approaches that enhance student learning in STEM, such as peer-led instruction, problem-based learning, and a research-based curriculum. Aggressively recruiting students, offering effective pre-college outreach and summer enrichment programs, implementing programs to increase successful completion of gate-keeper courses, enhancing undergraduate STEM curricula by modernizing instrumentation, laboratories and classrooms, utilizing undergraduate research as a teaching tool - these are the strategies required to bring about institutional reform while preparing students for graduate study and successful careers in STEM fields.\r\n",
