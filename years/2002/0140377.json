 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental aspect of quantum phenomena is the non-local coherence of the\r\nquantum wave that describes the state of a particle, which is called the\r\nwave-particle duality. A consequence of this is the Heisenberg uncertainty\r\nprinciple according to which there is a minimum to the product of the\r\nuncertainties of the position and momentum or time and energy of the particle\r\nthat is given by the Planck's constant. We plan to investigate the latter\r\nuncertainty principle in relation to the general relativistic gravitational\r\nfield, using our earlier work that obtains this uncertainty relation using only\r\nmeasurements intrinsic to the system under investigation. We shall also use new\r\nnon-local quantities that we have introduced, called modular variables, to study\r\nthe non-local quantum coherence of the wave function. This will be used to\r\ninvestigate the Aharonov-Bohm effect (discovered by the PI), which is the\r\nnon-local interaction of the wave function with the electromagnetic field. Some\r\nnew aspects of scattering due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect will be studied. The\r\nlatter work is relevant to a wide class of problems involving surface waves and\r\npolarized light propagating in optical fibers, where various impurities may be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe quantum coherence of the wave function also opens up the possibilities for\r\nsecure communication using quantum systems and the construction of a quantum\r\ncomputer. Computations which would take a present state-of-the-art computer more\r\nthan the life-time of the universe to do would be done in less than a second by\r\na quantum computer. We shall try to use the weak measurement, discovered by the\r\nPI, to obtain better quantum communication. We shall also try to use the geometric phase discovered by the PI and a co-PI towards constructing a quantumcomputer.\r\n\r\n",
