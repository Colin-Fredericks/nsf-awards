DMS-0201443\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\n    The first part of this proposal is to study the dynamics and the\r\nstability of topological singularities in several concrete cases including\r\n:magnetic vortices in the Landau-Lefschitz equations(Schrodinger and wave\r\nmaps coupled with magnetic fields),vortices and vortex rings in the trapped\r\ndilute Bose-Einstein condensates(certain nonlinear Schrodinger systems\r\ncoupled with potentials).The second part of the proposal is concerned with\r\ntopological singularities of Sobolev mappings.We shall examine the effects\r\nof singularities  on the denisity of smooth maps,the topology of mapping\r\nspaces,the regularity and singularity of various energy minimizers.Of\r\nparticular interest is the global structures of singular sets and asymptotic \r\nbehavior of energy minimizers near such topological singularities.\r\n   Many interesting natural phenomena contain some sort singular behavior\r\nand they are often manifiested through energy concentrations.Singularities\r\nof solutions of partial differential equations which describe these\r\nphenomena are,therefore,an important part of facets.We propose here to\r\nestablish a rigourous mathematical theory concerning  probabilly a most\r\nimportant class of such singularities ,topological singularity.Topological\r\nsingularities arise in many physical problems and have been an important\r\nsubject of much study over past many years.Among known examples are\r\nmagnetic bubbles in a fereomagnetic(or anti-ferromagnetic)continuum,vortices  \r\nin Bose-Einstein condensates and superconductivity,topological defects in\r\nliquid crystals,as well as skyrminors,monopoles and instantons which are\r\nparticle like solutions in generic models of high energy physics.These\r\nsingularities not only carry definite topological informations but also\r\nquantified amount of energies.Because of this they are often more\r\nobservable and stable energitically and dynamically.Thus a rigourous\r\nmathematical theory for such singularity would be not only mathematically\r\nchallenging and interesting but also of fundamental importance in sciences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
