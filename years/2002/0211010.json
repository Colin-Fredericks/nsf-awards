 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species that are believed to play the same functional role in ecosystems are often placed in\r\nfunctional groups, types or guilds, and redundancy of ecological function is predicted to be highest\r\nwithin such groups. The concept of functional groups composed of interchangeable, redundant\r\nspecies is appealing because it simplifies the study and management of ecological systems.\r\nHowever, there are problems limiting the applicability of this concept. The degree of redundancy\r\namong species assigned to many functional groups or guilds is unknown and we do not understand\r\nthe degree to which the functional roles of species change with environmental context. The vast\r\nmajority of our knowledge of species roles and how they are influenced by the environment comes\r\nfrom studies of short-lived, terrestrial plants. We now need to broaden our understanding of\r\nspecies roles in other equally important systems.\r\n\r\nFreshwater systems, and streams in particular, are losing biodiversity at a higher rate than\r\nterrestrial or marine systems, but few studies have examined functional redundancy in these\r\nsystems. Freshwater mussels are a functional group of long-lived, benthic, burrowing filter-feeders\r\nthat are thought to play an important role in stream ecosystem function. Within this functional\r\ngroup, the potential for redundancy in ecological roles should be high because species have similar\r\nlife histories, typically occur as speciose assemblages, and there is little evidence for differences\r\nin microhabitat or resource preferences between species. However, we have almost no quantitative\r\ninformation on either the overall importance of mussel assemblages to stream function or the roles\r\nof individual species. In recent years, many mussel populations have undergone a drastic decline.\r\nIn order to predict how this loss of both species and overall mussel biomass will impact stream\r\necosystems, we must quantify the effects of both overall mussel abundance and individual species\r\non ecosystem processes, and we must understand how these relationships may change with\r\nenvironmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will address the following questions: (1) What is the overall importance of\r\nthe mussel functional group to stream ecosystems? What ecological processes do mussels\r\nperform in streams? How do these processes relate to overall mussel abundance/biomass? (2)\r\nAre species within the mussel functional group ecologically redundant? Do mussel species vary\r\nin their performance of ecological processes? Do ecological effects of mussel species within an\r\nassemblage vary based on species composition and/or abundance? (3) How are the overall\r\nimportance of the mussel functional group and effects of species roles within the group influenced\r\nby environmental context? Are the ecological effects of the overall mussel assemblage and of\r\nindividual species constant or do they change with environmental conditions? A series of\r\ncomplementary laboratory stream and field enclosure experiments will measure the ecological\r\nfunction of single and multi-species assemblages of mussels under varying abundance and\r\nenvironmental conditions. Laboratory stream experiments will focus on ecological processes\r\nperformed by mussels (eg. filtering rates, nutrient excretion) and field enclosure experiments will\r\nexamine the effects of mussels on the rest of the benthic community. Small-scale laboratory\r\nexperiments and analyses will quantify the potential contributions (eg. nutrient excretion and\r\nbiodeposition rates) of different mussel species to streams under differing conditions, and\r\nmechanisms underlying differences in ecological function between species (eg. gill morphology,\r\nbehavior). Finally, experimental results will be combined with quantitative information from an NSF-funded mussel biodiversity inventory to make predictions about mussel functional role and\r\nredundancy in different stream systems.",
