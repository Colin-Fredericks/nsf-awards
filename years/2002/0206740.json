This study will infer the 'openness' of alpine plant-insect communities and the relative impact of biotic and abiotic factors on the evolution of interacting species. The history of alpine plant-insect communities of the Rocky Mountains will be inferred by comparative phylogeography of two specialized plant-insect associations. Phylogenies for each species will be constructed from genetic polymorphisms. Phylogenies will be compared within specialized plant-insect pairs as well as between unassociated organisms to infer the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors. Preliminary analysis suggests that specialized plant-insect pairs share a common history and that the geographic structure of genetic diversity is due to historic fragmentation of the alpine followed by post-glacial range expansion. This study will reveal the relative importance of historic abiotic and biotic interactions on the composition of alpine plant-insect communities.\r\n\r\n",
