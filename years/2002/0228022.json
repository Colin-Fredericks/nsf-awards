 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genomic and post-genomic eras of biological research have produced large quantities of information and novel genetic products that have challenged traditional means for conservation and access. Altogether, these resources may be termed \"genomic resources\" and for the most part research funding agencies require them to be publicly available to researchers.\r\n\r\nA workshop will be held with the goals of addressing the longevity, uniqueness, and utility of plant genomic resources and their curatorial status; determining strategies for their future curation, storage, and distribution; and recommending strategies for funding, infrastructure, and personnel needs. The workshop will address the common components of a genomic resource management system and determine a conceptual framework applicable to all plant genome research. This framework will provide guidance for researchers and funding agencies in developing both short- and long-term management plans for public genomic resources. Further, this framework will provide a basis for estimating financial, human, and physical needs for sustaining genomic resources.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will open with presentations to demonstrate the diversity of types of genomic resources, the current means of curation and management, the types of uses and demands for the resources, and the nature of financial support and anticipated duration. Results of two surveys conducted in advance of the Workshop will be presented. One will assess genomic resources produced by the NSF Plant Genome Research Program projects and the other will address research user expectations and needs for genomic resource access. Periods of open discussion will be held to define the components of a genomic resource management plan and determine the issues that impact them. The final product from this workshop will be a report that will provide guidance for researchers and funding agencies in developing both short- and long-term management plans for public genomic resources. Participants will represent existing genomic resource management programs, genomic projects with needs for biological resource management, and expertise with the components of biological resource management.\r\n",
