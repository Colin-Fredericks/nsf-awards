The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include the University of Central Florida (Lead Institution), University of South Florida, Florida Institute of Technology, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, City of Orlando, City of Tampa, Florida High Technology Corridor Council, Mid Florida Economic Development Commission, Museum of Science and Industry, Orange County Government, Orlando Science Center, Tampa Bay Technology Partnership, Applied Photonics, Central Florida Innovation Corporation, Central Florida Technology Partnership, Florida/NASA Incubator, Florida Business Incubator Association, Florida Photonics Cluster, Laser Institute of America, Team of Professional Internet Entrepreneurs.\r\nThe proposed goal is to develop the infrastructure in education, technology transfer, commercialization, and entrepreneurship in the technology sectors of photonics, space science, and simulation and software. \r\nThe following activities are proposed: (1) develop education and training programs to increase the number and sophistication of technology entrepreneurs and high tech entrepreneural start-ups in Florida,  (2) identify commercial applications of developed and developing technology and facilitate and foster technology transfer, (3) provide special program curriculum and mentors to underrepresented groups, and (4) provide infrastructure to enable the innovation, technology commercialization and entrepreneural process. \r\n\r\nThe Central Florida economy is largely dependent on tourism, which provides low-paying service sector jobs with limited opportunity for advancement.  Minorities constitute a large percentage of the workforce in this industry, but they are underrepresented in the technology and entrepreneurship sectors.  The program has a strong effort to recruit, educate and train entrepreneurs from the regional minority academic institutions.  The current program will create new start-up companies and train personnel to work in these companies.  The new high-tech jobs will be considerably higher in pay scales for the employees.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
