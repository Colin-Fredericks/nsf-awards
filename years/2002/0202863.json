 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California State University, Fresno Science and Mathematics Education Center (SMEC) is implementing a collaborative teacher education partnership project within the service region of the university. SMEC, in collaboration with numerous school districts in its service region along with 2 community colleges, Reedley College and West Hills Community College at Lemoore (including their satellite campuses), is providing a range of program components designed to enhance science and mathematics teacher recruitment, induction, support, and preparation in the Central Valley of California. Activities are facilitated and coordinated through a new network of SMEC satellite partners known as Learning Communities centered at the regional community colleges in collaboration with neighboring school districts. Project activities include: 1) expansion of efforts to recruit and support future science and mathematics teachers (middle and high school) throughout the service region of California State University, Fresno with recruitment efforts focusing on under represented minority groups; 2) development of a network of Science and Mathematics Future Science and Mathematics Teachers Clubs based at the two new Learning Community Centers; 3) use of a highly developed and successful model for early field experiences for all SMECTEP participants in the project; and 4) creation of a user-friendly Alternative Pathways Program designed to assist potential science and mathematics teachers entering the profession from other professions that incorporates special programs and summer institutes designed to assist in the career transition process.\r\n\r\nSMECTEP incorporates new recruitment and support strategies building upon the successful Fresno Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparation of Teachers (FCEPT) in an effort to greatly expand outreach to the service region of the university. STEM Site coordinators based at each of the Learning Community Centers (partner community colleges) serve as primary liaisons to SMECTEP and as key facilitators in the project. They serve as the primary recruitment facilitators at their site in collaboration with key district science and mathematics teachers. They are also establishing Future Science and Mathematics Teacher Clubs in collaboration with local SMECTEP school districts and identifying science and/or mathematics faculty on their campuses who may be interested in attending or leading professional development workshops. Academic Year and Summer Institutes focused on the modeling approach to learning are offered for preservice students. A partnership with the University High School is providing a campus-based demonstration site for the teaching strategies introduced at the Institutes.\r\n\r\nSMECTEP is improving the preparation of future science and mathematics teachers through early field experiences and other support and mentoring programs. The project is increasing the pool of credentialed middle and high school mathematics and science teachers in the Central Valley with special consideration for attracting prospective teachers from under served ethnic communities. \r\n",
