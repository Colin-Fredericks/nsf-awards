 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop proposal addresses data management research for the semantic web. Semantic web is mainly about technology for machine understandable and machine readable web pages. To date, much of the research on the semantic web has focussed on developing ontologies and languages such as the Resource Description Framework. There is a lot of research that needs to be done on querying and indexing the web pages. The participants of this workshop will be those who are actively conducting research in data management and the semantic web from academia and industrial research laboratories. The workshop will include short presentations by the experts as well as extensive discussions on research directions and challenges. The outcome of this workshop will be a list of recommendations for further research on data management support for the semantic web.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
