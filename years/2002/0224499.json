 "awd_abstract_narration": "In June of 2002, a workshop will be held on Fundamentals of Distributed\r\nComputing at Bertinoro, Italy.  From a set of 43 outstanding\r\nsubmissions, a total of 30 white papers were selected for publication,\r\nand 46 researchers (including a number of students) invited to attend\r\nthe workshop.  NSF provides travel funding to support attendance\r\nby these students, many of whom are on very tight budgets.  The workshop\r\nwill help set the agenda for a new generation of research in distributed\r\ncomputing while also knitting together the European and American\r\nresearch communities in the area.  \r\n\r\nQuality of the white papers was very high, and we have approached\r\nSpringer-Verlag about the possibility of revising and extending them\r\ninto a book-length treatment.   Our hope is that we might use the\r\nworkshop to develop a unified vision and to elucidate the research\r\nagenda in various areas of the discipline, then use this as a structure\r\nfor the white papers.  The resulting book will be both a snapshot of the\r\nstate of the art and also a coherent articulation of research\r\nopportunities in the coming decade.",
