 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is enabling secondary school teachers and college faculty in Baltimore County and the surrounding region to effectively integrate computer technology into their classrooms. Activities include:\r\n\r\n(1) expanding the current NSF-funded Information and Multimedia Technology (IMMT) program (NSF Award No. 9950056) to include a new Instructional Multimedia curriculum with a certificate option for educators interested in becoming proficient in using multimedia technology to create effective interactive learning materials for their classrooms;\r\n\r\n(2) providing two-week intensive experiences in classroom multimedia technology applications to develop the technological currency of in-service secondary school teachers and college faculty in science, mathematics, and technology fields, and to prepare in-service technology teachers to teach articulated multimedia technology courses at secondary schools; and\r\n\r\n(3) creating a new digital audio/video computer production laboratory at CCBC Essex to support the new Instructional Multimedia certificate option and to enable project participants to develop Multimedia Learning Activities (MLAs) (small computer- or Web-based animations and interactive applications) for their classrooms. The developed materials incorporate national science, mathematics, technology, and industry standards in education.\r\n\r\nScience, mathematics, and technology faculty from CCBC Essex are developing instructional design and technology courses in collaboration with teachers and administrators from the Baltimore County Public Schools, professionals from businesses that use multimedia in the workplace (including Apropos Media, BreakAway Games, and System Source), and faculty from the College of Notre Dame of Maryland. At least four new credit courses are being developed for both traditional and online delivery: Ethical Responsibilities in the Computer Age, Managing Learning with Technology, Educational Technology Process, and Online Course Management.\r\n",
