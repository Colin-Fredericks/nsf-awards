While the Big Bang picture of how the Universe began is generally accepted, the details of how and when structures developed and formed are in hot debate. On scales larger  than clusters of galaxies (>10 million light years across)  it is generally believed that gravity is the dominant force and structures grow from small initial seeds planted in the very early universe (<< 1 second since the Big Bang), because gravity is attractive and unstable. However, on smaller scales gas hydrodynamics, microphysics (i.e., forces on atomic scales)  and star formation processes play progressively more important roles  in shaping and determining when galaxies form and how they evolve;  the picture at these smaller scales is much less clear.  The radiation field, especially,  the ultra-violet radiation that is capable of ionizing atomic hydrogen  must play a very important role in these processes.  In particular, it determines when atomic hydrogen is fully ionized and the universe is cleared of hydrogen \"fog\" and  becomes transparent  to distant sources. This epoch has been characterized as the \"end of the dark  ages\".  Since radiation  controls the evolution of the thermodynamic  state of the gas, a fraction of which is subsequently incorporated into stars, it is essential to include radiation hydrodynamics  in full detail in cosmological computer simulations in order to provide  answers to many of the important questions in modern cosmology. This is  a formidable task to tackle even with the fastest supercomputers today.  Dr. Cen and his collaborators  have developed an efficient way to compute this complicated situation and begun to carry out a program that should help provide some clues about  how the radiation field and the matter evolve with time.\r\n***\r\n",
