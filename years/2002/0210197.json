 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Lilja\r\nU Minnesota\r\n0210197\r\n\r\nRecent work in physics, chemistry, and materials science has\r\nproduced nanometer-scale structures out of exotic materials using\r\nsophisticated fabrication techniques.  However, very little work has\r\nbeen conducted in computer engineering to investigate how to build\r\nfull-scale computer systems out of these new devices.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this exploratory project is to begin to develop new\r\ntechniques for constructing finite state machines (FSMs) out of\r\nmolecular nanodevices.  FSMs are one of the fundamental building\r\nblocks of any digital computing system.  In this project, we\r\nintroduce NanoBoxes as a possible abstraction for constructing\r\nreliable finite state machines for use in molecular computer\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nThe reliability and error characteristics of molecular nanodevices\r\nare substantially different from the corresponding characteristics\r\nof traditional silicon-based CMOS transistors.  These nanodevice\r\ncharacteristics present new challenges to computer designers which\r\nwill require an entirely new approach for designing finite state\r\nmachines.  The techniques we develop eventually could be used to\r\nbuild entire computer systems out of molecular nanodevices.\r\n\r\nThis is a high-risk/high-reward project.  The risk is that we need\r\nto develop new approaches for designing computers out of a large\r\ncollection of devices which are still under development themselves.\r\nBy observing common trends in newly developed molecular devices, we\r\nmake assumptions about their weak drive capabilities and their\r\nunstable nature.  While we expect that we can adapt and extend\r\ntraditional space, time, and information redundancy techniques for\r\nfault-tolerance into this new domain of molecular computers, new\r\nideas will be necessary to develop appropriate solutions.\r\n\r\nThis project is high-reward, however, since by conducting computer\r\narchitecture research in tandem with research on the nanodevices\r\nthemselves, we will be streamlining the development process to be\r\nable to have fully-functional molecular computers more quickly than\r\nif we wait for the nanodevice research to solidify.  Furthermore,\r\nwhile we are tailoring our techniques for molecular nanodevices, our\r\ntechniques also will be applicable to error detection and correction\r\nin quantum nanodevices and in nanometer-scale conventional CMOS\r\ndevices, which are becoming more fault-prone as transistor sizes\r\nshrink.\r\n\r\nThis project will make substantial contributions to educational and\r\nhuman resource development.  It will initiate the dissertation\r\nresearch of a Ph.D. student in electrical and computer engineering\r\nto focus their research in this new area.  We also expect to involve\r\na few M.S. students in this work and possibly provide research\r\nopportunities for undergraduate students through existing internship\r\nprograms at the University of Minnesota.\r\n",
