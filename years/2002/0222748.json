 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a global information network with the ultimate goal of better understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take place within it.  This proposal consists of various segments addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for existing protocols, development of new protocols, and scientific research with GLOBE data.  This proposal will support the current set of GLOBE soil measurement protocols, with the cooperation of  the USDA, Cornell University, ISRIC (The Netherlands).  The project will use GLOBE student-collected data to derive and validate algorithms for physical and chemical soil/plant/atmospheric process simulation models, including the General Purpose Simulation Model of the Earth Atmosphere System (GAPS).  The GLOBE soil data will be used to determine baseline estimates of soil quality within various ecosystems and land use scenarios.  Seasonal measurements of surface soil characteristics will assess regional changes in soil quality.  This proposal will also support the development of materials for education that will include soil science in the context of Earth Systems Science.  Scientists, students, and the general public will be able to better understand the role of living soil in ecosystems and their role in the care of our natural resources.",
