 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project involving University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Boston University.  The project will build, deploy, test and package a middleware-oriented distributed account management system.  The system supports the information exchange between grid-enabled systems that are necessary to implement distributed account management, resource allocation, usage accounting, and monitoring functions in a heterogeneous grid environment.  The system will be coupled to the a grid transactions system to form a completely operational, grid-enabled reference implementation.  \r\n\r\nThe ability to manage user accounts, provide access control over its resources, manage allocations and generate usage reports in a distributed fashion is critical to the expansion of the grid.  The proposed system can be used to build a highly automated, scalable account management system that will work across disparate computing systems. The software will be packaged as an open-source distribution for further development and adaptation by the grid community.\r\n",
