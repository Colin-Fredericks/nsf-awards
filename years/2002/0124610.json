The field of theoretical immunology has\r\nbecome a prominent direction in biomathematics and it concerns\r\nmathematical modeling of the biocomplexity in the immune system,\r\nand more specifically the generation of immune responses to\r\ninfections, generation and maintenance of immune memory,\r\nunderstanding the mechanisms that govern persistent infections,\r\ndesigning optimal strategies for antibiotic treatment of\r\ninfectious diseases, and vaccine development.  The main goals of\r\nthis conference are to advance the interaction between\r\ntheoretical and experimental directions of immunological research\r\nand to facilitate a better communication between science and\r\nmedicine.  The conference focuses on modern approaches to\r\nmathematical modeling of immune processes using differential\r\nequations and dynamical systems, game theory, mathematical\r\nstatistics, stochastic processes and computer simulations, as\r\nwell as mathematical algorithms for data mining and data fitting.\r\nThe conference features lectures by prominent scientists on\r\nfundamental results in the field as well as reports on work in\r\nprogress.  A special session is devoted to the discussion of new\r\ndirections and most significant problems of theoretical\r\nimmunology in the near future.\r\n     The immune system is our primary defense against viruses and\r\ninfections.  Theoretical immunology is a relatively young field of\r\nscience that deals with theoretical modeling of interactions\r\nbetween immune system and invading parasites.  Mathematical and\r\ncomputer models are used to unify our understanding of the\r\nextremely complex functioning of the immune system.  Such\r\ntheoretical models allow scientists to sort through the growing\r\nwealth of experimental and clinical data and extract\r\nfundamentally important features of immunity, design new\r\nexperiments, and optimize the performance of drugs and vaccines.\r\nThe meeting aims to bridge the gap between theoretical and\r\nexperimental biology and medicine and advance the theory of\r\nimmune processes to address the current needs of medicine and\r\nbiotechnology.  The conference has an educational impact by\r\nexposing younger researchers and graduate students to the present\r\nchallenges in immunology and facilitating their future scientific\r\ncareers.\r\n\r\n",
