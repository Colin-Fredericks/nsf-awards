 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Moving Image Gateway is a combination Collections and Services project.  The Services aspect is developing a web portal for moving images that combines an archives directory database with a union catalog to provide access to the world's moving image collections.  The Collection aspect involves opening the archives of moving images found in the Library of Congress, Cable News Network, National Geographic Television, National Library of Medicine, Oregon Health and Sciences University, ResearchChannel, and the Smithsonian Institution to STEM students, educators, and researchers as well as the general public.  Moving image materials that are being selected from these archives represent a wide array of science disciplines and a wealth of materials that support all levels of education from K-12 through university, postgraduate and continuing education.\r\n\r\nThe Moving Image Gateway is a result of prior collaboration between the Association of Moving Image Archives and the Library of Congress and is bringing a very flexible but standardized metadata architecture to these diverse resources so that moving images are being integrated into the information mainstream.  The Moving Image Gateway is offering several innovative components, including a searchable directory of international moving image archives that will identify the document and generate a dynamic web page for each archive and a union catalog that supports portals for customized end user searching.  An NSDL portal specifically for science materials is being developed as well as an innovative schema-independent union catalog architecture that provides export and display in different schemas depending on the portal used for searching.  This project is allowing the participating organizations to collaborate in describing, preserving, and digitizing these unique cultural resources.\r\n",
