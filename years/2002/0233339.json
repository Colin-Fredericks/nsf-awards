 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power distribution voltages and insulation are areas of critical importance to the study of SSP systems. Due \r\nto the importance of the mass and cost of the SSP system, most designs for the SSP operate at high voltages \r\nin order to reduce transmission losses and mass. Some design concepts even use no insulation. Use of these \r\nhigh voltages will present challenges of electrical breakdown and performance of insulators, insulation, and \r\nswitchgear. As a result, there is a strong research motivation for technology geared towards enhancement of \r\nPMAD systems exposed to electrical breakdown and corona type faults.  In harsh environments (aerospace), economic and effective fault management (maintenance and monitoring of electric power systems) is needed to ensure high performance. In the effective fault management of the aerospace  environment,  the maintenance  cost  of  aging  distribution  cables  is  a major  consideration.  The installation  and  maintenance  of  the  equipment  on  board  the  SSP  is  also  of  high  significance.  These operations  can  be  significantly  improved  by  more  accurate  predictions  of  insulating  aging,  as  well  as detection and location of faults within the components of the power system. \r\n \r\nThis project will focus on the design of an integrated system using state-of-the-art technology for \r\ncontinuous and periodic monitoring of a space power system with emphasis on the detection and diagnosis \r\nof corona and soft faults. This scheme involves the cost effective, efficient monitoring and control for an \r\nenhanced space solar power network. A network of sensors will monitor the network, report information \r\nfor  the  detection  of  faults,  and  provide  health-status  information  of  electrical  insulation  and  other \r\ncomponents in the system. \r\n \r\nThe Center for Energy Systems and Control (CESaC), Howard University is one of the research centers in \r\nthe US that has demonstrated capabilities in the following combination of fields: Power system analysis in \r\nthe  terrestrial,  non-terrestrial,  naval  systems,  and  spacecraft  energy  power  systems;  Application  of \r\noptimization  techniques  to  improve  the  solution  of  different  problems,  and  applications  of  intelligent \r\nsystems to the solution of complex problems. This combination is necessary for completion of the complex \r\ninterdisciplinary tasks that will be faced in this project. The project will create an opportunity for students \r\nfrom differing branches of electrical engineering - material sciences, communications, power systems and \r\ncontrols - to  become  aware  of modern  problems  in  the  power  industry  and  contribute  to  the  technical \r\nprogress in this field.",
