 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to study the nonlinear dynamics and control\r\nof a class of canonical fluid systems: flow over a backward facing\r\nstep, flow separation from two sharp convex corners of a bluff body,\r\nand high frequency flutter of one or multiple airfoils.  Here,\r\n\"Control\" should not be interpreted in the traditional sense.  Recent\r\n\"control\" efforts have focused on triggering instabilities in the\r\nfluid shear layers; by creating certain vortex dynamic interactions,\r\nsystem performance often improves dramatically. The proposed research\r\nseeks to gain an understanding of the nonlinear dynamic processes and\r\nthe bifurcation structure of the systems, so that it may be possible\r\nto synthesize such triggering controllers systematically, rather than\r\nrelying on ad hoc trial and error.  The approach consists of\r\nconstructing low order vortex models that capture essential features\r\nof the systems, and then performing normal form and bifurcation\r\nanalyses.  It is believed that lessons learned from the three\r\ncanonical problems to be studied here will be applicable to a broad\r\nclass of fluid flow problems whose performance is sensitive to\r\nnonlinear vortex dynamics within shear layers.  The project will\r\nsupport close collaboration between the PI and United Technologies\r\nResearch Center, whose engineers/scientists are searching for\r\npractical ways of incorporating triggering controllers into several\r\nproducts.  Furthermore, the proposed project will form a focal point\r\naround which to generate several undergraduate research projects. The\r\nPI has observed that such experiences, in which undergraduates make\r\nmeaningful contributions, often buoy their motivation and desire for\r\npursuing advanced degrees.\r\n",
