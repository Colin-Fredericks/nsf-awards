The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a seven month research fellowship by Dr. Arek J. Goetz to work with Dr. Pierre Arnoux at the University of Marseille in France.\r\n\r\nDr. Goetz will join a group of active researchers at the University of Marseille II, Institut de Luminy, and the Center of Theoretical Physics, in research pertaining to the dynamics of transformations with low symbolic complexity.  In particular, he will explore the relationship between the symbolic dynamics induced by invertible piecewise rotations, the geometry and fractal structure of the coding partition.  The last month of the fellowship will be spent at the University of Exeter in the UK where he will join a team of researchers in dynamical systems led by Dr. Peter Ashwin and apply results from the theory of piecewise isometries to electrical engineering, in particular to the theory of digital filters.  Digital filters are computer algorithms used currently in electronic devices such as cell phone and voice and image recognition devices.  \r\n",
