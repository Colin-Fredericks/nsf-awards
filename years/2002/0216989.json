 "awd_abstract_narration": "This special meeting of experts in the field of molecular self-assembly is to promote intensive discussions on, and to identify future prospects and needs for, fundamental research on and implementation of these concepts in emerging technologies. It is anticipated that these discussions will catalyze cross-disciplinary and international collaborations to advance the state of knowledge and application of this important field. \r\n\r\nMolecular self-assembly lies at the heart of advanced applications in areas as diverse as medicine, information technology, bio-engineering and green chemistry, and is poised to play a significant role in fueling the growth of the rapidly-emerging field of nanotechnology. To realize the potential offered by these technologies, there is a need to advance the understanding of self-assembled systems, from both experimental and theoretical perspectives, and to develop a vision as to the most promising areas for applications and technology development of these phenomena. The purpose of this meeting is to bring together a group of eminent scientists spanning a range of appropriate disciplines (chemistry, physics, chemical engineering, materials science and biochemical physics) to stimulate identification of the prospects and needs for advancing our understanding of self-assembly phenomena in the context of advanced applications in a wide range of areas, and to promote inter-disciplinary and international collaborations. The organizers will provide an exciting and inspirational atmosphere for the conference. As well as describing recent advances, the speakers will be asked to look forward and raise significant issues that should be addressed in the short and intermediate term for the most effective way for furthering this area. In this way we intend to catalyze new collaborations, which will provide the foundation for future research programs in the area.\r\n\r\nA wide range of topics fit under the general heading of self-assembly, both in bulk solution and at interfaces, and these will be addressed at the meeting. Some specific topics, which will be discussed are not only the mechanistic aspects of self-assembly in surfactant systems, the role of binding energy concepts, and the nature of weak and long-range forces, but also how a deeper understanding of these principles can accelerate the development of new functional materials based on self-assembly principles, and of new applications of these materials. Many of the details of interactions at the molecular level such as lipid-protein interactions in biological membranes and phospholipid/surfactant interactions are still not well understood. A related topic of current interest is the spatial and temporal control of the interfacial and bulk properties of both liquids and solids, which is of crucial importance in microfluidic applications, for instance, and which will require a better understanding of the dynamic aspects of self-assembly and development of methods to accomplish these goals. New interrogative techniques are key to facilitating advances in all these areas of colloid and interfacial science, and will be another focal point of this conference.\r\n\r\n",
