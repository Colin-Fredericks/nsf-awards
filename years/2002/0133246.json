 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research and education program is directed at devising theoretical frameworks and methodological strategies for designing and employing learning objects in scalable online learning environments that are rich with human-to-human interaction. To develop these new frameworks and strategies, empirical program based on qualitative analyses of existing online learning communities will be done. Rather than viewing learning objects as decontextualized artifacts existing independent of learners interactions with them, Wertsch's (1991) analytic method will allow the research to focus on the ways in which resources mediate the achievement of online learners' goals in the context of existing online learning communities. \r\n\r\nThe research will be integrated into several educational activities. Three full graduate assistantships are provided for the five years of the grant, which will engage students in Utah State University's Instructional Technology graduate program in real-world application of skills they are learning, as well as prepare them for future research projects of their own. Additionally, the grant will serve as a real-world context for assignments in a variety of courses such as qualitative methods courses and a Learning Objects Seminar. Thirdly, as portions of the framework become available courses will be designed around the framework, giving both myself and the students the opportunity to engage reflectively in their own integrated learning and research activities.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by Division of Undergraduate Education.",
