 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThis project is developing a multidisciplinary B.S. Program in Biotechnology that places a heavy emphasis on both methodology and ethical, socio-political and economic outcomes to provide students with the necessary skills required for (1) entry-level laboratory positions in the pharmaceutical industries and academia, and (2) placement into research-based graduate programs. We are adapting materials from institutions offering a B.S. in Biotechnology including: Cedar Crest College, Clarion University of Pennsylvania, Eastern Washington University, Elizabethtown College, Ferris State University, Moorhead State University, University of Southern Maine, University of Wisconsin and Worcester State College. A newly-approved B.S. in Biotechnology is providing cutting-edge technology training for biotechnology students within a framework of a core curriculum, community service, internships in biotechnology laboratories, and small faculty/student ratios. Cabrini College is constructing a state-of-the-art building to house a new Center for Science, Education and Technology. The Biotechnology Program is to be housed in the new Center.\r\nIn its first stage, this program is being offered to traditional undergraduate students, and concentrates on outreach, recruitment and admissions . As it matures, additional students will be drawn from non-traditional students and transfer students. Area high school teachers participating in a Cabrini-taught summer course,\" DNA and the New Millennium\", will be part of the feeder school process for locating new students for the program.",
