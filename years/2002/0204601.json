 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe PI plans to establish rigidity and finiteness results for\r\ninfinite groups, both in geometric and dynamical contexts.  In an\r\nattempt to broaden the scope of rigidity as initiated by Mostow,\r\nMargulis, Zimmer and others, we aim at results for very general\r\n(finitely generated) groups, notably fundamental groups arising\r\nin geometry.  The proposed methods are however also new and\r\nrelevant for the more classical study of arithmetic and\r\nS-arithmetic groups.  There are three aspects to the project.\r\nThe first is to construct cohomological invariants characterizing\r\nvarious geometric situations; a typical example is the\r\ninterpretation of negative curvature in terms of bounded\r\ncohomology that we propose with Shalom.  The second step is to\r\ndevelop a suitable theory to handle these invariants in an\r\nefficient way, notably by using tools from ergodic theory.  Last,\r\none has to apply this to concrete situations.  We focus in\r\nparticular on superrigidity and cocycle superrigidity for\r\nnon-linear groups and on orbit equivalence of ergodic actions.\r\n\r\nThe last forty years have witnessed the birth and remarkable\r\ndevelopment of what is now called ''rigidity theory''.  The first\r\ndiscovery in that field was this: Even though a flat space (which\r\nis the kind of space one thought we live in, from the ancient\r\nGreeks to Newton) can be deformed in many ways, some curved\r\nspaces (whose relevance to our world has been discovered by\r\nEinstein) are in a sense rigid.  Later came a discovery regarded\r\nas yet much more fundamental: The most symmetric geometric spaces\r\nturn out to be in fact arithmetic objects.  The project under\r\nconsideration here is to broaden the scope this rigidity theory\r\nto many more geometric spaces, and especially to deal with\r\nsituations in which the geometry cannot be reduced to\r\narithmetics.  Actually, we propose new methods that stand out by\r\ntheir abstract nature and allow us to tackle situations which do\r\nnot even stem from geometry, but rather regard the study of\r\ndynamics.  (Dynamics is the theory of systems that evolve in\r\ntime, typically ocean currents or galaxies, and may have chaotic\r\nbehaviours.)  Our project proposes new methods for obtaining more\r\nresults both in this dynamical setting and in geometry, and this\r\nin a unified way.\r\n",
