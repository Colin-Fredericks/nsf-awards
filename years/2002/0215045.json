 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a pulse measurement device intended to fully characterize optical pulses used in fiber optic telecommunication systems.  Next generation optical networks will use 40 Gbit/s rates requiring pulse widths of less than ~25 picoseconds.  At this pulse width, dispersion compensation is required to obtain transmission distances of greater than 25 km.  In addition, nonlinear optical effects will complicate system development by adding intensity-dependent dispersion.  Optical network designers are anticipating these problems by developing active dispersion compensation.  However, a requirement of active dispersion compensation is accurate measurements of pulse intensity and phase within an optical network.  Then, corrections to the dispersion compensation can be determined exactly.  A pulse characterization device is proposed that will be self-contained, have only one fiberized input, be rugged and easy to use.\r\n\r\nThis technology has commercial potential as a diagnostic for telecommunications research and as a diagnostic for optical network design.  As optical networks move beyond the OC-192 standard, active dispersion compensation will be required.  This technology can used in research applications and can be part of a feedback mechanism to actively control dispersion in functioning optical networks.",
