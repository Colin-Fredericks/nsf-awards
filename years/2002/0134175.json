 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award provides funding for the development of optimization-based decision support systems that model the interaction between various levels of the logistics network and utilize improved network communications to increase logistics efficiencies. The major focus is to design and analyze algorithms which integrate production plans, inventory control and transportation strategies across the supply chain to reduce system-wide costs and enhance service.  Analysis of the theoretical properties of different problem formulations and optimal policies will be used to develop efficient and robust solution techniques.  Building upon our previous research in distribution planning problems, a series of increasingly complex models will be considered to account for large-scale production-distribution networks, nonlinear production and transportation costs, multi-modal transportation, capacity constraints, and uncertainty in demand.  This research will be fully integrated with the educational program through the incorporation of case studies, industry projects and software tools in Logistics and Supply Chain Management courses. The most salient aspect of the educational component is the preparation of case studies that provide sufficient technical information to allow rigorous engineering analysis, while presenting students with real, unstructured situations that require sound business assessment. Finally, the educational program also includes curriculum design, mentoring and outreach activities with particular focus on women and minorities.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this career program will lead to improved coordination in large-scale logistics networks and significant contributions to the theory of combinatorial optimization, networks and algorithms, as well as to education.  The impact of our research is clear: lower system-wide costs, more reliable delivery times and enhaced service in supply chains. On the educational front, we expect that the introduction of appropriate case studies to engineering education will be widely accepted to stimulate critical thinking and bring hands-on experience to the classroom.",
