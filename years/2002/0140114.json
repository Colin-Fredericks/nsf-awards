 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flavonoids are metabolites produced exclusively by plants that are well known as the blue, red, and purple pigments in flowers, fruits, and leaves.  As such, these compounds are important for attracting pollinators and seed dispersers.  However, flavonoids are also used by plants for a large number of other purposes, such as protecting exposed tissues from UV radiation, as signaling molecules, and as part of the chemical arsenal against pathogens, predators, and other challenges.  Although all higher plants synthesize flavonoids, these compounds clearly participate in distinct processes in different plants.  Therefore, it is important to understand how flavonoids are synthesized in different plant species.  Our laboratories study the organization and regulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in plant cells, how the products are transported to their final destination inside the cell, and how this system has developed over the course of plant evolution.  Despite the success of genetic and biochemical analysis of flavonoid synthesis, current studies into detailed mechanisms are hampered by the extraordinarily expensive reagent costs and the lack of radiolabeled compounds, while analysis of enzyme levels and localization are confounded by the lack of adequate antibody reagents.  This project is aimed at assembling a standardized collection of flavonoid compounds and antibodies.  These reagents will be stored at specific locations for distribution among the group and, if feasible, to other publicly-funded groups working on flavonoid synthesis.  The project will immediately impact the quality of the work that is done in our laboratories and at the same time open up entirely new avenues of investigation.  \r\n\r\n",
