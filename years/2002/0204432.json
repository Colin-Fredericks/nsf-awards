 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to produce useful and practical\r\nmethods for the development of large complex software systems. The\r\nresearch will address the problem of composing software components\r\ninto large systems that have guaranteed correctness properties.\r\nState-explosion (the exponential growth of the number of possible\r\nsystem behaviors with the number of the system's components) is\r\navoided by analyzing interactions among every pair of components\r\nseparately, rather than inspecting the interaction of all components\r\nat once.  This local approach nevertheless enables us to prove that\r\nthe overall system behaves as desired.  Since the number of behaviors\r\nthat have to be analyzed is much smaller, the amount of effort needed\r\nto rigorously analyze and verify large systems is greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nThe main activities are:\r\n\r\n1. Develop techniques for the precise description of the\r\nrequired behavior of a software component.\r\n\r\n2. Develop practical methods for reasoning about the behavior that\r\nresults when a set of components are connected to form a large\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this research is to reduce the cost of creating\r\nrealistic size software systems that have demonstrable correctness\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
