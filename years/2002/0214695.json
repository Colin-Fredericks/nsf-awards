 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the requirement of high-density microvias, which are critical in a variety of microelectronic modules, such as Flat-Panel Displays (FPDs), Multi-Chip Modules (MCMs), and Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). As these modules become ever faster, more compact, and more capable, their density of interconnects has been increasing dramatically and new packaging technologies such as Chip-Scale Packages (CSPs) and Ball-Grid Arrays (BGAs) have been developed to accommodate all the required input and output (I/Os) connections. Such dense interconnects are realized by the generation of hundreds of thousands of microvias in the substrate layers on which the electronic modules are built. These microvias are also both difficult and expensive to produce because of their small sizes and large numbers. Current technologies for microvia generation are not optimized for the varied cost considerations of different manufacturing requirements  direct-write tools address low-volume needs, whereas mask projection systems are designed for very high via-density products. The system technology described in this proposal offers several desirable features, including: high-speed microvia generation for different via densities, full microvia pattern programmability, capability to drill high-threshold photo-ablation substrates, and full and efficient utilization of available high-power excimer lasers.\r\n\r\nA variety of microelectronic modules, such as flat panel displays, multi-chip modules, and printed circuit boards play an important role in numerous advanced technology applications in both commercial and military systems.  Results from this project could result in substantial cost reductions in a wide range of electronic modules.",
