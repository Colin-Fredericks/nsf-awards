 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to Dr. Alexander Fernald and co-principal\r\ninvestigators Dr. Laurie Abbott, Dr. April Ulery, and Dr. Clint Loest at New\r\nMexico State University to acquire major research instrumentation to analyze\r\nwater, soils, and biomass for environmental research, monitoring and\r\nassessment.  The awarded funds will enable purchase of four research\r\ninstruments: 1) a  Flow Injection Analysis System with ion chromatograph for analysis of major cations and anions in water, soils, and biomass; 2)a Nitrogen/Carbon\r\nAnalyzer for determination of N and C in soils and biomass; 3)a Laser Diffraction Particle Analyzer for measuring particle size distribution of suspended sediment and soils; and 4) an X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrum Analyzer for analysis of metals in liquids, soils, and biosolids.  The instrumentation will support research that has the goal of\r\nproviding information to: 1) reduce negative environmental effects of land use\r\npractices, and 2) enhance quality of natural resources in New Mexico and the\r\narid Southwest.  Land use impacts on water, soil and biomass threaten\r\nsustainable economic use and ecological health of rangeland, forest,\r\nagriculture, and wildlife in New Mexico.  Water quality is a growing concern\r\nwith increasing competition for limited water supplies and decreasing\r\navailability of high quality irrigation and drinking water.  Rapidly growing\r\ndairies in New Mexico generate large amounts of animal waste, and pollution\r\nfrom confined animal production threatens water and soil resources.  Metal\r\ncontamination is a problem in areas of New Mexico with naturally high mineral\r\noccurrence and in areas impacted by mining, military, and agricultural\r\nactivities. \r\nAs a minority-serving land grant institution, the mission of New Mexico State\r\nUniversity is to conduct meaningful research, to educate and train scientists,\r\nand to extend information to the citizens of the state.  The state-of-the-art\r\ninstrumentation will provide a leap forward in the ability of university\r\ninvestigators to conduct needed environmental research and fulfill the mission\r\nto educate.  The instrumentation will initially support the research activities\r\nof four investigators, faculty in three departments, and federal researchers. \r\nIt will be used to train graduate and undergraduate students in the use of the\r\ninstruments as part of their research.  Obtaining this equipment will increase\r\nNMSU competitiveness for future grant proposals.  The equipment will support\r\nresearch to provide critical information that will allow agencies, communities,\r\nand individuals to participate in meaningful and sustainable programs that\r\nreduce negative environmental effects of land use practices and that enhance\r\nthe quality of water, soil and biomass resources.\r\n",
