 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWest Virginia has developed a strong academic base on which to support larger scale competitive programs and technology transfer in the areas of Identification Science and Technology (Id S&T) and High Performance Computing (HPC) and deems them important to the future economic development for the state.   This project builds infrastructure at West Virginia University and Marshall University to strengthen physical and intellectual capability in these scientific areas. \r\n\r\nIdentification Science and Technology is based on the growing synergy between molecular science and engineering applications.  It reflects the multidisciplinary research in areas defined by the interfaces of molecular/life sciences, micro/nano science and information science and technology. Research in the molecular/life sciences will develop scientific understanding of life signatures at the most fundamental level by focusing on biochemical complexity and the hierarchy of organization.  Research in the micro/nano sciences and engineering will focus on design and use of new devices to acquire biometric information.  Research in information science and engineering will develop data analysis and interpretation of large volumes of spacial and temporal biometric information.  \r\n\r\nThe High Performance Computing research area will enhance the infrastructure for computational science and human/computer interfaces that support the numerical and data analysis necessary to complement the physical research.  The HPC effort will: 1) link the EPSCoR HPC plan to the broader academic research computing and information science and engineering infrastructure plan; 2) find new ways to assist users interacting with computers and assist researchers in various disciples; and 3) provide a resource for student research and education at various levels including high school.  The HPC effort includes use of an established Virtual Environment Laboratory for a variety of innovative research and educational activities.\r\n\r\nIn addition to work in the research areas, the project will integrate the NSF EPSCoR activities with on-going educational and outreach initiatives in the state, create new initiatives, and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
