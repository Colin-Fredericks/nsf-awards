Our approach is interdisciplinary, involving electrical engineering, economics, and policy analysis.  They will apply their research to improve undergraduate and graduate education, as well as provide training for working professionals.  The research areas are:\r\nDistributed Decision-Making: Use economic theory and autonomous agents to decentralize decision making in complex systems, such as transmission grids and micro-grids, to increase efficiency and reliability.\r\nEngineering-Economics of DR: Study engineering design, operation, and economics of DR to understand how to optimize power system configuration for efficiency and survivability.\r\nReliability & Security: Examine the reliability and security implications of introducing DR into current and advanced electric power systems with advanced computer modeling methods. \r\nAir Quality & Life Cycle Analysis of DR: Quantify the implications of DR for local and regional air quality and examine the environmental implications of DR over its life cycle.\r\nDG & Microgrids: Examine the technical difficulties of establishing microgrids powered by DG on total energy use, reliability, cost, and security.\r\nInterconnect Standards: Examine DR interconnection issues, e.g., implications for conventional systems and profitability.  \r\nGeneral Regulatory Environment: Study how the actions of regulators expedite or impede the introduction and operation of DR, e.g., microgrids.\r\nOther Applications of the Technology: Examine the implications of DR for small-scale systems, e.g., power systems on ships.\r\nBenchmarking Test Systems: Test the research in IEEE-PES testbeds and utility systems.\r\nEducation: Design new courses and teaching modules for graduate & undergraduate course and develop new material for disseminating this research to practitioners.\r\n\r\n",
