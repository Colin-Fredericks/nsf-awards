Martin\r\nVa Poly Inst. \r\n\r\nWearable  computing  has  the  potential  to  allow  access  to  information  anytime  and  anyplace.  \r\nThree of the major goals of wearable computing are to allow the user to go about a normal daily \r\nroutine  while  constantly  wearing  a  device,  to  be  invisible  to  those  around  the  user,  and  to  be aware  of  the  user.s  actions  and  location.  The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  investigate  the wearable  computing  uses  of  electronic  textiles  (e-textiles),  a  novel  hardware/software  platform  that  has  the  potential  to  solve  many  of  the  problems  in  achieving  these  goals,  and  to  create  a  design environment for e-textile-based wearable computing. \r\nE-textiles  are  fabrics  that  have  electronics  and  interconnections  woven  into  them.    The \r\nelectronics  consist  of  general-purpose  microprocessors,  digital  signal  processors,  sensors,  and \r\nactuators at regular intervals throughout the fabric.  E-textiles allow the creation of systems with a \r\nphysical  flexibility  and  size  that  cannot  be  achieved  with  currently  available  electronic \r\nmanufacturing techniques. Components and interconnections are a part of the fabric and thus are \r\nmuch less visible and, more importantly, not susceptible to becoming tangled together or snagged \r\nby the surroundings. Consequently, e-textiles can be worn in everyday situations where currently \r\navailable  wearable  computers  would  hinder  the  user.  E-textiles  also  have  greater  flexibility  in \r\nadapting  to  changes  in  the  computational  and  sensing  requirements  of  an  application  for  the \r\npurpose  of  managing  power  consumption  and  context  awareness. The  number  and  location  of \r\nsensor and processing elements can be dynamically tailored to the current needs of the user and \r\napplication, rather than being fixed at design time.",
