 "awd_abstract_narration": "The projects to be undertaken here have as their goal a substantial increase in the number of African American Ph.D.s in mathematics, statistics and other quantitatively based disciplines.  Objectives include:\r\n\r\n-Identifying of students at participating HBCUs who have the potential to obtain an advanced degree in a mathematical science or a field employing mathematical skills and methods.\r\n\r\n-Providing mentoring, nurturing and research experiences for the students identified above throughout their undergraduate careers.\r\n\r\n-Building bridges between participating HBCUs and majority institutions to provide a seamless transition to graduate school.\r\n\r\nThese projects will be carried out by the Alliance for the Production of African American Ph.D.s in the Mathematical Sciences, a consortium of departments of mathematics, statistics and testing and measurement at the three Iowa State Regents Universities and four Historically Black Colleges and Universities: Alabama A&M University, Benedict College, Florida A&M University and Jackson State University.   \r\n\r\nThe first project will involve the selection, mentoring and nurturing of eight undergraduate Alliance Scholars at each of the four participating HBCUs.  Each of these students will be provided with two mentors: a mentor at the student's home institution and an Iowa Regent mentor.  These mentors will work together with the student to develop an individualized course of study as well as a series of research projects.  Students will spend time at Iowa Regents Universities and will normally be offered admission and support at an appropriate Ph.D. program at one of these universities upon graduation.\r\n\r\nThe second project will be an eight-week Alliance Summer Institute to be held each summer at either Iowa State University or the University of Iowa.  Among the objectives of this project are:\r\n\r\n-Providing information about the variety of research areas and career paths available to students with quantitative abilities and training.\r\n\r\n-Providing a cultural and academic introduction to life and work at a large, majority university.\r\n\r\n-Providing opportunities for interactions between students and professors at minority serving institutions and their counterparts at majority universities.\r\n\r\n-Providing exposure to distinguished minority scholars and other longtime supporters of minority scholarship.\r\n\r\n-Providing opportunities to carry out research projects, both alone and in groups.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four students will be selected for the Summer Institute each summer.  They will be organized into research teams consisting of three students, one faculty member and one graduate student assistant.  Faculty will be drawn from a pool of Alliance faculty; graduate student assistants will be selected, where possible, from among the twenty-seven underrepresented minority graduate students in the University of Iowa Department of Mathematics.  Preference will be given to eligible Alliance Scholars; remaining positions will be filled by undergraduate students who will most benefit from the sort of experience provided here.
