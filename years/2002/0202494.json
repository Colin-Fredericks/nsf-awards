Using heuristic ideas from\r\nHolomorphic Dynamics it is proposed to investigate an effective\r\nselection of polynomials as iterators in Pollard rho method of \r\nfactorization. Factorization algorithms are a central topic\r\nin Cryptography. Numerical explorations show that there is\r\nroom for improvement in this field. In Holomorphic Dynamics\r\nand Small Divisors, it is proposed to extend the  general\r\ntheory of dynamics on Hedgehogs. The focus of the proposed\r\nresearch is on weak forms of stability when arithmetic\r\nconditions, typical of Small Divisors, fail. It is proposed to \r\ninvestigate Siegel disks and their boundary, and to attack\r\nthe hard problem of classifying invariant annular continua.\r\nIt is anticipated that the techniques of tube-log Riemann\r\nsurfaces should play an important role. Another project\r\nconsists in extending geometric techniques to higher\r\ndimensional Small Divisors problems. In particular, a new\r\ngeometric construction of invariant tori is envisioned. In\r\nthe theory of Renormalization in Holomorphic  Dynamics it\r\nis proposed to develop the new theory of renormalization.\r\nThis involves a better understanding of Degenerate\r\nQuasi-Conformal theory (i.e. for non bounded Beltrami\r\ncoefficients). A last topic in Complex Analysis on which\r\nresearch is proposed is the theory of Borel Monogenic \r\nfunctions. We project to develop a theory that is flexible\r\nenough to apply to problems in Small Divisors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamical Systems is a branch of Mathematics with ancient\r\nroots linked to Celestial Mechanics. It was founded as a\r\ndistinct branch of Mathematics more than a century ago by\r\nH. Poincare. It is a rich field with multiple interactions\r\nwith other parts of Mathematics and Science. The main goal\r\nis the study of the long time behavior of evolution processes.\r\nSome of the most important problems come from fields as\r\nBiology, Physical Sciences and Chemistry. One of the central \r\nquestions is the Problem of Stability. For example, is the\r\nSolar System stable  according to Newton laws ? K.A.M. theory\r\n(also called  Small Divisor theory) is one of the major\r\nbranches in Dynamical Systems. It was founded in the second\r\nhalf of the XXth century and had an important impact in\r\nDynamical Systems and related fields. It is the very first\r\ntheory that provides stability results in non-linear\r\nconservative problems. It continues its expansion to fields\r\nas diverse as Partial Differential Equations, the theory \r\nof foliations, Holomorphic Dynamics, etc. In the proposed\r\nprojects some of the most difficult open questions in KAM\r\ntheory will be explored. What happens when stability fails?\r\nCan we still recover some traces of stability that may be\r\nuseful in the applications?  \r\n",
