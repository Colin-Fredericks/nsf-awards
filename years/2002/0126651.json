 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nWith the upgrade of our Varian continuous wave 60 MHz NMR spectrometer to an efficient multinuclear FT-NMR spectrometer equipped with 2-D capabilities using technology developed by Anasazi Inc., we are incorporating modern NMR techniques across our chemistry laboratory curriculum at Florida Institute of Technology. We introduce routine Proton and Carbon-13 analyses into lower division labs, reinforcing identification techniques taught in the lecture. More sophisticated experiments such as 2D and multinuclear analyses, kinetics and equilibrium studies of reactions, Quantum Mechanics applied to NMR analysis, and Dynamic NMR Spectroscopy are being adapted into upper division labs. Most of the experiments are taken form the chemical education literature such as the J. Chem. Educ. We anticipate the progressive integration of the experiments into our curriculum to continue. We are also using this instrument in ongoing undergraduate research projects. Students independently run samples using the upgraded FT-NMR instrument without any operational difficulties and the hardware/software operation is durable and reliable enough that requires only moderate supervision during student usage. We are involving the Science Education Department at Florida Tech in the evaluation of the project and plan to present the results of this project at regional and national professional meetings. In addition, we will submit articles describing any new NMR experiment and/or resulting curriculum improvement to the Journal of Chem. Educ. or the web-based The Chemical Educator for publication. \r\n",
