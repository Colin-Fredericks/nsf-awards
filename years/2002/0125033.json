This work will take place in collaboration with the SBI Project Office and the scientific investigators who are to provide datasets and information.  The data management program will help ensure that data are accurate, accessible, well-documented, and disseminated in a timely fashion to scientific users.  Initial preparation of the program will be assisted by results from a questionnaire that will be sent out to all involved parties including scientific investigators and project managers.  These results will help in establishing database structure and to determine operational data needs.  An on-line field catalog will support field activities and will contain field reports and data products for review and exchange during the progression of the field programs.  Information included in the catalog is anticipated to include satellite images and early data products that may be useful to other ongoing work.  Experience with past large research projects has shown that data management components such as this are essential to effective database generation and data dissemination, while the field catalog can be very helpful in project coordination and in optimizing field sampling.",
