 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science on Patrol (SOP), a demonstration project of the Institute for Schools of the \r\nFuture and the Police Athletic League in collaboration with the Manhattan Robbery Squad,\r\nthe Crime Scene Unit, the Arson and Explosion Squad and other units of the New York City\r\nPolice Department Detective Division, selected New York City public schools, community\r\noutreach organizations, science professionals and database and Web designers, is designed\r\nto promote interest and achievement in science by providing youngsters compelling \r\nproblems ('crimes') they can solve by applying the scientific processes and skills\r\nactually used by crime scene investigators to solve crimes. This approach capitalizes on \r\nthe interest in high profile crimes treated in the popular press, movies and current\r\ntelevision programs. The informal science project is aimed squarely at raising the level of\r\nparticipation and achievement in science for adolescent females and other members of \r\nunderrepresented minority groups by achieving thee goals:\r\n\r\n1. using research-based strategies to attract and retain underrepresented minorities, particularly\r\n     females, in informal science programs;\r\n2. increasing their interest and achievement in science knowledge and skills; and\r\n3. raising their awareness and interest in science-based careers.\r\n\r\nThis project will roll out through an existing structure, PAL centers in the Bronx in Year\r\nOne, in PAL centers throughout New York City in Year Two and in PAL centers across \r\nthe country in Year Three. Interdisciplinary teams comprising PAL center instructors,\r\neducators, police detectives, instructional designers, and scientists will work \r\ncollaboratively to: (1) develop, field test and revise a minimum of 12 crime scenarios\r\nfor the youngsters to solve; (2) develop additional course materials, including a\r\nFacilitator's Guide, the Science on Patrol website, a Student Activities Kits which\r\ninclude case folders for each of the 'crimes', and a manual for mentors and/or volunteers;\r\n(3) increase the participants' capacity to apply science knowledge and processes to solve \r\nreal world problems; and, (4) build the capacity of faculty to implement compelling and \r\nchallenging problems in environments that are gender-neutral, promote collaboration, \r\nencourage problem-solving and reflect both research and best practice for increasing \r\nparticipation and achievement in science-based areas.\r\n\r\nDecades of research on the root causes and outcomes of the under representation of \r\nfemales in mathematics, science and technology have amply demonstrated that the culture\r\nand context of K-16 schooling clearly lies at the heart of the issue. Yet the literature\r\nshows the very factors that constrain participation and achievement of females and other\r\nunderrepresented minorities in higher levels of mathematics and science are alterable.\r\n\r\nScience on Patrol is an innovative project that links science knowledge and skills with \r\nthe real world applications of forensic specialists in a highly motivating course of study\r\nfor middle and high school students. The key element, however, is the comprehensive use \r\nof research-based findings to shape learning environments specifically designed to attract \r\nand retain females and other underrepresentedminorities to advanced study of science and\r\nscience-related careers. Science on Patrol does not single out specific research-based\r\nfactors that promote success for female and other underrepresented minorities.\r\nInstead, it integrates all in an integrated and coherent manner to create learning \r\nenvironments that are friendly to the target population. Information about the culture\r\nand context of these learning environments will be disseminated broadly and serve as a \r\nmodel for other informal science efforts and for school-based K-16 classrooms.",
