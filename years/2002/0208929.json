 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given a metric space, that is a finite set of points with\r\ndistances between them, there are several classical\r\nminimization problems that are hard to solve exactly.  A\r\nprime example is the traveling salesman problem (TSP),\r\nwhere we want to find a cyclic tour visiting all the\r\npoints with minimum total distance.  These problems arise\r\nin a wide range of applications such as manufacturing and\r\ncommunications network design.  In the worst case it is\r\nNP-hard to solve these problems even approximately, that\r\nis with relative error better than some constant threshold.\r\n\r\nRecent results show that these problems are easier in\r\nmetric spaces that often arise in practice.  In particular\r\nif the distances are geometric, or if they are given by\r\nshortest paths in a simple graph (such as a planar graph),\r\nthen the TSP and similar problems have approximation\r\nschemes.  These schemes run in polynomial or\r\nquasi-polynomial time, with the exponent depending on the\r\ndesired relative error.  The main techniques include\r\nseparators, spanners, and dynamic programming. In\r\nparticular a spanner is a subgraph of a given graph, whose\r\nshortest path metric is a close approximation of the\r\noriginal. In various graph families we can find spanners\r\nwith a useful tradeoff between the total weight and the\r\nrelative error.\r\n\r\nThis research continues the development of these\r\ntechniques, in particular seeking better spanner\r\nconstructions and possibly some useful lower bounds.  One\r\ngoal of the project is some progress on two unsolved\r\nvariants:  the geometric case in the presence of\r\nobstacles, and the graphical case in the presence of many\r\nextra ``Steiner'' points.",
