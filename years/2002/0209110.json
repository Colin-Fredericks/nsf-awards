 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this research is to produce practical codes that provide\r\nunequaled robustness, approaching the performance predicted by compound\r\nchannel information theory for linear Gaussian channels.  The resulting\r\nchannel codes will find application in many scenarios including wired and\r\nwireless broadcast, wireless local area networks, asymmetric digital\r\nsubscriber lines, military anti-jam communications, and frequency hopped\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nResults from compound channel information theory state that a single code\r\nexists that supports communication over every channel that has a mutual\r\ninformation above the information rate of the code.  Thus, once the\r\ntransmitter power spectrum is fixed, a code need not be specialized to a\r\nparticular frequency selective channel in a single antenna system or a\r\nparticular space-time path-gain matrix in a multiple antenna system.  While\r\nthis theoretical result is more that thirty years old, practical code design\r\nhas focused to date on a weaker notion of robustness, that of average\r\nperformance according to a statistical channel model, such as Rayleigh\r\nfading.  The power of the code design approach taken in this\r\nresearch is that the code design is independent of statistical assumptions\r\nabout the channel.  The code simply works on every channel that it possibly\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nA second goal of this research is to develop codes that support multiple\r\nrates to different users.  Here again, information theory (this time\r\ninformation theory for degraded broadcast channels) lays out the limits of\r\nperformance.  Our research will closely approach these performance limits by\r\napplying turbo codes to the concept of superposition coding for the degraded\r\nbroadcast channel.\r\n",
