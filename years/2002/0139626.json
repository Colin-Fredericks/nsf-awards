 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knight and her students will work on various aspects of\r\ncomputable structure theory.  Knight plans to continue work with\r\nD'Aquino on weak fragments of arithmetic.  She expects also to\r\ncontinue work with Goncharov and Harizanov, with Young, and with\r\nShore, on a collection of inter-related problems involving\r\ncomplicated relations on computable structures, structures of\r\nhigh rank, and paths through Kleene's O.  She is currently\r\nworking with Csima, Hirschfeldt, and Soare on prime models and\r\nlowness properties.  She plans to work with Lempp, McCoy, and\r\nSolomon on Boolean algebras.  The funds are mainly for student\r\ntravel and books.  The remainder is for partial support of the\r\nNotre Dame Logic Seminar.  Currently, Knight has two students.\r\nAndrew Arana, who may finish this summer, has a number of results\r\non complexity in arithmetic, using some new independent sentences\r\n(variants of the Godel-Rosser sentence).  Arana is now\r\nconcentrating on problems of a more foundational nature.  Wesley\r\nCalvert, a second year student, is working on complexity of the\r\nisomorphism problem for various familiar classes of computable\r\nstructures.  He already has results for several classes of\r\nfields.  Knight may acquire new students during the period of the\r\ngrant.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Knight's research, and that of students working with\r\nher, is to determine which aspects of mathematical structures are\r\ncomputable, and for those which are not computable, whether there\r\nis some nice, computable approximation.  The grant will\r\nfacilitate new work of this kind.  There is a larger\r\ngoal---enabling students to become first-rate research\r\nscientists.  The grant will be used mainly for student travel and\r\nbooks.  Without money for books, Knight's students would hardly\r\nown any.  She has found that, given money to buy the most\r\nimportant references, her students read much more than they would\r\notherwise.  They see how the problems they are working on arose,\r\nand what their work means for the field as a whole.  Knight's\r\npast students, and other logic students at Notre Dame, have\r\nbenefited tremendously from opportunities to travel to meetings.\r\nThey meet researchers from other universities and hear about new\r\ndevelopments.  As soon as they have results of their own, they\r\ngive talks, and they get valuable suggestions.  In short, they\r\nhave the opportunity, as students, to join the community of\r\nresearch mathematicians.\r\n",
