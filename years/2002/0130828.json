Wheeler-University of Illinois-BITS:  Information processing in Designed Neuronal Circuits\r\n\r\nBITS:  Information processing in Designed Neuronal Circuits\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to enhance our understanding of information processing by small numbers of neurons arranged in designed circuits.  This is an ideal time for this initiative because:\r\n  \r\nWe can intentionally design neuronal microcircuits due to progress in serum free media to support relatively pure neuronal populations, in microlithgraphy as applied to the deposition of proteins and other biomolecules to surfaces, and in understanding of the conditions under which sparse pattern populations of neurons become functionally active in culture.\r\n\r\nWe can study the information processing capabilities of these neuronal circuits due to advances microelectrode array technology, permitting both stimulation and recording of electrical activity, as well as the supporting real-time data acquisition technology.\t\r\n\r\nWe can analyze the data utilizing theories of neural coding derived as applications of rich theoretical foundations in signal processing and communications theory.\r\n\r\nWe have three specific goals, creation of reliable, repeatable, robust neuronal circuits of cultured hippocampal neurons.   Stable circuit behavior is essential to further investigation of information processing.\r\n\r\nThe first aim emphasizes geometric properties, including guiding axonal extension, the second aim emphasizes functional properties, and the third aim is neuronal information processing.  Models to be evaluated include rate codes, precise timing codes and phase synchronization codes. \r\n",
