The co-organizers are Professor Kenneth Hicks at Ohio University and Professor Hajime Shimizu of Yamagata University in Japan.  The workshop will provide a forum for presentations and discussions of the structure of subatomic particles using new results from experiments with polarized photons incident on polarized hydrogen and deuterium.  Both theoretical and experimental techniques will be discussed, with the objective to gain a better interpretation of the data.  \r\n\r\nPlans for new cooperative activities resulting from the workshop will most likely be in the form of new proposals for experiments at the new facilities.  These collaborations would be a natural result of sharing experimental techniques for polarized targets and beams.  In addition, theoretical input from experts across the globe will be highly desirable to provide an overview of the role of non-perturbative QCD in the interpretation of precise polarization observables to be presented at the workshop.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of many junior faculty, postdocs and graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. The researchers plan to publish proceedings of the workshop through either the World Scientific Publishing Company or through the Jefferson Laboratory.  \r\n",
