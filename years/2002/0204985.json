 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT  DMS - 0204985   PI: Borthwick\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will study spectral geometry in three basic contexts.  \r\nFor smooth infinite-volume hyperbolic manifolds (without cusps), he will study \r\nthe question of finiteness of classes of surfaces with the same resonance set,\r\nrefine techniques involving determinants that he and his co-authors \r\nhave already developed, and study resonances as functions of the deformation\r\nspace of a hyperbolic structure.  For the more general class of asymptotically\r\nhyperbolic manifolds, the main goal is to analyze the determinants and relative\r\ndeterminants and use them to derive geometric constraints from resonance data.\r\nThe techniques developed  will be applied to define determinants and obtain\r\nconstraints for exterior domains in two and three dimensions as well.\r\nA final goal is to understand the basic spectral theory of a broader \r\nclass of negatively curved surfaces.  Here the objectives are to determine \r\nthe essential spectrum and prove a limiting absorption principle which will \r\ncharacterize the essential spectrum and lead towards the establishment of a \r\nscattering theory.\r\n\r\nGeometric spectral theory lies at the interface of the fields of differential \r\ngeometry and mathematical physics.  In physical theories such as quantum \r\nmechanics or wave propagation, one can draw a natural distinction\r\nbetween geometric properties of a system, meaning the underlying structure,\r\nand analytic properties, which reflect how the physics of the system behaves.\r\nAnalytic properties, of which the spectrum is a prime example,\r\nare generally the aspects of a system most readily determined\r\nby experiment (for example, component colors of light emitted by stars, or\r\nfrequency spikes in a radar scan).   In many physical applications, \r\nthe basic goal is to derive information about the geometric structure from the \r\nspectral data.  The PI will pursue this goal in settings for which one already \r\nhas good sources of conjectures and mathematical tools.  \r\nUnderstanding the spectral theory of these cases\r\nwill provide new geometric invariants of interest in differential geometry,\r\nwhile developing intuition for problems of a more applied nature.\r\n",
