With this award, Professor Felix Castellano will design, synthesize and characterize photochromic luminescent quenchers based on transition metal complexes dispersed in polymer matrices.  Metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excited states using a series of Ru (II) and Re (I) compounds in polymer matrices will be used for a variety of data storage applications such as write-once-read-many systems and read-write-erase systems.  One- and two-photon photochemical and photophysical processes of these polymer composites will be determined to evaluate potential photonic device applications. Development of new inorganic chemistry laboratory course in partnership with a private science center will provide new education and training opportunities to students.  Planned science exhibits will reach a large segment of population including students at different educational levels.\r\n\r\nPhotochromic luminescent quenchers based on Ruthenium and Rhenium complexes dispersed in polymer matrices will be designed, synthesized and characterized.
