 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nLand-use change and alterations of plant diversity and composition have been shown to\r\ninfluence ecosystem processes. Until recently, however, there has been little evaluation of\r\nthe role of microbial community changes in mediating process change. Shifts in land-use\r\nand plant diversity may alter the composition, and thus collective physiology, of soil\r\nmicrobial communities, leading to differences in process rates. To understand more fully\r\nthe factors that influence microbial communities and their functioning, our research\r\naddresses the following questions: 1) Does plant diversity and/or land-use influence soil\r\nmicrobial community composition? 2) Do these changes in microbial composition\r\ninfluence nutrient cycling rates? We are addressing these questions using an experiment\r\nin Costa Rica that manipulates plant community composition and diversity as well as a\r\nset of land-use sites, including forest and pasture. To address the first question, we are\r\nexamining microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid analysis\r\n(PLFA) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP). PLFA data\r\nsuggest that microbial communities differ significantly across plant diversity and land-\r\nuse gradients. We request funds to proceed to the crucial second question and test, using\r\ncontrolled laboratory experiments, whether soils with distinct microbial communities\r\ndiffer in two critical ecosystem functions: nitrification and litter decomposition.",
