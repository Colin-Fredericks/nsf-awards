 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides 14 undergraduate (upper classman) and 16 graduate scholarships, focused enrichment activities and support-services to academically talented but financially disadvantaged students including non-traditional students and those from underrepresented groups. The scholarships promote full-time enrollment and academic success in the Master of Science in Systems Technology program and in upper-division computer science curricula. The project encourages more students to pursue degrees in advanced technology needed for national competitiveness in the global economy of the 21st century. \r\n\r\nStudents' classroom and laboratory experiences are enriched through advanced technology utilization, research training, and interaction with industry partners. \r\n\r\nStudent support strategies build upon institutional resources as well as established industry linkage to further Scholars' career success. At least half of the scholarships assist students from underrepresented groups. Project components include: recruitment; selection; financial assistance; student support services including faculty and peer mentoring; and professional development, research and internship opportunities.\r\n",
