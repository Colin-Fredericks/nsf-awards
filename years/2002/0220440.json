The PI has planned a CAREER proposal-writing workshop in conjunction with a Southeastern Universities and Colleges Coalition for Engineering Education (SUCCEED) Regional Conference to be held on March 3, 2002 at the The University of Florida Doubletree Hotel and Conference Center in Gainesville, Florida.  It is a general goal of the CAREER program to achieve a broader diversity of proposing individuals and institutions.  The establishment of regional workshops for young investigators is one method of accomplishing this goal. The PI has invited young faculty from about 40 schools in the southeastern region.  Institutions in most of the southeastern states are invited to send representatives.  Funding will provide travel grants for the participants.  This workshop is intended to help young PIs become more competitive in receiving initial grants, especially CAREER awards.  In addition, the PIs will be invited to stay for the remainder of the SUCCEED conference (March 3 - 5), which will focus on educational issues such as teaching effectiveness, mentoring, and assessment.\r\n",
