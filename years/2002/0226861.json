Wordnet is a lexical database for English that has been widely adopted in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics for a variety of practical applications.  The basic elements of WordNet are sets of words that are linked according to semantic relations:  synonomy, antonymy, superordination, and so forth.  WordNet is publicly available, widely used, and is currently being into a multilingual database.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a set of tools that can be applied to current and future versions of WordNet to extend it for knowledge processing applications.  The extensions are enhancements of the glosses that currently contain definitions, comments, and examples of sets of words that are linked in WordNet.  Enhanced glosses will be syntactically parsed, will have each word tagged with its part of speech, and will themselves be linked with other glosses that describe related concepts.\r\n",
