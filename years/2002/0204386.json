 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0204386\r\nDaniel Ruberman, Jerome Levine, and Kiyoshi Igusa\t\r\n\r\nThe topology group at Brandeis University proposes research on knot \r\ntheory and 3-manifolds, gauge-theory and 4-manifolds, and on higher \r\nReidemeister torsion of families of manifolds.  Jerome Levine plans \r\nto continue his study of finite type invariants of 3-manifolds. In \r\nparticular, he plans to investigate a graphical interpretation of a \r\nnew surgery-theoretic theory proposed in a recent paper. He also will \r\ninvestigate various questions concerning boundary link invariants \r\nsuch as the signature-type invariant and the relationship between the \r\nFarber invariant and non-commutative Reidemeister torsion.   Daniel \r\nRuberman's research uses gauge theory to investigate the geometry and \r\ntopology of 4-dimensional manifolds.  He will extend his program of \r\nusing Seiberg-Witten theory and Yang-Mills theory to explore families \r\nof diffeomorphisms of 4-manifolds and  positive scalar curvature \r\nmetrics on a 4-manifold.  Further work explores whether finiteness \r\ntheorems of Riemannian geometry hold in dimension 4.  Seiberg-Witten \r\nand Donaldson theory will also be used to investigate a simple but \r\nimportant class of non-simply-connected 4-manifolds.  Kiyoshi Igusa's \r\nwork extends his study of higher Franz-Reidemeister torsion to the \r\ncomplex case and to various new spaces of graphs.   He will use this \r\nto interpret the Miller-Morita-Mumford classes in terms of the higher \r\nFranz-Reidemeister (FR) torsion.\r\n\r\nOur research encompasses a number of themes in geometry and topology. \r\nOne of these is the interplay between topology and algebra, and \r\nanother is the interplay between topology and theoretical physics. \r\nTo study spaces or other topological objects such as knots, we encode \r\nsome aspects of the space into familiar algebraic objects such as \r\nmatrices or polynomials.   Some of the algebra used to study \r\n3-dimensional objects is connected with ideas developed by physicists \r\nto understand quantum field theory, especially the Feynmann integral. \r\nInvestigating this interplay contributes to our understanding of the \r\n3-dimensional world in which we live.   Part of our work is concerned \r\nwith the evolution of spaces--the study of the way in which they \r\nchange as some parameter is varied.  Some of the research in this \r\ndirection develops algebraic tools which apply in the case when there \r\nare many independent parameters.   Another component studies the \r\nevolution of 4-dimensional spaces and geometries, using techniques \r\narising in gauge theory, a fundamental geometrical tool in \r\ntheoretical physics.\r\n\r\n",
