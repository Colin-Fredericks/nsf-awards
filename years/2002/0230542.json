Moreover, as a women's college, SBC is concerned with the\r\nongoing dramatic under representation of women in undergraduate and graduate\r\nengineering programs and in the engineering workforce.\r\nIn response, SBC is requesting this planning grant in order to initiate\r\nthe reform and upgrade of its engineering curriculum. The objective of this\r\nproject is to develop an extensive engineering curriculum at SBC, which would\r\nbe only the second such program in the nation at a liberal arts institution\r\nfor women.\r\nSBC currently offers students a dual degree program with a number of\r\ncooperating institutions. Students follow a pre-engineering curriculum and\r\ncomplete a bachelor's degree from SBC and either a bachelor's, or in one case\r\na master's, degree in engineering from the other university. The program\r\nupgrade will be to institute a true engineering curriculum at SBC: five\r\ncourses at the introductory and intermediate level that will comprise the\r\ncore sequence of an Engineering Science major, which will be supplemented by\r\nresearch and internship opportunities. The curriculum will be designed to\r\ncomplement the strong liberal arts and study abroad traditions of SBC and to\r\nallow the students to take full advantage of the proven nurturing environment\r\nof a women's college.\r\n",
