 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year national Teacher Enhancement project that leads to a Master of Natural Science degree from Arizona State University.  It can be completed within three summers.  The physics and integrated chemistry-physics courses for the degree program are tailored to meet the needs of inservice teachers and have three main categories of:  1) Research-based physics pedagogy and peer community building in accord with the NSES; 2) Interdisciplinary courses to promote collaboration among teachers in different sciences; and 3) Major advances in 20th century physics taught by research faculty.  The courses are complemented by a Leadership Workshop offered one day a week.  All courses will be offered in the summer to make the program accessible to teachers nationwide.  Teaching Associates drawn from the Hestenes' Modeling Physics project will share in the course instruction.  During the three years the project will enroll 75 residential teachers and 75 local teachers.",
