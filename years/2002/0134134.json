 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a great demand for next-generation optical communication devices that are capable of wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) switching while avoiding optical-electronic-optical interconnects which compromise transmission speed. Compound semiconductors such as Indium Phosphide (InP) have direct bandgaps that allow active optical devices like lasers and optical amplifiers to be realized - an advantage over silicon, an indirect bandgap material limited primarily to electronic devices. The monolithic integration of InP-based active optoelectronics with micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) actuators will enable the realization of versatile WDM lossless switches, tunable lasers and tunable optical filters at 1.55 mm. At this wavelength optical fibers have minimal losses. This CAREER award supports an interdisciplinary research and education program by combining the three technical areas of MEMS, optoelectronics, and microfabrication of III-V materials for integrated optical microsystems. \r\n\r\nThe research component aims to demonstrate the advantages of using InP-based materials in monolithic integration of MEMS and optical structures by reducing the optical losses on the chip, thus making complex devices achievable. The initial focus of this program is to investigate the electro-mechanical behavior of InP for development of electrostatically driven linear microactuators. The results of this study will enable the use of InP-based materials for (1) development of an innovative 4x4 optical cross-connect switch by combining the MEMS linear microactuators and optical waveguides and (2) integration of the optical cross-connect switch with semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) to minimize optical losses in the microsystem. The educational component focuses on a research oriented curriculum by integrating well-formulated research problems in teaching undergraduate and graduate level courses in MEMS and Microsystems and by exposing students to hands-on experience, industrial practice, and teamwork in both classrooms and laboratories. An early exposure of students to interactive research environments is accomplished by providing avenues for direct interaction between undergraduate and graduate students on collaborative research projects. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
