 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a 5-year REU Site in Bridge Engineering at the University of Delaware, under the direction of Dr. Michael J. Chajes.  This 10-week summer program will provide 10 students from other institutions,  with research projects focused on bridge engineering based on the growing base of expertise in this area at the University of Delaware.  The program recruitment efforts will focus heavily on students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) and on female undergraduates who have up to now not been significantly represented in this traditionally male-dominated field.  This REU program will be administered by the Center for Innovative Bridge Engineering (CIBE) which was established at the University of Delaware in 2000 to serve as a primary resource for the world's highway and railroad bridge owners.   Each student will work on an individual research project and will be assigned a faculty member as her/his research mentor.  In addition, the students will participate in weekly seminars where they will have the opportunity to discuss their work with fellow students, and hear from researchers, practicing bridge engineers and graduate students on topics of mutual interest.  The students will also participate in field trips, several bridge tours, and will prepare and submit a brief report for presentation at a research symposium.",
