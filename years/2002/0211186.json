Tomentosoides, involves field surveys and experiments at Lough Hyne, Ireland, the Channel Islands, the English Channel Coast and Atlantic French Coast.  Cynthia D. Trowbridge of Oregon State University, Colin Little of Bristol University, William F. Farnham of University of Portsmouth, and Alan Critchley of Degussa, Texturan Systems Research Centre, will conduct research on ecological mechanisms inhibiting or facilitating invasion of Codium fragile.  This macroalga is a widely distributed temperate seaweed that has spread across geographic regions and international boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe investigators propose to conduct field surveys of invaded regions and field experiments testing causal mechanisms.  They will document community attributes of the French and English shores to determine whether the invasive agla establishes itself primarily in disturbed communities.  In the intertidal community of Lough Hyne, they will explore inhibiting and facilitating mechanisms, such as high cover of intertidal seaweed, high densities of fauna grazers, and low nutrient levels. The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in the genus C. fragile and marine zoology.  This is complemented by Dr. Farnham's expertise on introduced macroalgae, Dr. Critchley's expertise macroalgae biology, and Dr. Little's experience in intertidal communities.  Insights into causes and conditions conducive to seaweed invasions could prevent future spread and impact coastal management practice.\r\n",
