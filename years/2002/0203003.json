 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric confinement of electrons in quantum structures including films, nano wires, and nano dots leads to quantization and the formation of discrete states or subbands.  As a result, electronic properties including the total energy, electronic charge distribution, and density of states can exhibit quantum variations as a function of system size and boundary conditions.  The structure and dynamic properties may also be affected due to electron-lattice and electron-phonon coupling.  This project aims at a fundamental understanding of these quantum effects and phenomena.  The proposed work will include photoemission at the Synchrotron Radiation Center in Stoughton, Wisconsin, and x-ray scattering and diffraction at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.  Besides the quest for fundamental knowledge, an important mission of this project is the education and training of students and postdoctoral research associates.  The rigorous training provided by this project involving national synchrotron radiation facilities, state-of-the-art instruments, and detailed theoretical modeling matches well with the highly technical personnel needs of universities, industry, and national laboratories.\r\n\r\nNanoscale features prepared on solid surfaces in the form of thin films, narrow wires, and small dots offer opportunities for creating novel properties.  Namely, electrons in the system, confined by the geometry, can exhibit modified electronic structure, and thus the physical properties of the system can be size-dependent and thereby tunable.  This project aims at a fundamental understanding of these quantum effects and phenomena. The proposed work will include photoemission measurements of the electronic structure at the Synchrotron Radiation Center in Stoughton, Wisconsin, and x-ray scattering and diffraction studies of the lattice structure at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.
