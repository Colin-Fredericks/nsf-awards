The outcome of the project will be a comprehensive study and potential impact assessment of how increased investment in STEM can attract more Navajo students into these fields of study, identification of professional needs of faculty, as well as how these actions will potentially effect the economic status and quality of life of the peoples of the Navajo Nation.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of the project are to increase STEM resources to allow faculty to encourage and mentor students in scientific study and research, and to develop avenues for students to return to their homelands and help their own people, thus completing the circle of their journey.\r\n",
