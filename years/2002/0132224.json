 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to investigate the formation of drinking water contaminants.  Compounds which are formed by the reaction of chlorinating (and in some cases brominating) agents with humic acids and other organic materials will be studied.  A number of phenol and resorcinol related humic acid models, which have received little attention previously, will be chlorinated and brominated in a variety of solvents and the reaction products will be identified.  Reactions of dichloramine, the active chlorinating agent at near neutral pH in water, with phenols will be studied.  Reactions involving humic acid models and oxidants containing chlorine-oxygen bonds will also receive attention.  Similar studies with brominating agents will also be performed. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Victor L. Heasley of the Department of Chemistry at Point Loma Nazarene College.  Dr. Heasley will explore contaminant formation which occurs during the treatment of drinking water with chlorinating agents.  Models of naturally occurring humic acids (plant material found in all waters) will be treated with chlorine and bromine and the reaction products determined.  Understanding these reactions should provide information about how water purification can be accomplished in conjunction with minimizing the amount of these byproducts formed.  Students trained as a result of working on this RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) project will gain experience in environmental chemistry as well as organic chemistry.   These undergraduate students typically go on to work in the pharmaceutical or specialty chemical industries or go on to advanced study in graduate or medical schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
