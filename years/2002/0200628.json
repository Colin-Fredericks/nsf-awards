Most of these problems are in the sub-field of non-linear\r\nPDE, and some in linear PDE. The non-linear problems\r\narise naturally from Physics and\r\nGeometry and the interaction of Physics and Geometry. \r\nThe linear problems are also tied in with\r\nGeometry and Physics. There\r\nis a strong focus in this proposal on various qualitative\r\nfeatures of solutions to PDE, their level lines, nodal lines\r\nof eigenfunctions, smoothness of solutions and so on. \r\nWe have selected the problems in part because we view many of them as having very natural connections with classical Harmonic analysis, and in fact we have made some start on solving them using techniques from classical Harmonic analysis. This is described in the body of the proposal. Some of the problems that arise from Physics in our proposal are connected with the phenomena of\r\nvortices. Here we continue work that was funded by previous grants.\r\nThe vortices we study are those that arise from fluid flow on\r\ntwo-dimensional spheres and on the plane. Taking the continuum limit of the \r\npoint vortex distribution leads us to a new technique for solving the prescribed \r\nGauss curvature equation which also gives a tremendous insight into conformally invariant PDE's. Problems are also posed\r\nthat stem from the Schrodinger equation and Geometry and its\r\ninfluence on the spectrum of elliptic operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe single out an important component of the proposed research\r\nproposal. In todays environment it has become important to\r\nstudy so-called smart materials, more principally composites.\r\nBecause of their lightness they are preferred materials\r\nto use for their strength and lightness. In this proposal\r\nwe study as one problem the vibrational characteristics\r\nof composites. In particular how should one build objects using\r\ncomposite materials so as to minimize their basic vibrational characteristics.\r\nIntuitively the larger the natural frequency with which\r\nan object vibrates, the more it is susceptible to stress\r\nand breakage. For example one question one can ask is, if we need to \r\nbuild a symmetric object like a washer does it\r\nmean the composite has to be arranged symmetrically respecting\r\nthe symmetry of the washer? We find that in our research for example that\r\nthis necessarily does not minimize the stresses that can be caused by vibration\r\nand we need to arrange the composite in a non-symmetric way\r\nto construct the washer. This is not the only problem we study in our\r\nproposal but also problems in Differential Geometry and Physics.\r\n\r\n",
