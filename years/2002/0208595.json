 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kolmogorov complexity is a modern theory of randomness\r\nand has many applications in computer science and\r\nother fields. The investigator is enriching this theory\r\nand its applications by doing research in two directions.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm\r\nis at the heart of practical algorithm analysis. \r\nIt has been demonstrated over the past decade that \r\nKolmogorov complexity is a powerful tool to help analyzing the \r\naverage-case complexity and the lower bounds of algorithms.\r\nExamples are the average case analysis of Shellsort and Heapsort.\r\nThe PI plans to continue this work to systematically develop \r\nthe tool, the Incompressibility Method.  This involves comparative \r\nstudies to understand why, how, and when \r\nthe incompressibility method\r\nworks. In order to demonstrate, and to uncover,\r\nthe power of this method, this method will be used to solve \r\nother open questions. Samples of some open questions include: \r\nimproving Shellsort average-case lower bound analysis, \r\naverage height of balanced trees, and Stack sorting lower bound.\r\n \r\nThe modern information age and the post-genomic era raises a \r\nfundamental question: Given two sequences (genomes or English\r\ndocuments), how much information do they share? For example,\r\ngiven two genomes, can we measure their evolutionary distance? \r\nThe goal of this second part of the proposal is to understand \r\nthis fundamental question and develop tools.\r\nIn the past, the PI and his coauthors have partially answered this\r\nquestion by defining the concept of Information Distance. \r\nInformation Distance measures the absolute\r\nthermodynamic energy required to convert one sequence to another.\r\nHowever, it does not measure evolutionary distance because\r\ngenomic evolution allows long segment deletion/insertion, cheaply.\r\nA new theory suitable for such evolutionary distance will be\r\ndeveloped.  To demonstrate the feasibility of this research,\r\nsome preliminary theory has been proposed and successfully applied to \r\nconstruct whole genome and chain letter phylogenies when no other\r\nmethod applies. More recently, this theory has also been\r\napplied to program plagiarism detection and language classification. \r\n",
