The three broad\r\nproblem areas to be investigated are\r\n     1) The initiation and dynamics of cardiac arrhythmias;\r\n     2) The dynamics of defibrillation;\r\n     3) The dynamics of autoimmune disease.\r\nThe study of these problems involves the development and use of\r\nsophisticated mathematical models and tools, including advanced\r\nnumerical methods such as immersed boundary methods, bifurcation\r\ntheory and dynamical systems theory, and asymptotic analysis.\r\nThese tools are used to give theoretical understanding to problems\r\nof border zone and ischemia related cardiac arrhythmias, APD\r\ninstabilities and their relationship to the onset and development\r\nof reentrant arrhythmias, mechanical alternans deriving from\r\ninstabilities of the calcium handling system or crossbridge\r\ndynamics, the success or failure of defibrillation, and\r\noscillatory autoimmune responses.  Serious attention is given to\r\nobtaining agreement between theoretical results and experimental\r\nfindings.  To that end collaborations with experimentalists\r\nexamine gap junction coupling of rabbit myocytes, the effect of\r\nhypertrophy on excitation-contraction coupling through the\r\nsodium-calcium exchanger, the effect of mutations on the delayed\r\nrectifier potassium channel that lead to increased proclivity\r\nfor fatal arrhythmias, and the role of mimicry in oscillatory\r\ndynamics of cystic fibrosis in mice.\r\n     Excitability is one of the most important features enabling\r\nsignalling in physiological systems.  It is crucial to the\r\noperation of nerves, muscle, the heart, the immune system, and\r\nblood clotting as well as numerous gene regulatory networks.  The\r\nspecific goal of this project is to gain an improved theoretical\r\nunderstanding of how the normal function of systems that rely on\r\nexcitability can go awry, exhibiting pathological behaviors, and\r\nhow these pathological behaviors might be controlled or\r\nprevented.  The behaviors that are studied here are the result of\r\ninterwoven interactions of simpler behaviors, resulting in\r\ncomplex behaviors that defy understanding through intuition or\r\nsimple means.  The investigation therefore focuses on the\r\ndevelopment and analysis of mathematical models of these\r\nbehaviors in the belief that substantial new and important\r\ninsights can be gained, and new hypotheses formulated that are\r\nnot apparent from phenomenological descriptions.  While this\r\nproject has as its main focus several problems relating to\r\nabnormalities of the cardiac cycle, it extends far beyond to many\r\nareas of physiology where common principles are involved.  The\r\nproject includes a significant training component for students.\r\n",
