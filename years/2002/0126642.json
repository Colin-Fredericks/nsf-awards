 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York College at Geneseo is modernizing its Biochemistry, Inorganic, Physical, and Analytical Chemistry laboratory curriculum with the purchase of an Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (ITC) and a Real-Time PCR Thermalcycler/Sequence Detector. The motivation stems from our strong desire to broaden our students' experience with modern biochemistry instrumentation, increase inquiry- and discovery-based laboratory experiments for active learning, and to improve participation in undergraduate research projects that we believe are an integral part of a chemistry or biochemistry education. Our ultimate goal is to produce students who are excited about science and who possess the necessary skills and problem-solving abilities to solve timely and important problems.\r\n\r\nA number of discovery-based experiments utilizing the ITC and the Real-Time PCR Thermalcycler/Sequence Detector are being adapted from the research and/or education literature. Experiments utilizing the Real-Time PCR Thermalcycler are being carried out in the biochemistry laboratory. ITC experiments are being done in the Biochemistry, Inorganic and Physical/Analytical Laboratories. For example, ITC experiments on the study of molecular interactions, developed by Professor Lawrence Kaplan at Williams College (NSF DUE 9850820) and Professor Timothy Elgren at Hamilton College, NY (NSF-DUE 9951375), are being implemented into our biochemistry laboratory. Both Professor Kaplan and Professor Elgren have kindly shared their programs with us and have agreed to serve as test sites for our inquiry-based laboratories. We believe that inclusion of experiments using these instruments are significantly enhancing the education of our students at Geneseo.\r\n",
