This will be done from the perspective of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow\r\nconjecture and algebro-geometric analogues of this conjecture currently\r\nbeing developed by M. Gross and B. Siebert. These ideas will be pursued\r\nwith a goal of finding a general mirror symmetry construction, associating\r\nto any polarized maximally unipotent degeneration of Calabi-Yau manifolds a mirror family\r\nof polarized Calabi-Yau  manifolds. Implications of these ideas to understanding\r\nthe behaviour of Ricci-flat metrics near maximally unipotent degenerations\r\nand the counting of rational curves using the notion of log Gromov-Witten\r\ninvariants will also be pursued.\r\n\r\nThe work proposed by M. Gross lies at the intersection of string theory\r\nand geometry. String theory replaces the traditional notion of \r\nthe point particle with a small loop of string, moving through space-time.\r\nTo make string theory compatible with quantum mechanics, space-time must\r\nbe ten-dimensional. Since space-time appears four-dimensional, one expects \r\nsix of these dimensions to be a very small `curled up' geometric object. \r\nThese geometric objects are called Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the early\r\n1990s, string theorists proposed a remarkable association between\r\ncompletely different Calabi-Yau manifolds: certain calculations extremely\r\ndifficult to perform on one Calabi-Yau manifold could be completed\r\nby performing completely different, and much easier, calculations on\r\na different Calabi-Yau manifold. This discovery was known as mirror symmetry.\r\nSince this time, many geometers have been trying to understand \r\nthe mathematics behind this miraculous observation. The work of M. Gross\r\nhopes to give mathematical insight and explanation for the phenomenon\r\nof mirror symmetry.\r\n",
