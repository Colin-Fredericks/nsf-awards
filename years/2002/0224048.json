In particular, we are \r\nconcerned with the existence, stability, and variety of spatial patterns in \r\ninteracting and reacting systems which exhibit threshold behavior.  Not \r\njust stationary patterns but also those which evolve in a predictable way.  \r\nThe systems of equations arise in the field of computational neural \r\nnetworks designed to perform specialized tasks such as automatic image \r\nrecognition.  They also arise in population dynamics, in models of phase \r\ntransitions, in models of the primary visual cortex of the brain, and in \r\ncomputer simulation of a wide variety of continuum processes where \r\ndiscretization is the standard approach.  Results from the project will have \r\na direct impact on the understanding of computational experiments and on \r\nthe assumptions on which the mathematical models of many physical \r\nphenomena rest.\r\n\r\nFrom one perspective, the project explores some of the basic challenges of \r\npresent day material science: The modeling of processes which cause and \r\naccompany change of phases or crystalline variants of a substance. New \r\nmathematical models are being continually proposed, with the hope of \r\nshedding insight into the basic physics of these processes. Successful \r\nmodeling can offer help in the development of new high performance \r\nmaterials, which is vital to economic and other national interests.  From \r\nanother perspective, the theoretical study of neural networks will lead to \r\nthe development of automatic pattern recognition, useful in such widely \r\ndiverse areas as text analysis, target identification, and image \r\nenhancement.\r\n",
