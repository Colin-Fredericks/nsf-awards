 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morse is working on a project involving a filtration for \r\nthe space of symmetric functions that depends on a positive \r\ninteger k.  In earlier work, Lapointe, Lascoux, and Morse \r\nintroduced new families of polynomials that lie in these subspaces,\r\nand they made a number of assertions relying on their characterization \r\nof these elements.  Among these conjectures is one stating \r\nthat their elements form a basis for the k-subspaces of the symmetric \r\nfunction space and that the Macdonald polynomials expand positively on \r\nthis new basis.  More generally, their claims lead to a family of \r\npositivity conjectures which will provide a natural refinement for \r\nmany fundamental concepts in symmetric function theory.  For example, \r\ntheir elements appear to play a role in the k-subspaces analogous to \r\nthe important role that the Schur functions play for the symmetric \r\nfunction space.  Morse is working on proving these conjectures and is also \r\ninvestigating the possible representation theoretic interpretation \r\nfor these polynomials.\r\n\r\nThe theory of symmetric functions is a classical part of \r\nmathematics with a wide variety of applications in fields\r\nincluding physics, engineering, and computer science.\r\nRecent development in the study of symmetric functions\r\nwas made with the introduction in 1988 of a new family of\r\nsymmetric functions called the Macdonald polynomials.\r\nRemarkably, these polynomials have also been found to play an\r\nimportant role in areas such as geometry, representation \r\ntheory, and many-body physics.  The successful completion of \r\nthis project would prove important properties of the Macdonald \r\npolynomials and more generally, would provide a natural refinement \r\nfor the fundamental concepts in symmetric function theory.",
