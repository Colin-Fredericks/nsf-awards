 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe project is aimed at understanding the causes of population dynamics in two \r\nspecies of reef fish at the meso-scale (over areas tens of km in extent).  Most reef fishes, and \r\nother benthic marine species, have a complex life cycle that includes a site-attached adult phase \r\nand a larval stage during which individuals may disperse long distances across open ocean.  \r\nMuch debate has centered on whether benthic population dynamics are controlled by the influx \r\nof pelagic larvae (larval settlement) or by density-dependent interactions among juveniles and \r\nadults in the benthic habitat.  Past controversy, based on the notion that density-dependence is \r\nnot compatible with a strong larval-input signal, has been resolved following recognition that \r\nboth pre- and post-settlement processes influence the dynamics of most populations.  One \r\nbroadly applicable hypothesis (the recruit-adult hypothesis) predicts that oceanographic \r\nprocesses controlling the influx of larvae create predictable differences among populations at the \r\nmeso-scale: sites with high settlement are chronically resource limited, whereas sites with low \r\nsettlement rarely reach their carrying capacity and adult densities track larval influx.  The \r\ncarrying capacity of the benthic habitat, and the post-settlement interactions within it, are \r\nassumed to be consistent among meso-scale sites.  All experimental evidence on the nature of \r\npost-settlement interactions is, however, based on study at small spatial scales (a few m's in \r\nextent).  Studies in other environments indicate that population dynamics can potentially vary \r\nwith spatial scale, however, and a major challenge now is to test whether small-scale results in \r\nmarine systems will extrapolate to larger spatial domains.   \r\n\r\nPast small-scale experiments by these investigators on two reef fishes indicate that competition for shelter \r\nsites used as refuges from predation is the cause of small-scale density dependence in both \r\nspecies.  The strength of density dependence, however, depends on the local availability of \r\nshelter, and is eliminated in habitat patches that provide abundant shelter.  They hypothesize that, \r\nin addition to oceanographic processes causing differential settlement, the carrying capacity of \r\nthe benthic habitat will also vary at the meso-scale and cause differences among populations in \r\nthe strength of density-dependent mortality.  In this system, the investigators suggest that carrying \r\ncapacity is a function of shelter abundance.  They will test experimentally for shelter limitation at \r\nthe meso-scale.  To complement  the field work, a mathematical scaling model will be constructed to explicitly link local- and meso-scale populations.  This model will include a functional description of shelter limitation at local scales and will be used to test specific hypotheses for the congruence (or lack of it) in population dynamics at local and meso-scales.   \r\n\r\nTesting the expanded version of the recruit-adult hypothesis will provide a rare \r\nexperimental test of the causal interactions shaping population dynamics at large spatial scales.  \r\nMeso-scale populations are little studied, but a deeper understanding of their dynamics is of \r\npractical importance because it at this scale that marine reserves are designated and at which \r\nmost reef fisheries are managed.  Support for the hypothesis that meso-scale carrying capacity \r\ndepends on shelter provided by the reef would also have important implications for the effects on \r\nfishes of the ongoing habitat degradation on coral reefs.   \r\n\r\n",
