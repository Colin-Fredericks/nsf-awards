 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nAdaptive Teaching and Learning Environments (ATLes) is a project that is providing undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering, and technical students with problem-based, authentic learning activities designed to help them develop problem-solving skills and master content. The ATLes project is founded on constructivist learning theory and peer-to-peer faculty development while using technology to bridge learning goals and promote problem solving. Adaptive Teaching and Learning Environments is a collection of collaborative communication tools and content tutorials in science and mathematics education embedded into generative adaptive tutorials based on progressive disclosure of key concepts, facts, and data. Regardless of the course or topic, ATLes requires students to write hypotheses, sketch problem analyses, and prepare summaries or reports using the same technology-based tools recent graduates are using in the workplace. Additionally, the learning path a student takes through an ATLes course is being tracked, allowing instructors to identify successful learning pathways, and of equal importance, those areas that are not successful, where students struggle with material. Finally, this project incorporates a unique research design that assesses the effect ATLes has on student critical thinking and command of discipline specific knowledge. ATLes development is broken into three major themes: 1) adaptive software \"engine\" design, 2) ATLes lesson module design, and 3) comprehensive assessment of the effects of ATLes on student critical thinking and mastery of discipline- specific knowledge.",
