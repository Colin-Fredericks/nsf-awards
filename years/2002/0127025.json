 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe project is addressing known and significant deficiencies in the way undergraduate students are educated in the chemical sciences by implementing a teaching and learning environment in which the boundaries between lecture and laboratory are eliminated. Building on our preliminary work, we are modifying the Studio-Laboratory concept pioneered by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and California Polytechnic State University, and elements from NSF-CCLI awards (9951346; 9950501; 9952732; 9972293) for our analytical and honors-level chemistry courses. This provides a teaching and learning environment which addresses our students' difficulty in making higher-level connections between theory and practice, and improves the laboratory technique they exhibit in quantitative experimentation. Central to this endeavor is the change from supervision and assessment of \"canned\" experiments to an inquiry-based study of real-world problems and laboratory techniques. A number of novel technological features are being incorporated into our version of the Studio-Laboratory which is divided into stations. Each station, serving up to four students, supports two computers and data interfaces (Vernier Lab Pro) and a diode-array UV-VIS spectrometer. Each group of four stations (a cluster) shares an FT-IR spectrophotometer. The instructor serves as an \"expert-mentor\" and \"guide\" to provide an inquiry-based learning environment rich in real world content and laboratory techniques. WebCT augments the instructor by serving as the gateway to the educational media under development. On-demand video, conceptual animations, and self-paced learning assignments are being designed specifically to help our students build higher-level connections between theory and practice, particularly those who are more visual learners and those requiring additional reinforcement or support. Workshops are being offered to faculty and staff from all universities and colleges in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in order to introduce the university community to the Studio-Laboratory concept. Additional workshops will be held for high school teachers. \r\n",
