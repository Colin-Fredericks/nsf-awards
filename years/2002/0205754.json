 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0205754\r\nHeacox\r\n\r\nDr. William Heacox will analyze gravitational microlens survey data in the current  literature in order to deduce the mass distributions of the objects causing the lensing, and thus help characterize  their  natures.    Microlensing  is  a  promising means  of  detecting  otherwise undetectable planetary- to stellar-mass objects in such locations as the halo of our galaxy, where a large amount of dark matter of unknown nature is known to exist.  In a typical microlens survey, a few  million  stars  in  the  Large  Magellanic  Cloud  are  monitored  periodically  to  detect  the optical amplification caused by gravitational lensing when a Galactic halo object (the lens) passes nearly in  front of a background star (the  source).  While the resulting amplification amplitude depends upon lens mass, it also depends upon such unknowable quantities as the relative velocity of lens and source, and the distance of closest encounter of the lens to the line-of-sight  to  the  source.    This  complication  has  prevented  accurate  estimates  of  lens masses, so that the observation of a few tens of microlenses has not  greatly  aided in the identification of halo dark matter.  Dr. Heacox' research  consists of the application of sophisticated statistical  modeling techniques to the entire set of observed microlenses in a survey, in order to determine the statistical distribution of lens masses (rather than the masses of individual lenses).   The method uses all that is knowable about the kinematics (velocities, distances) of lens and source populations, together with the set of observed microlens parameters, to infer all that can be deduced  about the mass distribution  of the underlying \r\npopulation causing the lensing.   In application to the Galactic halo microlenses, the result \r\nshould be the first credible estimate of the mass distribution of the halo dark matter, and  a \r\nconcomitant increase in our understanding of the nature of this material.  The nature of dark \r\nmatter in the Universe is one of the outstanding problems in modern astronomy; a better \r\nunderstanding of the component in our galaxy will be a useful first step in determining what \r\nmost of the Universe is made of.
