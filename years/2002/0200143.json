 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project seeks to integrate the development of a series of optimization-based models for digital human motion simulation and the synthesis of movement performance descriptors such that the developed models are physically realistic and computationally efficient.  Three new models, formulated as optimization problems, will be developed: (1) an end-point trajectory model, (2) a parameterized differential inverse kinematics model, and (3) a parameterized forward dynamics model.  These models will have open structures to incorporate movement performance descriptors that can be formulated as objective functions, constraints, or parameters, and then be empirically synthesized, tested, and determined.  In return, the determined or evaluated descriptors will allow the models to render complex simulated motions via efficient computations.  The project will employ empirical databases of several types of complex human movements most relevant to computer-aided workplace or vehicle design and virtual prototyping.\r\n\r\nDigital human motion simulation is an integral part of the enabling technology that will profoundly change the process of designing and prototyping a wide variety of products or systems that are used, operated, inhabited, or maintained by human beings.  Such changes, including tremendous cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and quality (usability, serviceability, and manufacturability) enhancement in product development, will be central to the vitality of the US economy and its global competitiveness.  The proposed research identifies and explores a unique and important area for novel, strategic application of various optimization techniques.  A successful completion will lead to a new generation of digital human motion simulation models for computer-aided human-centric design and human-machine systems engineering, and will yield results addressing some of the most fundamental questions about human movement control.  Educational outcomes from this project will include new course materials on advanced modeling tools for a graduate class, and a collection of examples of operations research problems in biomechanics and ergonomics.",
