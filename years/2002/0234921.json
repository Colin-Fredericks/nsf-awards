 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe goal of this Minority Research Planning Grant is to use non-cultivation based methods to\r\ncharacterize the microbial populations associated with natural hydrocarbon seeps in Yellowstone\r\nNational Park. In addition to its well-known hot springs, Yellowstone has a few documented\r\nareas that contain hydrocarbon seeps. These seeps are typically associated with thermal vents and\r\nthe best characterized ones occur in terrestrial areas. The proposed research will focus on soil\r\nsamples to be taken from the Calcite Springs area, where several hydrocarbon seeps exist. The\r\nspecific objectives of this planning grant are:\r\n1. Evaluate soil microbial diversity in Calcite Springs soil containing naturally occurring\r\nhydrocarbons.\r\n2. Examine functional gene diversity and evolutionary relatedness to characterized genes\r\nencoding hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes (PAH dioxygenases).\r\n3. Characterize the abundance and types of hydrocarbons present in Calcite Springs soil\r\nadjacent to hydrocarbon seeps.\r\nClone libraries of 16S rRNA genes and PAH dioxygenase gene fragments will be constructed\r\nand sequenced to identify microorganisms and catabolic pathways present in hydrocarbon-\r\nimpacted soil. A thorough chemical analysis of soil samples (GC-MS) will also be performed to\r\nidentify and quantify the major hydrocarbons present. This study will provide the first\r\ninvestigation into the phylogenetic diversity of soil microbial populations associated with\r\nterrestrial hydrocarbon seeps in Yellowstone National Park. This information is of interest\r\nprimarily due the extended exposure to hydrocarbons that these microbial populations have\r\nreceived. As such, novel microorganisms and/or metabolic pathways may have evolved in this\r\nsetting. As a planning grant targeting underrepresented minorities in science, this award will help\r\nto increase the participation of a minority scientist in NSF-funded research. Furthermore, this\r\nplanning grant will be used to generate sufficient preliminary data for an NSF CAREER proposal\r\nto combine research and teaching efforts focused on the microbial ecology of hydrocarbon seeps\r\nin Yellowstone National Park.",
