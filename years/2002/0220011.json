These filters are used in problems where time-varying  signals must be processed in real time and the objective is to estimate various unknowns of the signals and to detect events described by the signals. The standard solutions of such problems in many applications are based on the \r\nKalman or extended Kalman filters. In situations when the problems are highly nonlinear or the noise that distorts the signals is non-Gaussian, the Kalman filters provide solutions that may be far from optimal.  \r\nA major drawback of the particle filters is that their implementation is  computationally very intensive. They are, however, inherently parallelizable, and special hardware can be built for their implementation that can meet the stringent requirements of real-time processing. In this research, \r\nreconfigurable and physically feasible VLSI architectures for particle filters are developed. In the development of these architectures, many important problems are researched. The most critical of them is the balancing of hardware and software, which itself is tightly related to other important issues. They include reductions of computational complexities by transformations and \r\napproximations, investigation of the degree of parallelism implemented in the filter, investigation of various interconnection mechanisms, random communication schemes, hardware optimization, and design of low power VLSI processors. This effort also includes building of reconfigurable hardware so that it is suitable for different types of particle filters. \r\n\r\n",
