 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on developing a  better understanding of the nature of  the  active  sites  on  sulfated-  and  tungstated  zirconias  for  the  isomerization  of  \r\nlight n-alkanes  (n-butane, n-pentane,  and n-hexane). To date, zirconia-based catalysts have offered more potential for utilization than  has  been  able  to  be  realized,  in  large  part  due  to  their  tendency  towards  fast deactivation. The reaction induction period, lasting only a few minutes for n-butane isomerization, largely determines the future behavior of sulfated zirconia.   The proposed research will make use of an in-situ  reaction  technique,  isotopic  transient  kinetic  analysis  (ITKA),  to  determine  the evolution of the concentration and residence time(s) of the surface reaction intermediates during the initial reaction period.  Addition of trace amounts of olefins (1-butene, 1-pentene,  and  1-hexene)  during  initial  reaction  will  help  to  define  the  nature  of  the active sites, and in particular \"olefin-modified\" sites that have recently been identified.  In-situ  DRIFTS  as  well  as  other  more  traditional  ex-situ techniques will be used to characterize  adsorbed species and the  catalysts studied.  The educational component will be the traditional mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students.  A better understanding of  the similarities  and  differences  of  the  sites  on  these  catalysts  for  the  isomerization  of  the different n-alkanes may guide the design of more stable catalysts. Processes built around the use of such  solid  acid  catalysts  offer  possibilities  for  replacing  less  environmentally friendly processes with liquid acids or solid acid catalysts requiring the co-feed of corrosive compounds.\r\n",
