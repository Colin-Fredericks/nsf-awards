 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nThe Living Textbook Initiative (LTI) of the Johns Hopkins University has designed a new form of textbook to address specific educational challenges: How can textbooks become more effective at delivering the best science to more students? How can different learning styles--listening, reading, seeing, and interacting--be integrated into a textbook? How can such a text support teachers' efforts to expand their role as mentors and discussion leaders? The LTI is producing, evaluating, and publishing Human Physiology: The Cardiovascular System, in a CD/Internet-based textbook. This publication will comprise 10 chapters, each composed of a virtual lecture, a full lecture-length animation of scientific concepts, note taking capabilities, and interactive laboratory simulations. A web site provides tutorials, posting capabilities, and discussion boards. A prototype textbook has been tested and proven effective. LTI content and technology experts represent the Johns Hopkins University's Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Beta-test site schools representing a diversity of students are testing and evaluating the Living Textbook. McGraw-Hill Publishing is part of the beta study and is focusing on issues related to marketing and distribution. A project report will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal to culminate the project.",
