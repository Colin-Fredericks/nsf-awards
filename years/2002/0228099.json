The rationale is that civil engineers \r\nhave lead roles in infrastructure and environmental systems, and the power of \r\ninformation technology can be used in design, construction, and operations to relieve \r\nproblems of traffic congestion, infrastructure integrity, construction productivity, \r\nenvironmental monitoring, systems security and other sectors of civil society. To address \r\nthis rapidly changing field requires new thinking about the curriculum. Old curriculum \r\norganization, consisting of loosely connected subjects, will not provide the integration \r\nneeded for expanding applications of information technology across civil society sectors. \r\nTwenty-first century problems require integration of new technologies and new \r\napproaches to the organization of engineering work, shaped by information technology.  \r\n \r\nEarly application of information technology in engineering education focused on \r\ncomputer programming, but only a few civil engineers engage in much programming. \r\nMost use software to apply wide bands of technology to problems with highly dispersed \r\nspatial, technological, and social dimensions. Teaching civil engineers how to apply the \r\nmethods that underlie the software is a main goal of the integrated curriculum at \r\nColorado State. \r\n \r\n",
