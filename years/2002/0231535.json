 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are one of several tools used by security professionals to detect and respond to security breaches.  Typically an IDS is implemented by tapping a network and diverting a copy of every network message to a sensor. Usually, the sensor is a general-purpose computer running software that examines every packet that it receives. This approach to IDS is easy to implement as it relies on off-the-shelf hardware and software. However, the overhead incurred by the general-purpose operating system and the limited I/O throughput of most PC and workstation architectures restrict such IDS to low and medium bandwidth networks. Special-purpose IDS platforms, on the other hand, can be optimized to handle high-bandwidth traffic, but the lack of flexibility and the high cost of custom hardware and software make this approach not viable in practice.\r\n\r\nRecently, parallel and distributed IDS architectures exist that operate on high bandwidth traffic by distributing network packets over a number of general-purpose machines. This approach combines the flexibility of off-the-shelf hardware and software with the high performance of parallel processing. A systematic study of the scalability of this approach as well as an analysis of suitable packet distribution strategies has not been done. Because such clustered architectures pay a potential penalty in terms of space and power required as they are essentially a set of complete computer systems that occupy shelf or rack space, consume power, and require time consuming management and configuration they have space and power costs that are high.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a scalable parallel appliance-based architecture for network intrusion detection systems that is able to reliably monitor high-bandwidth network segments, yet is cost-efficient and retains the flexibility of general-purpose based IDS. High performance is achieved by distributing network traffic among an array of low-cost sensors in a way that does not impact the quality of intrusion detection, while maximizing the available concurrency and minimizing required communication among sensors. Utilizing off-the-shelf single-board computers leads to an inexpensive and compact design that requires less power than a comparable number of complete workstations or PCs.\r\n\r\nThe key component of a parallel intrusion detection platform architecture is the approach by which network packets are distributed across the sensors. As a result, the system design will by guided by a systematic analysis of network traffic characteristics which will provide input into high-level models and simulations. To verify and evaluate the performance and scalability of the resulting architecture, a prototype system will be implemented based primarily on low-cost off-the-shelf hardware and software. By addressing IDS issues using off the shelf components, a product to assist in security breaches may be quickly developed.  This could have large, immediate impact on an important network topic.",
