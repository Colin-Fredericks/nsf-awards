One unusual \r\nfeature of this program is the inclusion of teacher workshops and monthly follow-up classroom \r\nvisits.  Another feature is development of a course for pre-service teachers.  The existence of this \r\nnew course will increase the impact of this project in years to come. \r\n\r\nThe focus of the summer teacher workshops will be threefold: 1) to improve the middle \r\nschool teachers' backgrounds of engineering disciplines and their relevance to physical science \r\nand associated mathematical concepts in their current curriculum, 2) to introduce the teachers to \r\ntechniques for integrating content and learning standards (including content literacy) into the \r\ncurriculum, and 3) to provide teachers with instruction concerning how to use inexpensive \r\nmaterials to provide hands-on learning experiences in their classroom. .  The purpose of the \r\nfollow-up classroom visits will be to assist the teachers in implementing the hands-on engineering \r\nexperiments in their classrooms and to respond to teachers' questions concerning science and \r\nengineering concepts.  In other words, members of the CSM faculty team will become a valuable \r\nclassroom resource for both students and teachers alike.   \r\n\r\nIn parallel with this effort, a program for pre-service teachers will be developed.  The \r\nUniversity of Colorado at Colorado Springs will pilot a one-semester course for pre-service \r\nteachers covering the .Fundamentals of Engineering..  The pre-service teachers will use \r\nmaterials developed through this project during classroom visits with in-service teachers and \r\napply these materials during their student teaching experiences at the middle school level.  This \r\nproposal is intended to develop/adapt an appropriate set of course material for the teacher \r\nworkshops and in-class lessons, and to test and evaluate the materials in urban and suburban \r\nclassrooms.  The joint effort of addressing both in-service and pre-service teachers will provide a \r\ncontinuous stream of knowledgeable instructors that can use engineering principals to illustrate \r\nthe practical applications of science and mathematics to middle school students. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
