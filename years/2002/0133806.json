 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nExposure-Resilient Cryptography concerns the important problem of key\r\nexposure and general information leakage.  Exposure of such\r\ninformation poses one of the most serious and common threats to\r\nemploying cryptography in real life. For example, cryptographic\r\ncomputations (decryption, signature generation, etc.) are often\r\nperformed on a relatively insecure device (e.g., a mobile device or an\r\nInternet-connected host) which cannot be trusted to maintain secrecy\r\nof the private key. Thus, the goal of Exposure-Resilient Cryptography\r\nis to design solutions that will limit (or even completely eliminate)\r\nthe negative consequences of such an exposure in various cryptographic\r\nscenarios. In particular, this research concentrates on the design of\r\nvarious key evolving schemes and the problem of partial key exposure.\r\n\r\nThe paradigm of secret key evolution over time invloves updating one's\r\nsecret key such that key leakage at given period(s) compromises the\r\nsecurity of other periods to the minimal extent possible. The\r\ninvestigators examine two such models. Forward-secure schemes update\r\nsecret key locally, and seek to protect the security of all the past\r\nperiods when the current key is exposed. In contrast,\r\nbidirectionally-secure schemes use secure key updates, but protect\r\nall non-exposed periods: both in the past and in the future.  In\r\neither model, the public information (e.g., public keys) are not\r\naffected by the secret key evolution. The problem of partial key\r\nexposure concerns the scenario where most but not all secret\r\ninformation has been leaked. The main question studied in this setting\r\nis how can valuable secret information be stored or represented in\r\nsuch a way that almost complete exposure of its representation still\r\nguarantees the secrecy of the actual, embedded secret?\r\n",
