 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor McGrath and his group will work on developing new methodology for the controlled degradation of dendritic materials.  The acid lability of the benzyl aryl ether subunit found in many dendrimers will be used as a trigger for degradation.  Dendrimers with depolymerizable backbones will also be prepared and degraded.  Release of degradation fragments which have been covalently incorporated into the dendrimer will be monitored so that the process can be understood and modified as necessary.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Dominic V. McGrath of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Arizona.  Dr. McGrath and his students will work on the controlled degradation of dendritic materials.  Controlled degradation of dendritic materials could have potential applications in controlled release of pharmaceuticals for drug delivery and as precursors for photoresists for microlithography.  The students trained during the course of this interdisciplinary work will gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical, polymer and speciality chemicals industries.",
