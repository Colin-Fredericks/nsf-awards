 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\nAdvances in microtechnology have increased the possibility for providing robotics\r\ninstruction emphasizing computing requirements rather than hardware requirements.\r\nCurricula for a first course in robotics have been published to take advantage of this\r\ntechnology. The purpose of this project is to take advantage of the existing work, adapting\r\nit as necessary to produce an effective, hands-on course in robotics within the computer\r\nscience curriculum at the University of North Florida. To realize this objective, an\r\nappropriate robotics laboratory is needed and a set of robotics laboratory projects must be\r\ndeveloped.\r\nNo general standards have as yet been developed for robotics technology. A major\r\ninhibitor for introducing robotics courses within computer science has been the uniqueness\r\nof the fabrication requirements, which has largely confined the subject to engineering-\r\nrelated programs with resources for robotics construction needs. Corresponding software\r\nhas been in short supply, and generally has relied on base-level programming in C or in\r\nmachine language. Existing robotics curricula for computer science that have been\r\ndeveloped have been constrained by the need to develop a lab and produce a viable lab\r\nmaintenance plan, all complicated by the fabrication issues. On the other hand, significant\r\nprogress has been made in reducing the complexity of electro-mechanical requirements,\r\nallowing software issues for producing effective autonomous robots to receive increased\r\nattention.\r\nRobotics kits developed by the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics (KIPR) and\r\nincorporated into this proposal at least partly redress the logistical issues and form the\r\nbasis for a robotics lab suitable for supporting a first course in robotics. To conduct the\r\ncourse of instruction, an incremental series of hands-on exercises using the laboratory\r\nfacility must be developed and tested. The KISS Institute will be called upon to both\r\nevaluate overall project outcomes and to promulgate materials developed for the project\r\n(the Institute is a non-profit national corporation that among its objectives seeks to\r\nadvance the state of robotics education).",
