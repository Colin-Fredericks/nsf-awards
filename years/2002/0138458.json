Devore\r\nDMS-0221669\r\nMathieu Desbrun\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative project funded by the CARGO program under\r\nDMS-0138458, DMS-0221642, and DMS-0221669.  This is the Age of Information.  Whether it be in scientific computation or reverse engineering, in remote sensing or medicine, data sets of \r\nincredible resolution and exquisite detail are created\r\ndaily.  These data sets often have geometric structure which \r\ncontains important information about the data and its \r\napplication.  The usefulness of such geometric datasets \r\nrests on our ability to process them efficiently, whether \r\nit be for storage, transmission, visual display, correlation, \r\nor registration against data from other modalities.  \r\nCompression is the common critical issue in all\r\nthese applications.\r\n\r\nCurrent data processing technology does not provide the \r\nefficient and geometrically faithful representations demanded \r\nby applications. In fact, a satisfactory data processing \r\nplatform will not be created by incremental advances of current technology but rather through a fundamental investigation of \r\nhow to represent large data sets with inherent geometry. To \r\npursue the necessary advances a team of researchers and \r\napplication developers representing expertise from\r\nseveral disciplines including mathematics, computer science, \r\nand engineering has been assembled. As drivers of the research, specially targeted applications (DTED, reverse engineering, \r\nphysical simulation) have been selected to guide the formulation \r\nof the most critical and meaningful problems, as well as testing approaches to solving them.  The team is carrying out \r\nfundamental investigations on the representation and compression \r\nof data sets with geometry by building new mathematical theory\r\nincluding deterministic models, appropriate application \r\nspecific error metrics (e.g., Haussdorf distance rather\r\nthan Lp norms), an information theory based on Kolmogorov \r\nentropy to determine the optimal compression, and the \r\ndevelopment of nonlinear methods for representing the data \r\nsets which are near optimal in the entropy sense.\r\n",
