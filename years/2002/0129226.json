Their collaboration addresses modeling and experimental aspects of anisotoropic shrinkage in sintering and compaction powder processes.  During these processes, powder mixtures are pressed into different and sometimes complex forms.  Characterization of microstructure evolution during powder sintering and modeling of anisotropic aspects will be studied.  \r\n\r\nThe collaboration merges modeling and experimental approaches.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration, expertise in thermomechanical modeling.  This is complemented by participation in experiments in France and French expertise in physiochemical and microstructural characterization.  Sintering of powder mixtures is a key step in a number of processing techniques for a variety of industrial processes, such as manufacturing of steel parts and hard magnets.  This research will advance our understanding of behavior of powder mixtures and enhance predictive modeling capabilities.  The collaboration includes an educational component.  An instructional module is planned for classroom use and undergraduate students will participate in the experiments in France.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS.  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and students.  The CNRS will support visits by French researchers to the United States. \r\n",
