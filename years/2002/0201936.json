 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand how physically active women living in the lower Brazilian Amazon adapt to the increased energy demands of lactation and the impact of their choices on their own health and the health of their infants.  Lactation is the most energetically demanding portion of reproduction and successful reproduction is a most important aspect of adaptation.  How women meet this additional energy demand is important from both evolutionary and health perspectives.  In developed countries women often meet the additional demands of lactation by increasing their dietary intake or decreasing their activity levels. However, these options may not be available to women living in developing nations, especially those who practice subsistence agriculture.  In the latter case, women may be more reliant on their body fat stores or on making metabolic adaptations that would allow them to decrease their energy expenditure.  In order to understand the adaptive strategies being used by these women, data on their dietary intake, energy expenditure and body composition will be measured during early, peak and late lactation.  In addition to these biological data, cultural data will also be collected to identify potential cultural practices that may impact women during this period of time.  By studying the energetics of lactation in women with physical activity patterns closer to those of our ancestors, we have the opportunity to increase our understanding of human reproductive biology and the flexibility of our reproductive system.  In addition, this study will provide information on the health of women of reproductive age, as well as on their diets and activity patterns, which can inform potential development projects in the area.",
