 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past several years two technologies, ad hoc networking and smart antenna systems, have developed independently of one another. Smart antenna systems have been developed primarily for cellular communication systems while ad hoc network technology has been developed for military and disaster relief network models. In this research, the researchers plan on utilizing smart antenna systems in the context of ad hoc networking.   The researchers believe that smart antennas with their ability to dynamically form directed beams will allow the capacity of ad hoc networks to dramatically increase.\r\n\r\nThe approach in this research is to exploit direction of arrival information obtained at\r\nthe antenna level for MAC and routing protocol design and, conversely, use routing and MAC layer information to form appropriate beams. This integrated approach appears to be ideal in terms of improving the overall system performance.  The planned approach will rely on simulations as well as modeling. For the simulation,  the researchers propose adding smart antenna models into NS-2. In addition, since one of the performance metrics is energy, the researchers  plan on incorporating accurate energy models for beamforming and direction of arrival algorithms into NS-2. One of the two approaches that will be explored for this is a mixed NS-2/DSP (Digital Signal Processor) environment in which NS-2 uses external DSPs to run the antenna algorithms and the exact measured energy cost is returned to the simulator.\r\n\r\nThis research will have a significant impact on the existing state of the art in ad hoc\r\nnetwork design. The researchers believe that as smart antenna systems mature, these systems are the right choice for infrastructureless networks. This research will develop protocols and answer questions related to performance improvements and the energy cost of using smart antennas.  The researchers hope that the work will enable other researchers to explore this merging of technologies as well.\r\n\r\n",
