Buckley\r\n\r\n\r\nSatellite radar interferometry (InSAR) provides earth-surface deformation measurements at finer resolution and greater spatial coverage than any other traditional geodetic technique and has quickly developed into a critical tool for measurement of deformation associated with natural and anthropogenic hazards.  The routine production of InSAR measurements is a consequence of the general availability of InSAR processing software with each package producing the same general final product - the differential interferogram.  Although recent InSAR research has considered the ensemble use of tens of interferograms to reveal complex and subtle surface deformation, a post-processing software package is not readily available to the InSAR geoscience community.  This project involves the research and development of an InSAR post-processing software toolkit employing three general strategies missing from current InSAR software: mosaicking of multiple satellite tracks for complete surface displacement measurement, interferogram stacking for noise reduction, and InSAR time-series analysis for measurement of continuous, non-uniform deformation.  The software is modular, coded in C and Fortran, called from a series of Unix-based shell scripts and developed generally independent of the InSAR software used to generate the differential interferograms.  Where processor-specific information is required, the software is integrated with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ROI_PAC software package.  Distribution of the post-processing toolkit is through a GNU General Public License.",
