 "awd_abstract_narration": "ourier analysis appears in many of the celebrated cornerstones of\r\ntheoretical computer science. It plays essential roles in expander\r\ngraph construction and derandomization, complexity lower bounds,\r\nprobabilistically checkable proof systems, quantum computing, lower\r\nbounds for distributed computation, and traditional applications to\r\ncomputer algebra. The majority of these applications involve the\r\nfamiliar framework of commutative Fourier analysis. The proposed\r\nproject brings together a multidisciplinary research team to apply the\r\nbeautiful tools of non-Abelian (that is, noncommutative) Fourier\r\nanalysis to investigate open questions in two areas where non-Abelian\r\ngroups have recently become very important: lower bounds for parallel\r\ncomputation and quantum algorithms.  The program also further develops\r\nefficient algorithms for the discrete Fourier transform over finite\r\nnon-Abelian groups.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on developing tools for separating the complexity\r\nclasses ACC^0 and NC^1, in order to demonstrate that there are natural\r\n(polynomial-time computable) problems which simply cannot be\r\nparallelized in the sense of ACC^0. The project applies a new family\r\nof tools for separating such circuit classes, using non-Abelian\r\nFourier analysis to bound their computational power. These tools apply\r\nalso to the problem of solving equations over finite groups, and the\r\ndevelopment of new probabilistically checkable proof systems based on\r\nnon-Abelian groups.  In addition, the project applies non-Abelian\r\nFourier analysis to develop improved lower bounds on the standard\r\nQuantum Fourier Transform approach to Graph Isomorphism and study\r\nquantum Monte Carlo algorithms. Finally, the project focuses on\r\nadaptations of Bratelli diagrams and quivers to develop classical and\r\nquantum algorithms for the non-Abelian Fourier transform itself.\r\n",
