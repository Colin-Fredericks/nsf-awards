 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Chemical(53)\r\nWe have developed interactive hybrid curriculum materials for teaching chemical reaction engineering. Our materials consists of textbooks, a CDROM, as well as a web site on the Internet. A prototype of this hybrid has been evaluated over the past two years at the University of Michigan. Through the use of interactive computer modules (ICM) we are supporting students with different student learning styles. These learning styles are outlined in the Felder/Solomon Inventory and we have designed our materials to address these in a number of different ways. The simulations we have created are around various chemical reactions. These simulations model complex problems that allow students to alter key parameters and evaluate their results to complement homework assignments, classroom lectures, and student study groups. These problems have been designed to enhance student critical thinking and problem solving skills. Updated authoring software Quest 10 from Quest 2.0 will be utilized as well as FEMLAB to upgrade our existing modules. Our original materials have gained a wide audience in the Chemical Engineering community. We are disseminating our new material through two textbooks, our CDROM that is being distributed to every chemical engineering department through the CACHE Corporation, and the Internet.",
