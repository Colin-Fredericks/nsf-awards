 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will develop technologies to synthesize nano tin/metal oxide anode materials for lithium rechargeable batteries. Reducing tin particles to nano size is known to be critical for a good cycle life of tin-based anode materials. The materials are expected to show a capacity of >1000 mAh/cm3 which represents a >50% increase over the practical capacity of carbonaceous materials presently used in lithium rechargeable batteries. In addition, the materials are expected to have a first cycle reversibility of >80%, comparable to that of carbon.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in the materials market for the next generation of lithium rechargeable batteries. The market for portable batteries is about $6 billion, with an annual growth rate of 15% in the last 10 years. Of this, the worldwide portable lithium-ion battery market is $2.93 billion,\r\nwith 530 million cells shipped in 2000. New markets are also emerging for electric and hybrid vehicle propulsion.",
