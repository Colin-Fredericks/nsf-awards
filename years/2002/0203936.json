There are two threads of \r\nideas involved here.  One is the description of homotopy \r\ntheory as a kind of topologically enriched category theory, \r\nas has been developed by Dwyer-Kan and many others.  Another \r\nthread is in the theory of commutative ring spectra (a homotopy theoretic generalization of commutative ring theory), and\r\nin particular the development of a topological version of \r\nthe algebraic de Rham complex of a ring.\r\n\r\nHomotopy theory is a branch of topology; it arose as the \r\nstudy of certain invariant properties of spaces, namely those \r\nleft unchanged by continuous deformations.  It is a surprising \r\nfact that there are deep analogies between the methods of the \r\nhomotopy theory of spaces (which would seem to be geometric and topological) and those of several branches of algebra (such as homological algebra, sheaf theory, and category theory).  For \r\nexample, there is a close analogy between the way we can \r\ndescribe an algebraic object (such as a group or ring) by\r\ngiving generators and the relations between them, and the \r\nway we can describe a topological space by giving polyhedra \r\nand the way they are attached together to give the space.  \r\nThe goal of this project is to develop certain homotopy \r\ntheoretic methods in the context of ring theory and of \r\ncategory theory, and to allow them to be applied to\r\ntraditional algebraic problems.\r\n",
