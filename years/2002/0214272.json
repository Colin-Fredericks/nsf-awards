 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I Project will develop a methodology for improved diagnosis and treatment of cancer by combining therapy and imaging in the same drug. Specifically, this study proposes to bind polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated magnetic nanopheres to a cancer targeting therapeutic agent (doxorubicin encapsulated temperature sensitive liposomes and hydrogels) and chelated to Tc-99m for imaging. After administration, the drug will be concentrated at the site of action by external magnetic guidance, verified by gamma camera imaging and released to the tumor using herperthermia treatment. A tumor specific marker bound to the complex will improve drug transport into the tumor. Once inside the tumor, therapeutic agents will be released to kill the cancer cells. Specific Goals of this Phase I Project are: (1) to develop the necessary chemistry and conjugation, (2) to examine the magnetic susceptibility of the complex using an in vitro flow model, and (3) to conduct tests in an in vitro cell culture model.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project are in the treatment of cancer. The proposed method will enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment by ensuring that the drug reaches the target tissue while minimizing non-target tissue uptake.\r\n",
