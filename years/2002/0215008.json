 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to establish the technical and economic feasibility of a novel photocatalytic technology to inactivate air-borne surrogate bacterial spores representative of Bacillus anthracis (anthrax bacteria). The technology is to be incorporated into circulating air ducts of buildings, providing protection against introduction of anthrax into central air systems by a terrorist act. The investigators have previously  developed a new class of photocatalysts that are orders of magnitude more active for organic compound oxidation than the traditional titania. This new class of photocatalysts will be adapted for use in anthrax spore destruction. The program will utilize photocatalyst composition studies to tailor a superior photocatalyst for this application, to be followed by reactor studies of the bactericidal efficacy of the new photocatalysts, and a competitive cost analysis of the technology relative to other alternatives for maintenance of indoor air quality. \r\n\r\nThe immediate commercial application of this project is in the area of homeland security.  The proposed technology will protect against the threat of introduction of lethal anthrax spores into central air systems.",
