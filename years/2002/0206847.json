 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS - 0206847.\r\n\r\nAbstract of the Project\r\n\r\nThis project is centered around the study of the Ricci flow on complete,\r\nnon-compact Kaehler manifolds of nonnegative holomorphic bisectional\r\ncurvature. The main goal is to seek a complete understanding of singular\r\nbehavior of the maximal solutions to the Kaehler-Ricci flow with\r\nnonnegative curvature,  in particular the geometry, such as the rates of \r\ncurvature decay and volume growth of geodesic balls, of complete Kaehler-Ricci solitons,\r\nwhich turn out to be the models for Type II singularities and can be considered as a\r\nnatural extension of Calabi-Yau metrics on non-compact complex\r\nmanifolds. Progress on the project will lead to new understanding of geometry, analysis, \r\nand complex structure and could have important application to solving a\r\nwell-known conjecture in complex geometry.  The research will be based\r\non the effort of extending the dimension reduction method of Hamilton\r\nfor the Ricci flow in the Riemannian case to the Kaehler case where one\r\nhas weaker curvature assumption. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project deals with singular behavior of the Kaehler-Ricci\r\nflow, or Parabolic-Einstein equations, and studies uniformization type\r\nproblems for complete Kaehler manifolds. The Kaehler-Ricci flow is an\r\nimportant type of geometric evolution equations, which have profound\r\nimportance and applications in science and geometry. Some of the examples include \r\nthe motion of a surface by its mean curvature, the flow of gas in a porous mechanism,\r\nthe motion of a liquid crystal, the diffusion of oil in shale, the\r\nreproduction of sparse species, and image sharpening. The knowledge\r\ngained in this project would not only  have significant implications to\r\nour understanding of complex geometry which in turn could be very useful\r\nto the study of mathematical physics, but also may lead to new\r\nunderstanding of singularity formations in other geometric evolutions.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n",
