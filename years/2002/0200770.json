The main\r\nemphasis of this research is placed on the study of \r\ncertain representation theory\r\nquestions such as Kac-Wakimoto conjecture, orbifolds and boundary states in \r\nconformal field theories  using operator algebraic techniques. \r\nThe applications  of these operator algebraic techniques\r\nwill lead to proofs of representation theory questions\r\nand shed lights on exotic subfactors such as those coming from \r\nconformal inclusions. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of operator algebras was introduced by John von Neumann \r\nin order to provide a proper mathematical framework for Quantum \r\nMechanics. Conformal field theory  was a theory \r\ndescribing  critical phenomena in\r\ncondensed matter physics, and it also plays an important role in \r\nstring theory. The remarkable interactions between operator algebras\r\nand conformal field theory has  led to many interesting mathematical\r\nissues.  The aim of this research\r\nis to find solutions to some of  the important mathematical issues that \r\nsurface in this context which have a wide range of applications.\r\n\r\n",
