The researchers will develop and field-test new measures of quality-of-life in order to ultimately test hypotheses about the effects of economic development.  They intend to collect primary information from a sample of people; to collect repeated observations from the same people and communities to control for fixed attributes; and to evaluate a broad range of explanatory variables relating to economic success, nutritional status, and stress. \r\nThis research will be significant in its theoretical advance in estimating how inequalities affect quality of life.  It will advance the methodology of eliciting information from people about their subjective state of happiness, and in its broader aspects, will contribute to a more informed discussion and a new way of thinking about he degree to which economic development, integration to a market economy, trade opening or globalization hurts or helps traditional people. \r\n",
