 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some of the most striking examples of community change appear to be driven by\r\nchanges in the abundance of particular species with cascading effects on other members of an\r\necosystem. Seabirds exert substantial effects through predation and by modifying abiotic\r\nfactors, thereby determining species richness of assemblages in both marine and terrestrial\r\nhabitats. In New England, gulls have increased dramatically since the early 1900s, and are\r\nlikely transforming coastal terrestrial and intertidal communities through their activities.\r\nHowever, their impacts are virtually unknown. The goal of this research is to understand the\r\nmechanisms by which nesting gulls impact plant (terrestrial herbaceous and intertidal algae)\r\nassemblages. Gulls may have top-down effects on algal diversity in the intertidal through\r\npredation on secondary consumers (crabs) that forage on algal grazers (littorines). Birds\r\ntransfer marine-derived nutrients and energy from intertidal to terrestrial habitats via guano,\r\nand as a consequence they may impact terrestrial plant diversity from the bottom-up. I\r\npropose a combination of experimental manipulations and comparative sampling methods to\r\ninvestigate these effects. Policies in aquatic ecosystems (e.g. seabird restoration) can affect\r\nboth aquatic and terrestrial systems. Understanding gull impacts in marine and terrestrial\r\nhabitats will contribute to informed management practices.",
