The  overarching  goal of this project is to recruit and retain a large and diverse population of young people to programs of study leading to careers as: 1) engineering professions in which they are master problem  solvers and developers  of new solutions to engineering challenges; and 2) high school math and science teachers who understand and are critical consumers of technology, and who can extrapolate fundamental concepts to engineering applications.  \r\n \r\nThe planning team consists of Northeastern University (NU) faculty from engineering, \r\nbiology,  chemistry,  mathematics  and  physics  and  Boston  Public  School  (BPS)  math  and science  teachers.  They will  form  a  community  of reflective teaching practitioners spanning across disciplines and the high school-university divide.  These communities will meet to assess and enhance their own teaching practices and will collaboratively design: 1) a 3-week Urban Engineering Summer Camp for juniors from the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and  Science in Boston; 2)  engineering activity modules for G11 and 12 math and science courses; 3) math and science courses taken by first-year  engineering majors that are based on solving a series of engineering problems; 4) math and science courses taken by undergraduates in NU's School of Education that emphasize the connections between these courses  and issues from engineering  and technology; and 5) comprehensive, conceptual tests to assess student understanding of the principles of math and science and their abilities to apply these principles. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
