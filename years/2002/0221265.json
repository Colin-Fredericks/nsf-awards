 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Teacher Education Collaborative (STEMTEC) is an NSF Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (CETP) involving the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in partnership with Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges, Greenfield, Holyoke, and Springfield Technical Community Colleges, and local school districts. STEMTEC accomplishments include the revision of mainstream courses for science and math majors who are potential teachers, faculty development to enable the adoption of student-active teaching strategies, alternative assessment, and collaborative group work,  and early teaching experiences for preservice students. New science and mathematics teacher preparation transfer programs were developed for community college students and a post-baccalaureate summer/fall secondary certification option was created. A follow-on project is supporting a comprehensive summative evaluation of STEMTEC, emphasizing the outcomes of STEMTEC efforts in K-12 schools. The evaluation effort focuses on the extent to which STEMTEC has improved the preparation of K-12 math and science teachers, recruited students into math and science teaching, and supported new math and science teachers. The project provides an induction program for new teachers coordinated with district programs and state and national certification requirements. It includes a teacher collaborative group, STEM Education Institute programs including Science and Engineering Saturday Seminars, and a redesigned UMass Teacher Education Program that features an online seminar and a master's program with a discipline research experience. The project is contributing data to the CETP Core Evaluation effort.",
