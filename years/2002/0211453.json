 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators consider a general system of nonlinear\r\nnonlocal hyperbolic equations describing the dynamics of several\r\ninteracting populations.  The goal of the project is to develop\r\ntheories on the existence-uniqueness, long-time behavior, and\r\nnumerical approximation of solutions to the hyperbolic system.  A\r\ncombination of analytical and numerical methods is used to\r\nunderstand the dynamics of the complex proposed model.  To study\r\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions to this system, two major\r\napproaches are adopted.  The first approach to study the\r\nwell-posedness of solutions is via the finite difference method\r\nused for classical conservation laws.  The second approach to\r\ninvestigate the well-posedness and long-time behavior of\r\nsolutions is based on the monotone approximation and comparison\r\nresults that have been successfully established for the\r\nsemilinear case by the investigators.  Although similar approaches\r\nhave been used in studying other nonlinear partial differential\r\nequation models, their applications to special cases of the\r\ngeneral nonlinear and nonlocal model considered in this project\r\nhave only been carried out by the investigators.  In addition, a\r\nnumerical methodology is developed for an inverse problem\r\ngoverned by the proposed nonlinear nonlocal system of equations.\r\nIt uses a connection between real data and the model to estimate\r\nunknown parameters.  Meanwhile, a numerical package is developed\r\nfor simulating the proposed model.\r\n     Many populations and their interactions with the environment\r\nhave been modeled using the structured population approach, where\r\nthe structures of interest are induced by internal\r\ncharacteristics such as age or size.  For example, size-structured\r\npopulation models with distributed rates have been successfully\r\nused to describe the dynamics of mosquitofish in California rice\r\nfields.  The structured population approach has also been used to\r\nmodel the dynamics of hierarchically structured populations in\r\nwhich the differences between individuals have a direct effect on\r\nthe availability of resources.  Another application is the\r\npredator-prey interaction between zooplankton and phytoplankton\r\nwithin the context of algal aggregation.  Generally speaking, in\r\norder to analyze, manage, and control the dynamics of a\r\npopulation, it is necessary to understand the interactions\r\nbetween the population evolution and its environment.  In this\r\nproject, the investigators study a general structured population\r\nmodel.  Due to its complexity, a combination of analytical and\r\nnumerical methods is developed to investigate the dynamics of\r\nsuch a population.  In particular, a numerical package to simulate\r\nthe proposed model is provided.  Furthermore, certain techniques\r\nare introduced to estimate the growth and mortality for\r\nindividuals within the population from field data.  Because of the\r\ngenerality of the proposed model, the results help to answer\r\nquestions about nonlinear phenomena in population dynamics.  In\r\naddition, the resulting numerical method can be used by\r\npopulation biologists to investigate the dynamical behavior of\r\ngeneral population models.",
