 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rice University, in collaboration with the Houston Independent School District, proposes the Computer Science Computing and Mentoring Partnership (CS-CAMP), a demonstration project to enhance the interest and persistence of female students in pre-college computer science. The proposed CS-CAMP is an ambitious yet realistic plan to develop a model that can be used across the nation to make systemic school change while providing enriched learning experiences for underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nEven though women are making strides in some areas of science, their participation in computer science is actually declining. Even in high schools, the vast majority of girls opt out of advanced high school computing courses. Through its 2-year program, CS-CAMP will provide high school girls opportunities to learn computing in a female-centric environment outside school and increase enrollment of girls in advanced computer science classes in their high schools. This should give girls in these high schools enough high-quality exposure to computing so that they can make informed decisions about whether to pursue computer science as a college major and a life career.\r\n\r\nProgram Goals are to:\r\n-Prepare high school girls so that they will succeed with confidence and enthusiasm in computer science courses;\r\n-Increase girls' admission and retention in pre-college computer science courses; and\r\n-Improve the climate for girls and instructional experiences in high school computer science classes\r\n\r\nThe proposed program will target eight high schools in the Houston area who will make a strong, long-term commitment to improve their schools' computer science program with the goal that girls comprise 50% of the schools' most advanced computer science classes, and if they are not currently teaching an advanced computing class, to begin to do so. The selected schools will form an implementation team consisting of a counselor, administrator, and computer science teacher to meet bimonthly at Rice with the other schools' teams and CS-CAMP to develop and implement an action plan for their schools. CS-CAMP will seed the effort by engaging 16 girls from each of the eight schools in a two-year program consisting of 2-week summer computer camp and monthly follow-up sessions. Computer camp focuses on community building, computing-career awareness, mentoring, introductory computing courses, and lots of fun.\r\n\r\nThe program will provide professional development on gender equity in technology to the schools' principals, counselors, and computer science teachers. The participating computer science teachers will also facilitate at the girls' computer camp under the tutelage of master teachers. This will afford the targeted teachers (1) solid knowledge of computer science content and curriculum; (2) skill in a variety of approaches to instruction; and (3) the opportunity to plan and reflect on instruction together with other teachers.\r\n\r\nCS-Camp will create a multi-level (middle school through university faculty/industry worker) community that provides academic support and personal and professional mentoring to girls in the targeted eight schools in the hopes that those eight will become some of the country's premier schools in participation of girls in computer science and provide a model for the nation in this regard.\r\n",
