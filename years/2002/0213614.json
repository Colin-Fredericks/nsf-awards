 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project's objective is to overcome the drawbacks of existing imaging sensor designs, and to demonstrate a novel video camera design concept.  Named the Super-Eye, this camera is able to provide simultaneously both large depth of field the dynamic scene and selective high-resolution video images for the object of interest. The unique advantages of the proposed Super-Eye concept include: (a) achieving simultaneous high image resolution and large depth of field; (b) Intelligent guidance of the high-resolution image channel; and (c) 3D Modeling Capability.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for high image resolution, large depth of field, and wide field of view are applicable to both the commercial and military markets.  The security surveillance market has experience near double-digit growth and is expected to maintain this growth in light of the events of 9/11. Security cameras are roughly 30 percent of the $100 billion global security industry.",
