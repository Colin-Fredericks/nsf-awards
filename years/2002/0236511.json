The content of the workshops builds on recent  NRC reports (e.g., How People Lear; Adding it Up; Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology;  Knowing What Students Know; Learning and Understanding), and participants will have opportunities to examine the research and implementation issues identified in these reports in depth and apply them to their project designs.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that two workshops each on two different topics (making a total of four workshops) will be offered annually for three years. MSP grantees would be guaranteed slots in the workshops.\r\n\r\nThe workshops will be jointly developed by the Center for Education and the National Science Resources Center.",
