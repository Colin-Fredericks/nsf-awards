 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to understand the relationship between two activities of a\r\nprotein encoded by a group I intron. The protein facilitates a splicing reaction that excises the\r\nintron from its precursor RNA and also acts as a DNA endonuclease, cleaving DNA at a specific\r\nsequence. It is commonly believed that the RNA splicing activity evolved from a protein that\r\noriginally functioned solely as a DNA endonuclease. However it is unlikely that this new\r\nfunction arose simply by fusion of an additional gene sequence. Preliminary evidence indicates\r\nthat the DNA and RNA substrates bind to distinct or partially overlapping sites on the protein.\r\nThe question then arises as to how a protein acquires a new function and how easily this can be\r\ndetected. This is particularly relevant to annotating genomes. Attributing a single function to a\r\ngene may constitute only partial characterization of the sequence since an unknown number of\r\nproteins may \"moonlight\" and perform a second, unrelated and unforeseen task. Group I introns\r\ncan catalyze their own excision from RNA precursors. An intron-encoded protein, called a\r\nmaturase, significantly facilitates removal of such an intron in Aspergillus nidulans. It also has\r\nDNA endonuclease activity. The three-dimensional structure of the protein has been obtained\r\nwith the help of a collaborator and the region which binds the cleavable DNA sequence has been\r\nidentified. Guided by this model, the relationship between the binding sites of the RNA and\r\nDNA substrates will be studied biochemically and genetically. Current diffraction data from\r\ncrystals of group I introns are of insufficient quality to reveal structural details at the atomic\r\nlevel. Co-crystallizing RNA with a protein can often solve this problem. A collaboration will be\r\nperformed to obtain a high-resolution structure of the intron-maturase complex. This will not\r\nonly reveal the RNA binding site on the protein and help to determine how the RNA binding site\r\narose, but also provide a wealth of structural information about the group I intron RNA itself.",
