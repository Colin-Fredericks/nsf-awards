 "awd_abstract_narration": "North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation - Phase III\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NC-LSAMP) requests\r\nsupport for continuingits efforts during Phase III. The LS-NCAMP Alliance includes eight\r\npartner institutions - North Carolina A&T State University (lead institution), Fayetteville\r\nState University, North Carolina Central University, North Carolina State University,\r\nUniversity of North Carolina - Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Charlotte, \r\nUniversity of North Carolina - Pembroke, and Winston Salem State University. The\r\nProvost and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at North Carolina A&T State University\r\nwill lead the project with assistance from key administrators at all Alliance institutions. \r\nThis will ensure the effective institutionalization of the strategies proposed here. The \r\nwork proposed caps a decade long series of activities aimed primarily at increasing \r\nundergraduate degree production in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology \r\n(SMET). \r\n\r\nUnderrepresented minorities comprise 30 percent of the college-age population \r\nbut they represent only 11 percent of the baccalaureate engineering graduates resulting \r\nin a \"parity gap\" of 19 percent. The parity gap is even more pronounced at the master's\r\nand doctoral level. Clearly, more needs to be done to reduce this parity gap, more out of\r\neconomic necessity and to meet global competitive pressures than any other reason. \r\nThe efforts outlined in this proposal are aimed at meeting this challenge. \r\n\r\nThe activities proposed in this proposal are driven by the need to increase substantially \r\nthe number of underrepresented minorities who will contribute significantly in science,\r\nmathematics, engineering and technology areas. While the baccalaureate degree programs \r\nwill receive continued attention, special emphasis will be placed on amplifying the flow \r\nof minority students in the graduate and research pipeline. The primary goals of the\r\nproposal are (i) to increase the pool of competent underrepresented SMET graduates \r\nwith bachelor's degrees (specific objectives include increasing the number of SMET \r\ngraduates from bachelor's degree programs by 10% from allAlliance partner schools by\r\n2007 and increasing the quality of SMET bachelors degree graduates from all alliance\r\npartner schools based on their performance in college courses and national examinations\r\nby 50% by 2007) and (ii) to increase the number of students who matriculate into SMET \r\ngraduate schools (specific objectives include increasing the number of SMET students\r\nwho express an interest in graduate studies by 100% by 2007, increasing by 100%, the\r\nnumber of SMET graduates who are academically qualified for admission to graduate \r\nprograms by 2007, increasing the number of SMET graduates from alliance partner\r\ninstitutions who are enrolled in graduate SMET programs by 100% by 2007, and increasing \r\nthe retention rate by 10% of underrepresented students in graduate SMET programs). \r\nAn additional goal of the project is to identify significant factors that promote \r\nbaccalaureatedegree attainment, retention in academic programs and entry into graduate \r\nschool in SMET areas (specific objectives are to identify significant factors that promote \r\nand hinder retention of minority students enrolled in SMETbaccalaureate degree programs, \r\nand to identify significant factors that promote and hinder entry of minority\r\nundergraduate students into graduate SMET degree programs).\r\n\r\nStrategies for accomplishing project goals are based on published techniques that have \r\nproven successful in smaller samples. Specifically, the approaches to be employed include\r\nfocused recruitment from school; bridge programs to manage the school-college transition;\r\nsupplemental instruction, cohort scheduling and workshops for undergraduate students \r\nduring the first year to enhance retention and preparation for upper-class coursework; \r\nundergraduate research and professional development workshops aimed at motivating and\r\npreparing students for graduate study; and the development of networking and mentoring \r\nsystems to improve retention in the first year in graduate school. A key emphasis during\r\nPhase III will be Alliance-wide institutionalization of proven strategies that have been\r\nknown to improve the success rates of students in SMET.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance partners together awarded over a thousand degrees and currently enroll over \r\nsix thousand undergraduate minority students in SMET programs. In addition to students \r\nin the Alliance, dissemination activities under this proposal have the potential to impact\r\n several thousand students each year.\r\n",
