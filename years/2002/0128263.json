 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project will develop novel trimetallic nitride template endohedral fullerene (TNTs) materials for use as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TNTs, which offer significant diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities, are now available in sufficient research quantities. Chemical functionalization reactions to solubilize the TNTs are also now available. TNTs offer an exciting alternative to current MRI contrast agents. TNTs offer the flexibility of excapsulating a variety of paramagnetic metals into the C80 fullerene cage. As several of the metals are paramagnetic, a production optimization plan balancing cost of materials versus efficiency as an MRI contrast agent is a primary focus of this project. The development of TNT based contrast agents is expected to lead to smaller patient doses, increased T1 relaxation rates and increased product safety.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the contrast agent segment of the MRI imaging market. If successful, this project could result in a significant expansion in MRI capability and usage, with the potential of developing new business on the order of $700 million per year.\r\n",
