 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds to implement and evaluate a model of instructional strategies for\r\nprekindergarten teachers in order to enhance their ability to support young childre's \r\nlearning in language, early literacy, and math. The model will be experimentally tested \r\nacross Head Start and public school educational settings and is guided by a strong body of \r\nrecent research. As the two settings have different goals for children, funding of this \r\nproposal will provide important information on the conditions under which the model is \r\neffective. The outcomes of this research will determine critical elements for models of \r\ninstructional approaches such as intensity and duration, teacher background characteristics,\r\n role of mentor teachers, and the importance of including a home literacy component. The \r\nmodel is based on research that has clearly established a group of key elements for \r\nprekindergarten language/literacy programs (e.g., expressive language, vocabulary, early \r\nreading skills). Results will answer a critical remaining question regarding how a model \r\nof instructional strategies can support teachers to implement a comprehensive set of \r\nteaching practices supporting language/literacy development in ways that are sensitive to \r\nthe broadest range of social, emotional, and cognitive needs of young children.\r\n",
