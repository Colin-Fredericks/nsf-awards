 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops new tools and methodology to study properties of magnetic microstructures.  A broad range of technology-enabling magnetic phenomena is emerging from research on thin films and thin-film based structures.  The novel magnetic effects associated with engineered materials now provide the basis for a broad range of new magnetic devices including magnetic sensors that improve hard-disk performance in computers (giant-magnetoresistance read heads) and permit magnetic-materials-based random access memory (MRAM) to be developed.  In order to optimize the performance of the new magnetic materials and explore new device architecture that exploits the new magnetic phenomena, precise understanding and control of the magnetic effects are required.  The new instrumentation to be developed from this NSF award and the research to be carried out using it will advance our understanding of magnetic phenomena that enables new technological applications.  The research will study factors that govern critical magnetic properties such as magnetic switching thresholds, the speed at which information can be stored and retrieved, and factors that govern how magnetic materials growth and microstructure fabrication affect the properties.  The research is likely to result in discovery of new magnetic effects as well as deeper understanding of novel magnetic phenomena that have already been discovered.  The research will provide rigorous training for graduate students in the important fields of condensed matter physics and materials technology that is essential for the United States to maintain a leading position in science and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project develops new tools and methodology to study properties of magnetic microstructures.
