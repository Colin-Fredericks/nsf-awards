The third in a series of biennial workshops, this meeting will bring together the bulk of U.S. geoscientists who either manage, maintain and/or utilize secondary ion mass spectrometry for microspatial trace element and isotopic analyses of natural and man made materials.  The workshop will focus on presentations from the community that address developing new SIMS techniques for geological and cosmochemical applications, providing improved service to the community through NSF-sponsored SIMS facilities (i.e. WHOI; EAR-0115433 and  UCLA; EAR-0113563) and the sharing and development of laboratory standards.  The PI, Laurie Leshin, currently oversees a newly established (EAR-9871270) CAMECA 6f SIMS facility at Arizona State University and has included a list of invitees from the preeminent SIMS labs in U.S. academia and government labs.  Additional attendees will include representatives from the manufactures of SIMS instrument (CAMECA and Australian Scientific Instruments) and should ensure that the analytical needs of U.S. geoscientists who use SIMS will be effectively transmitted to the private sector capable of facilitating instrumental improvements.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
