 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe theory of automatic control has reached considerable maturity\r\nin the last few decades. Solutions to a large number of diverse\r\nand challenging problems have been obtained, and many important\r\nmathematical aspects of the theory are well understood. However,\r\nthere remain several categories of problems for which the success\r\nof standard control tools has been limited. These include:\r\n\r\n  1. Control of systems that cannot be stabilized by continuous\r\nfeedback.\r\n  2. Control of systems with sensor or actuator\r\nconstraints.\r\n  3. Control of systems with large-scale modeling\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\n   The research and educational development plan\r\nproposed here is aimed at designing hybrid control\r\nalgorithms. In this framework, a continuous-time process is\r\ncontrolled by means of logic-based switching among a family of\r\nregulators. The closed-loop system is then called hybrid\r\nbecause it combines continuous and discrete dynamics. We study\r\nseveral situations in which such a control paradigm is natural and\r\nhelps overcome various shortcomings of more traditional control\r\nmethodologies.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of this research is on systematic development of\r\ntools for hybrid control design, applicable to general and useful\r\nclasses of nonlinear dynamical systems. We propose to achieve this\r\ngoal by recognizing common trends that unify different aspects of\r\nthe problems under consideration, and by exploiting recent\r\nadvances made by the proposer and collaborators in nonlinear\r\ndisturbance attenuation and in stability analysis of switched\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nHybrid control techniques are suitable for implementation in the\r\ncontext of many important applications that drive the modern\r\ntechnology, such as software-enabled control, control over\r\nnetworks, and vision-based control. These methods help bridge the\r\ngap between the mathematical control theory and engineering\r\npractice. For this reason, they also generate high student\r\ninterest. Our research program will be integrated into the\r\nacademic curriculum of the Electrical and Computer Engineering\r\nDepartment of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\r\nthrough course development, student mentoring, laboratory\r\ncreation, and tutorial publications.\r\n",
