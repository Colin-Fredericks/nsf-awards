 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Keith Stevenson of the University of Texas at Austin has received a CAREER Award from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study the electrochemistry of unique nanostructures leading to efficient energy storage and conversion.  Optical and scanning probe microscopy will be applied to redox-active materials, starting with the oxides used in lithium batteries, to observe mixed conduction of electrons and ions at nanoscales.  Together with electrochemical methods, the approach will permit the correlation of structural characteristics (e.g. atomic-level defects, porosity and morphology) with the energetics and kinetics of ion insertion.  The research will enable the development of new nanostructured materials to improve ion transport and storage capability.  The PI plans to incorporate new modern electrochemistry, light microscopy and scanning probe microscopy in innovative undergraduate laboratory courses.  In addition, he will develop an interactive public outreach module that interfaces with existing UT-Austin outreach programs.  Local high school students will also be involved in the PI's research.\r\n\r\nInformation obtained from the research may lead to next-generation energy storage materials and configurations, and lead to creation of potentially superior high-performance electrochemical power sources.  The students and public involved in the work will gain perspectives about research in nanomaterials and cutting edge ideas in energy storage.\r\n\r\n",
