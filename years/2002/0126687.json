 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nThe standard undergraduate geometry courses are principally designed for pre-service teachers and prospective research mathematicians. Such courses are normally not of interest to students in the technical oriented fields of engineering, computer science, and the applied mathematical sciences. This proof of concept proposal develops course materials for an applied geometry course for students pursuing degrees in engineering, computer science, and the applied mathematical sciences. Also, interactive course materials that can be used in such an introductory geometric modeling course and that can be used in the pre-requisite calculus courses are developed.\r\n\r\nEffective courses utilize the current skills and abilities of the students in developing new skills and in developing an understanding of new concepts. In geometry, the crucial abilities tend to be somewhat intuitive, as geometry is similar to a language. The current generations of students tend to have an underdeveloped geometric intuition, possibly because they have played more with virtual reality than physical reality. However, there is a geometric intuition in virtual reality, which is not equivalent to geometric intuition of physical reality. In order to use their virtual geometric intuition, this project develops materials aimed at unifying these two diverse varieties of geometric intuition, by using both modern technology (computers and the internet) together with the traditional tools of geometry (compass, straightedge and physical models). In addition, the materials are interactive, as it is important to engage the students with the material. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
