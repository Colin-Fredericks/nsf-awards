 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological invasions represent a major component of global environmental change.\r\nInvasions may lead to reduced biodiversity and often result in permanent alterations to\r\necosystems.Invasive non-native plant pathogens have dramatically affected ecosystems in many\r\nparts of the world.The mechanisms underlying dispersal of these pathogens and their ecological\r\nconsequences are critical issues for conservation and ecosystem management.Spatial pattern is\r\na fundamental property of disease dynamics because it reflects the genetic heterogeneity and\r\nenvironmental forces acting on pathogen dispersal and life history.A multidisciplinary approach\r\nis required to solve the challenges of 1)incorporating fine-scale processes of pathogen dispersal\r\ninto landscape-level models and 2)integrating spatial variation in environmental factors and host\r\npopulation genetics with disease incidence.\r\nIn this proposal,we describe research to analyze spatio-temporal dynamics of\r\nPhytophthora ramorum,an emerging,and probably exotic,pathogen that causes a lethal disease\r\nof oaks and tanoaks in coastal California.This disease,known as Sudden Oak Death (SOD),has\r\nreached epidemic levels in several counties.The proposal integrates spatial data on host\r\ngenetics,community structure,and environmental variation with investigations of mechanisms\r\nunderlying spread of P.ramorum to model changes in the distribution of this plant disease across\r\nthe landscape.Model predictions will identify critical factors that influence the distribution of\r\nSOD and provide forecasts of habitat loss in oak woodlands as a consequence of SOD.This\r\nproposal describes a multidisciplinary program to model the spread of a destructive plant disease\r\nand to predict its ecological consequences.Our objectives are not developed as discrete\r\nactivities for individual researchers,but rather a collaborative effort among researchers to attack\r\na single problem.We aim to accomplish the following:\r\n1.Develop a statistically based model that predicts spatial patterns of SOD risk on the\r\nlandscape,based on relationships among several critical environmental factors.These factors\r\ninclude proximity to previously infected locations,genetic background of host species,plant\r\ncommunity structure,landscape structure,abiotic conditions,and anthropogenic activities.\r\n2.Develop a mechanistic model that predicts spatial patterns of pathogen activity and host\r\nsusceptibility based on empirical studies of pathogen dispersal between hosts on fine spatial\r\nscales and on environmental conditions conducive to pathogen reproduction and dispersal.\r\n3.Develop a model of SOD spread that integrates the most predictive components of the\r\nstatistical and mechanistic models.\r\n4.Foster participation of undergraduates in this cross-disciplinary research and integrate the\r\nresearch into the curriculum of core courses in the Departments of Biology and Geography at\r\nSonoma State University.\r\nSonoma State University is located within 20 km of the study area,which is easily\r\naccessible to PI s and their students.Previous analyses of the relationship between\r\nenvironmental variation and SOD spread have concentrated on the most heavily impacted\r\nregions in Marin County where the pathogen has infected trees throughout the study area.In\r\ncontrast,the present study focuses on SOD spread into new areas that presently show no sign of\r\ninfection.We believe that this approach will contribute substantially towards a greater\r\nunderstanding of the biology of this pathogen and to our understanding of the ecology and\r\ngenetics of plant-pathogen interactions.The timing of this study will also ensure involvement by\r\nmotivated undergraduates at Sonoma State University who wish to participate in research that\r\neveryone recognizes is of critical significance to the larger community.",
