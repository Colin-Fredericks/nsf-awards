 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CCLI-EMD Proof-of-concept has as its primary goal the integration of haptics technology into required undergraduate engineering courses to improve learning and teaching in the engineering program at the Ohio University. Haptics indicates force and touch feedback to the human from a computer. Commercially available haptic interfaces can greatly augment education: \" feeling is believing\". Teaching and learning can be more compelling, fun, and engaging with better student retention via the integration of haptics technology. Specifically, we are developing haptics-augmented software activities and Internet-based tutorials, and integrating these tools into undergraduate engineering physics and statics/dynamics courses. The PI has delivered similar products in the K-12 arena, sponsored by NASA.\r\n\r\nThough this proof-of-concept haptics technology development and evaluation is taking place at Ohio University, we have a nationwide focus with a goal of systematic changing the nation's undergraduate engineering programs via integrated haptics technology and curriculum. The College of Engineering personnel are performing the haptics technology, software, and tutorial development. The College of Education personnel are leading the integration of the resulting technology into the undergraduate engineering curriculum, the transfer of project results to K-12 science and technology teacher preparation, and the project evaluation efforts at Ohio University. \r\n\r\nThe deliverables for this project include prototype haptics-augmented PC software learning activities, HTML-based tutorials, and integrated curriculum for physics and statics/dynamics courses. Pilot tests on each of these courses will be conducted to evaluate project results. The dissemination of the results of this project will consist of conference papers and a journal article. Also, we will study the potential of commercially disseminating the products of the project nationwide. We will submit a full development proposal to NSF CCLI-EMD at the project conclusion.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Haptics, haptics-augmented software, haptics technology\r\n",
