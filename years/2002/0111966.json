 "awd_abstract_narration": "The AIM Research Conference Center (ARCC) will foster progress in\r\nthe mathematical sciences and contribute significantly to the\r\ncurrent and future productivity of mathematicians.  Through the\r\nsponsorship of focused workshops, ARCC will provide a new venue\r\nfor research mathematics which will enhance and complement\r\nexisting conference centers and institutes.  ARCC focused\r\nworkshops will be distinguished by their emphasis on a specific\r\nmathematical goal, such as a significant unsolved problem, an\r\nimportant new result, or the explanation of the convergence\r\nbetween two distinct areas of mathematics.  Also planned are\r\nworkshops exploring connections between mathematics and other\r\nsciences.  A small team of researchers will carefully plan each\r\nworkshop so as to maximize its effectiveness in achieving this\r\ngoal.  Central to each workshop will be a public website which,\r\nduring the lead-in phase, will outline the scope of the workshop\r\nand provide resources to the participants.  Most workshops will\r\nlast for one week and will feature a small selection of talks\r\ncoupled with several problem and discussion sessions.\r\nImmediately following the workshop, the website will be expanded\r\nto serve both as a record of the workshop and as a comprehensive\r\nresource for the current status of important problems and\r\nresults.  The website will remain up-to-date through the\r\nincorporation of future work and new developments.  The\r\ncollection of all workshop websites will grow to become a\r\ncomprehensive and interconnected resource for the most important\r\nproblems and results in modern mathematics.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, mathematics has become an increasingly\r\ncollaborative endeavor, and many of today's important unsolved\r\nproblems will require techniques from several areas of the\r\nmathematical sciences.  The ARCC focused workshops will provide\r\nan ideal forum for a team of researchers, working together, to\r\nmap out strategies, set priorities, work toward a solution, and\r\nset in place a framework for progress on important problems.  It\r\nis expected that these workshops will often lay the groundwork\r\nfor significant efforts, both by focused research groups and\r\nthrough special, longer term programs at other institutes.  When\r\nit is operating at full capacity, ARCC will sponsor 20-25 focused\r\nworkshops per year, each designed to facilitate collaborative\r\nprogress on an important area of the mathematical sciences.  To\r\nensure that these collaborations will be successful, the leaders\r\nin each field will be involved in the planning of the workshops.\r\nEqually importantly, junior scientists and graduate students will\r\nbe actively involved in the workshops, thereby ensuring the\r\nlong-term development of the ensuing work and contributing to the\r\neducation of new mathematicians.  Special attention will be\r\ndevoted to facilitate collaborations which include women,\r\nminorities, and researchers at primarily undergraduate\r\ninstitutions.  This will allow for a more effective use of the\r\nnation's collective mathematical knowledge and resources.  The\r\nAIM Research Conference Center's emphasis on focused\r\ncollaborative research will foster significant progress on\r\nimportant mathematical problems and will be of significant\r\nbenefit to both current and future generations of mathematicians.\r\n",
