 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a study of computational complexity theory, in particular\r\na study of structural complexity theory and some compelxity problems\r\nrelating to lattice problems.  Computational complexity theory is\r\nthe study of the inherent hardness of computational problems, both\r\nin the worst-case measure as well as in the average-case measure.\r\nThis theory is the underpinning of all computer security based on the\r\nhardness or insolvability of computational problems.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will study the interrelationship between a number of\r\ncomplexity classes, especially those between determinisitic P and the\r\nsecond level of the polynomial time hierarchy, building on the recent\r\nbreakthrough concerning the class S2, the symmetric second level class of\r\nthe hierarchy.  The investigator also explores a notion of persistent\r\nNP-hardness.  This is to be an intermediate level of complexity\r\nmeasure between worst-case hardness and average-case complexity\r\nin the framework of Levin and others. In lattice problems, \r\nthe investigator will search for  moderately efficient algorithms\r\nfor the shortest vector problem and the closest vector problem,\r\nboth in the worst case measure as well as in the average case measure.\r\nThe investigator will study their connections to random lattices,\r\nand potential applications to the design of secure public-key\r\ncryptosystems based on assumptions of hadness in the worst case \r\ncomplexity only.",
