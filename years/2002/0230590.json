The SET program was conceived largely on the basis of three major factors: industrial demand within the region and state, the small number of qualified\r\ngraduates available to enter the workforce, and the increasing pool of potential students. It is  Eastern Washington University's goal to develop and offer a timely and high-quality SET  program that provides a thorough understanding of theory and design combined with the variety\r\nof practical skills needed today. \r\n\r\nThe principal components of the curriculum design to be developed under this grant include:\r\n1.  A synthesis of research derived from surveys and site visits to industry and other undergraduate SET      programs,\r\n2.  Program objectives and outcomes based on the research and internal discussions within the department,      school and college,\r\n3.  A final list of proposed SET courses including course descriptions based on the research\r\n4.  Recommendations for integrating new learning strategies and problem-solving techniques in the      curriculum,\r\n5.\tAn identification of potential industry mentors, internships, and industry-originated classroom projects,\r\n6.\tA final list of laboratory needs including identification of equipment, configurations, and numbers of workstations,\r\n7.\tA student recruitment and retention plan that focuses on nontraditional students,\r\n8.\tIncreased advisory board membership to include persons with a background in SET and non-technical members who can assist with both curriculum development and student recruitment and retention,\r\n9.\tA timeline for obtaining final program approval, and\r\n10.  A  checklist of TAC of ABET requirements.\r\n",
