Biofilm formation in industrial water systems leads to poor system performance, to accelerated biocorrosion, and to increased maintenance expense. Microbial colonization of food processing equipment and medical devices poses a serious health threat when biofilms harbor pathogenic organisms. Toxic biocides, even at high concentrations, often fail to control problematic biofilms. The efficacy of traditional antimicrobial agents would be greatly improved if used in conjunction with biofilm degrading enzymes. This Phase I project  will identify promising biofilm matrix- hydrolyzing enzyme candidates. The follow on Phase II project will develop enzyme products that are stable in the presence of chemical biocides and a variety of  adverse reaction conditions. These enzyme formulations will eventually be tested against mixed-species biofilms.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project are in a number of  areas, including  water distribution systems, food processing equipment, industrial machinery and medical devices.",
