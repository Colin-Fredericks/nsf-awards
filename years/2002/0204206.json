The typical so-called multi-stage stochastic program \r\ntends to be modeled as an extension of a two-stage problem (often referred \r\nto as a stochastic program with recourse).  This misses some important \r\nfeatures of a problem with many time stages, including a description of the \r\ndynamics inherent to the problem, the structure of information, and the \r\ndegree to which one may respond to that information at a given time stage.  \r\nA typical problem from mathematical finance will be framed in a many-\r\nstage stochastic programming setting, allowing for a description of the \r\ndynamics.  The classical pricing results of mathematical finance and \r\nextensions to more complicated problems will be obtained using the new \r\nmodel.  This model will be generalized to be applicable to a much broader \r\nrange of many-stage stochastic optimization problems, highlighting \r\nduality results and their significance.  In conjunction with this will be an \r\ninvestigation into problems that could be modeled in a continuous time \r\nframework, and problems with infinitely many time stages.  New \r\nstochastic programming models, and approximation techniques using the \r\ntools of variational analysis, will be developed for these respective \r\nproblems. Finally, an investigation into the structure of many-stage \r\nproblems that include a description of system dynamics will be \r\nundertaken, leading ultimately to the development and implementation of \r\nalgorithms for solving them.\r\n\r\nDecision making under uncertainty and the theory and techniques of \r\nmathematical programming merged in the 1950's to create the field now \r\nknown as stochastic programming.  A stochastic program is a \r\nmathematical program (e.g. a linear program) that includes in its \r\nformulation a probability distribution to describe uncertain parameters.  \r\nResearch consists largely of understanding problem structure, deriving \r\nduality results and optimality conditions, developing approximation \r\ntechniques, and exploiting the structure and theory in the development of \r\nsolution schemes.  The field's development began with a two-stage \r\nrecourse model, where the cost of a decision made now (e.g. production) \r\nis affected by an uncertain outcome in the future (e.g. demand), and the \r\npossibility of taking recourse action once the future is revealed (e.g. \r\novertime).  A typical problem is to determine the present decision that \r\nminimizes expected cost.  While much knowledge has been gained from \r\nthe investigation of two-stage models, a limited view of many-stage \r\nstochastic programming has resulted in which multistage problems are \r\nconsidered as simple extensions of the two-stage case.  This fails to \r\naddress the inherently dynamic nature of problems with many time stages. \r\nAdditionally, two-stage applications tend to come largely from areas such \r\nas production and manufacturing, whereas the bulk of problems with \r\nmany time stages arise from financial, economic, and environmental \r\nplanning applications and other problems where dynamics are driving a \r\nsystem. Thus, much of the new many-stage theory should be geared \r\ntoward these sorts of applications.  The proposed research will explore the \r\nadditional dynamic structures, theory (duality, approximation), and \r\nquestions regarding implementation, of stochastic optimization problems \r\ninvolving many (possibly even infinitely many, or a continuum of) stages.  \r\nThis will be motivated primarily by financial applications.\r\n",
