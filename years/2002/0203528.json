The overall goal of this project is to contribute to a redesigned engineering curriculum that better matches the practice of engineering in the 21st century. The curriculum focuses on (1) visualization and hands-on manipulation, (2) computer-assisted design and virtual reality, (3) interactive learning, (4) critical thinking, (5) creative problem solving, and (6) problem-based learning. These objectives are achieved through the redesign of existing courses and through the creation of a new interdisciplinary course. The project directly addresses the connection of engineering with the changing needs of industry and society in merging technology areas by educating future engineers in the 'office of the future' environment. This instructional environment (VizClass) includes tele-conferencing capabilities, interactive whiteboards, spatial tracking and semi-immersive visualization operating within a completely wireless environment. The VizClass system uses readily deployable, cost effective components, such that other academic institutions may easily replicate it. The hardware configuration leverages existing technology where possible and introduces system components for the real-time control and the middleware required for fusing numerical solvers with visualization tools and hardware components. Components of the environment include a series of interactive projection display boards (white boards) and a semi-immersive projection table or wall display controlled by a dedicated visualization server. Digital whiteboards, with touch sensitive input surfaces, enable more accurate tracking of user input. Active white board screens providing either an input or output workspace are linked via a high-speed (large storage capacity) server. This in turn is connected to a numerical solver. The solver receives feedback from the input or 'working' screen in the form chosen by the user. If the input-mode is of type equation, the solver manipulates the equations and outputs the solution as either a 2- or 3-dimensional visual object to the selected output device in either mono- or stereoscopic form, respectively. Visual output can be a distorted or contoured mesh (with, for example stresses, strains or heat distribution), or figures annotating important engineering parameters. The advantage of teaching in this environment is the near-real time visual feedback articulating results of the solved equations utilizing the finite element method approach as applied to structural engineering, mechanics or electronics problems. The VizClass is equipped with a wireless network, giving collaborators and students instant access to all available on-line resources.\r\n\r\n",
