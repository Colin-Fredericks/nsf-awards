 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Community Colleges of Colorado plan to establish a regional center in information technology (IT) to significantly increase the supply, capability and diversity of the IT workforce in Colorado. The Center is a consortium of the community colleges with the Colorado Institute of Technology, the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies and a proposed Colorado IT Industry Advisory Council. A technology symposium is held to engage industry and colleges in a dialogue about key issues. Industry needs to become aware of the roles for two-year college graduates in IT. The IT curricula in two-year colleges need to be upgraded and expanded based upon standards and industry requirements. The faculty, teachers, counselors and administrators need ongoing professional development. Students need to be provided consistent information and advising about IT positions. This symposium serves to develop the basis for the Center.",
