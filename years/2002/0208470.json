 "awd_abstract_narration": "SoundVision Productions is developing and distributing a series of ten, hour-long public radio documentaries that will explore the turbulent boundary between science and the humanities, capturing the present moment of tremendous scientific and scholarly ferment with the unique and intimate power of radio.  By introducing the radio audience to the thoughts and voices of some of the world's most accomplished scientists, in conversations with the counterparts in the humanities, the series will look at recent developments in science including physics, molecular and cell biology, environmental science, cognitive psychology and neuroscience, and the multiple disciplines of the life sciences reflecting the increasingly subtle and widespread application of evolutionary theory.  In each program, a careful account of new scientific ideas and discoveries will be placed within the context of historical and contemporary thought about the human and natural worlds.\r\n\r\nBarinetta Scott, the Executive Producer, has most recently been the Executive Producer for the highly regarded NSF funded NPR series, \"The DNA Files.\"  In developing this project, she will work closely with an advisory committee that includes:\r\n\r\nJohn Avise, Research Professor, Dept. of Genetics, University of Georgia\r\n\r\nSamuel Barondes, Professor and Director of the University of California San Francisco's Center for Neurobiology and Psychiatry\r\n\r\nTerrence Deacon, Associate Professor of Anthropology, Boston University\r\n\r\nAnne Foerst, Professor of Computer Science and Theology, St. Bonaventure University\r\n\r\nUrsula Goodenough, Dept. of Biology, Washington University, St. Louis\r\n\r\nWilliam Irons, Professor of Anthropology, Northwestern University\r\n\r\nGordon Kane, Professor of Physics, University of Michigan\r\n\r\nJim Miller, Senior Program Associate for the AAAS Program of Dialogue Between Science and Religion\r\n\r\nW.
