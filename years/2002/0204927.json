This hypothetical theory should live in\r\n11-dimensional space and the corresponding low energy action\r\nshould be given by 11-dimensional supergravity. At this\r\nmoment a rigorous definition of M-theory is not known. \r\nNevertheless, using various heuristic tools (first of all,\r\ndualities) physicists have created a beautiful and\r\nconsistent picture, where all versions of (super)string\r\ntheory can be obtained as limiting cases.A promising approach \r\nto a rigorous definition of M-theory is based on so\r\ncalled M(atrix) theory. The action functional of BFSS M(atrix) \r\nmodel can be obtained from ten-dimensional supersymmetric\r\nYang-Mills theory ( 10 D SYM theory) by means of dimensional\r\nreduction to (0+1)-dimensional space.(This means that we should \r\nconsider only gauge fields that do not depend on spatial\r\nvariables, but can be time-dependent.)  It was shown  by  \r\nA.Connes,  M. Douglas and A. Schwarz (1998) that\r\ncompactification of M(atrix) theory  can lead\r\nto gauge theories on noncommutative spaces, in particular, on \r\nnoncommutative tori.This paper  opened the way for application \r\nof Connes' noncommutative geometry to string/M-theory  . It\r\nbecame very popular, especially after the appearance of the\r\ninfluential Seiberg-Witten paper (1999) , that contains\r\ntogether with important new  results, the understanding of\r\nNekrasov-Schwarz noncommutative instantons (1998),  gauge\r\n(complete) Morita equivalence defined by A.Schwarz (1998),and  \r\nPioline-Schwarz background independence (1999)    from the\r\nstring theory viewpoint. The number of papers considering  the \r\nrelation of string/M-theory to noncommutative spaces grows \r\nexponentially (today it is close to a thousand); many of these\r\narticles  were influenced by the papers of A. Schwarz and his\r\ncollaborators. A. Schwarz  intends  to continue his work on\r\napplications of noncommutative geometry to string/ M-theory.  \r\nHe is  planning to  analyze thoroughly the general theory of \r\ngauge fields on noncommutative spaces and  its relation to the \r\nduality in physics. He would like to apply (in collaboration \r\nwith M. Movshev) this general theory to  the construction\r\nand analysis of gauge theories on noncommutative curved spaces. \r\nOne more direction  the PI  would like to pursue ( also\r\ntogether with M. Movshev) is a search of formulation\r\nM(atrix) theory ( and, more generally, maximally supersymmetric\r\ngauge theory) in a manifestly supersymmetric form. The solution \r\nof this problem is interesting by itself, but M. Movshev and \r\nA. Schwarz  are planning to use it also as  a starting point in \r\nthe construction of a  maximally supersymmetric Dirac-Born-Infeld\r\naction  for nonabelian gauge fields and on  noncommutative \r\nspaces. A. Schwarz is planning to develop a complex version of \r\nConnes' noncommutative geometry and the theory of\r\nnoncommutative theta functions having in mind possible\r\napplications to noncommutative instantons and other BPS\r\nfields.He  aims also to study the role of K-theory in \r\nstring/ M-theory. M. Movshev  is planning to analyze\r\nalgebraic structures arising in open string field theory. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is clear now that noncommutative geometry is quite useful\r\nin physics. The PI intends to develop methods of\r\nnoncommutative geometry and to apply these methods to\r\nvarious problems arising in string/ M-theory. It seems\r\nthat noncommutative geometry should play an important role\r\nin rigorous formulation of M-theory. The PI hopes that\r\nhis work will contribute to the search of appropriate\r\nmathematical formalism. \r\n",
