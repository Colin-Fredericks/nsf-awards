We are introducing four digital microscopy workstations into our cell biology, microbiology, and plant physiology courses. These workstations permit us to offer laboratory exercises that expose students to techniques and phenomena normally confined to the research laboratory. We are adapting research techniques from the contemporary science literature and building upon the efforts of several other project supported by NSF that incorporate digital microscopy workstations into the undergraduate curriculum (e.g., DUE-0088185, 9952672 and 0088412). For example, phase and fluorescence microscopy is being used in experiments to examine the various cell compartments and dynamic processes such as organelle transport and cell migration. Students have the capability to make digital records, including time-lapse movies, of their phase and fluorescence observations. It is our experience that experiments that include fluorescence and video microscopy generate the greatest excitement among our students.\r\n",
