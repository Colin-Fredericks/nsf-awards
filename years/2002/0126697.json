In the game, students apply the principles learned in class to \"run their company\", as investment opportunities become available. Each opportunity requires the use of the most recent topics covered in class. The current \"manual\" version of the game, although very popular with the students, requires inordinate instructor time to manage the game and calculate the results of the students' decisions. Students will be surveyed to get their reaction and their suggestions; also test results from students who used the game in their course will be compared to those from a similar course where the game was not used. The investigators will present papers describing the game and the results of their evaluation at professional conferences, and they will make the software available free to anyone who is interested through a web site and a CD-ROM.",
