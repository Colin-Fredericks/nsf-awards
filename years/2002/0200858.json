 "awd_abstract_narration": "Passing from an affine algebra or an ideal to the integral closure\r\nis a fundamental operation. The investigator intends to examine\r\ncomputational aspects of this process. While there exist algorithms\r\nfor computing the integral closure of an affine domain, little is\r\nknown about the complexity of such calculations. To address this\r\nproblem the investigator intends to find estimates for the number\r\nof algebra generators of the integral closure and for the degrees\r\nof these generators. In the case of ideals on the other hand, one\r\nstill has no efficient method for computing integral closures. In\r\nview of this lack of an algorithm, the investigator intends to\r\nexpress, or at least approximate, the integral closure of an ideal\r\nby a sum of colon ideals that are more readily accessible. The core\r\nof an ideal is a counterpart of the integral closure: it encodes\r\ninformation about all possible reductions of a given ideal, i.e.,\r\nall ideals over which the given ideal is integral. The investigator\r\nintends to work on a conjectural formula that, if proved, would give\r\nan explicit expression for the core of a large class of ideals.\r\nContinuing the somewhat computational theme the investigator proposes\r\nto establish bounds for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of\r\nembedded projective varieties in terms of their defining equations.\r\nThe known results require strong assumptions on the singularities of\r\nthe variety which the investigator hopes to weaken. In this vein he\r\nintends to show that rational singularities persist under generic\r\nlinkage of ideals in the linkage class of a complete intersection.\r\nIn continuation of his earlier work on blowup algebras the\r\ninvestigator plans to study the rings representing special fibers of\r\nblowups. These `special fiber rings' describe, for instance, images\r\nof rational maps, including secant varieties and Gauss images. The\r\ninvestigator intends to study the Cohen-Macaulayness of special fiber\r\nrings, estimate their depth and compute multiplicities. Suitable\r\ndepth estimates would have a bearing on a conjecture by Mazur that\r\noriginates in Wiles' work on deformations of Galois representations.\r\nFormulas for the multiplicity on the other hand would lead to an\r\nextension of the Teissier-Pluecker formula for the degrees of certain\r\ndual varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe investigator works in the area of Mathematics called \"Commutative Algebra,\" which deals with the qualitative study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables.  Such systems arise in numerous applications outside mathematics.  Over the past two decades commutative algebraists have become more concerned with computational aspects, thereby emphasizing connections to applied areas such as computer algebra, robotics, cryptography and coding theory.  This project addresses both theoretical and computational aspects of commutative algebra.\r\n",
