 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the many ambitions of Arizona State University East (ASUE) faculty is to motivate and mentor Arizona students to pursue education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Our planning strategy is to explore the creation of a consortium of partners from educational institutions (ASUE, Pima Community College [PCC], and six high schools in the Sunnyside School District); the Arizona Science Center (ASC); and industry collaborators (Intel, Microchip, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments) to launch a campaign to interest young adults in science and technology disciplines. Their objective has been to study the creation of educational pathways and career awareness programs for students enrolled in middle school, high school, and community college science and math courses that culminate in the completion of a Baccalaureate Degree in Engineering Technology/Technology at ASUE. Their goal is to improve the educational system in the State of Arizona and to render underrepresented Arizona populations (Hispanics, Native and African Americans, and women) better equipped to meet the multidisciplinary needs of high technology companies.",
