Topics to be addressed include geometric aspects (modeling and\r\nrepresentation techniques, data structures, algorithms and analysis, software development,\r\nimplementation and testing, etc.) of: manufacturing processes, manufacturing and assembly\r\nplanning, rapid prototyping technologies, model acquisition/reconstruction, reverse engineering,\r\ncomputational metrology and tolerancing, mechanism design, constraint systems,\r\nsimulation and visualization in design and manufacturing, solid modeling related to manufacturing,\r\ncomputer vision and robotics related to manufacturing, and manufacturing in\r\nspecific applications (e.g., biomedical, textile, automotive, aerospace engineering etc.).",
