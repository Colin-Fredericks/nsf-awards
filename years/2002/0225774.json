 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small grant for exploratory research will support development of novel computer systems that will enhance the quality of life of people suffering from Alzheimer's Disease and similar cognitive disorders. Assisted Cognition systems use ubiquitous computing and artificial intelligence technology to replace some of the memory and problem-solving abilities that have been lost by an Alzheimer's patient. Assisted Cognition systems: sense aspects of an individual's location and environment, both outdoors and at home, relying on a wide range of sensors such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), active badges, motion detectors, and other ubiquitous computing infrastructure; learn to interpret patterns of everyday behavior, and recognize signs of distress, disorientation, or confusion, using techniques from state estimation, plan recognition, and machine learning; offer help to patients through various kinds of interventions including speech and natural language processing; and alert human care-givers in case of danger.\r\n\r\nTwo concrete examples of the Assisted Cognition systems that will be developed are an activity compass that helps reduce spatial disorientation both inside and outside the home, and an adaptive prompter that helps patients carry out multi-step everyday tasks. This project will explore an emerging area that could be of great humanitarian, commercial, social, and scientific importance in the coming decades.\r\n",
