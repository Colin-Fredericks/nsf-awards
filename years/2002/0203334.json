 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for 0203334:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award provides support for a one-day workshop of separations specialists to identify needs and opportunities for research on capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide is the leading greenhouse gas that may be responsible for global warming.  Much carbon dioxide is produced by power plants and by transportation as well as industrial operations.  To deal with the potential treats of global warming it is desirable to develop efficient and economical methods for separating and stabilizing carbon dioxide so that discharges to the atmosphere can be controlled.  The experts attending the workshop will provide guidance to NSF regarding appropriate research investments in this area.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is being organized by the University of Colorado.  It will be held at Tulane University during the week of March 11, 2002.  It is planned to coincide with an AIChE conference that will offer a symposium on global warming.  Thus, a number of experts will be available at that site.  It is expected that staff from DOE will also participate so the workshop should provide an opportunity for coordination of research efforts by the two agencies.  The impact will be to enhance development of greenhouse-gas-control technology for the protection of the global environment. \r\n",
