Friedman and S. Simpson, and\r\ntopos theory.  NSF support is provided for some of the expenses\r\nof the speakers and attendees, in particular of the graduate\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nVia the meetings sponsored, the MAMLS grant maintains the\r\nvitality of the field of mathematical logic.  Special emphasis is\r\nplaced on enhancing the participation of younger researchers and\r\nmembers of traditionally underrepresented groups, especially\r\nwomen.  This is done by providing an intellectual forum in which\r\nall interested persons are invited to contribute and in which\r\nthere are lectures on current topics of research.\r\nThe Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar (MAMLS), formed in\r\nthe fall of 1982 under the aegis of Lee Stanley, has supported\r\n3-4 regional meetings per year of 1-2 days' duration since then.\r\nThese meetings are held at various locations and cover a broad\r\nspectrum of mathematical logic with particular emphasis on\r\ncomplexity theory, theoretical computer science, fragments of\r\narithmetic, pure and applied model theory, proof theory,\r\nrecursion theory, set theory, subsystems of analysis in\r\naccordance with the program of H.
