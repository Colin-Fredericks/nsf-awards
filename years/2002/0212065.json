 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evidence for arms-race coevolution between predator and prey will be\r\nevaluated in a unique natural interaction between  toxic newts and their\r\nresistant snake predators. Newts possess the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin\r\n(TTX), which blocks sodium channels in nerves and muscles. No known\r\npredator can ingest TTX and survive except for garter snakes of the\r\ngenus Thamnophis. Previous work demonstrated that predator and prey have\r\nmatched levels of defensive and exploitative abilities, but the source\r\nof newt toxicity is still unknown. High Performance Liquid\r\nChromatography (HPLC) will be used to assay levels of toxin in\r\nlaboratory bred and reared newts to determine whether the requisite\r\nindividual, genetic and population variation exists for newts to evolve\r\nin response to predators, allowing an evaluation of whether observed\r\npatterns of matching are consistent with an arms race view of\r\ncoevolution.\r\n\tUnderstanding the interactions between species that drive\r\ncoevolution is a major goal of evolutionary biology. Coevolution, in\r\nwhich one species evolves in response to another species, is thought to\r\nbe one of the major engines of biodiversity. Although coevolution is\r\nthought to be a common outcome of many ecological interaction, there are\r\nstrong theoretical and empirical reasons to suspect that predator-prey\r\ninteractions might be different. This research will shed important light\r\non natural variation in an important neurotoxin, TTX, which is used\r\nwidely in studies of nerve function and development, by identifying the\r\nsources of TTX in amphibians.\r\n",
