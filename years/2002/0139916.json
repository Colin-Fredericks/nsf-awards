He will apply analytical, topological and combinatorial\r\ntools in order to investigate real and complex systems. A substantial\r\npart of the project is aimed at providing bridges between real and\r\ncomplex, one- and two-dimensional dynamics. A new class of\r\ntwo-dimensional systems will be considered. Quadratic laminations will\r\nbe looked upon from the point of view of combinatorial dynamics and\r\nrotation theory. For other systems attractors, periodic orbits,\r\nrotation sets and topological entropy will be in the center of\r\nattention. Moreover, symbolic systems with an additional local order\r\nstructure will be studied.\r\n\r\nFor almost every phenomenon from Physics, Chemistry, Biology,\r\nMedicine, Economy and other sciences one can make a mathematical model\r\nthat can be regarded as a dynamical system. Sometimes the study of\r\nthis system is extremely difficult, but quite often it can be reduced\r\nto the study of a much simpler, low dimensional or symbolic one. This\r\nproject is devoted mainly to the investigation of the properties of\r\nthese types of systems from the mathematical point of view. The\r\nresults that can be obtained are usually much stronger than in the\r\ngeneral case and often lead to much deeper understanding of the\r\noriginal systems.\r\n",
