The overarching goal of the program is to increase\r\nthe number of talented, low-income students enrolled and retained in these degree programs\r\nenabling them to enter the high technology workforce. The program establishes and maintains an infrastructure of support services for Infinity Scholars that includes a one credit hour Infinity Scholars Course that concludes with the completion of a capstone project. The Infinity Scholars program focuses on \r\ndelivering a menu of educational services and learning experiences that retain students and support a seamless transition to job placement upon degree attainment from the community college, or transfer of students to 4-year institutions.\r\n\r\n",
