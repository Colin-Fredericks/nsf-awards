Gannod\r\n\r\nThe objective of the research component of this project is to develop software \r\narchitecture analysis and software reverse engineering techniques that support \r\nthe evolution of existing software into software product lines with an emphasis \r\non high-integrity systems.  To this end, this research will first involve the \r\ndevelopment of an approach for analyzing software from both the architecture and \r\ncomponent views in order to support assessment along different quality attribute \r\ndimensions.  The approach will consist of models for static and dynamic analysis \r\nas well as simulation to determine level of compliance with quality attribute \r\nconstraints.  Second, this research will involve the development of a methodology \r\nfor modifying and evolving software at both the architecture and component levels \r\nin order to ensure compliance with different quality attribute constraints and \r\ngoals.  For the software architecture community, this research will address a \r\nneed for analysis approaches that allow software architects to assess the extent \r\nto which a software architecture meets various quality concerns.  In addition, \r\nthe results of this research will facilitate the long-term evolution of a software \r\narchitecture based on long-term product-line goals.  For the software reverse \r\nengineering and maintenance community, this research addresses the need for \r\napproaches that allow a software maintainer to determine the extent of the \r\nsupport for various quality attributes by individual components and provides \r\na technique that facilitates component modification in order to ensure compliance \r\nto quality constraints.",
