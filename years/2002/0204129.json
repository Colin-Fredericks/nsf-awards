Goerss\r\n\r\nHomotopy theory is the study of topological phenomena that \r\nremain invariant under fairly flexible sorts of continuous deformations.  Most basically, we seek to compute and to \r\nunderstand homotopy classes of maps between finite simplicial \r\nor CW complexes, perhaps after some sort of stabilization. \r\nComputation and understanding are not the same: we have forty \r\nor more years of computations, but only lately have we begun \r\nto have the language to in which to make a coherent theory out \r\nof the data we have. This project is, therefore, as much about exploring and refining the language as it is about calculations \r\n-- although there will be a mixture of both.  The entry point \r\nis the observation that any cohomology theory with a good \r\ntheory of Chern classes gives rise to a formal group law\r\nand, hence, a formal group. Conversely, given a formal group\r\nwe can ask whether there is an associated cohomology theory.\r\nThese cohomology theories then delineate the finer structure\r\nof stable homotopy theory.\r\n\r\nThis is the chromatic picture of stable homotopy: we seek\r\nto use the algebraic geometry of formal groups to organize and \r\ndirect investigations into the deeper structure of computations \r\nand theory.  This project seeks to develop this point of view \r\nin two directions, one local and one global.  The first, or \r\nlocal, direction is an investigation into K(n)-local homotopy \r\ntheory in general and into the K(n)-local sphere in particular. \r\nThe second, or more global, direction, would be to make systematic\r\nour knowledge of structured ring spectra using stacks and \r\nthe moduli stack of formal groups as the basic parametrizing\r\ndevice.\r\n",
