 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0203941\r\nJohn Etnyre\r\n\r\nThe focus of this proposal is to better understand the nature of contact structures in \r\nall (odd) dimensions, with special attention given to dimension three, and to apply contact \r\ntopological techniques to questions in hydrodynamics. The first main theme of the \r\nproposed research is Legendrian knots. Legendrian knots are knots that are tangent to \r\na contact structure and seem to encode a great deal of information about the contact \r\nstructure. For example, the famed tight vs. overtwisted dichotomy in dimension three \r\ncan be understood in terms of Legendrian knots. These knots also give an important invariant \r\nof a contact structure. As part of this proposal the general structure of Legendrian knots \r\nwill be studied. The expected outcome will be various classification result for certain \r\nLegendrian knots and contact structures; and, moreover, a better understanding of Legendrian \r\nsurgery (an important surgery construction of contact structures). Legendrian knots in \r\nhigher dimensions will also be studied using contact homology. There is very little known \r\nabout contact structures, or Legendrian knots, in dimensions above three. By investigating \r\nLegendrian knots in these dimensions the nature of contact structures should be illuminated, \r\njust as the corresponding study revealed much about three dimensional contact structures. \r\nThe final part of the proposed research centers on the connection between contact structures \r\nand hydrodynamics discovered a few years ago by the Principal Investigator and R. Ghrist. \r\nHere work with Ghrist will continue with the aim of understanding when, and what type of, \r\nclosed flow lines occur in fluid flows. We shall also study hydrodynamic instability from \r\nthe contact topological perspective. This naturally leads into the study of energy minimization \r\nfor fluid flows and relations between contact and Riemannian geometry.\r\n\r\nContact structures are very natural objects, born over two centuries ago, in the work of Huygens, \r\nHamilton and  Jacobi on geometric optics. Through the centuries contact structures have touched \r\non many diverse areas of mathematics and physics, including classical mechanics and thermodynamics. \r\nIn everyday life one encounters contact geometry when ice skating, parallel parking a car, \r\nnavigating a submarine, using a refrigerator, or simply watching the beautiful play of light in a \r\nglass of water. Many great mathematicians have devoted a lot of their work to this subject  but \r\nonly in the last decade or two has it moved into the foreground of mathematics. This renaissance \r\nis due to the recent remarkable breakthroughs in contact topology, resulting in a rich and beautiful  \r\ntheory with many applications. The most remarkable feature of all this recent work is the intimate \r\nconnections between contact structures and topology in dimension three. Moreover, there were \r\nimportant newfound interactions with Hamiltonian mechanics, symplectic and sub-Riemannian geometry, \r\nfoliation theory, complex geometry and analysis, topological hydrodynamics, and knot theory. The \r\nPrincipal Investigator will explore new connections between contact structures and topology in all \r\n(odd) dimensions and continue his study of idealized fluid flows (hydrodynamics) via contact geometry.\r\n",
