 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0203593\r\nYong-Geun Oh \r\n\r\nFloer homology in symplectic geometry\r\nwas introduced by Floer in an attempt\r\nto prove the Arnold conjecture. \r\nVarious results by Chekanov, Oh, Polterovich\r\nand Seidel have proved that the Floer homology is a general \r\npowerful tool to investigate symplectic topology.\r\nIn this project, Oh proposes to \r\nfurther investigate structure and applications of the Floer \r\ntheory for deeper understanding of the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group \r\nand Lagrangian submanifolds or more generally symplectic topology.\r\nThe Floer theory of Lagrangian submanifolds, via \r\nFukaya's A-infinity category, also provides a geometric framework\r\nfor Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry\r\nproposal on Calabi-Yau manifolds. Oh's recent work with Fukaya, \r\nOhta and Ono provides several key steps towards a rigorous \r\nconstruction of Fukaya's category by developing an obstruction \r\ntheory for defining the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology.\r\nComplete construction will involve study of singular Lagrangian \r\nsubmanifolds, Lagrangian surgery and their relations to the Floer homology.\r\nOh proposes to investigate these new aspects of the Floer theory\r\nin relation the mirror symmetry on the Calabi-Yau manifolds.\r\n\r\nThe Hamiltonian formalism plays\r\nimportant roles not only for solving problems in classical mechanics\r\nbut also for quantizing the classical mechanics into\r\nquantum mechanics.  The Poisson\r\nbracket is the crucial geometric structure that plays a key role in\r\nthe classical mechanics and the quantum mechanics through the\r\nquantization process. When one considers mechanics in \r\na constrained system, i.e., mechanics on a curved space, \r\ndescription of the corresponding phase space\r\nand the geometric structure corresponding to the Poisson bracket\r\nrequires the notion of the symplectic structure\r\nand symplectic manifolds. Symplectic geometry and topology \r\nis the study of symplectic manifolds. \r\nIn symplectic geometry, there are two most important objects of\r\nstudy. One is the study of Hamiltonian systems, a special type\r\nof differential equation, and their periodic orbits.\r\nThis is dynamical in nature. The other is the study of geometry\r\nand topology of Lagrangian submanifolds. This is geometric in nature.\r\nUnderstanding the intersection theory of Lagrangian submanifolds\r\nis the core of symplectic topology. Floer homology introduced \r\nby Floer in the end of 80's is a general machinery to study\r\nthis intersection theory. The Floer theory also provides a \r\ngeometric framework for the  mirror symmetry phenomenon that \r\nwas discovered by physicists in string theory.\r\nOh's proposed research aims at, on the one hand, deeper understanding of\r\nsymplectic topology, and also aims at understanding inter-relations \r\nbetween the symplectic and the complex geometry \r\nvia the study of mirror symmetry.\r\n\r\n",
