The two-day workshop is one of the series organized by Mineralogical Society of America.  A total of 13 invited presentations (16 invited speakers) are currently on the agenda.  Reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of this area of science, among these 16 invited speakers, three are from materials science community and two are from geodynamics.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this workshop is to provide students and scientists alike an opportunity to learn the current status of plastic deformation of minerals and rocks.  There have been major progresses in the study of plastic deformation in minerals and rocks during the last 20 years or so.  They include the extension of experimental studies to a wider range of conditions and the development of theoretical models of deformation including the modeling of deformation microstructures.  But there has been little opportunity to bring these developments together to allow students and scientists in Earth sciences to learn the current progresses to make significant advances in Earth sciences.  This workshop will provide such an opportunity that is needed for the healthy development of solid Earth sciences particularly solid Earth geodynamics.\r\n",
