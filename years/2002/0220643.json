 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project provides a unique opportunity for talented but financially\r\ndisadvantaged high school students from Southeastern Massachusetts to enter and complete \r\nan innovative education program in computer science, civil, mechanical, electrical, and \r\ncomputer engineering disciplines at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth (UMD). \r\nResidents of Southeastern Massachusetts are going through a major economic transition \r\nthat resulted from almost total loss of textile industry in the United States. This region was \r\nonce one of the richest communities in the nation, but it is now home for mostly working \r\nclass population with first generation college attendees. UMD is well known for providing \r\none of the best undergraduate engineering programs in northeast United States. However, \r\nit still loses the battle for attracting highly qualified students who cannot afford college \r\non their own.\r\n\r\nUMD has developed a strategic plan to play a major role in the economic revival of the \r\nregion. As part of this plan, the University has established an Advanced Technology and \r\nManufacturing Center (ATMC). ATMC assists technology based companies in the region \r\nto develop new products and processes and helps them commercialize university-\r\ndeveloped technologies. While ATMC has a staff of professionals, it also employs a good \r\nnumber of student interns who function as junior engineers on its projects.\r\n\r\nThis project combines internship opportunities available at the ATMC with an NSF\r\nsupported Foundation Coalition program that has been established for freshmen and \r\nsophomores in the College of Engineering at UMD. This combination provides a unique \r\neducational opportunity for students with financial needs. Students admitted through \r\nCSEMS spend their first two years in the College of Engineering's integrated math/\r\nscience/engineering curriculum and are supported by NSF scholarships. In their last \r\ntwo years, they join the ATMC as interns. During their ten hours a week internship at \r\nthe ATMC, CSEMS students are not only gain invaluable experience, they also earn \r\ninternship salaries that are higher than what they receive during the first two years \r\nwork study program. With this plan, CSEMS students are trained similar to that of \r\nmedical school students who get experience in teaching hospitals.\r\n\r\nIn order to take maximum advantage of this scholarship program, we plan for a project \r\ncycle of six years funded by a combination of NSF and private industry. During the first \r\nthree years we admit three cohorts of twenty students each. By the end of the four-year \r\nNSF project period, each student is supported by NSF funds for the first two years of \r\nhis/her education. During the last two years, each student is supported by industry \r\nprojects at ATMC. To accomplish the objectives of this project a partnership has been \r\ndeveloped with eighteen of the area high schools, and a contact person has been \r\nidentified for each school. All schools have expressed their enthusiasm to identify \r\nqualified students for this program. In addition, a set of programs and activities has \r\nbeen planned to add to the exceptional features of this project.",
