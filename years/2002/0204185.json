The space of all such homotopy equivalences, \r\ncalled Outer space, is a contractible space on which the \r\ngroup of outer automorphisms of a free group acts properly\r\ndiscontinuously.  Analyzing the quotient of Outer space by \r\nthis action has yielded a significant amount of algebraic \r\ninformation about this group over the years.  More recently,\r\nwork of Maxim Kontsevich has  related the rational homology \r\nof this quotient to the homology of a certain \r\ninfinite-dimensional Lie algebra, consisting of derivations \r\nof the free Lie algebra.   Kontsevich also defined variations \r\nof this infinite-dimensional Lie algebra whose homologies \r\nare related to the homology of mapping class groups and to\r\nKontsevich's graph homology, which is a homology \r\ntheory containing various 3-manifold and knot invariants.  \r\nThe Principal Investigator will use this point of view to \r\nobtain new information about invariants of these groups \r\nof classical interest to topologists; conversely, topological \r\nmethods will be applied to obtain new information about \r\nthese Lie algebras and their homology.  In particular, new \r\nLie bi-algebra structures on the chain complexes used to\r\ncompute graph homology, recently discovered by Jim Conant \r\nthe the Principal Investivator,  will be investivated. \r\nFinally,  the local geometry of Outer space will be studied.  \r\nCertain neighborhoods in Outer space are non-positively \r\ncurved metric spaces, and can be identified with spaces \r\nof finite labelled metric trees.  Such trees are of interest \r\nin many branches of science, including biology, where they \r\nappear as evolutionary trees produced from DNA data. Another \r\naim of this project is to determine efficient algorithms for \r\nfinding geodesics in this space, and to continue from there \r\nto develop a program of applying statistical methods to this \r\nspace of trees.  \r\n\r\nGraphs and trees appear in many contexts in the sciences and \r\nin mathematics.  In Geometric Group Theory  a space of graphs \r\nknown as Outer space, originally defined by Marc Culler and \r\nthe Principal Investigator,  has been used extensively to \r\nstudy the group of outer automorphisms of a finitely \r\ngenerated free group.  In this project the Principal \r\nInvestigator will continue to study how the geometry of \r\nthis space is related to algebraic properties of the group \r\nof automorphisms. A new perspective on this problem is \r\nprovided by work of M. Kontsevich; motivated by \r\nconsiderations from physics and symplectic geometry, \r\nKontsevich defined various abstract infinite-dimensional \r\nalgebraic structures whose invariants  are closely related \r\nto invariants of Outer space.  Finally, small regions of \r\nOuter space can be identified with spaces of finite trees.  \r\nSuch trees are used as a tool by evolutionary biologists, \r\nand another focus of this project is understanding the \r\nlocal geometry of these regions in a very concrete, \r\nalgorithmic way which can be applied to problems in\r\nmolecular phylogenetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
