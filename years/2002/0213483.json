 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Levis will investigate the behavior of molecules in the presence of intense laser pulses.  A long-range goal of these studies is the control of chemical reactions in the gaseous and eventually the solution phase.  Special experimental and theoretical tools will be developed towards the realization of these goals. \r\n\r\nChemical reactions most often occur along reaction paths that are determined by the intrinsic properties of the reactants.  Reactions that lead to desirable reaction products are then not realized unless means are found to control the reactions by means of external intervention.  One hopeful method to achieve such control is through modification of the intrinsic molecular properties in the presence of very intense laser fields.  The goal of this project is to devise experimental and theoretical techniques that lead to the control of chemical reactions.  Students and postdoctoral research associates participate in this research.\r\n",
