 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its inception in 1986, the main goal of the NBER Macroeconomics Annual Conference has been to encourage promising and established young researchers to write empirically oriented papers that draw out and test the empirical implications of new theories as well as papers that use relevant theory to analyze empirical or policy issues of current interest.  There has also been a tendency within the field of macroeconomics to split into different schools of thought with little communication between these schools.  Another goal of the Macroeconomics Annual has been to provide an opportunity for macroeconomists within different points of view to focus on different approaches to problems, not in the abstract, but in relation to specific empirical issues.  The conference series will continue to encourage the writing of empirically oriented papers by both established and promising young economists. In addition, the series will continue to serve as a forum for communication among economists from the different schools of macroeconomics. The annual conference volume has become a widely cited and influential research reference.",
