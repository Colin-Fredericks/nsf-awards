A platform for learning is used to integrate the curriculum..  Beginning in the freshman year, students build on the platform (in this case a robot we call TekBots) so that subject areas become connected and students have a context for their learning similar to what practicing engineers experience in their profession. As students take courses throughout the program, they apply their knowledge to this platform so that it becomes a representation of what they have learned and how the various topics they have learned are connected. A key part of developing this curriculum is also enhancing stakeholder-defined goals and outcomes such as those in the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) criteria.  The proposed curriculum will be designed to specifically enhance these outcomes and, the will determine if and how much the platform for learning curriculum improves each of these outcomes. \r\n",
