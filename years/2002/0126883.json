 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biology (61)\r\nThe Biology Department at the University of St. Thomas has built a curriculum for both majors and non-majors that introduces undergraduates to modern biological techniques modeled on actual scientific investigations. This project is introducing flow cytometry into this curriculum in order to address our goal of providing students with hands-on exposure to current technology via investigative laboratory experiences. The project is modeled after successful similar efforts at Occidental College, Haverford College, Ursinus College, and San Diego State University. The flow cytometer is a powerful tool for detailed analysis of complex populations of cells in a short period of time. In recent years, flow cytometers have become less expensive and more user-friendly, making them accessible and appropriate for undergraduate biology\r\neducation. In this project we are integrating flow cytometry into our curriculum via three majors courses, two non-majors courses, and independent student research. We also making flow cytometry available to Biology faculty in a Twin Cities consortium of five private institutions. We are aiming to expand future use of the technology into other courses of our curriculum such as advanced cell biology, microbiology, molecular biology, evolution and ecology, as seen in other undergraduate programs.",
