The collaborators are Anup Sharma of Alabama A&M University (AAMU) and Har Narayan Acharya of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IITKgp).  They will examine issues related to the fabrication of specifically doped single-mode optical fibers and followup with an investigation of the Bragg-grating characteristics that are written in these fibers.  The researchers will utilize the unique capabilities and expertise offered by  each participating institution to accomplish the research objectives.  The IITKgp specializes in optical fiber preform and single-mode fabrication; AMMU is a leader in characterizing Bragg- gratings in optical fibers.  Fiber Bragg-gratings have numerous important applications in sensing and communications.  The research goals include developing a novel scheme for fiber sensing of strain and temperature.     \r\n\r\nScope:  This activity will initiate a new international collaboration with a competent group of Indian materials scientists and will promote the participation of under-represented groups in research.  A doctoral student will accompany the PI on trips to the IITKgp where he will learn about the modified chemical vapor deposition techniques; likewise, the Indian collaborator will gain exposure to fabrication techniques developed at AAMU.  This proposal has strong educational aspects and there is a good chance that the investigators will produce novel results.  The Indian Department of Science and Technology (DST) jointly supports this activity under the NSF/DST program.   \r\n\r\n",
