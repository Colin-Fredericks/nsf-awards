 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on designing solid state chemical strategies that will produce tailor-made porous crystals. Synthetic and host-guest chemistry of new compositions will be developed to advance porous materials research with the following emphasis: (a) frameworks combining porosity with semi-, photo-conductive, and nonlinear optical properties, (b) synthesis of extra-large pore (defined: 10-20 A diameter) frameworks,which will be useful in the separation and catalytic conversion of bio-related molecules (pharmaceuticals) and large petrolewn fractions, and (c) confined molecular space of unusual composition and electrostatic potential capable of hosting the assembly of active molecular complexes and clusters. Because the nature of this project involves both solution chemistry and solid-state chemistry, it provides a rare opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to experience and become experts in the synthesis, characterization and properties of materials in both arenas. \r\n\r\nPorous materials based on carbon and oxide compositions have found wide-spread applications in sensing, gas separation, catalysis, environirnental cleanup (water purification and radioactive ion removal), nanotechnology, and more recently in hydrogen and methane storage and transport. For example, the enormous importance of zeolitic silicates and aluminosilicates as shape- and size-selective adsorbents, ion- exchangers and catalysts is reflected by their 350 billion US dollar sector of the global economy. The interdisciplinary nature of this research is ideally suited for training students in areas that are becoming increasingly critical to the US ability to maintain its leadership in global industries. \r\n",
