 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specifics of this project concern three directions which\r\narose out of a general interest in definable equivalence\r\nrelations. The first of these directions relates to the treeable\r\nequivalence relations.  Following work of Adams and Kechris, we\r\nknow that there is a mass of countable Borel equivalence\r\nrelations which are mutually incomparable.  No such result is\r\nknown for the treeable Borel equivalence relations. We do not\r\nknow whether there are infinitely many distinct examples, and we\r\nbasically have only one established example which is not\r\nhyperfinite. More generally we do not know whether the implicit\r\ninvolvement of measure theoretic examples involving free actions\r\nof the free group is the sole obstruction to hyperfiniteness. The\r\nsecond direction of Hjorth's project concerns issues in the fine\r\nstudy of Borel complexities of countable isomorphism types in the\r\ntopology of quantifier free logic, and may be connected with a\r\ntranslation of some basic concepts from first order logic into a\r\nquantifier free context. The third direction of the proposal is\r\nto investigate some combinatorial questions, such as having a\r\nmodel with a certain partition property for definable partitions,\r\nfor infinitary sentences, especially those arising as the Scott\r\nsentence of some countable structure; this may be related to a\r\nstill open problem posed by Shelah in the 1970's on the Hanf\r\nnumber up to the continuum for countably infinitary logic.\r\n\r\nIn very general terms, this project can be located inside the\r\nbranch of mathematics known as \"descriptive set theory\". This\r\narea arose around the end of 19th century as part of an effort to\r\nbetter understand the basic objects -- such as the real number\r\nline, real valued functions, subsets of the reals, subsets or\r\nregions of two dimensional and three dimensional space, the area\r\nor volume of such subsets -- which appear in calculus, and which\r\nare needed for applications in engineering, physics, and\r\ndifferential equations. Descriptive set theory does not itself\r\nactually address any of these eventual applications, but is\r\nrather preoccupied with purely foundational issues. Following\r\nSilver's theorem in the 1970's, many descriptive set theorists\r\nhave become interested in equivalence relations on spaces such as\r\nthe real number line, or two dimensional space, or similar\r\nclasses of \"topological spaces\". The study of such equivalence\r\nrelations leads to quotient objects which arise by considering\r\nthe collection of all equivalence classes.  For instance if we\r\nset two real numbers to be equivalent when the result of\r\nsubtracting one from the other is an integer (i.e. a \"whole\r\nnumber\"), then the collection of equivalence classes may be\r\nnaturally identified with the result of basically wrapping the\r\nreal number line around itself, to obtain circle of circumference\r\none. In this simple example the quotient object is easily\r\nunderstood, and has a geometrical representation.  Most of the\r\nwork in Hjorth's area deals with the so called \"non-smooth\"\r\nequivalence relations whose quotient objects do not admit such a\r\nrepresentation, and the study of these quotient spaces is known\r\nto have connections with a variety of mathematical disciplines,\r\nsuch as \"dynamics\", and \"ergodic theory\", and some of the more\r\nabstract branches of \"analysis\", such as \"infinite dimensional\r\ngroup representations\".\r\n",
