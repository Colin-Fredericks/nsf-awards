The focus is on issues of tissue fluid balance, in particular on the effects of interstitial flow on matrix remodeling in a dynamic living environment.  To characterize the system, an in vivo model of lymphangiogenesis into an implanted collagen gel (in situ model in the rat tail) will be observed over time.  Based on the qualitative data obtained, a 3D in vitro model in which the physical environment can be tightly controlled and cell response readily ascertained will be developed.  The two models will then be used symbiotically to examine the relationship between extracellular matrix architecture and interstitial flow, with particular focus on the organization and development of interstitial water channels.  The notion of interstitial-flow induced matrix remodeling and vessel formation can be used to address a number of related research questions.\r\n\r\nThe educational component focuses on integrating traditional biomedical engineering topics with contemporary problems in the biological sciences and biotechnology.  Specific areas to be addressed are:  reconstructing the biomechanics and biotransport curriculum within the department (new courses in Advanced Tissue Mechanics and Transport in Living Systems and increased involvement in the NSF Engineering Research Center on Engineering Education), enhancing the bioengineering community within the engineering school (establish a focus in biomechanics) and introducing non-traditional, interdisciplinary components to the engineering curriculum (new course in societal implications of technology).  \r\n",
