Initial evidence indicating that mental models and their application are strongly context dependent is particularly relevant to application-based curriculum. In this PECASE project, I investigate students' mental models of real-world devices, how these models evolve through instruction, and whether they transfer across contexts. Next, I utilize my research results to develop application-based curriculum, organized into versatile weeklong instructional modules that are pilot-tested in introductory classes that I teach. I assess the impact of the model development on the students, as well as issues of transfer of learning from one context to another. As a spin-off from this investigation, I develop instruments that are transferable to other research on student mental model development. This research is also integrated into a graduate level course that I team-teach. The course focuses on current Trends and issues in physics education research. Students in this course are involved in my research through a capstone project in this course. Two experienced faculty members facilitate my professional development through the project. A pioneer in physics education and head of the department mentors my growth as a researcher and teacher in the graduate course. An award-winning teacher at the introductory undergraduate level mentors my pilot testing of the application-based curricula in the introductory courses that I teach. Overall this project builds a strong foundation for a lifetime of contributions to research and education in physics pedagogy.\r\n\r\nThis project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
