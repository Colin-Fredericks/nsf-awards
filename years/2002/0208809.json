 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moulin, Pierre\r\nU of Ill Urbana- Champaign\r\n\r\nThe enormous growth in electronic commerce has led to an urgent need for the protection and\r\nauthentication of information, which now is stored and transmitted in massive amounts. There is a\r\nmultitude of applications where a signal (typically audio, image or video) is to be communicated to\r\na receiver, along with information such as ownership identification or a timestamp authenticating\r\nthe signal. The communication channel on which the signal is transmitted may be insecure, i.e.,\r\nan adversary may modify the signal in such a way that it can no longer be reliably authenticated.\r\nIn some applications (e.g., wireless video transmission) the channel is considered to be insecure\r\nnot due to the presence of an adversary, but because of the significant degradations introduced\r\nby the transmission medium. A secret message necessary for authentication may be embedded\r\nin the signal (watermarking-based authentication) or transmitted on a separate channel (hashing-\r\nbased authentication). In watermarking, the host data set is intentionally corrupted, but in a covert\r\nway, designed to be imperceptible to a casual analysis. Hashing does not require the signal to be\r\nmodified, but requires the transmission of side information about the signal (authentication tag)\r\non a separate channel.\r\nSignal authentication encompasses applications such as forgery detection and analysis, copyright\r\nprotection for digital media, copy control, fingerprinting (traitor tracing), and database query and\r\nretrieval [1]|[30]. Watermarking and authentication are now major activities in audio, image, and\r\nvideo processing, and standardization efforts for JPEG-2000, MPEG-4, and Digital Video Disks\r\nare well underway. Commercial products are being developed. Annual International Workshops\r\non information hiding have been held in 1996, and every year since 1998. Special issues of major\r\ntechnical journals have recently been recently devoted to information protection [31, 32, 33, 34],\r\nand comprehensive surveys of image and multimedia watermarking techniques are available from\r\n[35, 36].",
