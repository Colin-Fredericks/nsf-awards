 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the development of efficient numerical\r\nmethods for problems related to material science.  The\r\ninvestigator studies computational issues concerning the\r\nnumerical solution of continuum models for thin film growth.  Many\r\nof these models include effects for surface diffusion, which is a\r\nnonlinear 4th order term.  Consequently, these models are very\r\nstiff from a computational point of view.  Because the surface\r\ndiffusion term is nonlinear, it is difficult to use implicit\r\nmethods.  The investigator introduces a new semi-implicit level\r\nset method for solving motion by surface diffusion.  He uses this\r\nnew method to incorporate the effects of surface diffusion into\r\nmodels of polycrystalline thin films.  He also develops a new\r\napproach for computing island dynamics, where the adatoms on the\r\nterraces are considered as a continuum field and the atoms on the\r\nedge of the island are treated discretely.  This approach retains\r\nthe potential advantage of continuum methods but at the same time\r\npreserves the discrete and stochastic effects present in island\r\ndynamics.  The investigator includes effects of edge diffusion,\r\nsurface tension, nucleation, and elasticity.  An important\r\ncomputational aspect of this problem is the numerical solution of\r\nthe diffusion equation in a complex domain.  The investigator\r\nexamines new methods for the efficient solution of this problem.\r\n     Thin films occur in a large number of applications, from\r\ncoatings on bearings to semi-conductor devices.  In many cases\r\nthese films are not single crystals but instead are\r\npolycrystalline and the quality of the film can depend on its\r\ntexture.  Films with good biaxial texture are close to being a\r\nsingle crystal and have applications in the manufacture of\r\nsuper-conducting tapes, for example.  One important physical\r\neffect in determining the evolution of the texture is surface\r\ndiffusion, but this is difficult to implement numerically and the\r\ninvestigator plans to develop a semi-implicit level set method to\r\nstudy the growth of polycrystalline thin films.  The work here\r\ncould help improve the fundamental understanding of these films.\r\nAnother important process by which thin films are made is\r\nmolecular beam epitaxy.  The standard method for accurate\r\nsimulation of this process is kinetic Monte Carlo.  In many\r\nsituations this method can be slow, and continuum models have the\r\npotential to greatly increase the speed of such computations.\r\nHowever, continuum models ignore discrete and stochastic effects.\r\nThe investigator develops hybrid models that have good physical\r\nfidelity but offer considerable computational speed.",
