The two scientists plan to conduct research aimed at increased understanding of fundamental phenomena of particle clustering, settling, nucleation and particle pushing, which control the distribution of particles and influence the properties in cast metal matrix composites (MMC). The work should result in a decrease in cost and improvement in properties of cast metal matrix composites.  MMC consist of a metallic matrix and a reinforcing phase such as fibers and particles.  The main function of the matrix is to transfer and distribute the load to the reinforcement.  The reinforcements impart strength, stiffness and other desirable properties like wear resistance and a low coefficient of friction to the composites.\r\nReinforcements are generally ceramics, including oxides, carbides and nitrides.  These materials are used because of their combination of high strength and stiffness at room and elevated temperatures.  Particles are the cheapest form of reinforcement materials and they impart isotropic properties to composites.  Among the reinforcements in aluminum SiC, aluminum oxide and fly ash are attractive materials because of their relatively low costs and interesting physical and mechanical properties.  \r\n\r\nScope: \r\nAlthough the U.S. automotive industry currently manufactures a limited number of components from cast composites, certain problems, such as high cost, low ductility and fracture toughness, a scatter in properties and casting defects, prevent the widespread use of cast MMC.  This research will help overcome these issues.  The U.S. PI has experience and a strong background in the solidification processing of alloys and MMC.  He and the Egyptian scientist have established collaboration in previous joint research activities.  In this project, Dr. Daoud's experience in laboratory-scale manufacturing of MMC components will complement the fundamental research experience of Dr. Rohatgi.  The project is likely to benefit the U.S. as well as Egypt in promoting the use of cast metal matrix composites to conserve energy and the environment.  The research is expected to involve a U.S. postdoctorate and a number of U.S. undergraduate students at UWM. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
