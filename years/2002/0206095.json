 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recruitment determines the initial density of populations, and may thereby critically\r\ninfluence their abundance. Little is known about recruitment of aquatic insects and its\r\ninfluence on the abundance of larvae. We combine surveys, mechanistic and large-scale\r\nexperiments in natural streams to determine the patterns and mechanisms of recruitment\r\nof new individuals to populations of the mayfly Baetis bicaudatus, and how small and\r\nlarge scale variation in recruitment interact to influence abundance of larvae.\r\nMethods include observations of patterns of oviposition, and field experiments to\r\nunderstand the mechanisms and fitness consequences of oviposition behavior. Extensive\r\nsurveys relate patterns of recruitment to temporal and spatial variation in mayfly larval\r\nabundance. A large-scale field experiment manipulating the availability of oviposition\r\nsites in 12 natural streams will test whether populations of Baetis larvae are recruitment\r\nlimited.\r\nThis proposal will make significant and unique contributions to the understanding of\r\nrecruitment of aquatic insect populations, and its influence on subsequent insect\r\nabundance. Proposed research will also generate models for predicting how mechanisms\r\n(i.e. oviposition behavior) affect patterns of populations at local and regional scales.\r\nFurthermore, it will provide a foundation for understanding population dynamics of\r\naquatic insects important to designing realistic and relevant conservation programs.",
