 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central object of study are Schrodinger operators with potentials\r\ndisplaying aperiodic order. In one dimension there have been recent\r\nadvances in the understanding of their spectral and quantum dynamical\r\nproperties, particularly in the case of the Fibonacci potential and\r\nrelated models, so-called Sturmian potentials, which are the standard\r\nmodels of one-dimensional quasicrystals. It is the goal of the proposed\r\nresearch to extend the theory to larger classes of potentials in one\r\ndimension and to tackle the higher dimensional case. A crucial tool in one\r\ndimension is the trace map, an energy-indexed dynamical system which can\r\nbe used to characterize and study the spectrum of the operators. Along\r\nwith combinatorial partition results and Gordon-type criteria one can\r\nobtain good bounds on generalized eigenfunctions from which one can deduce\r\nspectral and quantum dynamical consequences. It appears feasible that this\r\napproach is applicable to potentials beyond the class of Sturmian\r\npotentials -- sufficiently low complexity should suffice to induce\r\npartitions and trace maps. In higher dimensions the main goal is to find\r\nan analog of Gordon's criterion which can serve as a link between\r\ncombinatorics and spectral theory.\r\n\r\nThe mathematics of aperiodic order is a young emerging field that has\r\nsparked a lot of research activity since the mid-nineties. Researchers\r\nfrom disciplines as diverse as spectral theory, group theory, dynamical\r\nsystems, combinatorics, and algebraic topology have found a common\r\nground that was motivated by the discovery of quasicrystals in 1984\r\nand the subsequent reconsideration of the nature of order and ordered\r\nstructures. By now, quite a number of structural models for quasicrystals\r\nhave been proposed. Joint efforts are being undertaken to investigate\r\ntheir properties and shed light on why quasicrystals exist, how they form,\r\nwhy they are stable. Regarding their electronic transport properties, it\r\nis expected that quasicrystals may exhibit anomalous behavior. It is\r\ntherefore planned to study transport properties of Sturmian and related\r\nmodels from this perspective.\r\n",
