Organized by Dr. Mary Kirchhoff of the Green Chemistry Institute of the American Chemical society and Dr. Patrick Moyna of the Universidad de la Republica in Montevideo, Uruguay, this PASI will be held at the National University of Uruguay from July 6-17, 2003 and will feature case studies and interactive discussions between participants and lecturers.  The proposed activities will provide participants with a foundation in green chemistry and will demonstrate the applicability of green chemistry principles to different branches of chemistry, as well as to specific industrial sectors.  In addition, this PASI will help to establish a network of scientists throughout the Americas who can promote green chemistry through their teaching, research, and industrial involvement. \r\n",
