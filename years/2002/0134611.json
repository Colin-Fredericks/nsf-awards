 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Career project, the investigator creates a software\r\nplatform (called NLApack) for Numerical Algebraic Geometry,\r\ntrains students in the development and application of\r\nmathematical software, and broadens the graduate education of\r\nstudents in the areas of mathematics, computational science, and\r\nengineering.  In a first stage, the algorithms for the numerical\r\nirreducible decomposition of the solution set of a polynomial\r\nsystem are refined and combined into a blackbox program.  Besides\r\nsoftware, another outcome of this stage is the development of a\r\ntextbook for a course introducing students to symbolic and\r\nscientific computing.  The second stage of the project focuses on\r\nthree specific topics: pole placement, overconstrained linkages,\r\nand multi-body dynamics.  A result of this stage is a collection\r\nof software tools specialized for those application fields, case\r\nstudies, and benchmarks.  Throughout, students are trained in\r\nmathematics and computing and in important applications areas.\r\n     The principal investigator, his collaborators, and his\r\ngraduate students are working in the areas of numerical analysis\r\nand computer algebra.  While computer algebra solves mathematical\r\nproblems in an exact symbolic fashion, as one would by hand,\r\nnumerical analysis calculates with limited precision on input\r\ndata often only approximately known.  The software developed in\r\nthis project combines the symbolic and numeric approach.  Most\r\nscientists seek insight (not just numbers) in the form of\r\nequations to reveal new relations between the important\r\nparameters in their models.  But these models contain approximate\r\ndata that cannot be handled directly by current symbolic methods.\r\nThe investigator develops symbolic-numeric methods that will\r\nmake computer algebra more relevant to scientific computing, and\r\ntrains students who will adept at both numeric and symbolic\r\ncomputation, with significant payoffs for disciplines that depend\r\non large-scale scientific computing.\r\n",
