 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop and characterize a novel ceramic material and microcomponent fabrication technique for two different industrial sectors: the fiber-optic communications industry and the chemical industry. Current processes for microcomponent fabrication, primarily based on silicon processing technology are expensive, and often do not meet the production rates required for optical component (fiber-connectors, beam splitters) fabrication or possess the desired high-temperature performance for chemical industry applications (micro-channel devices for gas separation/reforming). The objective of this project is to develop a cost-effective technique for microfabrication of components with properties and/or production efficiency comparable to or superior than silicon technology. The process will use a low-temperature, net-shape fabrication technique that is expected to be efficient, cost-effective, scalable and environmentally friendly (no-byproducts). \r\n\r\nThe commercial benefits will be an alternative to silicon processing technology. The high production capacity and tight dimensional tolerances for components fabricated using this material/technique makes it an attractive option for optic fiber component manufacturers. The high achievable surface areas and the inherent thermochemical stability of ceramics make this material very attractive for fabrication of microchannel devices for gas separation/reformation.\r\n\r\n",
