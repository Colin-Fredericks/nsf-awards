 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0204311\r\nG. Robert Meyerhoff\r\n\r\nThe monumental work of W. Thurston has shown the fundamental \r\nimportance of hyperbolic 3-manifolds within the study of 3-\r\nmanifolds.  The proposer plans to work on a hard open problem in \r\nthe theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and to attempt to strengthen \r\nconnections between number theory and the study of invariants of \r\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The hard open question is the problem of \r\nfinding the closed hyperbolic 3-manifold of minimum volume.  The \r\nproposer, working jointly with D. Gabai and P. Milley, and in \r\nconsultation with N. Thurston, has a computer-based scheme to \r\nattack this problem.  The computational aspects of the approach are \r\ninteresting in their own right.  The connection between number \r\ntheory/algebraic K-theory and invariants of hyperbolic 3-manifolds \r\nis well-known, but a new approach to understanding it is proposed.  \r\nSpecifically, a new method for computing the Chern-Simons invariant \r\nof a hyperbolic 3-manifold might lead to interesting properties of the \r\ndilogarithm function.\r\n\r\nAlmost 200 years ago, J. Bolyai, C. Gauss, and N. Lobachevsky \r\nrevolutionized mathematics by claiming that a legitimate geometry \r\ncould be constructed by taking the five classical postulates of Euclid \r\nand negating the fifth postulate (the parallel postulate).   Further,\r\nthey theorized that this new and mysterious non-Euclidean geometry \r\n(now called \"hyperbolic geometry\") would have important applications.  \r\nTheir theorizing has been borne out:  hyperbolic geometry is vitally\r\nimportant in the modern study of geometry.  For example, hyperbolic\r\ngeometry turns out to be much more important than Euclidean geometry\r\nin the study of \"3-dimensional manifolds\" (our 3-dimensional\r\nUniverse is an example of a 3-dimensional manifold).  As another\r\nexample, it is quite possible that our Universe adheres to the laws\r\nof non-Euclidean geometry rather than the laws of Euclidean geometry.\r\nThe proposer, working jointly with D. Gabai and P. Milley, and in \r\nconsultation with N. Thurston, plans to work on a computer-based \r\napproach to solving one of the hardest and most fundamental problems \r\nabout hyperbolic 3-manifolds: finding the smallest one.  In addition, the\r\nproposer will try to strengthen the already existing connection between \r\nhyperbolic 3-manifolds and number theory.  The history of mathematics\r\nhas borne out the importance of finding strong connections between\r\n(supposedly) disparate areas of mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
