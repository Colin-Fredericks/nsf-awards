Quartz and kyanite will be investigated.  The timescales involved in crystal growth processes are poorly constrained and the absolute time involved in the growth of crystals from either igneous or metamorphic environments is not known.  This is a first order problem in petrology and few new approaches have been proposed to attack it.  Although the theory describing reaction kinetics in the crustal environment is sound, few quantitative studies exist and the mechanisms responsible for the variation in size and shape of individual crystal  faces  are still not  well understood.  Published data on natural euhedral quartz crystals obatined in our laboratory allow quantitative determination  of  the  relative  growth  rates  of  their growth  faces  throughout  their  growth  histories.  The concentration of water molecules and metal hydroxyl impurities incorporated into the crystal structure at the time of growth serve as \"speedometers\" that directly reflect the growth kinetics of active growth faces.  These measurements provide a new means of imaging the shape and absolute dimensions of crystals throughout their growth history. A partnership with commercial quartz production company will provide synthetic samples for experimental calibration of fluid parameters, which are necessary to quantitatively interpret H-defect data from natural hydrothermal quartz crystals.\r\n",
