 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study and conservation of natural resources in insular areas are necessary for and critical to the preservation of the myriad, unique ecosystems present.  This is of immediate concern in Hawai'i, with its high levels of endemism, geographic isolation, and biodiversity.   In order to continue and hopefully increase the number of future researchers focusing on these ecosystems, it is important to capture the interest of undergraduates.  The Island of Hawai'i, with its diversity and high representation of almost all ecological niches found in the archipelego, presents an excellent living laboratory in which to train these future researchers. \r\n\r\nThis program represents a collaboration between the University of Hawai'i at Hilo (UHH) and state and federal research organizations conducting research on the Island of Hawai'i, to develop an undergraduate research opportunity program focused on tropical conservation biology.  UHH, with its growing student enrollment in sciences (more than 20% over the last four years alone), and diverse student base, is committed to providing valuable research opportunities for undergraduates with faculty mentors at UHH available in Biology, Marine Science, Agriculture, Forestry, and Natural Resource Management.  The Island of Hawai'i is also home to numerous agencies and offices that have ongoing conservation biology research programs.  The US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the US Geological Service Biological Resources Division, the National Park and others work together on many research projects and are will to provide additional research opportunities for undergraduates. \r\n\r\nThis program entails a summer component and a continued effort during the academic year.  Ten students will be selected for 10-week research experiences during the summer.  Following a one-week orientation, student participants will work side by side with researchers on conservation biology projects located on the Island of Hawai'i.  Weekly meetings will allow students to interact with each other and with other researchers and faculty, and give oral presentations on the progress of their individual projects.  Students will also submit written sections of their final report in progressive pieces throughout the summer, which will be edited, compiled and polished into a final report at the end of the summer.  Each student will give a final presentation at the end of the 10-week period.  Students who are attending UHH following their summer research experience and have shown promise to develop a publishable research project will have the opportunity to continue their research during the academic year.  These students will also be responsible for scheduled meetings throughout the academic year and a final presentation and paper. \r\n \r\nInformation is available from Sharon Ziegler-Chong at UHH (telephone: 808-\r\n933-0706; email: ziegler@hawaii.edu).\r\n",
