 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Newburgh ASCEND program will provide 220 students per year in grades 7-9 with an opportunity to engage in inquiry-based science activities using units called \"Workplace Simulations.\"  The \"Simulations\" will focus on earth and life sciences in year 1 and physics and chemistry in year 2, and will emphasize career exploration in addition to the science content.  All content is aligned with New York State Learning Standards and emphasizes topics of interest to youth such as ecology, botany, aquatic science, paleontology, ornithology, archaeology and forensic science.  Students will also learn how to utilize GIS software and the use of a scanning electron microscope.  Many activities will focus on problem-solving skills and research methodology.  One Saturday per month participants will be engaged in field trips and field-based research.  During the summer, half of the students will participate in two-week summer sessions that enable them to explore topics in more detail, engage in career explorations and meet face-to-face with scientists and engineers in a relaxed setting.",
