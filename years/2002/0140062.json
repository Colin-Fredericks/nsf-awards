 "awd_abstract_narration": "Buechler's proposed research is to extend the scope of\r\ngeometrical stability theory outside of the context of a\r\nfirst-order theory.  His test project is an analysis of the\r\ngeometries induced by bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space\r\nand more complex structures like von Neumann algebras. With his\r\nstudent Berenstein Buechler has shown that many self-adjoint\r\noperators induce dependence relations satisfying all of the\r\nconditions of the dividing dependence relation. Buechler hopes\r\nthat the dividing dependence relation will give insight into the\r\nstructure of von Neumann algebras. In another project Buechler\r\nwill investigate \"dividing relative to a closure operator\". While\r\nthis study is analogous to the study of p-simple types in a\r\nsuperstable theory it presents dramatically different results\r\nwhen the original theory is not simple and the closure operator\r\nis chosen creatively. Applications to metric spaces and Vaught's\r\nconjecture are expected. Buechler will also study a class of\r\nscale-free networks with model-theoretic methods. Scale-free\r\nnetworks are ubiquitous in nature and technology.  Random graph\r\ntheorists have discovered some of their properties, such as the\r\ndegree functions.  However, techniques for building models are\r\nlimited.  Model theorists have developed techniques for building\r\ngraphs that are random relative to some constraints.  These\r\nmethods may lend themselves to building scale-free graphs with\r\nspecified parameters.\r\n\r\nFrequently a significant advancement in science occurs when a\r\nproblem arising in one area is viewed from the perspective of\r\nanother discipline.  For example, problems in genetics have\r\nyielded to techniques from graph theory. In mathematics algebra\r\nhas lead to great insight into geometry and knot theory.\r\nBuechler's specialty is model theory, a subfield of mathematical\r\nlogic. Recently, Hrushovski applied model theory to solve\r\nproblems in number theory. Buechler is adapting these same\r\nmodel-theoretic methods with an eye to problems in analysis and\r\nnetwork theory. In analysis Buechler is looking at the\r\nmodel-theoretic content of operator theory, which has connections\r\nto mathematical physics.  The networks Buechler will study are at\r\nthe heart of such disparate systems as the metabolic pathways in\r\na cell and the World Wide Web. Buechler will attempt to adapt\r\nmodel-theoretic techniques for constructing graphs of interest in\r\npure mathematics to building models of these networks arising in\r\nnature and technology.  Graduate students will be involved in all\r\nof these projects. The cross-disciplinary nature of the work will\r\nrequire the students to learn science that their normal\r\ncurriculum would not expose them to, and to learn the value of\r\nviewing research in a broader context.\r\n",
