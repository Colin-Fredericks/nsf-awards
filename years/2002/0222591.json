 "awd_abstract_narration": "gThe major goal of the research is to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the formation of new species of microorganisms. The research will target a single gene known to separate two closely related naturally occurring species of yeast in the genus Pichia.  The two species live in two different cactus types that have major differences in their host chemistry.   Toxic natural products in one cactus type deter the growth of one species while allowing growth of the other.   Identifying and isolating the gene(s) responsible for this difference is the specific goal of the research.  A molecular genetic knockout library recently created for baker's yeast will be used to identify the candidate genes. \r\n\r\nThis research addresses the nature of the fundamental process involved in the formation of new species.  It could provide us with 1) the detailed molecular mechanism responsible for adaptation to novel chemicals in natural plants and 2) the reasons for increased genetic and biological diversity in microorganisms.  An important aspect of the work is the use of modern genomic information from the widely studied baker's yeasts to learn about the origin of new species in natural systems. \r\n",
