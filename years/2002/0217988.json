 "awd_abstract_narration": "In light of the increasing role of knowledge work in the economy,  a fundamental understanding of effective knowledge transfer has increasingly gained currency in both the academic and managerial communities. Transferring knowledge across organizational boundaries allows individuals to benefit from the experiences of others and access a greater breadth of organizational, technological, and market know-how. There is a considerable body of research documenting the beneficial effects of knowledge transfer for organizational performance. Substantial progress has also been made on investigating the psychological processes underlying knowledge transfer. However, our understanding is less well developed for how social networks influence knowledge transfer. An integrative network-based theory of knowledge transfer has yet to emerge. Developing such a perspective is important because it: emphasizes the ongoing patterns of interaction through which knowledge spreads, considers the informal organizational influences on knowledge transfer, and broadens the focus of research beyond that of single individuals and dyads to larger collectivities.\r\n\r\nThis research tests a network-based theory of effective knowledge transfer, framed as a search-transfer problem. We argue that network patterns are important in solving both halves of the problem. For search, we argue that people with interactions that cut across multiple areas of expertise are better positioned to see how ideas developing in one area can be combined with ideas developing in another area. People solving the search problem can transfer knowledge using one of two strategies. The individual can move knowledge from the source to the recipient acting as an intermediary. Or the individual can facilitate the transfer of knowledge from the source to the recipient by bringing the two parties together. We maintain that the most effective knowledge transfer mechanism is contingent upon qualities of the knowledge being transferred and the amount of knowledge overlap between the source and the recipient. \r\n\r\nTo test the predictions, the researchers will gather sociometric, human resource management, and performance data (at various levels) along with information about individuals' areas of expertise. Data will be gathered from both primary and archival data sources. The setting for the study will be three member organizations of the Twin Cities Knowledge Management Forum (TCKMF), a consortium with the mission to help its members implement knowledge management within their organizations by sharing best practices. Members of the TCKMF include Fortune 500 and other leading corporations (e.g., Cargill, Medtronic, Oracle, 3M Company, Unisys) located in the Twin Cities area. Results of a pilot study completed with one member organization have been presented to the consortium and the attending companies agree that the initial findings are promising, the questions being addressed are worth further examination, and the study shows clear potential for broader impact.",
