 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Garden Mosaics program will develop and test a model in which youth conduct research on community and home gardens in urban settings.  Youth ages 11-18 will be recruited to participate in gardening activities in conjunction with elders from their communities.  Students learn the science content associated with organismal biology, community ecology, ecosystems and the physical environment, as well as culturally-related food growing practices.  Participants then take part in guided research; using methods such as transect walks, mapping, ecosystem models and soil tests, to document food-growing practices of immigrant minority and traditional gardeners.  Expanded research investigations will be open to students who want to continue their explorations using the Internet and other resources.  Students contribute to new and existing databases of ethnic and heritage gardening practices in the United States.  Materials to be developed include an Educator's Manual, a Youth Handbook and a Garden Mosaics website.  During the pilot phase a national leadership team will be established to test the program and materials at 10 sites in different cities across the U.S. including San Antonio, Baltimore, Boston, Sacramento, New York, Brooklyn and Philadelphia. It is anticipated that the dissemination of this model will reach more than 750 educators and 13,000 youth.",
