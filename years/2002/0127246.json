 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nThis project takes the innovative and highly successful interdisciplinary science education Web portal Visionlearning (http://www.visionlearning.com) from prototype to full implementation. Visionlearning has been proven through classroom evaluation to provide effective learning strategies for students and it has received outstanding peer reviews that have praised its effective use of creative and timely teaching methods. The Visionlearning portal efficiently leverages the inherent strengths of the Internet to make interdisciplinary teaching materials freely available to all students and instructors. Visionlearning has successfully integrated strategies to specifically benefit low income and minority science students. \r\n\r\nThis project is:\r\na) adding 72 new lessons to Our Library, a group of novel teaching modules proven to enhance learning;\r\nb) fully developing MyClassroom, an imaginative system that allows faculty to fully customize the Visionlearning interface to their own curricular objectives;\r\nc) enhancing the Teaching & Technology area, a valuable clearinghouse for faculty development;\r\nd) expanding the robust evaluation of the project to three additional diverse institutions;\r\ne) further disseminating the project to add at least 20 instructors to the Visionlearning faculty list; and\r\nf) broadening the publishing partnership to ensure the project's long-term sustainability.\r\n",
