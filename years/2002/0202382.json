 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator proposes here to study groups defined  by a single relation.\r\nSuch groups arise as fundamental groups in algebraic topology, as discrete\r\ngroups of transformations in analysis and geometry and in abstract group\r\ntheory. The importance of such a study is in its many connections to other\r\nbranches of mathematics, as well as to computer science and logic. Progress  will shed\r\nlight on a number of other subjects. These include  the theories of hyperbolic \r\nand automatic groups, computability, genetic and other algorithms and \r\nmay lead to a deeper understanding of finitely presented groups as a\r\nwhole. This proposal represents a first step in an overall study of one-relator\r\ngroups, using the number  of steps in a so-called Magnus breakdown, as the\r\nbasis for induction. The principal investigator, together with his many colleagues,\r\nwill initiate this study by focussing attention on one-relator groups of planarity one.\r\nThese are the very special HNN extensions of a free group that arise in the first step of the\r\nMagnus breakdown referred to above.  \r\n \r\nGroups are mathematical structures which are designed, in part, to capture the\r\nintrinsic nature of symmetry. Consequently groups play an extremely important role\r\nin geometry, in chrystallography, in particle physics, in chemistry and in cryptography\r\nas well as in much of mathematics. Their uses in cryptography are yet to be exploited; \r\nRSA encryption may be viewed as a first step in this direction. Many of the problems of \r\nthe physical world  can be translated into problems in group theory. On the other hand, many \r\nprocesses, such as evolution, can be used to unravel the nature of particular groups. Thus\r\ngroup theory provides a testing ground for a better understanding of these processes.\r\nThe principal investigator, in the work to be undertaken, will, in particular, use group theory \r\nto attempt to improve on one of the most exciting new aspects of computer\r\nscience, so-called genetic algorithms. Such algorithms appear to be a means for designing ever \r\nmore intelligent computers. \r\n",
