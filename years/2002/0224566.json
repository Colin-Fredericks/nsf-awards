 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing \"Suitcase Lessons in Oceanography\" in concert with the FOSS-based K-6 Science Curriculum Currently in Use in a Tri-County Educational\r\nService District\r\n\r\nThree counties in Oregon are currently involved in improving science education in schools by changing the education paradigm from teaching-centered to learning-centered via inquiry-based hands-on curricula.  It is based on a Science-Teacher Partnership Program (SEPS), in which Full Option Science Systems (FOSS) have been adopted for each grade level from K-6, and partnerships have been established to help teachers provide a quality science education for all students. The program is advised by a panel composed of teachers, scientists and administrators with experience and/or interest in hands-on science. The SEPS program has been successful not only in enhancing the young students interest and knowledge of science, but has also had a positive impact by increasing younger students awareness of opportunities and of careers made possible by higher education. However, there is no ocean science component in the curriculum. The objective of this project is to address that deficiency.  The project will generate and test the concept of using \"Suitcase Lessons in Oceanography\", in concert with ongoing curriculum, to infuse ocean science into K-6 science education in the Linn-Benton-Lincoln Educational Service District (ESD). A complete portable module (\"Suitcase Lesson\") will be created which will allow any faculty member to introduce fundamental science concepts of ocean science to K-6 students. This approach aims at directly addressing NSES goals of science literacy for all; real understanding of scientific processes; and development of a desire for science learning throughout life. In addition it addresses the current need of integrating ocean sciences in a life-long educational program aimed at promoting a basic understanding of the oceans and their relevance to everyday life.\r\n",
