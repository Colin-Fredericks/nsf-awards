 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Abstract - Ruth Gornet - DMS-0204648\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses several topics in inverse spectral\r\ngeometry. In the first project, the Principal Investigator will\r\nshow that the classical trace formula, which relates the Laplace\r\nand length spectra for generic manifolds, provides less\r\ninformation about isospectral manifolds than was previously\r\nspeculated. In joint work with P. Perry, the wave trace on\r\nHeisenberg manifolds will be explicitly calculated in order to\r\nunderstand the behavior of the length vs. Laplace spectra.\r\nAdditionally, a new notion of length spectrum will be studied in\r\norder to prove a necessary condition that lengths of closed\r\ngeodesics on isospectral manifolds must satisfy. A further project\r\n(joint with J. McGowan) studies the p-form spectrum on lens\r\nspaces. The Principal Investigator has constructed examples of\r\nlens spaces whose p-form spectra are equal for certain p but with\r\nunequal spectra on functions. This behavior will be further\r\nstudied toward constructing p-isospectral lens spaces with unequal\r\nabsolute length spectrum; i.e., different lengths of closed\r\ngeodesics. In the final project (joint with R. Brooks) tools from\r\nrepresentation theory of the symmetric groups will be used to\r\nconstruct an explicit upper bound on the number of isospectral\r\nRiemann surfaces of a fixed genus that can be constructed from the\r\nSunada method. When this final project is completed, an explicit\r\nupper bound on the number of nonisomorphic number fields with a\r\ngiven zeta function will result.\r\n\r\nIn 1966, Mark Kac popularized the question, \"Can one hear the\r\nshape of a drum?\"  The mathematical formulation of this question\r\nis: ``What geometric information is contained in the spectrum of a\r\nRiemannian manifold?'' Isospectrality, i.e., the study of\r\nisospectral families and/or the geometric properties they may or\r\nmay not share, impacts areas outside of spectral geometry; the\r\nresearch funded by this proposal thus supports the\r\npure-mathematical foundations of these areas. The first examples\r\nof closed isospectral manifolds, Milnor's flat tori, have appeared\r\nin string theory in physics (related to mirror symmetry). The\r\nempirical science of spectroscopy has studied frequencies of atoms\r\nand molecules to provide information about vibrating objects.\r\nInverse spectral problems also arise in medical imaging,\r\ngeophysical prospection, and non-destructive testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
