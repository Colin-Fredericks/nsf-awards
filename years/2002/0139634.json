This program allows up to ten undergraduate students to perform research in the areas of Computer Science, Supercomputing, and Visualization. This minority outreach program is open to students primarily from minority institutions, with preference given to minority applicants.  Recruitment is done by onsite recruiting at target institutions.  ARSC focus our efforts on these groups, as they have traditionally been underrepresented in the science and research fields.  With intern input, each participant is assigned a project related to their field of study, to be performed under the direct supervision of a faculty member or senior staff. Students spend an average of 10 weeks in Fairbanks where they live in campus housing with undergraduate interns from other groups and work an average of 40 hours per week to complete their projects.  Under the oversight of the Program Manager, they work independently and within research groups, live in housing with other interns, gain new work and study skills and establish a stronger sense of self-assurance. The program manager ensures that each participant fully understands their project and what is expected of them. Through this program ARSC strives to promote and further interests in many areas of arctic research.  The program also serves to develop positive research and life skills while increasing involvement of various minorities in science and research. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
