 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Professor Eric Conte of the Western Kentucky University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division.  The overall research goal is to development new methods of solid-phase extraction, a method commonly used to sample water and other solutions for trace quantities of organic components.  Solid-phase extraction is key sample preparation step prior to HPLC or mass spectrometry.  In the proposed project, ionic surfactants bound to an ion exchange resin will be developed as an new solid-phase extraction material.  If successful, the system has the potential of reducing or eliminating the use of organic solvents now required for solid-phase extraction, thus making the procedure more environmentally friendly.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate in this research.\r\n\r\nA critical aspect of modern chemical analysis is sample preparation prior to instrumental analysis. New methods of solid-phase extraction, especially environmentally friendly methods, will likely find quick application in analytical chemistry.  Undergraduate researchers can potentially make significant contributions in this research area.\r\n",
