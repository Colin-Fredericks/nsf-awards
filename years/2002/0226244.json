 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Collections project by the Journal of Chemical Education (JCE) is creating the JCE Digital Library.  Four major new collections are being added to the considerable digital material already available at JCE Online, the JCE Web site.  Each collection is being carefully reviewed to ensure that it contains materials that are scientifically accurate.  Reviewers are also requiring that materials embody pedagogy supported by the chemical education research literature.  Each collection is being categorized using keywords, organized by curricular level, and correlated with textbooks to allow quick and easy access by teachers from high school chemistry through graduate-level courses.\r\n\r\nThe four collections being developed include:\r\n\r\nDigiDemos-digitized text, graphics, sound, and video of chemical demonstrations that are enabling teachers to learn the most effective demonstration techniques, the latest important safety and waste disposal information, and exemplary pedagogy involving demonstrations.\r\n\r\nComputer Algebra Systems-documents for Mathcad, Mathematica, Maple, or MATLAB are being designed to help students learn mathematically intensive aspects of chemistry.\r\n\r\nJCE WebWare-a collection of Web-deliverable animations, simulations, calculations, and other pedagogically useful items are being incorporated into classroom presentations to promote discussion and interaction among students, and to provide new insights through graphic and other non-traditional means.\r\n\r\nResources for Student Assessment-Web-deliverable materials including homework, quiz, and examination questions with anytime anywhere, feedback and tutoring based on student responses, and a variety of new approaches to student assessment are being developed.\r\n\r\nJCE is providing a paid staff to organize volunteer efforts in order to maintain and to update content, and will continue to do so after the project ends.  JCE also is providing a well-established review process involving more than 4,000 reviewers, many of who already review digital materials.  Finally, feature columns edited by volunteers with expertise in specific content areas and who can serve as nuclei for additional collections materials are available once the JCE Digital Library is established.\r\n\r\nJCE is ideally suited to develop this Collection of digital materials for chemical education as it has nearly 80 years of expertise and experience in chemical education and a worldwide reputation.  JCE is where chemistry teachers from high school through graduate school look for high quality materials.  This Collection is enhancing and improving science education throughout the USA, thereby fostering better public understanding of chemistry and science and aiding in the recruitment of all kinds of students to careers in science.  Significant co-funding of this project is being provided by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences in recognition of the importance of a digital library for the support of the learning of chemistry.",
