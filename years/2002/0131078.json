 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the relationship between plant traits and plant performance is a fundamental goal of both basic and applied plant sciences.  This research will determine the relationship between plant traits and performance (survival and reproductive output) for a wild sunflower species of hybrid origin (Helianthus anomalous) and early generation hybrids of its ancestral parents (Helianthus annuus and Helianthus petiolaris).  We are interested in plant traits related to water use, photosynthetic carbon gain, growth, survival, and reproductive output.  The hybrid species complex provides a unique opportunity to look at how these traits are evolving to improve the fitness of the hybrids in a desert dune environment, and what trait combinations are associated with maximum performance in this water and nutrient limited environment.  The analyses will include a) experimental gardens to show which plants do best in environments on and off the dunes, b) phenotypic selection experiments to determine which traits account for better performance, and c) selection experiments to determine whether or not there is heritable genetic variation for these traits in Helianthus.  This research will further our understanding of how wild plants adapt to harsh environments and identify traits that may be useful for development of stress tolerant line of commercial Helianthus annuus.",
