Chen, The University of Arizona, Tucson\r\nIt is proposed to investigate the feasibility of applying intelligent search techniques for the filed of nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) on databases and websites.  The motivation for the research is that searching the World Wide Web for information in NSE with conventional search engines (like Google or Yahoo!) yields several thousand \"hits,\" most of which are of low value or relevance to the search objective while other related data are missed.  Therefore, customized intelligent search techniques are needed to enable NSE researchers and the public to learn about recent developments in the subspecialties of NSE in which they may have interests. The focus is on the academic and industrial data, in US and abroad.   A phased approach is proposed: a prototype portal (web site) and vertical search engine in three months, based on adaptations of existing tools plus NSE discipline knowledge, followed by enhancing in the subsequent six months with intelligent searching and clustering, post-retrieval analysis, automated directory generation, and user testing and evaluation.  \r\nSuccessful implementation of a domain-specific portal and intelligent search capability for NSE will benefit not only academic community but also the government and industry users.\r\n",
