 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical identification of nanometer sized features and individual molecules on solid surfaces is the focus of this research project.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Hipps and his colleagues at Washington State University, are using orbital mediated tunneling spectroscopy in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy to examine the electronic structure of large organic and organometallic molecular layers on metal and graphite surfaces.  The role of intermolecular packing and interface structure in determining the electronic transport properties of these layers is being examined.  The information gained from these studies will provide fundamental design information for molecule based electronic and opto-electronic devices. \r\n\r\nAs electronic devices shrink to the nanoscale and molecular scale, more fundamental information about the electronic structure of these molecular electronic devices is needed.  This research project, in the laboratory of Professor Hipps at Washington State University, uses orbital mediated tunneling spectroscopy to obtain this electronic structure information about well characterized molecular overlayers on metal and carbon surfaces.  In addition to the fundamental understanding obtained by these studies, an improved tool for the electronic characterization of molecular electronic architectures will result. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
