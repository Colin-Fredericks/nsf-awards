 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improved power management and distribution is essential for wireless power transmission (WPT) for next generation Space Solar Power (SSP) systems. A highly efficient C-band rectifying antenna (rectenna) array for WPT has been demonstrated to operate at 5.61 GHz at 78% efficiency at Texas A&M. The rectenna array combines high efficiency RF to DC diode conversion with a wideband, high gain and circularly polarized array to produce DC power regardless of array's orientation. In this project we propose to further extend this work by investigating suitable DC to DC and DC to AC Converters employing Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices. Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a nearly ideal material for power switching devices and diodes. The primary objective of this proposal is to investigate a variety of new converter topologies, which can be directly interfaced with rectifying antenna array. The project consists of two parts. The first part will focus on an experimental setup to demonstrate suitable converter topologies for rectenna type DC power source. An experimental 100V, 200W, 500kHz, SiC power conversion powered by a rectenna will be studied for its performance followed by an in-depth evaluation. The second part of this project will perform a trade study to investigate rectenna power converter architectures for higher power, higher voltage WPT systems. A rectenna array interfaced to a power converter will be considered as a building block and several series / parallel combinations of the building blocks will be studied for increased voltage and current capability.",
