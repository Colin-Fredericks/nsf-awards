 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymers with low average molecular weight and a low polydispersity index have many applications in the paint and coating industry.  Production of such polymers requires tight control of the molecular-weight distribution of the polymers.  Control is achieved by adjusting the temperature, diluting the reaction mixture, and adding chain transfer agents, mercaptans, and cobalt glyxins.  Liquid-phase, high-temperature, free-radical polymerization is used to produce low average-molecular-weight polymers.  Preliminary results also show that high-temperature, free-radical polymerization of butyl acrylate (BA) can lead to the production of low poly-dispersity index, BA polymers.  Thus, high-temperature polymerization offers better controllability to produce the desired polymer product.\r\n\r\nThis NSF GOALI project is a joint effort between Drexel University and DuPont aimed at improving the quality of acrylate and styrenic, homo-polymers and copolymers produced via high-temperature, solution polymerization.  This Faculty-in-Industry project is motivated by the need to take a fundamental approach to improve the product quality.  The PI Soroush will spend one year in DuPont's Marshall Laboratory to pursue the following research and education activities:\r\n     *Study the kinetics of liquid-phase, high-temperature (140-200oC), free-radical, BA and butyl methacrylate (BMA), homopolymerization reactions to develop mathematical models for high-temperature, BA and BMA, semi-batch, polymerization reactors.\r\n     *Calculation of optimal temperature and feed flow-rate profiles as well as loading conditions for high-temperature, semi-batch, BA and BMA, polymerization reactors.\r\n     *Formulation of a set of industrial, process modeling, open-ended problems to be assigned as projects to undergraduate students taking the process modeling courses at Drexel University.\r\n",
