 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to investigate the impact of the new I/O\r\ntechnologies on the operating system architecture of the network servers. \r\nThe key ingredient of the proposed approach is the memory-to-memory \r\nintra-server interconnect which allows non-intrusive communication \r\nbetween hosts and intelligent devices. Memory-to-memory communication \r\neliminates or significantly reduces the  overhead typically associated with \r\nconventional communication protocols. This benefit has been extensively \r\nstudied to improve the performance of distributed applications but has not \r\nbeen  yet explored in support of the operating system performance. \r\n\r\nThe research will focus on how to split the operating system functionality\r\nacross a cluster of computing nodes and intelligent devices. Two novel \r\noperating mechanisms based on memory-to-memory communication will be \r\nexplored: (i) direct application-to-device communication to offload the \r\nTCP/IP protocol processing to TCP servers executed on intelligent network \r\ninterfaces or dedicated nodes, and (ii) direct communication between  \r\nmemory-mapped file servers and TCP servers.  The research will also \r\ninvestigate how to use memory-to-memory communication to support cooperative \r\nfile and network servers for availability and load-balancing.\r\n\r\nThis research has been considerably motivated by the increasing interest\r\nin VIA, InfiniBand, and programmable device controllers. Its ultimate goal is \r\nto contribute  to the understanding of how systems software should be designed\r\nto exploit and combine these new technologies.",
