The project will build a technology outreach program that brings together in a mentoring relationship, faculty, students and community members to create an IT entrepreneurship program which focuses on business software development\r\n\r\nTwo academic goals of the project are to enhance the computer science education and experience of university students, and instill a sense of civic engagement in students and faculty.  The research design will use data gathering and analysis techniques to measure outcomes related to these and other goals.  The benefits to Loyola students will include hands-on experience in helping to develop real world software applications, as well as an understanding of the poor communities.  The benefits to the Austin community include the learning of IT skills, a sense of entrepreneurship in IT and improvement in their environment coupled with financial gains. \r\n",
