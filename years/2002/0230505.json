By including and impacting both pre-service and in-service\r\nteachers at grades K-12, this program, Bridges to Engineering Science: Teaching\r\nTeachers (B.E.S.T.T.), has the potential to affect the over 115,000 students in grades K-\r\n12 in thirteen school systems in Tennessee and Georgia identified as potential partners.\r\nThe program will include a partnership between the Colleges of Engineering and\r\nEducation; interaction among faculty and students of the colleges and the thirteen\r\ntargeted school systems; development of high quality, self contained, apparatus based\r\nengineering science experiments and curriculum units which meet the education system\r\ngoals and educational standards; development and dissemination of teaching materials on\r\nhands-on, age appropriate, engaging engineering science units for grades K-12; special\r\ntargeted inclusion of groups currently under-represented in engineering; and formative\r\nand summative assessment at all stages of the project.\r\n",
