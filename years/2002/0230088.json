The proposed interdisciplinary program, focusing on engineering systems and engineering design, encompasses the study of theories and methodologies that develop creative solutions to open-ended engineering design problems. Graduates of this program, called Engineering Systems and Design, will use modern design methodologies,\r\nsimulation, analysis and optimization techniques to develop safe and functional solutions to complex interdisciplinary design problems while adhering to constraints involving economics, reliability, durability, aesthetics, ethics and social impact (including legal and environmental issues).\r\n\r\nThe increased flexibility incorporated in the Engineering System Design program will appeal to a large number of bright students who are not interested in\r\ntraditional engineering programs with rigid requirements. The program will also meet increasing industry demands for broad-based product and systems designers capable of immediately working in interdisciplinary engineering areas such as mechatronics, nanosystems and bioengineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
