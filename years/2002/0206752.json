 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves research in computed tomography, \r\nadvanced Shannon sampling theory, and applications of sampling \r\ntheory in tomography. It combines theoretical investigations, \r\nnumerical analysis, and computational experiments with real world data. \r\nComputed tomography is a technique which produces \r\nimages of the interiors of opaque objects. It is widely used \r\nin applications ranging from diagnostic radiology to research \r\nin quantum optics. Mathematically it requires the reconstruction \r\nof a certain density function from its line integrals. Ordinary \r\ntomography is not local: reconstruction at a point requires integrals \r\nover lines far from that point. For a number of applications it is highly \r\ndesirable if only integrals over lines intersecting some  region of interest \r\nneed to be used (\"region-of-interest tomography\" or \"local tomography\"). \r\nShannon sampling theory plays a fundamental role in signal processing. \r\nIn tomography sampling theorems are used to identify efficient data \r\ncollection schemes allowing for maximum resolution in the reconstructed \r\nimage, as well as for error analysis of reconstruction algorithms. \r\n\r\nThe project's research in tomography involves interdisciplinary \r\ncollaboration and  is inspired by the question \r\n\"What features of the density function can be stably recovered \r\nfrom a given collection of its line integrals?\". Specific goals include \r\nthe identification and analysis of optimal sampling schemes in \r\nthree-dimensional tomography; the analysis of reconstruction algorithms \r\nfor three-dimensional local tomography with sources on a curve; \r\nfurther development and  numerical analysis of high-resolution reconstruction \r\nalgorithms in two dimensions, and development \r\nof a software package for region-of-interest tomography. \r\nThe research in sampling theory is stimulated by applications in \r\ntomography and involves the development and application of new \r\nsampling theorems for non-equidistant data;\r\nestimates for the aliasing error in various settings;  \r\nand further exploration of a generalization of the  \r\nsampling concept in the framework of locally compact abelian groups which \r\nprovides a unified view of a number of  diverse applications.\r\n\r\n",
