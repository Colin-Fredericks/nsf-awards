 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Wisconsin Vertebrate Fossil Project\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Vertebrate Fossil Project (WVFP) is a two-year pilot to be operated by the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum. WVFP will engage Wisconsin high school teachers and students in the discovery and study of vertebrate fossils, primarily from Wisconsin caves. WVFP totally integrates field experiences and inquiry-based classroom activities with original and important scientific research. The educational and scientific aspects of this project are united by a common goal: the production of high-quality scientific data by high school students. These data will be of far-reaching and contemporary scientific importance. As production of these data can be accomplished only by students with the knowledge and enthusiasm required to complete scientific research projects, the scientific success of the project hinges on its success in educating students. WVFP begins with a one-week summer workshop in which participants will conduct field work in Wyalusing State Park, located in the southwestern quarter of Wisconsin. Student and teacher participants will discover, collect, and learn to identify fossils of small vertebrates such as amphibians and reptiles.  Following the workshop, participants return to their schools. Under the supervision of project staff during frequent follow-up visits, they will process and identify raw fossil samples loaned to them by the Geology Museum. Processed fossils, along with student identifications, will be returned to the Geology Museum.\r\n",
