 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society for Research on Biological Rhythms is now the largest society in the world \r\nfor those interested in biological rhythms, and this award supports their biannual \r\nmeeting.   Biological rhythms are an important feature of life on this planet, and so the \r\ntopic has major importance, and there have been rapid recent advances in \r\nunderstanding underlying mechanisms of rhythmic biological activity.   \r\n   The conference is highly interdisciplinary in the approaches discussed, including \r\nmolecular biology, physiology and behavior, computational neuroscience and \r\nneuroendocrinology, and in topics spanning subsecond oscillations in motor systems, \r\nintertidal rhythms in invertebrates, reproductive cycles, human sleep and shift-work \r\nschedules.  The format is an excellent combination of lectures, workshops, and poster \r\nsessions, emphasizing interactions between workers from different fields, and women \r\nare well represented, along with the international community.  The biannual timing allows \r\na good perspective, and this year will cover some of the most exciting current issues, \r\nsuch as the recent discovery of a link between the circadian clock gene Per (from the \r\nfruitfly) and a genetically controlled sleep pattern in humans.  \r\n     The potential impact of this conference is high in the fields of neuroendocrinology and \r\nbehavioral neuroscience, because of the focused discussions shaping future work, the \r\npotential to develop new cross-disciplinary collaborations, and the likely interactions and \r\nintroductions essential to career development of young investigators. Funding from NSF \r\nwill be important to help students, postdocs, and young researchers without access to \r\nother funding to attend the conference.\r\n\r\n",
