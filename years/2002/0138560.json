 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid development of technology and its by-products require increased\r\nprecision in mathematical modeling of the relevant phenomena to make the\r\nmodels more realistic and more readily applicable. This has required some\r\nbasic changes in the direction of research in many fundamental areas. The\r\nscientists concerned have been involved for some years now in promoting the\r\nuse of advanced methods in Analytical Dynamics and Control, and in the\r\nControl of Complex Nonlinear Systems. The workshop will involve experts both\r\nin the purely dynamical aspects of such systems so that improved models with\r\nmore realistic predictions can be generated and experts in Lyapunov\r\nformalisms for handling bounded uncertainties in system parameters so that\r\ncontrol actions can be made in the face of uncertainties. A range of\r\napplication areas is also intended to be broached, so that a crossover of\r\ninformation between various disciplines that have the same types of\r\nfundamental problems can be effected. Past experience has shown that such\r\ncrossover of information has led to new ideas and new collaborative research\r\nprojects among attendees of the workshop.\r\n\r\n\tEleven workshops have been held to date between 1986 and 2000. The first\r\nfive were held in the US at the University of Southern California, and they\r\nhelped to get together scientists and engineers mainly from the US and the\r\nPacific Rim, with occasional participation from scientists from other\r\ncountries. In an effort to initiate a technical exchange between US and West\r\nEuropean scientists and engineers who are working in this area, the next two\r\nworkshops were held in Vienna (Austria) and Ulm (Germany). The East European\r\nscientific community was drawn into the following workshop in Sopron\r\n(Hungary), which was co-sponsored by NSF and the Hungarian Academy of\r\nSciences. The 1997 workshop was held in Rio de Janeiro and was sponsored by\r\nthe Brazilian Ministry of Science. This workshop indicated that there were\r\nnumerous scientists working in the area of Dynamical systems and Control in\r\nSouth America. The tenth workshop was held in Lambrecht (Germany) and was\r\nco-sponsored by the Volkswagen Corporation and the National Science\r\nFoundation. The large community of scientists and engineers working in South\r\nAmerica caused the International Organizing Committee to select Brazil yet\r\nanother time, and the 11th workshop was held in Brazil in 2000.\r\n\r\n\tIt has been decided by the International Organizing Committee to have the\r\nnext workshop in the US, in Los Angeles, bringing the venue after an entire\r\ndecade back to the location from which the workshops initiated. The workshop\r\nwill be held at the University of Southern California. One of the main\r\nthrusts of this particular workshop is to focus more on bringing junior\r\nfaculty (especially women-faculty) and graduate students, so that they can\r\nhave a greater chance of increased exposure to the more established\r\ncommunity in the area of dynamics and control, and so that they can have an\r\nopportunity to interact with their counterparts who are working outside the\r\nUS.\r\n\r\nThese workshops, each of whose proceedings have been published either as\r\nspecial journal issues or as books, have led to the realization that there\r\nare today a large number of scientists who are working in South America, the\r\nformer USSR, as well as both West and East European countries like Germany,\r\nFrance, Russia and the Ukraine, in similar areas of dynamics and control. In\r\nparticular the last three meetings have clearly pointed out the need for\r\nincreased interaction between scientists from Europe, South America, and the\r\nformer USSR. There appears to be a substantial body of information gathered\r\nin these countries that is yet unknown to US scientists and engineers. An\r\nexchange of information in this important area with our colleagues in these\r\ncountries will be beneficial to the engineering and scientific community\r\nhere in the US. These workshops have led, in the past, to collaborative\r\nresearch projects, not only among  the US attendees but also between\r\ninvestigators from the US and those from different countries; some of these\r\njoint research projects have been funded by NSF. We therefore expect, as\r\nbefore, that the forthcoming workshop will open up new avenues for\r\ncollaborative research and sustained long-term cooperation among scientists\r\nand engineers through joint research projects. This, we hope, will be more\r\nso true for this particular workshop, since its focus will be more on junior\r\nfaculty who may be more active and enterprising.",
