 "awd_abstract_narration": "0128925\r\nHibbett and Binder\r\nThe proposed research by Drs. David Hibbett and Manfred Binder at Clark University concerns the evolutionary relationships of homobasidiomycetes, which include the mushroom-forming fungi. There are about 13,500 described species of these fungi. Homobasidiomycetes play important ecological roles as decayers, pathogens, and beneficial symbionts of plants and animals. Traditionally, classifications and evolutionary hypotheses in this diverse group have been based on the morphology of the fruiting bodies, which include forms with a cap and stalk, club and candelabra-shaped forms, puffballs, bracket fungi, etc. Recently, however, DNA sequences have been used to infer evolutionary relationships of homobasidiomycetes. The proposed research will use DNA sequences to study relationships of two groups of homobasidiomycetes: \"cyphelloid\" fungi (roughly 300 species), which are minute cup-shaped forms, and aquatic homobasidiomycetes (20 species, usually quite rare). Both cyphelloid and aquatic homobasidiomycetes have been taxonomically obscure. Recent molecular evidence suggests that these groups may be closely related, which had not been predicted previously. The proposed research will follow up on the leads generated in recent molecular studies, and will include fieldwork to expand knowledge of the diversity in both groups. The proposed work will increase understanding of the pathways of morphological evolution in homobasidiomycetes. In addition, it will elucidate the ecological transitions from terrestrial to aquatic habitats in fungi.\r\nThe proposed research will benefit science and society in two major ways: 1) The proposed research will enhance understanding of biodiversity. In particular, it will highlight an unusual group of organisms that even most biologists are not aware of, but that play important ecological roles. 2) The proposed research will include a significant training and outreach component. A post-doctoral fellow and a Ph.D. student will receive training. In addition, a series of summer workshops in the Worcester, MA, area for local high school students and high school teachers is planned (one student and one teacher will be supported per year). The summer workshops will provide exposure to modern techniques of molecular biology and evolutionary biology. Teachers who participate in the workshops will receive professional development points, which are necessary for annual recertification in Massachusetts, and which Clark University is authorized to award. Teachers and students will be recruited from the Worcester public school system.\r\n",
