 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Model-Based Design and Verification of Embedded Systems\r\nRadu Grosu\r\nState University of New York at Stony Brook\r\n\r\nComputer aided verification (CAV) and embedded software design automation (ESDA) emerge from\r\nacademia and industry respectively as two promising approaches to developing the high-confidence\r\nsoftware demanded by embedded-system applications, including those found in the telecommunications,\r\naerospace/military, medical-device, and automotive industries. CAV and ESDA advocate the same\r\nmethodology for system design: (1) define the requirements, (2) construct a model and (3) analyze\r\nthe model with respect to the requirements. The difference is essentially that: (1) CAV uses more\r\nsophisticated requirements, (2) ESDA uses more sophisticated models and (3) CAV performs a more\r\nsophisticated analysis.  While ESDA analysis reduces to manual, pointwise simulation of the model,\r\nCAV analysis is automatic and exhaustive.  This is made possible by a mathematical formulation of\r\nthe requirements, models and analysis problem that is far beyond the precision currently supported\r\nby ESDA.  The goal of this research is to: (1) push the limits of CAV to capture and analyze\r\nESDA models; (2) increase the confidence in ESDA by applying CAV techniques.  This goal is pursued\r\nwith following research and education objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Support the design methodology for discrete, time-triggered and event-triggered embedded\r\nsystems with:\r\n\r\n  - Hierarchic reactive modules (HRM), a state-based modeling language that supports\r\n    architectural and behavioral hierarchy together with powerful time and space abstraction.\r\n    \r\n  - Concurrent class machines (CCM), an action-based modeling language that directly\r\n    incorporates object-oriented features like classes and inheritance, objects and object creation,\r\n    methods, method invocation and exceptions, threads and thread creation.\r\n    \r\n  - Shared variables interaction diagrams, a scenario-based language that adequately\r\n    captures requirements of embedded systems communicating via shared variables.\r\n    \r\n  - Hermes}, a modeling, simulation and model checking tool for HRM that efficiently\r\n    exploits the hierarchical structure to prune the state space. We also consider a variety of\r\n    other CAV techniques and support for CCM.\r\n  \r\n2. Support the design methodology for embedded systems with tightly coupled discrete and analog\r\n  behavior with:\r\n\r\n  - Hierarchic hybrid machines (HHM)}, a hierarchic, state-based modeling language that\r\n    allows to capture both discrete and analog behavior.\r\n    \r\n  - Charon, a modeling and simulation tool for HHM that exploits hierarchic structure for\r\n    efficient multi-rate integration.\r\n    \r\n  - Different approaches to simulation, reachability analysis and modular reasoning.\r\n    Application of hybrid systems to modeling cell behavior.\r\n  \r\n3. Publish a textbook providing a comprehensive, formal treatment of the unified modeling\r\n  language UML for Real Time to reduce the gap between ESDA and CAV.\r\n  \r\n4. Integrate formal concepts in the undergraduate education at Stony-Brook by proposing changes\r\n  for the courses in software engineering, theory of computation and operating systems.",
