Ghrist\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of topological methods in contemporary applied\r\nmathematics is primarily attributable to the fact that topological\r\nfeatures of a system are inherently robust and global. This \r\nproject focuses on a technology transfer from contemporary ideas \r\nin topology, geometry, and dynamics to bear upon application \r\ndomains which include the following:  First, Robotics: tools \r\nfrom configuration space theory, CAT(0)complexes, and \r\ncomputational topology will be directed toward specific \r\nproblems in reconfigurable robotics, sensor-based navigation \r\nof mobile agents, and self-assembly systems.  Second, Parabolic \r\ncoupled systems: a Morse-theoretic homotopy index for braids \r\nwill be used to solve parabolic variational problems arising in pattern-formation PDE's, discrete Lagrangian mechanics, and \r\ncoupled oscillators. A Floer-theoretic extension of the braid \r\nindex will also be developed for infinite dimensional systems. \r\nThird, Hydrodynamics: tools from contact geometry and topology \r\nwill be directed toward solving global problems of the dynamics \r\nand stability of Eulerian fluid flows in dimensions higher \r\nthan two.  \r\n\r\nIn most systems of interest in science and engineering, \r\nmultiple cooperative tasks must be globally coordinated. \r\nA common thread is that whether the tasks involve \r\nmacro-scale robots, micro-scale devices, coupled oscillators, \r\nor fluid particles, there is an abstract space of configurations\r\nlurking behind the physical phenomena. Unearthing and \r\nexamining those properties of physically-motivated \r\nconfiguration spaces which capture the global features, the \r\ntopology, geometry, and dynamics, holds the promise of \r\nproviding global tools which transcend the physical \r\ninstantiation of the system at hand: ostensibly different \r\nsystems possess similar topological underpinnings. \r\nThe research component of this project is the development \r\nof contemporary topological and global-geometric techniques \r\nfor analyzing the dynamics and coordination of systems of \r\ninterest in engineering and computer science. The overall \r\ngoal is an effective technology transfer from cutting-edge \r\nperspectives in topology to bear upon systems in application \r\ndomains which include robotics, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. \r\nThis is combined with a blend of pedagogical service across \r\ngraduate, undergraduate, and high school levels, featuring \r\na focused research group on topological robotics and a \r\nhigh-school outreach program of expository lectures on the \r\nrelevance and joy of mathematical research. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
