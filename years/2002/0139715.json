 "awd_abstract_narration": "Focused Research Collaboration Proposal: Differential Algebraic\r\nInequalities and their Applications to Engineering\r\n\r\nThis focused research project proposes a comprehensive investigation\r\nof Differential Algebraic Inequalities (DAIs) and Dynamic\r\nComplementarity Problems (DCPs), with the goal of developing an\r\nextensive theory, designing and analyzing efficient algorithms, and\r\napplying the results to problems in engineering of practical\r\nimportance.  The two problem classes of DAIs and DCPs represent a\r\nsignificant extension of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a\r\ndifferential algebraic equation (DAE). The proposed study necessitates\r\nthe use of state of the art mathematical programming methods in\r\nconjunction with ODE and DAE methods to deal effectively with the\r\ninequalities and complementarity conditions in a DAI/DCP.  The latter\r\nare novel features that are absent in ODEs or DAEs. Since the main\r\nmethods for solving DCPs and DAIs in realistic situations are\r\nnumerical, the research will emphasize the interactions among\r\nformulation, computation, and mathematical issues such as convergence\r\nand approximation including numerical approximation and sensitivity to\r\nparametric perturbations.\r\n\r\nDAIs and DCPs provide a powerful mathematical framework for the\r\ncomprehensive treatment of a host of important complex system\r\napplications that have so far received only minimal attention from\r\napplied and computational mathematicians.  The project will open a new\r\nchapter in applied mathematics in which classical differential\r\nequation theory is merged with contemporary mathematical programming\r\nmethods. The deliverables of the project will a set of broadly\r\napplicable mathematical and computational tools that will have a\r\ndirect impact in several distinct engineering disciplines including:\r\nconstrained mechanical systems with frictional contact arising in\r\nrobotics and manufacturing, conditional modeling in chemical and\r\nhydraulic processes, and hybrid systems with variable-structure\r\ncontrol encountered in avionics, intelligent highway systems, and\r\nautomotive systems.\r\n",
