 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project addresses problems covering a rather broad\r\nspectrum of discrete mathematics (DM), some drawn from related\r\nareas such as statistical mechanics (SM), probability, and\r\ntheoretical computer science (TCS).  A common thread in many \r\nof these problems is:one is given a probability distribution \r\non some large discrete space (e.g. independent sets in, or \r\nproper colorings of, a graph), and wants to know whether \r\nbehavior in one part of the system can significantly affect \r\nbehavior in other, distant parts.  The loose term\r\n``long range effects\" (LRE's) is used for such interactions.\r\nBoth strong and weak LRE's are of interest:\r\nFor SM what's wanted is, more often than not,\r\nstrong LRE's, usually under the name ``phase transition\" (PT).\r\nIn very recent work, the investigator and his student David\r\nGalvin used mainly combinatorial ideas to settle one\r\nmuch-studied question in this area (concerning PT's in the\r\n``hard-core lattice gas model\"), and a particular hope at\r\npresent is that ideas from this work, and, more generally,\r\nthe investigator's combinatorial perspective, will lead to\r\nprogress on various more or less related questions.\r\nFrom the perspectives of DM and TCS, on the other hand,\r\nweak LRE's are often desirable, e.g. because of their\r\nconnections with rapid mixing of Markov chains (a topic\r\nof major interest in TCS), and because in combinatorial\r\napplications of probability, systems with sufficiently\r\nweak LRE's can sometimes substitute for probability spaces\r\nbased on purely independent choices.  (This again involves\r\nthe hard-core model, which arises in surprisingly diverse\r\nmathematical contexts.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking very generally, the (main part of the) project aims\r\nat understanding the degree of order or disorder in various\r\nlarge random systems, for instance the extent to which the\r\nglobal structure of a physical system can be predicted from\r\nknowledge about interactions between neighboring particles.\r\nIn recent years, random systems similar to those used to model\r\nphysical reality have played increasingly important roles\r\nin TCS and DM, partly because they can be helpful in analyzing\r\n(algorithmically and/or theoretically) even non-random problems\r\nin these areas; and there has been an increasing realization of\r\nthe degree to which the issues arising in these three disciplines\r\nare related.  One major theme of the present project is an interest\r\nin applying ideas and methods across mathematical boundaries:\r\nespecially in using ideas from the investigator's core area (DM)\r\nto attack problems in SM and TCS, but also in bringing an \r\nincreasing familiarity with techniques from the latter areas to\r\nbear on several problems of longstanding interest in DM.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
