Genome Sequencing Center (WUGSC)] to continue their rice genome sequencing project that was funded in October 1999. The original goal of the project was to production\r\nsequence, finish and annotate approximately 20 Mb of rice genomic DNA on the short\r\narms of chromosomes 10 and 3 as part of the International Rice Genome Sequencing\r\nProject (IRGSP). Chromosome 10 is essentially finished and a joint manuscript is in preparation. Chromosome 3 is in progress. In collaboration with the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), the specific objectives of this award is to completely sequence, finish, annotate and publish rice chromosomes 3. \r\n\r\nThe specific goals are: 1) to generate a Phase II draft of rice chromosome 3 (~75% done already with current funding) by December 2002; and 2) completely finish rice chromosome 3 by September 2003, in collaboration with TIGR, in support of the ultimate IRGSP objective of depositing a finished rice genome in GenBank.  \r\n\r\nAn outline of research plan is: \r\nA) Forty-four ~143kb Nipponbare BAC clones (CUGI/Monsanto) anchored to the short\r\narm of chromosome 3 will be validated for insert integrity and chromosomal location\r\nB) Library development and production sequencing (10X) of the 44 BAC clones will be\r\nperformed \r\nC) 44 production sequenced BACs will be finished \r\nD) finishing technology development aimed at establishing robust chemistries and protocols that can be used by the consortium to finish difficult regions of the rice genome.\r\nE) 44 finished BACs will be phase I annotated \r\n\r\nAll sequence data will be publicly released according to the \"Bermuda\" policies.\r\n",
