One of the main points of \r\nstudy is the problem of producing actions from quasi-actions, \r\nalong the lines of the classical theorems of Sullivan and\r\nTukia.  Such results have significant implications in the quasi-isometric classification of groups, especially for \r\ngroups with natural splittings as a complex of groups.  A \r\nsecond area of study is large scale versions of rigidity\r\nphenomena in the geometry of symmetric spaces, and \r\nspecifically the classification of quasi-isometric embeddings \r\nbetween symmetric spaces, giving a geometric analogue of \r\nsuperrigidity.  A third and independant project involves \r\ncoarse versions of topological rigidity, including the coarse \r\nBorel, Novikov, and Baum-Connes conjectures.\r\n\r\n    Roughly speaking, large scale (or coarse) geometry is \r\nthe study of geometric properties of objects \"seen from far \r\naway\".  From this perspective, any bounded object is \r\nindistinguishable from a point, and a line of dots is \r\nindistinguishable from a solid line.  This sort of geometry \r\nhas been influencial recently in many areas of mathematics, \r\nnotably group theory, topology, and geometric analysis.  This\r\nresearch will explore the large scale geometry of several \r\nclasses of mathematical objects, both classical geometric \r\nspaces and objects only now being viewed in a geometric manner.\r\n\r\n",
