 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) The project is developing a prototype and evaluating \r\nInteractive Astronomy, a multimedia instructional package for a widely taught undergraduate \r\nscience course: Introductory Astronomy for Non-Science Majors. This course serves a great \r\nnumber of college students, including many future teachers, and has great potential for improving \r\ntheir science skills and influencing their understanding of and appreciation for science. \r\nThe multimedia package includes software which incorporates two \r\ninnovative elements: the revolutionary improvements in instruction offered by information \r\ntechnology, and the emerging paradigm of inquiry-based learning. Utilizing the high degree of \r\ninteractivity which computers make possible, students are led to discover things for \r\nthemselves, as opposed to learning them passively. Utilizing the dynamical simulations which \r\ncomputers make possible, students can live in the world of science, yielding a vivid experience \r\nof its normally abstract world. Two important elements of the package are \r\nGuided Discoveries, which are extensive, highly interactive instructional exercises, designed \r\nwith careful attention to pedagogical issues; and Intelligent Tutors, which customize their \r\ninstructional strategies, based on an assessment of the student's learning needs. \r\nDesign of seven of the Discoveries has already been completed. In this project, three are being\r\nfully implemented, and then a proof of concept test is conducted of their effect on student learning. \r\nThis formative evaluation (to be conducted in the Fall at Greenfield Community College and \r\nAmherst College, and in the Spring at the University of Massachusetts) runs parallel to, and \r\nbe interactive with, further software development.",
