 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering of InAs Quantum Dot Ensembles Using Interference of Optical\r\nSurface Waves\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the problem of inhomogeneous broadening of the size\r\ndistribution of quantum dot (QD) epitaxial semiconductor ensembles formed\r\nvia a stress-driven Volmer-Weber or Stranski-Krastanov growth mechanism. The\r\nuniformity and narrow size distribution of the QDs are the major challenges\r\nfor the utilization of QD structures in optoelectronic devices. The primary\r\ngoal of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of nanoscale control of\r\nthe nucleation process of InAs QDs on a GaAs surface using the interference\r\nof the optical surface waves. The interference pattern will be generated on\r\nthe surface of the substrate using a pulsed UV laser during the growth of\r\nQDs by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The pattern, with a typical period of\r\nfew hundred nm, will be created using two different optical schemes based\r\non: (i) the interference of the incident wave with the scattered coherent\r\nsurface wave; and (ii) the interference of the incident waves with two\r\nsurface waves coupled to the split laser beams. The optical interference\r\npattern will modulate periodically the surface properties of the substrate\r\nat 100-200 nm level. The nucleation of QDs will be controlled through either\r\nsubstrate temperature modulation, thereby destroying the nucleation clusters\r\nin the antinode of the standing wave pattern, or through undulation of the\r\nsurface by laser ablation to control the surface energy. The 100-nm\r\nmodulation scale is expected to form a template for initial QD nucleation,\r\nand the subsequent evolution of the QD ensemble will be driven\r\nthermodynamically towards higher density of dots, (3-10)e10 cm-2. The\r\nimportant features of the in-situ optical impact are that it does not leave\r\nany residues on the surface, can be conducted during the growth process, and\r\ncan be adjusted to introduce the minimum defect density.\r\nWe will systematically investigate the factors (growth temperature, As flux,\r\ngrowth rate, laser power, etc.) that provide uniform and narrow QD\r\ndistribution and efficient luminescence. The samples grown using optically\r\ncontrolled nucleation will be studied by the in-situ RHEED, as well as STM,\r\nTEM and photoluminescence methods to reveal the correlations between growth\r\nparameters, and the structure and properties of the QD systems. The\r\nlaboratories at the Institute have all the necessary equipment for the QD\r\ncharacterization. This includes state-of-the-art field-emission ultra-high\r\nresolution TEM, focused ion beam station, surface analysis tools, five STM\r\ntools configured for different imaging modes and environment including\r\nultra-high vacuum, and unique ultrasonic force microscope.\r\nThe successful completion of the proposed work would have a significant\r\nimpact on the performance of various optoelectronic components. The method\r\nwill allow the growth of QD structures with sharp size distribution and high\r\nradiative recombination efficiency. For example, the QD structures will be\r\nused as active media for laser diodes with superior performance\r\ncharacteristics, such as higher efficiency, higher thermal stability, higher\r\nmodulation frequency and increased reliability. \r\n",
