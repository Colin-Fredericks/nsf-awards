 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project concerns the surface modification of textiles in order to impart properties to the fabric necessary for their use as protective clothing. The increase in disease transmission, the widespread use of pesticides in agriculture, and the increased proliferation of chemical and biological weapons worldwide have increased the need for the development of effective fabric treatments for protective clothing. During the Phase I research, agents will be covalently attached to the surface of fabric in order to give them the desired properties.  The modified fabric will then be tested for antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms, for detoxification of chemical pesticides and appropriate surrogates for chemical and biological weapons, as well as for skin cytotoxicity. The Phase I research will show that the modified textiles are able to effectively eradicate a broad range of pathogenic microbes, detoxify chemical pesticides  and surrogates for chemical and biological weapons while retaining their original physical  properties and possessing no skin cytotoxicity. Potential applications for this  technology include protective clothing and materials for medical and dental institutions, agricultural workers, and military soldiers as well as for cloth products for household disinfection and various consumer products.\r\n\r\nCommercial applications for fabric that is active against pathogenic microorganisms as well as chemical agents are wide and diverse. Protective clothing for agricultural workers and military servicemen could be produced from these modified fabrics. A multitude of applications could be found in the medical and dental area. Clothing for medical and dental personnel and patients including lab coats, scrubs, caps, shoe covers, masks, privacy drapes, surgical drapes, bed sheets, etc. could be rendered antimicrobial utilizing this technology. Consumer products such as diapers, athletic socks, water filters, and disinfectant wipes could also be prepared from these materials.\r\n",
