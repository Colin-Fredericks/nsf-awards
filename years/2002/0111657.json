 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines a theoretical and experimental exploration of the basic chemistry of boron, structure-property relationships, long range intermolecular interactions in ordered fluids, and the potential for practical applications of some of the materials in the optoelectronics and communications industries. The focus of the project is on developing a new class of calamitic (rod-like) liquid crystals derived from inorganic boron clusters. The design of the materials takes advantage of the unique steric and electronic features of the clusters such as three-dimensional aromaticity, high electronic polarizability, variable polarity, and high rotational axes. This combination of properties is not available in purely organic systems. The proposed study focuses on nematic materials with lateral and longitudinal dipole moments, mesogenic additives to ferro- and antiferroelectric liquid crystals and mesogenic nonlinear optical chromophores. The proposed activities will include quantum mechanical calculations, synthesis, characterization and evaluation of device performance. The project is designed to have a maximum impact on education and research productivity.  The project will expose students to a broad spectrum of research activities, give them versatile expertise in organic materials, and prepare them to undertake complicated projects in the materials chemistry area.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this research project is the development of a new class of liquid crystals to address issues in fundamental and applied science and technology. Liquid crystals combine properties typical for solids, such as optical and dielectric anisotropies, with the fluidity of a liquid. This unique combination of properties makes these remarkable materials an indispensable component of contemporary technology, such as \r\nflat panel display, telecommunication, and sensors. The project is designed to have a maximum impact on education and research productivity. \r\n",
