 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nA major shortage of qualified mathematics teachers exists and is expected to worsen. By adapting and implementing Queens College's (QC/CUNY) exemplary TIME2000 program (NSF DUE 9652972), the pipeline of prospective mathematics teachers at the middle and high school levels is being increased. TIMEQCC is establishing a mathematics-education program at Queensborough Community College (QCC) and increasing the junior year cohort in TIME2000. The success of TIME2000 has been demonstrated through increased retention rates, media recognition, and additional funding from the college and a private foundation. The goal of increasing the pipeline of qualified teachers is being accomplished by targeting the under-recruited population of QCC students who have completed college algebra or precalculus with a B or better and then retaining them using two major innovations. These innovations are:\r\n 1. Cross-campus counseling and teaching (QCC and QC), including an interdisciplinary mathematics education course.\r\n 2. Implementing the successful QCC upper level mathematics retention model -- tutoring in upper level mathematics courses, study groups based on the Uri Treisman model, and tutoring internships in the Mathematics Learning Center.\r\n\r\nWorking closely with the TIME2000 faculty at QC, the structure of the program is being adapted for the community college student. Formative and summative evaluations are being conducted using QC's established evaluation procedures. Dissemination is through the CUNY Council of Math Chairs and national on-line conferences.",
