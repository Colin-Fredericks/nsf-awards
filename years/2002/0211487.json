 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the future, communications systems are expected to be characterized as\r\nubiquitous, pervasive, very mobile, and highly distributed, among other at-\r\ntributes. In contrast to current systems, such as cellular systems or the\r\ncurrent Internet, the reliance on central network components will be much\r\nreduced and ad hoc methods for forming networks will become more preva-\r\nlent. Additionally, the number of connected devices, including both sensors\r\nand actuators as well as processors, will increase dramatically and many\r\nnetwork devices will operate autonomously. Massive quantities of data of\r\nvarious highly structured formats will need to be accessed and distributed\r\nacross these networks. Wireless and wireline systems will interconnect with\r\noptical fiber and free space communications media.\r\nThis workshop is intended to bring together a distinguished group of\r\nresearch scientists/educators and industry and government experts to discuss\r\nand identify critical research in communications to support this vision. The\r\nworkshop will provide an opportunity to interact with experts from related\r\nfields, primarily computer science, working on different aspects of future\r\ncommunication systems. A list of invitees for this workshop is provided in\r\nthe appendix.\r\nThe workshop aims to identify research challenges and opportunities as-\r\nsociated with the emerging vision for future communications systems. We\r\nexpect a report to come out of the workshop reflecting the themes discussed.\r\n",
