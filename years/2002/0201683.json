 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT for DMS 0201683\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project concerns problems at the juncture of geometry, topology, and\r\nphysics. The mathematical challenge   we address is :(i) to provide a\r\nrigorous framework for    functional integrals in geometrical  quantum\r\nfield theories, and (ii) to use the rigorous framework to prove results\r\nwhich may be conjectured in the heuristic/informal  setting suggested by\r\nphysics. Specifically, we will be concerned with : (a) quantum Yang-Mills\r\ngauge theory over surfaces, (b) a three dimensional   Chern-Simons gauge\r\ntheory, and (c) other functional integrals arising from\r\ngeometrical/topological quantum  theories. The goal will be to give\r\nrigorous foundations to   the mathematical expressions and objects which\r\narise in these theories and then to use them to further develop\r\nmathematical ideas and solve specific problems. The mathematics involved\r\nincludes   geometry and topology connected with  fiber bundles and Lie\r\ngroups, as well as stochastic analysis and infinite-dimensional\r\nintegration. Stochastic analysis has  often been applied in the study of\r\nthe geometry of manifolds. The present proposal addresses   situations\r\nwhich promise deeper applications of stochastic analysis in settings\r\nenriched  by   geometry and topology.\r\n\r\nThis research program will bring together geometry  and topology  with\r\nstochastic analysis to provide solid mathematical foundations for certain\r\ncomputations done in physics, solve  certain specific  problems and develop\r\nnew mathematical ideas arising from quantum physics. The physics is quantum\r\nfield theory, which describes the quantum behavior of forces that govern\r\nthe interaction between elementary particles  in nature such as those which\r\nmake up protons and neutrons. This project   is concerned with development\r\nof fundamental mathematics  connected with   an area of physics. There may\r\nbe potential applications to surface physics and other phenomena involving\r\ngeometry and stochastics, but this project itself is devoted primarily to\r\nfoundations rather than application.   History shows that mathematics\r\narising through an investigation of fundamental notions associated to one\r\nparticular context later finds application in areas far removed from the\r\noriginal context, this being an essential aspect of the centrality of\r\nmathematics to applied sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
