 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this collaborative proposal is to increase the number of high achieving, but financially challenged, students graduating with a four-year degree in computer science, engineering, or mathematics. The approach is to create a formal link between the University of Texas at Arlington and two local community colleges (Tarrant County College-Southeast Campus and Mountain View College) to tap a rich pool of academically talented students who lack the financial resources to complete their studies on a full-time basis. First generation students, in particular, tend to fall into this category, and they often lack the visibility or knowledge to seek needed resources and career guidance effectively. Many of these students begin their higher education at community colleges, while working full- or part-time. Lack of funds negatively affects the retention rate of this group, thus shortchanging the technical workforce of much-needed potential talent.\r\n\r\nTherefore, UTA and its CC partners formed a CSEMS collaborative partnership that could have a tremendous impact on the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) technical workforce. Eighty-nine scholarships are awarded annually with priority given to eligible first generation students.\r\n\r\nThe objectives to support the goal include establishing a structured pipeline from the CCs to\r\nUTA; developing retention strategies and adapting existing academic support resources\r\nto target this pool of students in CSEM disciplines; formalizing an optional research component or industry internship experience to the Scholars' degree plan; and developing CSEM specific programs to prepare the students for professional experiences beyond graduation. Faculty and industry mentors are available, and a Peer Bridge Group of CC alumni, who are now attending UTA, assist CC students through the transfer process.\r\n\r\nA formal CSEM Articulation Agreement was developed to create seamless curricula and concurrent enrollment opportunities in these fields by which to transition CC students to UTA. This collaborative encompasses a significant portion of North Texas, and it builds capacity and critical mass for the technical workforce in this leading high tech region.\r\n",
