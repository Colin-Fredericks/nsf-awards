An arsenal of \r\ntechniques has been thrown at this problem; it is the focus of dozens of \r\nresearch groups. The most successful attempts have associated to each \r\n4-dimensional manifold the solution space to complex systems of \r\nequations that arise in particle physics: the Yang-Mills equations and \r\nthe monopole equations of Seiberg and Witten. These solution spaces are \r\nuseful in distinguishing cunningly constructed 4-dimensional manifolds. \r\nThe result of this assault is that 4-dimensional manifolds are more \r\ncomplicated than we ever expected.  As a result, it is impossible to \r\npredict a classification scheme. It is the goal of this project to more \r\nsystematically approach the existence and uniqueness framework for a \r\nclassification scheme. The first goal is to understand why smooth \r\nstructures on 4-manifolds are sensitive to local topological change. \r\nThis project describes the underpinnings of how the smooth structures \r\nchange in the known constructions. Log transformations on \r\nnull-homologous tori are shown to play a significant role. The first \r\nstep is to determine if two smooth structures on a fixed homeomorphism \r\ntype of simply-connected smooth 4-manifold are related by a sequence of \r\nlog transformations on null-homologous tori. The second step is to \r\ndetermine the characteristic numbers of irreducible smooth 4-manifolds \r\nand to determine how these topological invariants affect their \r\nSeiberg-Witten invariants. A notion of general-type smooth 4-manifolds \r\nis given and a conjectured restriction on their Seiberg-Witten \r\ninvariants is proposed. This project outlines new constructions that \r\nshow that there are general-type manifolds that fill out the regions \r\ndetermined by these restrictions. Careful investigation of these \r\nconstructions should indicate why they are best possible. Other \r\nquestions related to potential restrictions on the characteristic \r\nclasses of irreducible simply-connected smooth 4-manifolds will be \r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nExcitement has been generated by the idea that the puniest of all \r\nforces, gravity, may in fact be a strong as nature's other three \r\nfundamental forces: the strong force which binds protons and neutrons \r\ntogether in atomic nuclei; the weak force which governs radioactive \r\ndecay; and the forces that govern electricity and magnetism. The \r\nperceived mismatch between these three forces and gravity creates a \r\ntheoretical nightmare; it's the principle reason we have yet to find a \r\ngrand unified theory. However, it has recently been hypothesized that \r\nthis weakness is a mirage; the force of gravity only appears weak \r\nbecause its force is diluted in our own universe and most of gravity's \r\nforce radiates out into extra dimensions. All other forces remain \r\ntrapped in our 3-dimensional world, while gravity is free to roam other \r\ndimensions. With this hypothesis, there could be other worlds that are \r\nparallel to our own; they all neatly stack up, each oblivious of the \r\nother, with gravity the only force that moves between them. This would \r\nalso account for the missing dark matter of our universe; it actually \r\nresides in other parallel universes. New mathematics will be generated \r\nin this project to further explore these ideas. Much of the relevant \r\nmathematics has already exposed the special nature of dimensions three \r\nand four. These parallel universes may be explained by the theory of \r\n(singular) foliations. The proposed study of singular foliations may \r\nstructure the way in which we view our own universe -how we stack up \r\nwith possible parallel universes. These singular foliations will also \r\nprovide new insight into the classification of 4- dimensional \r\nmanifolds.  At bottom, the goal of this project is to develop more \r\nsystematic constructions of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds with the hope \r\nthat a general picture begins to emerge that will at least suggest a \r\nclassification scheme.\r\n",
