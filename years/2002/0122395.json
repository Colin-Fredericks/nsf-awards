 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr Kim Holland of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB), University of Hawaii, has received a grant from the National Science Foundation to renovate and expand the salt water life support system at HIMB's Coconut Island laboratory.   HIMB is a leading tropical marine biology research facility, and a reliable supply of high quality seawater is central to its research and education missions.  The existing seawater pumping and distribution system is several decades old and does not serve many of the newer buildings at the lab.  This grant will also help underwrite the construction of a new large seawater tank that will be used to hold large marine fish such as sharks and tuna. \r\n\r\nThe current inefficient maze of saltwater feeder pipes will be dismantled and replaced by an entirely new distribution system which will be more efficient and environmentally friendly.  The new system will feature dual parallel pipes to all use locations and will be constructed so that the pipes can be automatically cleaned without disruption of supply.  The more frequent cleaning possible in this new system will eliminate the discharge of heavily silt-laden effluent.  Similarly, the installation of modern pumps and pump controls will allow a better supply of seawater while reducing the amount of electricity consumed.  A forty-foot by twenty-foot reinforced fiberglass tank will be constructed on an existing concrete pad.  This tank will be fed by the new seawater system and will hold seawater to a depth of five feet.  The tank will be surrounded by a catwalk that will be used for experimental observations and service access.\r\n\r\nThe University of Hawaii has identified marine science as an area of excellence to be emphasized as the university enters the twenty-first century.  This emphasis is reflected in the recent construction of new laboratory facilities and funding for four additional faculty positions.  The renovation and expansion of Coconut Island's seawater system will be crucial to the success of the university's initiative.   Because of its location, HIMB can play a leading role in areas such as coral reef biology and the study of large tropical species such as sharks and tunas.  HIMB is a major destination for scientists from all around the world who wish to work on these topics.  This NSF grant will greatly assist HIMB in providing modern facilities for its faculty and visitors.\r\n",
