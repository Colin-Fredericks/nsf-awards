 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for a Field School in Biocultural Anthropology at \r\nthe University of Notre Dame.  The program will engage a diverse \r\npool of talented undergraduates in an experiential learning \r\nenvironment that immerses them in anthropological method and theory. \r\nUsing the large Byzantine St. Stephen's skeletal collection from \r\nJerusalem as the cornerstone for study, historical and archaeological \r\ninformation will be synthesized in a biocultural reconstruction of \r\nancient monastic life. Students will engage in original research to \r\ndevelop a suite of methodological skills in the sciences and enhance \r\ntheir capability for collaborative research.  They will share in a \r\nfield trip program to area research sites, libraries, museums, and a \r\nfunctioning monastery to gain an understanding of the cultural \r\nparameters affecting human adaptability.  Exploration of ethical \r\nissues related to the politics of archaeology, treatment of \r\nartifacts, and repatriation will focus attention on scientific \r\nethics, an important foundation for future research endeavors. \r\nFinally, a dynamic lecture program delivered by an international team \r\nof scholars in the fields of anthropology, biology, history, \r\nclassics, geography, theology, and Near Eastern studies will \r\ncrystallize the importance of a holistic approach for studying the \r\npast.   The biocultural field school will provide an \r\nintellectually energizing learning experience, which will equip \r\nparticipants with a suite of talents for viewing their surroundings. \r\nThe integration of practical research skills, ethical inquiry, and \r\nthe synthesis of disciplinary paradigms for viewing human interaction \r\nwill prove useful as students move into graduate or professional \r\ncareers in the natural and social sciences.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract\r\ntalented students into careers in science through active undergraduate \r\nresearch experiences.\r\n\r\n",
