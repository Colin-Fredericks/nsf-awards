A team of faculty and administrators from both colleges will\r\nexplore ways in which DET can be infused into all aspects of teacher education and\r\nultimately used to anchor instruction in science and math education. Part of the team will\r\ndesign and teach a pilot course that will be used as a tool to conduct research and collect\r\nthe data needed to inform both engineering and education faculty on best ways of\r\nincorporating DET concepts.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project include 1) identifying curricular and pedagogical needs of\r\nteachers and university faculty for implementing DET, 2) developing a DET-based pilot\r\ncourse as a research tool for exploring DET in the curriculum, 3) crafting a set of\r\nrecommendations for a comprehensive implementation of DET in teacher education, 4)\r\ndeveloping models for the appropriate points in the professional development sequence\r\nfor DET, 5) determining the effectiveness of the pilot on instructional practices,\r\ncurricular choices and student understanding of DET and engineering careers, and 5)\r\ndeveloping models that extend DET to pre-service education through methods classes\r\nand general education courses.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of this planning grant include a re-conceptualizing part of\r\nthe science and mathematics component of teacher education and bringing technological\r\ndesign, as addressed in the standards, to the forefront of k-12 science and mathematics\r\ninstruction. \r\n",
