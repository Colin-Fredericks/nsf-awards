The workshop is being held October 12 and 13, 2002, near the North Carolina State University campus.  The goals of the workshop are 1) to identify potential areas of research collaboration between the biological, statistical and signal processing communities and 2) to explore potential new avenues of research in genetics by exploiting synergies in research between signal processing, statistics, and genonomics.  The workshop brings together a diverse set of outstanding researchers from each of these areas to address the challenges of the multidisciplinary area of genomics.  Twelve internationally known researchers are presenting plenary and invited talks and the workshop also features poster sessions and round-table discussions of the key topics.\r\n",
