 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geomagnetically-Induced Currents (GICs) are generally produced by the rate-of-change of the local geomagnetic field caused by a geomagnetic storm.  The GIC when large in magnitude and/or geographically wide-spread can lead to severe power system problems.  Failures of equipment can occur due to this interaction of the GIC with the power grid.\r\n\r\nIt has been previously understood that electrojet-driven geomagnetic storm processes were responsible for local geomagnetic field disturbances and GICs affecting power girds, especially for power grids at high magnetic latitudes, which are in close proximity to the electrojet currents.  However, a large number of reported power system problems did not fit the timing or location pattern as being associated with intensification of auroral electrojets.  Rather, they were associated with the onset times of geomagnetic storm commencement (SC) events.  A preliminary review of power system disturbance and storm climatology data reported in Solar Cycle 22 and to date in Solar Cycle 23 indicates that a number of severe power system impacts have been observed due to this SC process.  Severe impacts to power system operations have been observed as far south as Los Angeles, Texas-New Mexico, and all across the southeastern US, as well as traditional mid and northern latitude locations.\r\n\r\nNo rigorous study has been conducted in the US to do even a preliminary assessment of this risk potential.  The PI will undertake a US-focused geomagnetic hazard study and assessment to further develop detailed understanding of this important storm process and how this storm process couples to important ground-based infrastructures such as power girds and communication cables.",
