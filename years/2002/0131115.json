 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division,  Bililign will address two important issues of physical chemistry. The first deals with the reaction dynamics of M-H2 (M = alkali metal). By measuring the nascent rotational state distribution of the LiH product we will try to understand the reaction mechanism. The second deals with the C-H activation by metal atoms. The physical and chemical quenching of excited Li atoms by alkane and alkene hydrocarbons will be investigated by means of  cascade and time-resolved atomic fluorescence techniques. Far-wing scattering state spectroscopy will be employed in the studies of  reaction dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis research deals with two important areas of chemical reaction processes. The goal is to understand how reagent molecules approach, collide, exchange energy, and finally separate into products. The benefits of such knowledge include applications to the modeling of chemical reactions in the upper atmospheric, plasma processes, chemical synthesis, and chemical reaction process technology.  This work will be conducted with students who will thereby gain research experience in preparation for advanced studies or entry into the scientific/technological workforce.  \r\n",
