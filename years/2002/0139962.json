 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory (BEST) is an annual\r\nconference in Set Theory hosted by Boise State University. It has\r\nrun continuously since it began in 1992 and is the only regular\r\nconference in North America devoted primarily to Set Theory. The\r\ntalks and the participants are representative of set theoretic\r\nresearch in North America with topics ranging from large\r\ncardinals, cardinal invariants of the continuum, core models,\r\nfine structure, descriptive set theory, set theoretic topology\r\nand analysis, forcing axioms, and combinatorics. The small scale\r\nof the conference --- about 20 participants, most presenting\r\ntalks --- allows for an informal atmosphere and encourages\r\ndiscussion between the representatives of various areas of set\r\ntheory.\r\n \r\nThe general format is that of a three day conference. Four\r\ninvited talks running approximately 50 minutes each are spread\r\nthroughout the conference with the remainder of the schedule\r\nconsisting of shorter contributed talks. NSF funds are used to\r\ncover the expenses of the invited speakers and to help defray the\r\nlocal and travel expenses of those who do not have their own form\r\nof travel support, especially graduate students. The organizers\r\nmake a sincere effort to invite women, minorities, and young\r\nmembers of the field.\r\n",
