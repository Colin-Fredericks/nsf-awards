 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) failure is a devastating reliability problem \r\nto VDSM (very-deep-sub-micron) and nano-scale Si ULSI IC technologies. \r\nIt is imperative to investigate ESD failure fundamentals and on-chip ESD\r\n protection theories focusing on the following challenges: 3D mixed-mode \r\nESD simulation methodology; accurate high-current ESD modeling; whole-chip \r\nESD design synthesis, advanced ESD protection solutions for ULSI ICs, ESD\r\nprotection for super-GHz RF ICs, ESD protection for nano-scale as well \r\nas wide-bandgap semiconductor IC technologies. The PI proposes a \r\ncareer development plan that addresses these challenges.\r\n\r\nProposed research activities consist of six tasks: to investigate \r\nadvanced on-chip ESD protection phenomena in ULSI ICs by developing a novel \r\n3D mixed-mode ESD simulation methodology; to investigate ESD \r\nprotection fundamentals by developing accurate high-current ESD device \r\nmodels; to develop a full-chip ESD design verification CAD tool called \r\nESDcat; to explore novel ultra-fast ESD protection solutions for \r\nsub-100nm ULSI ICs, to explore ESD protection for future nano-technologies, \r\nand to extend ESD research to super-GHz RF ICs and wide-bandgap \r\nsemiconductor, GaN. \r\n\r\nSince ESD phenomena are geometry-dependent involving complex\r\n electro-thermal-process-device-circuit coupling, the proposed \r\nresearch procedures take full-scale mixed-mode approaches that investigate \r\nESD fundamentals in a fully-coupled process-device-circuit-electronic-thermal\r\n closed-loop in 3D format. A 3D parallel ESD model network is proposed \r\nfor accurate high-current ESD modeling. ESDcat enables chip level ESD \r\nsynthesis and verification at both schematic and layout levels. Nano-scale \r\nESD research will take into account the ballistic phonon scattering \r\neffect. ESD for wide-bandgaps will focus on Si-compatible GaN ICs. \r\nEnd results include insights into ESD mechanisms, CAD tools for further \r\ninvestigation and design of ESD protections for various IC technologies, \r\ne.g., CMOS, BiCMOS, SOI, SiGe, GaN, RFIC, and Cu interconnects. Both \r\nnew ESD theory and immediate industrial applications are expected.\r\n\r\nThe education plan centers on: new curriculum development; integration \r\nof microelectronics research and education; student mentoring and \r\ncommunity services; and university-industry collaboration. Specifically,\r\n activities include: develop five courses/labs in a five-year period; \r\npursue an improved microelectronics teaching approach; establish an \r\nIntegrated Electronics Laboratory, a Virtual IC Fab facility, and \r\nTCAD/ECAD Design Studios; advising students in conducting \r\ninter-professional projects; develop a undergraduate industrial \r\nco-op program; and involving minority/women students in microelectronics\r\n research. This five-year education proposal is integrated into \r\nthe departmental redevelopment plan in microelectronics\r\n",
