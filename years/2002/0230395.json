 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last several years, the critical need to bolster participation in science at all levels in \r\nthe United States has become an issue of national concern. As the number of people trained in \r\nhighly technical fields in the sciences, mathematics and engineering grows, there is evidence \r\nto suggest that students who have aptitude and interest in the sciences and mathematics often \r\nbecome disillusioned with their college-level studies and opt for majors in non-science \r\ndisciplines. These students abandon potentially promising careers in science, technology, \r\nengineering and mathematics (STEM) fields because of inadequate preparation during their \r\nhigh school years, feelings that they can not compete, inadequate and/or poor advising by \r\ncollege faculty, and disinterest in university-level general education classes in STEM fields. A \r\nmost harmful part of this trend is that many students make decisions to leave STEM majors \r\nduring their first year of college when they have not yet had the opportunity to develop strong \r\nties with STEM departments. This loss of talent is detrimental not only to the intellectual \r\ncapital that is a source of national pride but also to the nation's ability to maintain the high \r\nstandard of living that is one by-product of a technologically-advanced economy. The solution \r\nto this problem lies, in part, in the ability of colleges and universities to restructure science \r\nand mathematics courses and majors. \r\n\r\nTo address this problem in which promising students switch to non-scientific majors early \r\nin their college education, funding is requested for a three-year initiative that has as its \r\noverarching goal to recruit and retain promising students in STEM majors. Our approach \r\nis to develop a pilot project that consists of three parts: (1) a Summer Science Institute \r\nfor high school students; (2) a Freshman Year Science Seminar Series, and (3) a Sophomore \r\nYear Independent Research Experience. At the heart of each of these programs are common \r\nthemes, including introducing students to the joys of scientific discovery and the nature of \r\nteam-based interdisciplinary research, informing students about exciting career choices in \r\nSTEM fields, exposing them to the rich history of scientific thought and discovery, and \r\nproviding them with the tools and support structure they need to complete a baccalaureate \r\ndegree in one or more STEM disciplines. We integrate practices that have been shown to be \r\neffective in improving participation, including close mentoring, extracurricular activities, \r\ndevelopment of a cohort, inclusion of parents, and professional development for faculty. \r\nAccording to recent studies, the problem of first-year flight disproportionately impacts \r\nwomen, minorities, low-income, and/or first-generation students. For this reason, our \r\nrecruiting efforts are concentrate on these target groups.\r\n\r\nThis pilot program has been carefully overseen and assessed by an Advisory Board chaired by \r\nthe chief academic officer of Central Washington University, Provost/Senior Vice President \r\nDavid Soltz. Assessment is coordinated by Associate Professor of Science Education \r\nand Chemistry Martha Kurtz and Vice Provost and Professor of Curriculum and Supervision \r\nLinda Beath. Twice per year, goals, assessment strategies and benchmarks are reviewed \r\nin order to improve the program. Should our approach be successful, full scale implementation \r\nat CWU would rely on funding from private sources and redirection of internal resources. \r\nBecause our proposed program relies on themes and resources that are fundamental to most \r\ncolleges and universities, we anticipate that other STEM groups could adopt our program, \r\nthereby increasing its impact from a local to a national scope. Central Washington University \r\nis well poised to support a program that stresses outreach to minority populations, careful \r\nmentoring, and inquiry-based, interdisciplinary academic programs. CWU emphasizes small \r\nclass size, close professional relationships between faculty and students, and a culture that \r\nrewards innovative, inquiry-based teaching and learning. The University has a strong, \r\nwell-supported program in undergraduate research and creative expression, and strengths in \r\neducation promote effective use of assessment strategies. This project reflects a \r\ncollaborative effort among 11 faculty in six College of the Sciences departments. Co-PIs \r\ninclude Wendy Bohrson (Geological Sciences), Michael Braunstein (Physics), Eric Bullock \r\n(Chemistry), Carey Gazis (Geological Sciences), Lisa Ely (Geological Sciences), Ed \r\nGellenbeck (Computer Sciences), Stephen Glasby(Mathematics), Martha Kurtz (Science \r\nEducation and Chemistry), Steven Lundblad (Geological Sciences), Andy Piacsek (Physics), \r\nand Holly Pinkart (Biological Sciences).\r\n\r\n",
