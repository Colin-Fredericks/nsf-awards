 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a considerable void of data on the frequency, patterns, and mechanisms of seed and pollen dispersal within and among natural plant populations.  The goal of the research is to integrate empirical and theoretical approaches to the measurement dispersal over large distances.  The project uses molecular genetic markers, a large mapped tropical forest plot in Panama, and several long-term environmental data sets to address fundamental questions about the patterns, processes, and mechanisms of seed and pollen dispersal in five tropical tree species.\r\n\r\nAs humans continue to alter and fragment tropical forest landscapes, knowledge of those processes that regulate populations and maintain diverse communities is critical for predicting how these populations will respond in the future.  Chief among the population processes that will determine the ecological and genetic response over time and space is dispersal.  To our knowledge, this study is among the first and most comprehensive attempts to obtain direct measurements of both seed and pollen dispersal distances using genetic techniques.  This study will directly inform conservationists and land managers as to the appropriate size of habitat required to maintain populations of tropical trees in light of the spatial extent of seed and pollen movement.\r\n",
