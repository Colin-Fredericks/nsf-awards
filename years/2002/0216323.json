This system will allow us to obtain detailed information about materials properties of bulk substrates, epitaxial layers, and heterostructures for wide band gap semiconductors enabling the optimization of the device design for high power electronics, solid state lighting, and UV emitters and detector applications for detection of hazardous biological substances. In particular, we will evaluate substrate material and surface preparation, and buffer and epitaxial layers for LEDs, laser diodes and transistors. The studies of non-equilibrium recombination and transport parameters that will be made possible with this system will allow us to optimize growth regimes and structure design for heterostructures and quantum wells and to optimize n-type and p-type doping regimes and conditions. This unique system allows for nondestructive characterization technique, which could bridge the gap between optical and electronic characterization of wide band gap semiconductors. We believe that light-induced transient grating technique capable of performing in deep UV spectral range is the best method to extract carrier generation, trapping, recombination and diffusion characteristics. This system will be unique in several respects: it will allow for sub-picosecond pulses, will have sub-picosecond time resolution; tunability in 200-800 nm range, and automatic operation.  It will allow us to apply both external electric field and mechanical deformation. The proposed system will perform in deep UV spectral range and will be used for the studies of GaN, AlGaN, AlInGaN and SiC materials, AlInGaN/GaN heterostructures and AlInGaN-based high Al content quantum well structures\r\n",
