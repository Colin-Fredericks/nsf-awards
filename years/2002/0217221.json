 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast success of products like the \"GameBoy\" sends a clear message that technology is\r\nthe domain of boys. The Girls Creating Games Program is a demonstration project designed\r\nto challenge this message by teaching girls to design and program a computer game. This \r\nproject is unique in its approach: it puts girls in the role of producers of technology, rather \r\nthan simply consumers. One hundred eighty middle school girls will participate in a study \r\nto determine whether producing technology (computer game design) can increase girls'\r\nfluency, interest, active participation and persistence in technology studies. The\r\nspecific project goals are to a)increase girls' knowledge, interest, attitudes, and\r\nconfidence with computers, b) increase adults capacity to support girls in technology,\r\nand c) add to research on the kinds of programs and technologies that increase the interest \r\nand persistence of middle school girls in technology studies and careers.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will take place with small groups of girls after school and during\r\nthe summer in a small, urban county (70% White, 21% Hispanic) in California.  It involves an\r\nunusual partnership between four entities: 1) researchers and program developers from a \r\nnon-profit health promotion agency (ETR Associates); 2) school personnel and students\r\nfrom New Brighton Middle School; 3) staff and youth from a Boys & Girls Club; and 4) \r\nfemale technology students, teachers, and professionals from local colleges and\r\ncompanies. This partnership is essential for building knowledge (e.g., identifying\r\neffective program strategies to increase girls interest and persistence in\r\ntechnology studies), and increasing social capital (e.g., building the capacity of\r\nadult female role models, teachers, and staff to provide a supportive environment).\r\n\r\nTeaching computer game design holds great promise as an intervention strategy for\r\nincreasing girls' interest in technology. Indeed, interactive games have an early\r\ninfluence on theskills and attitudes that are the best predictors of future \r\ntechnology-related behavior (Greenfield & Cocking, 1996; Levine & Donitsa-Schmidt,\r\n1998; Subrahmanyam & Greenfield, 1998).  Only two other known programs (with \r\nelementary and high school students) have used game creation as an intervention \r\nstrategy or as part of a research-driven agenda (Kafai, 1995; Miller, Chaika, &\r\nGroppe, 1996).  Our work extends that research by working with middle school students \r\nin an informal learning (out of school) environment, and using theoretically and\r\nempirically-based program activities that build on girls development research. \r\nOur project is also innovative in that it includes identity formation as part of the\r\nprogram as a way to transform, not simply respond to existing gender roles\r\n(Cassell & Jenkins, 1999). Our program strategies are designed to appeal to girls.\r\nThey include having fun with computers; linking technology with its real-world \r\napplication; focusing the game content on social issues; using a collaborative \r\ninstructional model; involving technical female role models, school teachers and \r\nprogram staff; and assessing the impact of game design on participants as well as\r\nthe teachers and staff.\r\n\r\nThe proposed intervention will be evaluated using a quasi-experimental, pre-post test\r\ndesign. Two hypotheses will be tested.  First, compared to the control group, the \r\nparticipants in the intervention group will report a greater increase in problem-solving\r\nand computer skills, interest in computers, positive attitude toward computers, intention \r\nto pursue computer studies, confidence using computers, knowledge about tech careers,\r\nand support to pursue a career in technology.  Second, the instructional model that uses \r\ncollaboration with peers and guidance from teachers, staff, and female role models \r\nwill increase the adults' capacity and interest to support girls active participation\r\n in technology, and challenge stereotypes about who is good at computers. Data will \r\nbe collected using surveys, interviews, and student notebooks. The findings will result \r\nin a replicable version of the program that can be used to increase girls interest in \r\ntechnology and adults capacity to support them in other school and after school settings.",
