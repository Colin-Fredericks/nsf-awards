The equipment will be used for\r\nseveral research projects, as follows.  Professor Ellingham\r\nwill investigate conjectures in graph theory involving\r\nsurface embeddings, traversability, and independent sets.\r\nProfessor Hardin will construct and develop applications\r\nof local orthogonal bases. Professor Horn will investigate\r\nthe controllability of linked elastic structurres using\r\nnumerical methods. Professors Hardin and Saff will\r\ninvestigate discrete minimum energy problems on the sphere.\r\nProfessors Saff and Schumaker will research the theory and\r\napplications of splines, especially on the sphere.\r\n\r\nProfessor Ellingham's research involves graphs, which are\r\nmathematical models of networks. Communication,\r\ntransportation and other networks are often modeled using\r\ntechniques from graph theory.  Professor Hardin's research\r\ninvolves wavelets, which are an important tool for\r\ncompressing images, sounds, and other real-world information.\r\nThey may be applied to problems in fitting equations to data\r\npoints in any area of science, or processing images, for\r\nexample from medical scanning equipment. Professor Horn's\r\nresearch involves control theory, which allows computation\r\nof how forces should be applied to a complicated system to\r\nachieve a desired outcome.  There are applications to many\r\nreal-world structures such as trusses, robot arms, solar\r\npanels, and suspension bridges. The work by Professors\r\nHardin and Saff involves the best way to place points on\r\na sphere so that the sphere is covered as uniformly as\r\npossible. This problem has applications in many fields,\r\nincluding the structure of viruses, crystallography,\r\nstructure of molecules, and electrostatics.  The research\r\nby Professors Saff and Schumaker involves trying to provide\r\naccurate but easily computable representations of quantities\r\non the surface of a sphere. For example, these technique may\r\nbe used to construct an accurate model of the Earth's\r\ngravitational field. \r\n",
