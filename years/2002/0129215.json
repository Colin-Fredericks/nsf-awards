The objective of their research is to develop an economic theory of the content of advertising and explore incentives used by firms regarding the amount and nature of information they provide in advertisements.  They will construct a model to demonstrate the relationship between the amount of information revealed by a firm about its products and corresponding market performance.  The US and French researchers have complementary expertise in economics.  They collaborated previously on research on firm pricing in the context of consumer search for prices and product matches.  This collaboration extends this initial research into new areas. The research will advance understanding about economic and social impact of advertising on firms, purchasing, product pricing and on the public respectively.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator.  The CNRS will support visits by the French researcher to the United States. \r\n",
