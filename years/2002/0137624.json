 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will produce a phylogeny (family tree) of the 38 flea beetle \r\nsupra-generic groups and 5 galerucine tribes, which will test three  \r\nproposed  hypotheses of relationships, between the flea beetles and the \r\ngalerucinae using a comprehensive taxon set and an exhaustive character set \r\nfrom adult and larval morphology and 3 gene fragments from the \r\nmitochondrial, nuclear and ribosomal genomes. This phylogeny will also be \r\nused to test hypotheses of evolution of jumping behavior, evolution of host- \r\nplant choice, Biogeography and geologic age of the flea beetles, and \r\nevolution of larval leaf feeding which are of general scientific interest.\r\n\r\nThe flea beetles (Chrysomelidae: Alticinae) together with their sister \r\ngroup, the Galerucinae, are a huge group containing over 12,000 species; \r\nthey are also extremely damaging to agriculture. The flea beetles are \r\nrenowned for making  \"shot holes\" in table crops such as potato, broccoli and \r\ngrapes. The galerucines are infamous for the multi-billion dollar damage to \r\ncorn and beans.  Unfortunately, the taxonomic status of the flea beetles is \r\nso confusing that it impedes proper research and pest management.  Over 500 \r\ndescribed genera of flea beetles are divided into 38 supra-generic tribes, \r\nsub-tribes and sections and there is no taxonomic or phylogenetic hypothesis \r\nof how these tribes and series are related to one another. This lack of a \r\ntrust -worthy phylogeny is especially important to pest management, where \r\nassumptions about pesticide applications or search for biological control \r\nagents are often made based on taxonomic position and where money is often \r\nwasted if these assumptions are incorrect.\r\n\r\n",
