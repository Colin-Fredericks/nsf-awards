In this case, the bottom of the spectrum \r\nis assumed to be positive.  The second project of the Principal Investigator is to \r\ninvestigate the size of the space of harmonic functions with polynomial growth on \r\ncomplete manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature.  In particular, \r\nthe primary goal is to prove that the dimension of the space of harmonic functions \r\nof polynomial growth with degree at most d is bounded by the dimension of an \r\nanalogous space in Euclidean space of the same dimension.  The third project is \r\nto understand the geometry of stable minimal hypersurfaces of Euclidean space. \r\nMore generally, he would like to study minimal hypersurfaces with have finite index.  \r\nThe PI also proposes to support a postdoc, Dr. Xiaofeng Sun, in his research projects.  \r\nDr. Sun proposes to study the regularity theory of harmonic maps into a metric space. \r\n\r\n\r\nThese proposed projects have the unified theme of using analytical techniques in \r\nstudying the underlining geometric spaces.  In many instances, topological and \r\ngeometrical conclusions can be drawn by detail analysis of solutions of some \r\nappropriate partial differential equations defined on the space.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
