E-infinity ring spectra are a stable \r\nhomotopy theory generalization of E-infinity differential \r\ngraded algebras.  Most commonly studied generalized \r\ncohomology theories that have commutative ring structures \r\nare represented by E-infinity ring spectra. This extra\r\nstructure yields important calculational information about \r\nthe theory and is useful for various constructions of \r\nrelated theories.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic topology tries to reduce topological or geometric\r\nclassification problems into algebra.  Because the algebra \r\nis usually discrete, it is typically invariant under changes \r\nby continuous deformations, or ``homotopies.''  Because of \r\nthis, fundamental problems in algebraic topology are often \r\nphrased in terms of understanding the homotopy equivalence \r\nclasses of spaces or in terms of computing the number (or \r\nmore often the ``group'' or ``module'') of homotopy classes \r\nof maps between spaces.  Quite generally this kind of question \r\ncan be reformulated as an equivalent question in algebra.\r\nThe purpose of this proposal is to develop tools to study \r\nthe sort of algebra that arises in this context.\r\n",
