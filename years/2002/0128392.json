 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate the usefulness of image processing technologies for characterizing discontinuities in rock masses. Discontinuities in rock masses include joints, faults, bedding planes, etc., and characterizing these features is one of the most important inputs to engineering design in rock masses. Split Engineering LLC has developed image processing and mathematical algorithms for I) delineating fracture traces in images of rock fractures, and 2) extracting three-dimensional properties (including strike and dip) from the delineated fracture traces. The first objective of the Phase I work is to test and further refine the image processing and mathematical algorithms that have been developed. The second objective is to investigate the synergies between this technology and the laser scanning technologies, which also have great commercial potential in the field of fracture characterization. The third objective is to conduct a number of field case studies to validate the trace analysis approach and to determine under what circumstances it is beneficial to incorporate laser-scanning technologies into the approach.\r\n\r\nKnowledge of geologic discontinuities is important for a number of industries. Current technologies have resulted in either millions of dollars in damage due to a missed fracture or costly reinforcement where it was not needed because of a misinterpreted discontinuity. Important end-users of the technology proffered by Split Engineering LLC, referred to as the trace analysis technology, are the mining and geotechnical industries. The capability fits in especially well with the need to automate certain rock characterization tasks and incorporate the resulting information into the mining process. If the project is successful in developing improvements in fracture system characterization, benefits for the petroleum and environmental industry are also plausible.",
