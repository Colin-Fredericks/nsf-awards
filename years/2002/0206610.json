 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nTo understand the genetic and developmental bases of naturally-occurring\r\norganismal variation is to understand the raw material of evolution itself.\r\nNatural variation in seed coat morphology will be genetically and\r\ndevelopmentally dissected in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  A\r\nthorough description of seed coat development for a reference strain (this\r\nis the most commonly-used among many available strains) of Arabidopsis will\r\nbe completed and will serve as the standard to which the development and\r\nunderlying genetics of both chemically-induced and naturally-occurring\r\n(field-collected) mutants will be compared.  Both artificial and natural\r\nmutants will be developmentally characterized and genetically mapped.  These\r\ndata, in addition to traditional complementation tests (crossing individuals\r\nand analyzing their progeny), will be utilized to identify the number of\r\nloci affecting variation in this developmental pathway and the frequency and\r\norigins of natural seed coat variation.\r\n\r\nThe seed coat serves as the interface between the plant embryo and its\r\nenvironment and  its roles are many and varied.  This relatively simple, yet\r\nhighly differentiated structure provides a unique opportunity to investigate\r\nevolutionarily important issues and the potential to identify genes\r\nresponsible for the development of a commercially important organ\r\nresponsible for such crops as cotton fiber and mucilage, (e.g., Metamucil).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
