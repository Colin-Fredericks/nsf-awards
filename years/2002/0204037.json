 "awd_abstract_narration": "0204037\r\nKhapalov \r\n\r\nIn the modeling of controlled distributed parameter systems \"additive\" \r\nboundary and internal locally distributed controls are typically used. \r\n(Examples of such controls can be a source in a heat/mass-transfer process \r\nor a piezoceramic actuator placed on a beam.) In terms of applications it \r\nappears that such controls can adequately model only those controlled \r\nprocesses that do not change their principal physical characteristics due to \r\nthe control actions. They rather describe the effect of various externally \r\nadded \"alien\" sources and/or forces on the process at hand. This \r\nlimitation, however, excludes a vast array of new and not quite new \r\ntechnologies, such as, for example, \"smart materials\" and numerous \r\nbiomedical, chemical and nuclear chain reactions, which are able to \r\nchange their principal parameters under certain purposefully induced \r\nconditions (\"catalysts\").\r\n\r\nThe intent of this proposal is to address the just-outlined issues in the \r\ncontext of global controllability of semilinear partial differential equations \r\n(PDEs) through the introduction and study of multiplicative (or \"bilinear\") \r\ncontrols. These controls enter the system equations as coefficients. \r\nAccordingly they can change at least some of the principal parameters of \r\nthe process at hand, such as, for example, the natural frequency response \r\nof a beam or the rate of a chemical reaction. (In the former case this can be \r\ncaused, e.g., by the embedded \"smart\" alloys and, in the latter case, by \r\nvarious catalysts and/or by the speed at which the reaction ingredients are \r\nmechanically mixed.) The focus of this proposal is on the development of \r\na new methodology for the study of global controllability of the semilinear \r\nreaction-diffusion-convection equation and of the wave and beam \r\nequations in the framework of bilinear controls. We are particularly \r\ninterested in the effect such multiplicative controls may have on the issue \r\nof controllability of highly nonlinear PDEs, in which case the classical \r\nadditive controls often appear to be inadequate. \r\n",
