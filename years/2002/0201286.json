 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies applications of algebraic geometry to \r\ncoding theory.  In this proposal, the investigator focuses on \r\nproblems relating semigroups and algebraic geometry codes.  This \r\ninvolves exploring connections between Weierstrass semigroups of \r\nm-tuples of points on a curve and algebraic geometry codes formed \r\nusing these m points.  The first aim of this project is to better \r\nunderstand the structure of Weierstrass semigroups of m-tuples of \r\npoints on certain curves over finite fields.  The second goal is \r\nto apply this knowledge to improve bounds on the minimum distances \r\nof codes constructed using these curves as well as arbitrary \r\ncurves over finite fields.  This builds on the investigator's \r\nprevious work showing that Weierstrass semigroups of pairs of \r\npoints can be used to construct algebraic geometry codes with \r\nparameters exceeding the usual lower bounds.   These codes, \r\nconstructed using two points on a curve, have better parameters \r\nthan any comparable code constructed using a single point on the \r\nsame curve.  Thus, in the third component of this project, the \r\ninvestigator compares codes constructed using m points on a curve \r\nto those constructed using fewer than m points.  In addition to \r\nthese topics, this project includes a focus on semigroups used in \r\ndecoding algorithms for algebraic geometry codes.   \r\n\r\nError-correcting codes are used to ensure reliable transfer of \r\ninformation across noisy communication channels by detecting \r\nand correcting errors.  Such codes are found in a wide range of \r\ndevices, from computing equipment to cellular telephones to \r\ncompact disc players.  For practical applications, codes should \r\nbe efficient and correct as many errors as possible.  While there \r\nare many ways to construct codes, one of the most promising uses \r\ntools from algebraic geometry.  In particular, curves over finite \r\nfields are used to define error-correcting codes, called algebraic \r\ngeometry codes.  One can gain information about these codes by \r\nstudying the curves used to define them.  In this proposal, the \r\ninvestigator examines curves commonly used to define algebraic \r\ngeometry codes by studying semigroups associated with the curves.  \r\nThis knowledge is then applied to obtain better estimates of the \r\nefficiency and error-correcting capabilities of the corresponding \r\ncodes.  In addition, the investigator pursues applications of \r\nsemigroups to the process of decoding algebraic geometry codes.     \r\n\r\n",
