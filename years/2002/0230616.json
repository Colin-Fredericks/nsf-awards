This new model would structure courses, laboratory experiences, and optional summer programs to enhance and augment the standard departmental engineering curricula offered .The planning process would include the evaluation of courses, faculty, and facility resource requirements to more extensively integrate research into the engineering curriculum.\r\n\r\nMainly graduate students participate in the more complete research pedagogy to become more advanced critical thinkers (scholars), and through the collaborative learning process grow as role models (advisors). Even for graduate students the research process is taught on a one to one basis, with little, if any, formal course work that transforms the content of research as a process to teach creative thinking, experimental design and interpretation, grant writing, reporting and mentoring into the context of the engineering curriculum. Properly taught, research should engage the teaching and research faculty to apply collaborative, active learning techniques to teach a student how to select a research topic, to generate a hypothesis to test, to procure funding, to collaboratively design and implement an experiment, to analyze the data, and to justify to their peers the results.\r\n",
