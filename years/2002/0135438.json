 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across the country, the last two decades have witnessed an increasing emphasis on biotechnology as an engine for state and national economic development. Within the last two years, the amount of federal, state, and industry funding, media attention, and public expectation focused on this issue at Missouri's public Research I university has exploded. The combination of the culture of academic science, the economic development goals of the state, and the proprietary needs of industry may create a lively stew of potentially conflicting value orientations around this initiative. Within this confluence of changing expectations and values, the next generation of academic life scientists is being socialized into their research roles. This dissertation research project will address the ethical implications these changes may have for these doctoral students. Qualitative research methods will be used to ascertain student's perceptions regarding the existence of the biotechnology initiative, the norms of research, the training they have received in research ethics, and the possible impact of changing expectations on their career plans. The results of this study will be shared with a variety of audiences who are struggling with new ethical issues and conflicts associated with changing expectations and modes of support in academic research.\r\n",
