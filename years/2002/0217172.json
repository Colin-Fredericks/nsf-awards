 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing a Women Interested in Mathematics and Science Advancement (WIMSA) Network in a Rural Community\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen's deeply ingrained negative perceptions of science and mathematics are directly\r\nlinked to their underrepresentation in these and related fields (Gottfried, 1993). The goal \r\nof our project is to increase the participation of women from rural communities in the \r\nfields of science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET). To achieve our goal, \r\nwe will initiate a program that involves women throughout the community in a sustained\r\nnetwork of support. This is an exciting, complex, long-term project. This proposal is for\r\na PGE Demonstration Planning Grant, which will enable us to prepare a strong, comprehensive\r\nproposal for a full PGE Demonstration Grant. Our full grant will address the inequities \r\nexperienced by girls, particularly in low-tech rural areas. The full grant will be used to \r\ncreate a program, called Women Interested in Mathematics and Science Advancement\r\n(WIMSA). The WIMSA program will consist of a network of people and organizations, \r\nall with the goal of increasing the participation and success of females in mathematics \r\nand science. The full proposal will address recruitment of WIMSA network members, \r\nsustaining their membership, and expanding the WIMSA program. The PGE Demonstration\r\nPlanning project will focus on the design of all aspects of the WIMSA program.\r\n\r\nOne of the two main planning grant objectives will be to design our pilot project, the \r\nannual WIMSA Summer Program (WSP) for middle school girls, which will have the dual \r\npurpose ofbeing the initial impetus to bring people into the WIMSA network, and of \r\nincreasing the skill level of middle school girls and teachers. A planning committee,\r\nconsisting of two K-12 teachers, two college students, and the two Principal \r\nInvestigators, will be formed to develop the summer program. The committee will\r\ndetermine the size and scope of the program, design program activities and curriculum, \r\nand will collaborate with community organizations regarding WSP field activities. \r\nThe program design will build on the successes of other SMET intervention programs \r\nfor women across the country.\r\n\r\nOur other main planning grant objective will be to design the WIMSA network connections \r\nand activities. We envision this network bringing together Mesa State faculty and students,\r\nK-12 teachers and students, private businesses, government organizations, educational\r\nassociations, community leaders and any local programs involved with science and\r\nmathematics. Our first activity will be a WIMSA kickoff meeting, hosted by Mesa State,\r\nwhich will include people from all target organizations and will introduce them to the\r\nWIMSA concept. We will create a WISMA Advisory Board that will oversee all aspects \r\nof the WIMSA project, including writing the full PGE Demonstration Grant. We will \r\ndesign college courses to provide ongoing SMET activities and training for WIMSA \r\nmembers, including a graduate credit component for K-12 teachers. We will \r\ncollaborate with local businesses and professionals to design activities for the\r\nWSP, internship opportunities for WIMSA college students, job-shadowing opportunities \r\nfor K-12 students, and presentation opportunities at Mesa State. In order to sustain \r\nsuch relationshipsand collaborations, there will be WIMSA meetings at least three\r\ntimes per year. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are no programs in our area addressing the lack of females in SMET fields, \r\nthere are programs and organizations committed to improving our community, and many\r\npeople who wish to make a difference. The WIMSA program will provide an incredible \r\nopportunity to harness and coordinate these resources and create a \r\nvery effective program that will have long-ranging impact.\r\n",
