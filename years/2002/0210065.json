 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will be used to develop non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation as a\r\nmethod for providing nucleation-on-demand, for controlling crystal structure, and for\r\nimproving the current understanding of nucleation from solution. The basis of this\r\ntechnique is the discovery, made by the PIs several years ago, that intense near-infrared\r\nlaser pulses could induce crystallization in aged supersaturated solutions of small organic\r\nmolecules. In cases studied so far, laser-induced nucleation enhances the rate of\r\nnucleation by a factor of 10 13 . Even more intriguing is the case of aqueous glycine,\r\nwhich crystallizes into two different polymorphs depending on the laser polarization state\r\n(linear vs. circular), which implicates the optical electric field as being responsible for the\r\nphenomenon. This \"polarization switching\" of polymorphs represents a clean method for\r\ncontrolling crystal structure. It is hypothesized that the oscillating electric field of the\r\nlight is aligning solute molecules in a pre-nucleating cluster, aiding its organization into a\r\nparticular crystal structure. The method also has the potential of creating new\r\npolymorphs of some substances. New polymorphs constitute novel materials that may\r\nhave important industrial applications.\r\n\r\nOver the next three years the PIs propose to gain a better understanding of the mechanism\r\nof non-photochemical laser-induced nucleation, by systematically studying its\r\ndependence on illumination parameters such as intensity, wavelength, laser pulse width\r\nand polarization state. With the same goal, they will also explore the effect of a strong\r\nstatic electric field on supersaturated solutions. Other experiments would focus on\r\nscreening a large number of solvent/solute systems, as well as melts, to correlate the form\r\nof the inducing electric field to the crystal structure that is induced. Such screening\r\nwould also include a search for new polymorphs.\r\n",
