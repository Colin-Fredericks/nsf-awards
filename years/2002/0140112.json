Nagy Dilation Theorem, which models a contraction\r\noperator on Hilbert space as the adjoint of an isometry \r\nrestricted to an invariant subspace has had a profound \r\ninfluence on operator theory and its  applications.  The \r\nexistence of the Agler boundary for families of \r\nrepresentations and of boundary representations \r\n(not necessarily irreducible) and the C-star envelope \r\nfor operator algebras are abstract generalizations of \r\nthe Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem which naturally encode \r\nPick interpolation and in many cases commutant lifting. \r\nThey also provide a  natural setting for versions of \r\nBeurling's theorem.  The Agler boundary and C-star envelope \r\nhave been explicitly computed for the families of \r\ncompletely contractive representations of the algebra of \r\nmultipliers of  symmetric Fock space, the algebra \r\nof multipliers of the  Dirichlet space,  as well as \r\nquotients of the disc and annulus  algebra. The PI will \r\ninvestigate situations in which strong versions of Pick \r\ninterpolation, Beurling's theorem, and commutant lifting\r\nhold as a function of the complexity of the corresponding\r\nAgler boundary and C-star envelope. The investigation \r\nwill make contact with function theory, special functions, \r\ndifferential equations, and the general theory of operator \r\nalgebras. Thre are also plans to continue studying\r\nfactorization of polynomials in several non-commuting \r\nvariables pursuing the theme that one-variable results\r\nmost naturally generalize to the non-commutative setting.\r\n\r\nOperator theory has a history of rich interplay with \r\nengineering and physics as well as other vital areas of \r\nmathematics including complex function theory and algebraic \r\ngeometry. Originally developed as a tool to study integral \r\nand differential equations arising in physics,  operator theory, \r\noperator algebras, and operator systems play an important role \r\nin modern quantum physics. Four fundamental themes in operator \r\ntheory, Sz.-Nagy dilation, Pick interpolation,  commutant \r\nlifting, and Beurling's theorem are now basic technology in \r\nsystems theory which in turn has important applications in image \r\nprocessing and control theory - the mathematics behind automatic \r\ncontrollers such as autopilots. A major emphasis in the proposed \r\nwork is generalizations of these themes with a view toward \r\napplications to systems theory, control theory, operator algebras, \r\nand function theory. McCullough will also study factorization \r\nproblems for polynomials in several non-commuting variables. \r\n(Here xy may not equal yx.) This investigation is\r\nexpected to make connection with non-commutative algebraic \r\ngeometry and  Linear Matrix Inequalities or LMI's which \r\nfrequently arise in engineering applications.\r\n\r\n",
