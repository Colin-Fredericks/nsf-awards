 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Gretz 0231109\r\n\r\nAn award was granted Dr Gretz of Michigan Technical University to develop a workshop on Modern Instrumentation Methods to be held during the 2002 Botanical Society of America national meeting. The tools scientists use define the science that they are capable of performing to a larger degree today than ever before. Knowledge of sophisticated, computer integrated instrumentation is essential for the modern biologist. The next generation of biologists must become familiar with modern tools such as remote sensing instruments, genomic/proteomic technologies and modern imaging methods to be well-trained and productive. The Modern Methods Workshop will be held in August 2002 in Madison,Wisconsin in conjunction with Botany 2002, a joint meeting of several national scientific organizations, at which 1500 participants are expected. This workshop will provide participants direct experience with current methodologies in such diverse areas as aquatic robotics, remote sensing, molecular biology and advanced microscopy. The format is four 2-3 hour sessions spread over a day. The workshop is designed to provide the opportunity for scientists to learn about techniques outside of their field of interest at a level of complexity sufficient to encourage technology transfer between disciplines. Student participation is encouraged through travel and subsistence awards to qualified students.\r\n",
