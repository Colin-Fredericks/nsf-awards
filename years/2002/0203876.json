Kaiser, Columbia University\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project investigates wide-area publish/subscribe event system models and architectures.  The focus is on two new models called Smart Events and Active Events, and an event bus architecture called Virtual Private Event Networks (VPENs).\r\n\r\nSmart events are associated with a structural type model (a grammar or schema), and a semantic model that defines the processing to be performed on the structural subcomponents.  Smart events are routed via content-based messaging, where subscriptions may specify complex patterns indicating the events of interest. Active events include their semantic model directly as mobile code. Active events operate as\r\nmobile agents transported (conceptually) under their own power point-to-point.  Smart events may optionally include active event substructures, enabling content-based messaging to be applied to this subset of active events.\r\n\r\nVPENs extend multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) protocols and mechanisms to the application layer, to improve the performance of content-based routing by preplanning label switched paths when publisher advertisements as well as consumer subscriptions are available.  VPENs also add encryption-based security and privacy in the style of virtual private networks (VPNs).\r\n",
