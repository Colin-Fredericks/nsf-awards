 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues focus on several\r\nfundamental computational issues involved in the parallel\r\nimplicit solution of optimization problems with partial\r\ndifferential equation  The goal of the research is to advance the\r\nstate of the art in four fundamental topics: (1) the formulation\r\nand analysis of algorithms for large-scale optimization; (2)\r\nadaptive mesh generation for partial differential equations; (3)\r\nmultilevel partial differential equation solvers; and (4)\r\nparallel computation.  Although each of these topics can be\r\ninvestigated in isolation, the exploitation of their interactions\r\nis crucial for the creation of effective global algorithms.  The\r\ninvestigators are members of a Scientific Computation Group that\r\noffers a program of instruction and research emphasizing the role\r\nof scientific computation in the formulation, modeling, and\r\nsolution of problems from diverse and changing areas.  A major\r\npart of the project involves the development of software and its\r\ndissemination within the manufacturing, engineering, and\r\nscientific community.  Software developed as part of the project\r\nprovides an effective method of technology transfer and extends\r\nthe scope and effectiveness of the existing codes PLTMG, MC, and\r\nSNOPT developed by the investigators.\r\n     Because partial differential equations conveniently\r\ncharacterize the physical laws of many complex systems occurring\r\nin science and engineering, they also lie at the heart of the\r\nmathematical models used to simulate and predict the behavior of\r\nthese systems.  The need to optimize the performance of such\r\nsystems is the common feature of practical applications that\r\nrange over such diverse areas as the optimal design of the hull\r\nof an America's Cup yacht, the cleanup of toxic waste sites, the\r\nconstruction of bioartificial arteries in tissue engineering, and\r\nthe management of stock portfolios and hedge funds.  Software\r\ndeveloped in this project provides engineers and scientists with\r\ninstant access to state-of-the-art methods for the modeling and\r\noptimization of complex systems involving partial differential\r\nequation constraints.  The resulting improvements in the\r\nefficiency, accuracy and robustness of these models have a\r\nsubstantial impact in areas of manufacturing and engineering that\r\nare vital to US global competitiveness.\r\n",
