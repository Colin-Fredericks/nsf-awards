 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award.  Computer access by means of augmentative and alternative communication can be an extremely valuable assistive technology for the disabled.  This project seeks to improve its efficiency and to develop accurate models of  the performance of individuals with disabilities when using computer access.  As an educational tool, an accurate modeling method would provide clinicians with insight into how specific disabilities affect an individual's ability to operate different kinds of devices.  As an assessment tool, an accurate model would allow a clinician to identify potential devices and device configurations that are most likely to be successful for a particular client.  The modeling technique will be used in a theoretical and empirical study to determine the most efficient method for representing language within an augmentative and alternative communication device.  A software tool will also be developed that allows clinicians to incorporate the user modeling technique into their existing clinical processes.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award recognizes and supports the early career-development activities of a teacher-scholar who is likely to become an academic leader of the twenty-first century.  The research project will develop science and technology needed to maximize the benefit of computers for disabled people, thereby allowing them to lead more productive and fulfilling lives.  The educational component will give graduate and undergraduate students the opportunity to become involved in both fundamental research and clinical application in the areas of human-machine interfaces and assistive technology for the disabled.\r\n",
