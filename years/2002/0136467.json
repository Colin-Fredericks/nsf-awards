Recently, some scholars have\r\nfocused on the existence of a \"glass ceiling\"  that impedes upward career mobility\r\nfor new immigrants in science and engineering (S&E). Most studies have yet to explore\r\nthe complexities/contradictions associated with the presence and experiences of new\r\nimmigrants in S&E occupations.\r\n\r\nThis project is a qualitative-quantitative study on the situation and experiences\r\nof foreign-born scientists/engineers from India in the United States. It focuses on the\r\nextent to which they are professionally successful and/or face institutional barriers with\r\nrespect to reward, recognition, and promotion in S&E organizations.  Attention to foreign-born scientists/engineers from India makes sense for many reasons.  First, they are increasingly present in the S&E workforce of the U.S..  Second, there is\r\nlittle scholarly work on the experiences and impacts of Indian scientists/engineers in the\r\nU.S..  Third, foreign-born Indians have made vast strides in education and employment in comparison to other ethnic minorities in the U.S.  Fourth, many cultural arguments (such as occupational preferences and linguistic abilities) for the lack of mobility in positions of authority and decision-making are not clear-cut for Indian scientists/engineers.  And fifth, many structural arguments for facing the glass ceiling, such as racial prejudice, may overlook other factors such as the existence of a \"good old boy\" network in S&E organizations.\r\n\r\nResearch methods include in-depth interviews to acquire primary data on the subject; collection of quantitative data;  examination of relevant literature. Attention is focused on two sets of subjects: foreign-born Indians holding master and doctorate degrees in S&E disciplines and their American colleagues, department chairs, and managers.  Subjects are drawn from  two industrial labs, two national labs, and three academic institutions.\r\n\r\nThe findings of this project help illuminate the potential contributions of Indian scientists/engineers in the future, as well as efforts to manage diversity, fairness and equality issues.  The project aims to develop a theory about the behavior of scientists and engineers from India, as well as to help shape future policies. Research findings are likely to raise questions and foster discussion about the purported objectivity in evaluation and promotion.  \r\n",
