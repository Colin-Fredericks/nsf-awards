 "awd_abstract_narration": "This four-year project increases educational opportunities at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) for low-income, academically talented students by providing scholarships and supplemental academic and student support services for 36 full-time students in bachelor's degree programs in computer science (CMSC), mathematics and statistics (MATH), chemical engineering (ENCH), mechanical engineering (ENME), computer engineering (CMPE), and information systems (IFSM). Support services include peer mentoring, faculty advisement, tutoring, a one-week summer orientation and career identification experience, and informal learning opportunities. This model is one that builds upon the program success of the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC) CSEMS project which began in summer 2001 and is going to provide a doorway for easy transfer for CCBC's computer science, engineering and mathematics CSEMS students to UMBC's quality four-year programs.\r\n\r\nObjectives include the recruitment, enrollment, graduation, and work placement of increased numbers of students, particularly underrepresented groups. Women are targeted as they are both underrepresented in computer science and engineering programs and over-represented in the pool of economically disadvantaged students at UMBC. The project also fosters an informal consortium relationship between UMBC and CCBC. An independent external evaluator oversees the project and provides data analysis on all measurable outcomes.\r\n",
