 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) can be found in nature\r\nin close binary systems orbiting each other. Such systems are expected\r\nto emit gravitational radiation of high frequency and therefore are\r\nthought to be excellent source candidates for the Laser Interferometer\r\nGravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) planned to become operational in\r\nthe next couple of years. Theoretical studies of such astrophysical\r\nsources of gravitational waves will be undertaken by the PI and a\r\npostdoctoral fellow, and a number of questions will be addressed:  \r\n(A) what is the predicted frequency with which binary compact objects of\r\ninterest form in our Galaxy and out to extragalactic distances, what\r\nare the uncertainties of these predictions, and what do they imply\r\nabout gravitational-wave detection, (B) what are the physical\r\nproperties of these binaries (e.g., masses, eccentricities, spins,\r\nvelocities) and how can gravitational-wave data analysis methods be\r\noptimized for their detection.\r\n\r\nUndoubted confirmation of the existence of gravitational waves as\r\nfundamentally predicted by the theory of general relativity can be\r\nprovided only by their direct detection, expected by observatories such\r\nas LIGO. The detectability of binary compact objects depends on a\r\nnumber of factors related both to the astrophysical properties of the\r\nsources and the capabilities of the observatory. The research described\r\nabove will contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the\r\nmost promising gravitational-wave sources, optimize the relevant data\r\nanalysis methods, and therefore improve the detectability prospects for\r\nLIGO.",
