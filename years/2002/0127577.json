 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy (11) This project expands development of data-driven interactive exercises and\r\nsimulations for use in a collaborative learning environment to cover virtually all topic\r\nareas in introductory Astronomy. The motivation is to a) use the naturally engaging\r\ncharacter of Astronomy as a vehicle to promote science literacy by integrating research\r\ninto the curriculum to transform the passive lecture mode into an active learning system\r\nthat emphasizes scientific process and methodology, b) explicitly create a collaborative\r\nlearning environment where student teams solve problems and analyze data and c) offer a\r\nmore engaging interface to science learning so that it becomes an effective recruiting tool\r\nfor future K-12 science teachers. These goals can be accomplished by the development of\r\nrobust software, based on real astronomical data sets, that runs in the Web browser\r\nenvironment. Previous work by the team on this project has already produced some of these learning tools.\r\nAssessment and evaluation of that effort shows that the methodology is sound.\r\nNew objectives will be accomplished via further software development and beta-testing\r\nin local classes. This will involve approximately 700 students\r\nannually on four different campuses. The overall goals of this effort are for the students\r\nto be exposed to science methodology by engaging them in the actual practice of science\r\nand for them to develop excellent collaboration skills. These outcomes will serve the\r\nstudents far better than the traditional mode of rote memorization of syllabus-driven\r\nmaterial that currently constitutes the pedagogy.",
