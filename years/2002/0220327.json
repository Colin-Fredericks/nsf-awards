 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project proposes to formulate methods for representing and analyzing random\r\nheterogeneous materials in three directions. First, general probabilistic models are developed\r\nfor the microstructure of cement based composites with carbon fibers. The models\r\nare random fields characterizing the geometrical, mechanical, and electrical properties of the\r\nmaterial constituents. These cement based composites have an interesting microstructure,\r\nand are used in both mechanics and electronics as sensors of mechanical properties. Second,\r\na computational environment is developed for calculating the evolution in time of the\r\nproperties of microstructures subjected to deterministic loads. Finite element procedures\r\nare used to calculate changes in, for example, the stress, strain, damage and electric fields\r\nin cement based composite specimens generated from their probabilistic models. Development\r\nof the finite element code entails advances in numerical solver techniques as well as\r\nformulation of new mathematically sound traction-displacment relationships to model cohesive\r\nfracture. Third, the results of the finite element analyses are used to (i) update\r\nthe probabilistic models of the material microstructure so they reflect the current damage\r\nstate and (ii) develop macroscopic damage models for cement based composites by using\r\nhomogenization procedures.\r\nThe evolution of the material state is monitored by a mathematical object, referred\r\nto as digital material (DM), that defines uniquely the state of the microstructure at any\r\ntime during loading and can be stored in the computer. The results of the analytical and\r\nnumerical developments are validated against experimental tests providing information of\r\nthe properties of the fiber matrix interaction and on the dependence of electric conductivity\r\nof macroscopic specimens on their damage state.\r\nThe main outcome of the project is a novel methodology for predicting structural behavior\r\nof composite materials and for designing materials with better structural properties\r\nand better capabilities for sensing damage and strain. Other outcomes include new finite\r\nelement codes, new mathematical models, and a strong educational outreach program.",
