 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is summarizing and synthesizing publications in education and engineering journals about peer assessment and student collaborative learning processes in undergraduate engineering courses. The project is stimulated by the requirements of ABET (The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) that undergraduate engineers engage in cooperative learning experiences and practice reviewing each other's work. Drawing on published research on the influence of peer assessment methods, this project is blending the perspectives of educational psychology, educational measurement, learning design, and engineering education into a review and synthesis of that literature. The practice of peer assessment in engineering classrooms is formative rather than summative assessment, and thus has the potential to improve the learning process of students. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
