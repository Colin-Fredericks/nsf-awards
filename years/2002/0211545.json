 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Robert West, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is exploring mulitply-bonded and low-coordinate compounds of silicon and germanium. Professor West synthesizes new types of organosilicon and organogermanium compounds containing multiple bonds, including silynes (RSiCR'), germynes (RGeCR'), 1,3-disilaallenes (R2Si=C=SiR2), 1,3-digermaallenes (R2Ge=C=GeR2), polysilyne polymers [(RSi=CR')n], and silafullerenes such as C58Si2. He then studies the chemical reactions of these unusual molecules, including their activity as polymerization catalysts and as precursors to stable silylenium ions, and their halophilic reactions.\r\n\r\nAlthough our understanding of the chemistry of compounds containing carbon has become quite sophisticated, the chemistry of carbon's closely related relatives, silicon and germanium, is comparatively undeveloped. Professor Robert West, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is studying the synthesis and reaction chemistry of a series of compounds in which one or more carbon atoms are replaced by silicon or germanium. These studies are of fundamental importance in developing our understanding of the chemistry of the other elements in the periodic table. In addition, the unusual structures of Professor West's target compounds promise potential advances in practical reaction chemistry, including polymerization reactions.",
