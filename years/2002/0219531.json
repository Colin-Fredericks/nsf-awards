 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explosive demand for communication services, fueled by the\r\nrapid growth in the areas of mobile communications and the\r\nInternet, has generated and will continue to generate immense\r\nresearch efforts in the area of wideband wired/wireless\r\ncommunications. To accommodate the demanding future applications,\r\nsystems must be designed to perform joint equalization, detection,\r\ndecoding and estimation of the unknown and possibly time varying\r\nchannel parameters, while maintaining reasonable complexity (and\r\nlow cost). Motivated by these requirements, and using an OFDM\r\nindoor wireless system as a design example, two main directions\r\nare investigated in this project.\r\n\r\nIn the first direction, receiver algorithms are designed for\r\niterative, joint equalization, detection and decoding, that\r\naddress the critical issues mentioned above. The investigation\r\nstarts by identifying a powerful model that encompasses all the\r\nsalient features of the OFDM transmission system. Data detection\r\nin OFDM is then stated as a problem of two-dimensional (2D) data\r\ndetection in the presence of localized, 2D intersymbol\r\ninterference, non-linear distortion, and unknown and time varying\r\nparameters. We then identify fast, joint data detection and\r\nchannel estimation schemes which are utilized as building blocks\r\nfor powerful adaptive iterative detection receivers. Unlike the\r\nentire iterative receiver, these sub-blocks are optimal in a\r\nprecisely defined sense, and can be implemented with\r\nless-than-exponential complexity with respect to the data sequence\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe second direction is the development of a unified framework for\r\nthe analysis of the transient and steady-state behavior of\r\nadaptive iterative algorithms. In the proposed study, the receiver\r\nis assumed to have no explicit knowledge about the channel\r\nparameters, other than their statistical description. The minimum\r\nsignal-to-noise ratio required for convergence to error-free\r\ntransmission, and the optimal allocation of power in pilot and\r\ncoded symbols, are some of the issues that are investigated for a\r\nwide variety of adaptive iterative receiver architectures.\r\nRegarding propagation modeling for the indoor environment, the\r\napproach followed herein is a direct divergence from the classical\r\napproaches that include either measurements, or the\r\nwell-established ray-tracing techniques. In particular, ultra-fast\r\nalgorithms for the numerical solution of the electromagnetic\r\nproblem are developed. These algorithms result in almost exact\r\nsolutions that can be evaluated with complexity comparable to the\r\nless accurate ray-tracing techniques.",
