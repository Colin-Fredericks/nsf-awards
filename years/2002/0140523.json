 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal highlights the role of the Hardy-Littlewood \r\n(circle) method as a flexible tool that underpins progress \r\nin many areas of mathematics intersecting with number theory.\r\n The proposer intends to pursue a number of investigations \r\nthat illustrate this intersubdisciplinary aspect of the method, \r\nconcentrating on applications in arithmetic geometry and \r\ncombinatorics. First, the researcher constructs a large class\r\n of examples of algebraic varieties, of relatively small \r\ndimension in terms of their degree, that may be studied by \r\nmeans of the circle method. Questions concerning the density \r\nof rational points and weak approximation should be accessible,\r\nthe intention being to shed light on conjectures of Manin and\r\nothers. In a second direction, the proposer applies results \r\nfrom the modern theory of diophantine approximation in order \r\nto refine Gower's recent explicit version of Szemeredi's \r\ntheorem. In a more traditional line of enquiry, the researcher\r\ninvestigates the distribution of the number of \r\nrepresentations of integers as sums of powers. The latter work \r\nenables higher moments than the traditional mean square to be \r\nconsidered, leading to multidimensional applications of \r\npreviously inaccessible type.\r\n\r\nNumber Theory studies the properties of integers (``whole \r\nnumbers''). Since antiquity, the study of diophantine equations \r\n(equations to be solved in integers) has formed a core component \r\nof Number Theory, and has recently influenced the development of \r\ncodes and cryptosystems (applied, for example, in data storage \r\nsystems such as compact disks and DVDs, communications systems and \r\nbanking security). The investigation of moment problems is a \r\nfundamental topic for Fourier analysis, which in the larger setting \r\nplays a crucial role in electrical engineering and communications.  \r\nThe circle method, in its modern incarnations, provides a mechanism \r\nfor transferring technology from one of these areas to another, \r\nand this proposal pursues basic research that facilitates such transfers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
