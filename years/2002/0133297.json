 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research described here addresses information security issues for distributed networks and embedded environments.  Embedded applications are found in a vast array of existing and emerging technologies, including mobile phones, personal digital assistants, smart cards, and remote-controlled utility network devices and are distinguished from typical (but far less prevalent) PC-level microprocessors in their relatively low power consumption and inherent limitations on memory and speed.                                                                                                                                                 It is predicted that the number of applications with embedded microprocessors which will be connected to our telephone and computer networks will increase dramatically over the next few years.  For instance, it is anticipated that within the next few years, 50% of all Internet end-devices will have to operate in constrained environments.  At the same time, these networks are enabling remote access to, and manipulation of, sensitive resources of all sorts, including bank records, medical information, alarm system, and industrial machinery.                                                                         The need is clear for long-term planning and directed research in the area of cryptographic security for these devices. However, cryptography has only recently evolved from a discipline confined to the special interest of a small, closed community to become a practical and vital tool to enable a secure communications and information infrastructure. As a consequence, the acceptance of cryptography as an engineering discipline is still in its early stages.  The US industry is already experiencing a shortage of \"crypto engineers\".  This negative trend is expected to continue, unless serious actions are taken for the education of crypto engineers.                                                                      The researchers propose an integrated solution for the research and education problems in perspective.  To contribute solutions to the security problems in distributed networks, the research will  focus on the hardware implementations of public and secret key algorithms with challenging new requirements.  The long-term ambition of this research is to bring cryptographic security solutions to the market which are flexible, low-cost, highly scalable, and power efficient.  The researchers  believe that this research will provide graduate and undergraduate students the perfect educational setting to explore solid engineering practices of cryptography.  A rigorous cryptography curriculum introduced  at the undergraduate level, enriched with international collaborations, and cutting edge research will create skilled crypto engineers, that will be essential in the future development of secured infrastructures.",
