 "awd_abstract_narration": "0223985  Graedel  This MUSES incubation project will convene an expert workshop to explore data needs and model formulation approaches for the steel-related elements.  Materials budgeting is a technique that, in principal, can provide information useful for studies of resource availability, potential environmental impacts, and policy options.  Though data for steel are relatively accessible, this is not necessarily the case for its common alloying metals, a group that includes silicon, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten.  The amounts of steel used are so large that, for these alloying elements, their cycles are dominated by their use a small-percentage alloying elements.  To understand the interrelationships, and to predict the usage and availability of these elements in the future, detailed dynamic models that couple resource economics, potential technological evolution, and use and recycling strategies will be necessary.\r\nThe workshop will draw participants from a broad geographic spectrum, and will explore available data archives, information networks, and partnerships among academia and between academia and industry.  Graduate students will be used a focus group reporters, both to ensure a detailed record of the workshop and to expose them to a group of participants of international stature.\r\nFollowing the workshop, a scientific programmer, under the guidance of the principal investigators, will begin the implementation of the concepts developed at the workshop.  The workshop report and the preliminary model construction are expected to be the basis for more comprehensive research on iron alloying element cycles in the future.\r\n",
