 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop the technology necessary to produce low-power, low-noise VLSI amplifiers for large-scale neural recording applications. Although there are many emerging multi-electrode arrays for neuroscience and neuroprosthetic recording applications, these arrays are practically limited by wiring densities and percutaneous connections. In order for chonic neural recording applications to achieve electrode densities in the 100 to 1000 electrode range, implantable amplifier, signal processing, and multiplexing circuitry will be required. The existing VLSI technology available for microelectrode recording is inadequate to create implantable amplifier systems with this number of channels. These types of implantable amplifier systems will also be necessary for emerging clinical neuroprosthetic applications that will require chronic recording from large numbers of neurons in the brain. In this Phase I project, novel CMOS techniques will be developed for producing the necessary high-density, low-power amplifier elements. In the follow on Phase II project, these techniques will be integrated and fully developed into implantable amplifier systems for neuroscience and neuroprosthetic research. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of biomedical device and instrumentation.  The implantable biopotential amplifier systems produced in this project will be directly marketed to neuroscience researchers for use with high-density microelectrode arrays. The technology will also be used in the development of clinical neuroprosthetic applications.",
