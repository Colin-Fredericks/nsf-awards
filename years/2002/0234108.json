The Summer Institute, hosted jointly by the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) and The Wellman Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), is designed in accordance with the following objectives:\r\n\r\n\tTo introduce students to the interdisciplinary nature of bioengineering research\r\n\tTo introduce students to the technologies associated with Biomedical Optics and provide an understanding of its strengths and limitations\r\n\tTo introduce students to current and envisioned biological and medical applications of Biomedical Optics\r\n\r\nThe didactic program is based on HST and MGH/Wellman program elements that are already in place, and will provide the students with both depth in biomedical optics, and breadth in bioengineering more generally. These include:\r\n\r\n\tA formal course on biomedical optics\r\n\tTutorial lectures on the role of light in medicine and biology\r\n\tAn ongoing research lecture series on in Photomedicine\r\n\tAn ongoing seminar series by the Center for Integration of Medicine & Innovative Technology (CIMIT), which deals more broadly with the use of bioengineering techniques ranging from tissue engineering to image-guided therapy, and will provide a broad view of current research at sites both inside and beyond MGH.\r\n\tWeekly meetings of the research groups into which students are placed.\r\n\tA research skills module designed to help students plan their research and communicate their results orally and in writing.\r\n\tBioethics module designed to teach students to identify the ethical considerations of their research.\r\n\r\nStudents in the program will work on research projects in the following areas:\r\n\r\n\tPhotodynamic Therapy (PDT)\r\n\tOptical Coherence Tomography\r\n\tIn vivo confocal microscopy and multi-photon microscopy\r\n\tSelective Laser targeting to treat diseases involving the retinal pigment epithelium\r\n\tDiffuse Optical Tomography imaging of stroke, hemorrhage, brain function, and breast cancer\r\n\tImproved Microscopy for Surgical Pathology\r\n\tVideo microscopy for Biological Micromechanics\r\n",
