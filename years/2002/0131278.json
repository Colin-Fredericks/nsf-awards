 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research into the structure of yeast chromosomes and the mechanisms and control of their replication and segregation continues at a rapid pace. To bring together scientists working in this area, the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) will sponsor the seventh convening of the research conference \"Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replication and Segregation\" to be held June 28-July 3, 2002, at Snowmass Village, Colorado.  The goal is to provide a forum where members of all subdisciplines studying the metabolism, structure and behavior of yeast chromosomes can meet to exchange ideas. This conference has a strong tradition of presenting primarily unpublished results and is attended by most of the leaders in the field.  Principal investigators are present for, and actively participate in, the entire meeting.  This small conference provides a good balance of students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior and senior researchers, with an informal atmosphere that contributes greatly to interactions between younger and older scientists.  \r\n\r\nThis is the only conference that is specifically devoted to this topic and brings together its diverse subdisciplines. Integration across research fields has become ever more critical, and assembling experts from separate but related fields provides a unique opportunity for the intellectual cross-fertilization, insight and understanding that can lead to discoveries beneficial to all society. \r\n\r\n",
