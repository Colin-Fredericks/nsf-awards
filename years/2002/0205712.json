 "awd_abstract_narration": "While handheld, battery-powered devices such as personal digital\r\nassistants (PDA's) and web-enabled mobile phones are emerging as new\r\naccess points to the world's digital infrastructure, their cost and\r\nshort battery life are factors that are holding back their enormous\r\npotential.  Worse yet, the cost of such devices might even widen the\r\n\"digital divide\".  This research addresses these cost and battery-life issues\r\nsimultaneously, thereby getting one step closer to a vision of ubiquitous\r\ncomputing embracing all of society.  The specific focus is the digital university\r\ncampus with wireless Internet coverage.\r\n\r\nIn this setting, the aim is to increase the utility and battery-life\r\nand decrease the cost of handheld wireless computers by enabling the\r\nuse of relatively simple hardware for the mobile devices. This research aims\r\nboth at designing embedded hardware that better conserves resources, as well as\r\ncreating a software layer that masks the limited computational prowess\r\nof a handheld device by seamlessly coupling it to a relatively high-powered\r\nstationary computational infrastructure via an \"always on\" wireless connection.\r\nBy off-loading power-intensive operations to the stationary infrastructure,\r\nthe battery-powered mobile device is provided with \"virtual power\".\r\n\r\nAdaptive just-in-time compiler technology will be developed for minimizing\r\npower use on mobile devices running mobile\r\ncode, and adaptive scheduling methods using results from the\r\nComputational Grid research community.  Depending on the algorithm to\r\nbe run on the mobile device and its current distance from the nearest\r\nbase station, the computation to be performed is to be automatically\r\npartitioned between a part to be executed in the stationary\r\ninfrastructure and another to be run on the mobile device.\r\n\r\nAt the hardware level, orchestrated resource-management strategies will be\r\ndeveloped to enable designers to correctly design and implement highly\r\nresource-constrained embedded systems while helping them to meet system-level\r\nconstraints. This requires augmenting today's functional design flows with a\r\nresource-centric view. Here, the goal is not to replace existing design methodologies\r\nwith yet another all-encompassing methodology, but rather making a cross-cutting\r\nimpact by demonstrating the applicability of results to several driving examples\r\nat different levels of abstraction, including System-on-Chip (SoC) platforms,\r\nmemory architecture level, and operating system level.\r\n",
