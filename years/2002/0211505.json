 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies systems with multiple interacting\r\ncomponents that together create rhythms.  The systems come from\r\nneural, chemical, and gene regulatory contexts.  There are two\r\nmain themes.  The first is reduction of dimensions, investigating\r\nthe circumstances under which large-dimensional models behave\r\nlike much lower-dimensional differential equations or maps.  Some\r\nof that work uses geometric singular perturbation theory to\r\ninvestigate how systems with multiple degrees of freedom\r\n\"condense\" to essentially lower-dimensional systems, at least\r\nlocally in phase space.  Another set of issues related to\r\nreduction of dimension concerns fast partial synchronization.\r\nThe second theme concerns how interaction of many components in a\r\nsystem can lead to the suppression of activity in some of the\r\ncomponents.  Two examples of this to be studied come from a\r\nchemical pattern formation and neural systems, each with some\r\ntype of global inhibitory feedback.\r\n     Systems with many separate but interacting components arise\r\nin a large variety of applications, including biotechnology,\r\nchemical engineering, and neurobiology.  In general, such systems\r\nhave a large number of degrees of freedom, and are usually\r\ninvestigated by numerical simulation.  However, simulations alone\r\ndo not provide a deep understanding of why the systems behave the\r\nway they do, or how they can be manipulated.  Reductions of\r\nequations to smaller systems can be very useful.  But without a\r\nprincipled way to do the reductions, one does not know how much\r\nof the behavior of the large system is lost.  This project\r\nconcerns methods to find such principled reductions, using\r\nmathematical tools that enable one to investigate circumstances\r\nunder which parts of the dynamics behave like that of systems\r\nwith a much smaller number of degrees of freedom.  Other tools to\r\nbe used allow one to understand how only some subset of the\r\ncomponents can be involved at a given time, even though all\r\ncomponents are coupled.  The methods are applied to problems from\r\nneural, chemical and gene regulation systems.  The project also\r\nprovides interdisciplinary training opportunities for students\r\nand postdocs.\r\n\r\n",
