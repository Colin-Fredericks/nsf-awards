 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project focuses on providing ambient power for wireless smart sensor units used for condition-based monitoring. Specifically, this project is to develop a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS)-based power-scavenging module.  Current research in the area of ambient power has established a strong foundation from which future solutions in the area of condition-based maintenance will take shape.  Research will also be performed on rare earth magnets to custom design thin permanent magnets that will produce a high-flux density in the compactly designed system.  The proposed component will provide power through the conversion of ambient machine vibration using electromagnetic induction.  Design objectives include the optimization of energy-scavenging efficiency in varying environmental conditions, operating conditions, and system types.  The proposed system uses MEMS technology to realize small dimensions (one-inch square and less than 0.5 cm. thick) and energy storage capabilities.\r\n\r\nCommercial applications include industrial machinery, vehicles, air conditioners, and refrigerators. Additional options are large markets such as building controls and manufacturing.",
