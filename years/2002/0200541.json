 "awd_abstract_narration": "Originating in the mid-1970's, Stark's Conjecture remains one of the \r\ndeepest unsolved problems in number theory. Tate's 1984 book on the sub-\r\nject provided a generation of researchers with a solid exposition of the \r\nstate of the conjecture at that time, and a foundation for further in-\r\nvestigation. Work related to the conjecture has recently grown to in-\r\nvolve more and more number theorists, but there has never been a major \r\nconference on the subject. This NSF award will provide major funding \r\nfor a conference dedicated to Stark's conjecture and its variations to\r\nbe held at John's Hopkins University in Baltimore August 4-9, 2002. \r\nPlans include plenary talks devoted to background and current research\r\nin the mornings, followed by contributed talks in the afternoons.\r\nThe gathering of researchers from various strands of inquiry should\r\nlead to insight into the links between various conjectures and provide \r\nan ideal platform for further research on all aspects of Stark's Conj-\r\necture. In particular, one would expect that this conference would lead \r\nto a number of new and fruitful collaborations, and to the greater in-\r\nvolvement of graduate students in this research. Indeed, graduate stu-\r\ndents, junior faculty members, women, and members of traditionally \r\nunder-represented minorities are especially encouraged to attend and \r\nto apply for funding. \r\n\r\n     Stark's conjecture in number theory suggests that there is astonishing \r\nand useful structure waiting to be discovered behind the fundamental \r\nconcepts of higher arithmetic. In higher arithmetic, one seeks to de-\r\nscribe the solutions of polynomial equations and their properties. This \r\nis the algebraic side of number theory. The conjecture states that the \r\nsolutions of certain polynomial equations can be obtained from the values   \r\nof specific limits and infinite sums which naturally involve the methods \r\nof calculus. This is the analytic side of number theory. Thus Stark's \r\nconjecture makes a striking connection between two branches of mathematics:\r\nalgebra and analysis. Understanding this type of connection is just what\r\nleads to major breakthroughs. Indeed, the conjecture has already led to \r\nnew and more efficient methods of performing certain computations.     \r\n \r\n",
