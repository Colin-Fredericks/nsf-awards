 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0139875\r\nAlan Reid\r\n\r\nThe problem of constructing infinitely many number fields of class\r\nnumber one descends from Gauss's work on quadratic forms, and remains\r\none of the major unsolved problems in algebraic number theory.  This\r\nhas been the inspiration for many new ideas and techniques in\r\nalgebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry.  The proposers plan a\r\nsustained attack on this problem using geometric methods based upon\r\nrecent advances in the theory of hyperbolic manifolds coupled with a\r\nnatural broadening of the classical Bianchi- Hurwitz theorem.\r\nPossible important mathematical by-products include new techniques\r\nfor estimating class numbers and an improvement of the\r\nunderstanding of properties of the trace fields of hyperbolic\r\nmanifolds.\r\n\r\nFurther  consequences of this work of a somewhat broader impact  also\r\nseem possible. The most obviously relevant applications seem to\r\ncome from the direction of cryptography.  The  difficulty of factoring\r\nnumbers into primes is the basis for the RSA cryptosystem. The fastest\r\nknown algorithm  for factoring large whole numbers into primes is the\r\nso-called number field sieve, and the techniques from algebraic number\r\ntheory involved in this sieve were developed in part from work on class\r\nnumbers.   This project could impact such algorithms and progress on\r\nfactoring problems would have significant implications for cryptography. \r\nThis award is jointly funded by the programs in Topology and Algebra,\r\nNumber Theory, & Combinatorics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
