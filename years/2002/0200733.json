The definition\r\nof the norm of these vector fields depends on which\r\napplication the fields are used for. One norm comes from\r\nlooking at vector fields as tangent vectors to the\r\nTeichmuller space of the given closed set.  This norm,\r\ncalled the Teichmuller norm, is suitable for applications\r\nin holomorphic motions and complex dynamics.  It turns the\r\nspace of vector fields into a space of all initial\r\nvelocities of holomorphic motions of the closed set. Since\r\nthe holomorphic motions of the fixed closed set are defined\r\nby an intrinsic condition on the closed set, it is natural\r\nthat there is a criterion that guarantees that the vector\r\nfield has bounded norm, and which is expressed purely in\r\nterms of the values of the vector field on the closed set.\r\nSuch a criterion was found recently by considering the\r\nvelocity of the cross ratio for every possible quadruple\r\nin the given closed set.  The velocity is measured with\r\nrespect to the Poincare density of the Riemann sphere\r\npunctured at three points. This leads to an alternative\r\nnorm on vector fields, called the cross ratio norm. The\r\ncross ratio norm is equivalent to the Teichmuller norm,\r\nand the equivalence constant is universal and independent\r\nof the closed set or vector field.  Hence, a vector field\r\nis a derivative of some holomorphic motion if, and only if,\r\nit has bounded cross ratio norm.  This equivalence led to\r\nthe introduction of a new canonical density on any Riemann\r\nsurface. The new density is equivalent to Poincare density,\r\nand this equivalence has several important applications of\r\nthe vector field theory to hyperbolic and conformal geometry.\r\nIt provides a link between, on the one hand, hyperbolic\r\ngeometry, Riemann surfaces, and geometric function theory,\r\nand on the other hand, Teichmuller theory, quadratic\r\ndifferentials and h olomorphic motions with their\r\napplications to complex dynamics.  \r\n\r\nFor many years the analytical and geometrical techniques\r\ndeveloped in dynamical systems and Teichmuller theory have\r\nbeen applied to a number of important nonlinear problems\r\nwith broad impact on ecology, economics, and genetics.  One\r\ncan expect these trends to continue. This project will\r\nfeature the applications of the finite earthquake theorem\r\nto various directions. This, recently stated and proved,\r\ntheorem provides a way to code each finite or countable\r\nstring of data into the weighted tree associated to a\r\nfinite lamination and vice versa. That could turn out to\r\nbe an efficient way of coding. The applications will be\r\nbased on recently made program in Maple that sketches the\r\ngraph of finite laminations corresponding to a given\r\nhomeomorphism and lists weights associated to each leaf of\r\nthose laminations. The third component of the project is\r\nbased on integrating research and education.",
