 "awd_abstract_narration": "New hybrid inorganic/organic materials with open-framework structures and improved properties based on various multifunctional linkers will be synthesized. The emphasis on transition-metal - multifunctional linker systems will lead to new open-framework compounds with new structures and novel properties. For example, the borophosphate group, a multifunctional \"linker\" with borate and phosphate functionalities, is a novel species that acts similarly  to the aluminophosphates in some compounds, but brings unique structural features in others. Envisioned for this project is further utilization of such capabilities by using analogies with known open-framework compounds where various templates, transition metals, and synthetic conditions will be systematically studied. Other multifunctional linkers to be investigated include di-phosphonates, carboxy-phosphonates, and phosphonated a-aminoacids to provide various coordination modes to the transition metal centers as well as different functionalities to the solid. Students involved with this project will acquire valuable skills in structure characterization, property measurements and novel synthetic techniques. Their training in cutting-edge research methodology is emphasized.\r\n%%%\r\nInorganic/organic hybrid materials have significant potential for applications in molecular separation and sensing, ion exchange, and catalysis in the petrochemical industry and for chemicals production. The technological impact of the latter will be in improvements in chemical processing and, subsequently, an increase in energy-use efficiency. The educational aspect of the program is aimed at teaching undergraduate and graduate students not only in particular lab techniques but also in general understanding and appreciation of solid state chemistry. Training in these areas will make these chemists highly  competitive for employment in universities and in chemical industry.\r\n\r\n",
