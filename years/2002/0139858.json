The Symposium is to be preceded by a tutorial on Nanofabrication for Cellular Engineering.  The purpose of the Symposium and tutorial is to bring together an interdisciplinary group of experts representing materials science, physics, chemistry, electronics, biology and medicine, to explore the fundamental processes and tools for nanoscale patterning.  The technologies to be addressed include optical as well as next generation lithography (EUV, X-ray, e-beam, ion-beam); probe arrays; self assembly processes; maskless and soft lithography including imprinting and holographic/ interferometric methods; materials design and characterization for data storage, NEMS, displays, systems-on-a-chip, molecular devices; metrology issues; bionanotechnology including tissue engineering, biomimetics and interfaces; and theory, modeling and simulation.  \r\n\r\nThe Symposium technologies in nanoscale patterning address critical challenges in a broad industry spectrum, from semiconductor to biotechnology, where the development of such nanofabrication techniques is particularly timely.  It is expected that the Symposium and tutorial will promote transfer of ideas and research expertise from the senior speakers to the young faculty, postdoctoral fellows and student participants, and therefore contribute to the professional/research development of new people in nanomanufacturing, as well as the dissemination of information to the research community and the development of educational materials for teaching.\r\n",
