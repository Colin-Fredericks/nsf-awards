 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nThe Biology and Chemistry departments at Eastern Michigan University (EMU) are dedicated to pedagogical innovation and the development of inquiry-based learning. Genomics is a rapidly advancing interdisciplinary science with highly projected applicability in the local and global job markets presenting a unique opportunity for the development of new pedagogical strategies in this area. This is particularly true at EMU, as many graduates are subsequently employed at local biotechnology firms. This project, therefore, adapts from a James Madison University funded NSF award \"Integration of genomics into the undergraduate curriculum\" (award #9981099), and implements new inquiry-based investigations at Eastern Michigan University. This project promotes new integrative pedagogical strategies in genomics through the development of a Genome Analysis course and the design of investigative projects in Biochemistry, Recombinant DNA Technology, Microbial Physiology, and newly-developed, inquiry-based core courses. Additionally, computational and technical skills are being developed with the acquisition of new equipment. The developed courses and modules resulting from this project provide model pedagogical advancements for universities and colleges nationwide, coinciding with a national emphasis in genomics and bioinformatics and a need for individuals knowledgeable in these areas.",
