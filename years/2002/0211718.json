 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Research at Undergraduate Institution (RUI) project.  It is funded by the Ceramics Program and the Condensed Matter Physics Program.  The glass science research focuses on the existence and effects of, \"intermediate-range-order\" in oxide glasses.  It will involve undergraduates in a variety of projects:  (1) Development of new solution chemistry for glass formation that avoids carbon dioxide retention and allows fabrication of glasses with high homogeneity and with extraordinarily high alkali concentrations.  (2) Development of novel glasses in binary vanadates, borates, bismuthates, and various ternary systems through rapid cooling.  (3) Determination of the relation between elasticity and other physical properties and the intermediate-range-order present.  (4) Exploration of packing as a universal measure of glass structure using computer simulation or experiments to achieve random mixing of constructed clusters of atoms in shapes hypothesized for glass. (5) Neutron scattering, NMR, FT-Raman, FTIR, ultrasonic velocity of sound, and Brillouin light scattering will be used to detect intermediate-range-order.  In particular, high-field NMR will be used for the first time to determine the intermediate site origins of tetrahedral boron atom in selected borate glasses and crystals. (6) Finally, students will help optimize a state-of-the-art twin roller-quenching system for glass fabrication.  High school students and teachers will also participate in this work as a way of motivating these students to pursue careers in science. \r\n\r\nThis is a Research at Undergraduate Institution (RUI) project.  It is funded by the Ceramics Program and the Condensed Matter Physics Program.  At least 12 undergraduates and several high school students and teachers will participate in significant, publishable glass science research projects. The determination of intermediate range order (clusters of atoms) and the impact of this order on a variety of physical properties are the main scientific goals.  Novel glasses will be formed using rapid cooling and new chemical methods.  The atomic structure will be determined using various spectroscopies. Properties such as density, optical absorption, and thermal effects will be measured and compared to structure.  Students will be involved in instrument enhancement as well.  All participants will receive training and encouragement to pursue careers as scientists:  In the past 15 years, more than 100 students have been trained to do high level research at a school of ca. 1100 students.  In support of these goals, the project includes active collaborations with major research centers in the US, Europe, and Japan:  Rutherford-Appleton lab near Oxford, England and the Institute Laue Langevin, Grenoble, France (Neutron scattering);  Indiana University and Iowa State University (NMR); Iowa State University and NHRF, Athens, Greece (Raman and infrared spectroscopy);  Fudan University (Shanghai) second harmonic generation; Sojo University, Japan (ultrasound); Tsukuba University, Japan, (Brillouin and Raman Light Scattering); Rostock University, Germany, (x-ray diffraction). \r\n",
