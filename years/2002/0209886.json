The investigators plan to study the correlation of Cretaceous rock sequences exposed along the Gulf of Suez margin in Egypt and in the North American mid continent. Using the magnetosusceptibility event and cyclostratigraphy (MSEC) method, they will use samples collected from both regions to build a composite MSEC standard that may be used for correlation between the two regions.  Recent published MSEC data sets have been shown to be useful for global correlation and correlation between wells when applied to cutting samples. \r\n\r\nScope: \r\nThe Cretaceous Period, especially in the Middle East, is a significant geologic period in terms of applied geology.  MSEC correlation in cretaceous Rocks from Egypt and the United States is a logical progression from Paleozoic studies.  This will advance knowledge and refine stratigraphic correlation of Cretaceous strata in northern Africa and the western United States, complementing and giving independent evidence for correlations within biozones and polar reversal intervals.  The research has direct application to studies of Cretaceous strata, which hold petroleum resources in the United States and elsewhere, and the results may have direct application in oil exploration.  Ellwood and Kafafy have experience in MSEC techniques and in applications in the field.  The project includes undergraduate students who will benefit from taking part in an international cooperative research.  This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
