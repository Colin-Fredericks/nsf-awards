 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by James Mayer, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, in the fundamental processes of transition metal-promoted oxidations. The properties and reactivity of a new osmium compound, tris(pyrazolyl)borate osmium dioxo nitride will be studied. This compound has shown olefin dihydroxylation activity. Novel electrophilic reactions of coordinated ligands will be explored, starting from the unique attack of an anilido ligand bound to osmium. Mayer will also extend his work into high oxidation state ruthenium and iridium complexes. In these strongly oxidizing complexes, ligands that are usually electrophiles act as nucleophiles and show unusual reactivity.\r\n\r\nThe selective oxidation of organic compounds by transition metal reagents and catalysts is of fundamental and technological importance. Selective oxidation is a key part of the production of many commodity chemicals, specialty organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and there is much room for improvement in these processes. Undergraduate and graduate students will also be trained in this important research area that combines synthetic and mechanistic chemistry.\r\n",
