The main function of multimedia encryption is to protect the confidentiality and thus performs access control, while data embedding or digital watermarking concerns how to associate a set of imperceptible data with the host media in a seamless way.  The embedded data can be used to accomplish ownership verification or authentication even\r\nafter decryption.\r\n\r\nThe research component of this project involves three parts.  The investigator first explores the protection of content confidentiality under three different levels of threats by designing and analyzing signal processing based encryption algorithms that are computationally efficient and easily compatible with lossy communications.  In addition, new challenging problems of multimedia data hiding are studied based on a\r\nlayered algorithmatic architecture, and a software testbed is developed.  Finally, the project investigates the joint use of encryption and data hiding as well as their interplay for providing comprehensive protection.\r\nThe educational component of this project focuses on two themes, namely, using multimedia as a powerful tool to enhance the productivity of multimedia education, and using carefully designed projects to provide\r\nstudents with hands-on experience that will well prepare them for joining the future technical force of information technology. In addition to the curriculum development, the investigator makes special effort to nurture the under-represented students especially young women and to attract them to step into the EE/CS disciplines.\r\n",
