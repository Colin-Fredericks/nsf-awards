 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information security has become a critical concern of both government and industry, and numerous groups have independently called for more and better research and education efforts in computer security.  During the first computer security education workshop (1997) attended by industry and government agencies, there was a clear call to action for universities to create programs in information security.  In response to these demands, faculty members from several universities have been working to increase both education and research in the area of information assurance.  This initiative proposes to build on the existing strengths of the faculty and universities involved by creating the Cyber Protection Center.  The Center will be one of the first facilities dedicated to creating a simulated Internet for the purpose of researching, designing, and testing cyber defense mechanisms.  The Laboratory will also be used to test key components of the critical infrastructure.",
