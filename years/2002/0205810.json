However, in spite of significant progress in recent years, there remain fundamental unanswered questions about the basic physics of star formation. If dense molecular clouds have lifetimes significantly longer than their free-fall collapse times, they must be supported against gravitational collapse. One view is that magnetic fields provide this support. This hypothesis can be tested by measurement of the mass to magnetic flux ratio in dense clouds.  The other extreme is that magnetic fields are weak and that molecular clouds are intermittent phenomena, and that the problem of cloud support for long time periods is irrelevant.\r\n   This project will measure, directly or indirectly, magnetic field strengths in a large, statistically meaningful sample of molecular clouds in order to help answer the above questions. Because the requisite measurements are of weakly polarized continuum and spectral-line emission from molecular clouds, measurements of interstellar magnetic fields remain among the most difficult of astronomical observations, and information about magnetic fields remains very sparse. It is crucial to our understanding of the fundamental physical process of star formation that measurements of interstellar magnetic fields continue to progress.\r\n***\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n",
