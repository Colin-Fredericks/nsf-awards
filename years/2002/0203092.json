 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Eisenbud will work on three groups of problems from commutative\r\nalgebra and algebraic geometry: The use of exterior algebra methods\r\nin projective geometry and their extension to toric geometry; the study\r\nof infinite free resolutions; and the study of codimensions of determinantal\r\n(and related) ideals. This last includes the circle of problems around the \r\nexistence of vector bundles of low rank on projective spaces. His activity\r\nwill also include the development of fundamental algorithms in computational\r\nalgebraic geometry and their implementation in the Macaulay2 package \r\nwritten by Grayson and Stilllman. By far the largest portion of the project\r\nbudget is devoted to the support of graduate students. This and the computational\r\ntools produced by the project will broaden its impact.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry deals with geometric forms defined by\r\nsimple equations (polynomials). The subject is central in mathematics\r\nbecause these forms include the fundamental examples in most disciplines\r\nof mathhematics; and it is important in the applications of mathematics\r\nbecause these forms provide the models most often used in representing\r\nnature in equations or in the computer. Over the last 150 years the group of\r\ntechniques called commutative algebra has been developed to study and unify this\r\nand problems arising in number theory. Much more recently it was realized that\r\nan extension of commutative algebra into the noncommutative domain of\r\nexterior algebras gives a fruitful new approach to some old problems in this\r\nfield. Independently, computers and algorithms became powerful enough to \r\nhelp research in algebraic geometry. Eisenbud's proposed work has to do\r\nwith some of the most classical problems in algebraic geometry as well\r\nas with new uses of exterior algebra and computation in this domain, and\r\nhe will also continue his work developing computational tools for others\r\nto use. The largest part of his grant will be devoted to the support\r\nof graduate students, whom he will train in these techniques and methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
