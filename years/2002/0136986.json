 "awd_abstract_narration": "Novel extreme composite materials due to constituents of negative stiffness\r\n\r\nR. S. Lakes, R. W. Carpick, R. F. Cooper*, W. J. Drugan\r\nDepartment of Engineering Physics and *Department of Materials Science\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\r\nMadison, WI 53706\r\n\r\n\tThe proposed research is directed toward the attainment of extreme\r\nmaterial properties by relaxing some of the assumptions commonly held about\r\nconstituent behavior in a composite material.  A composite  material\r\ncombines two or more constituent phases of different material properties to\r\nachieve a new material with enhanced mechanical/transport properties.\r\nEffective mechanical properties of composites are determined primarily by\r\nthe properties of the materials being combined, the interface behavior, and\r\nthe spatial arrangement of the phases in the composite. Traditionally, the\r\ndesign variables associated with composites include (i) the choice of\r\nconstituent materials, (ii) the volume fraction of the constituents, and\r\n(iii) the geometry of the phases.\r\n\tRecently, one of the writers (Lakes) and co-workers showed that\r\nseveral classes of composites can exhibit extreme behavior if one\r\nconstituent has negative stiffness. An analysis of the possibilities in\r\nviscoelastic composite systems was reported in Physical Review Letters.\r\nPeak damping and large stiffness anomalies are possible even with a dilute\r\nconcentration of inclusions, provided matrix damping is small. An\r\nexperimental illustration of the behavior of a lumped unit cell was\r\nreported in Philosophical Magazine Letters. It disclosed singular\r\nmechanical damping tan(delta) [where tan(delta) is the tangent of the phase\r\nangle between stress and strain] in a system containing post-buckled tubes.\r\nA further experimental illustration of extreme behavior in a particulate\r\ncomposite was reported in Nature. Composites prepared with a dilute\r\nconcentration of ferroelastic inclusions exhibited large peaks in\r\ntan(delta). The inclusions are more effective than diamond in increasing\r\nthe composite stiffness at selected temperatures. These results point to\r\nthe possibility of achieving extreme behavior in designed composites, and\r\nexceeding conventional bounds based on the assumption of positive\r\nconstituent stiffness.\r\n\tThe goal of this research is to explore the effects of constituents\r\nof negative stiffness in composite materials. We hypothesize on the basis\r\nof some initial theoretical analyses and experiments that if one phase has\r\nnegative stiffness, the overall stiffness of the composite can be made\r\nlarge. Moreover, we hypothesize that extreme mechanical damping effects can\r\noccur if one phase has negative stiffness.\r\n\tMultiple methods of achieving inclusion negative stiffness are to\r\nbe examined.  Also, the question of stability of materials and composites\r\nis to be examined in new theoretical developments.  For a composite with\r\nextremely high stiffness to be useful, it must be stable.\r\n\tComposites with inclusions of negative stiffness are of scientific\r\ninterest in that current understanding of heterogeneous media is predicated\r\non an assumption of each phase to have positive stiffness. Our preliminary\r\ntheoretical and experimental results indicate extreme effects in stiffness\r\nand damping when that assumption is relaxed, so we anticipate that the\r\npresent work will facilitate the development of new classes of materials\r\nwith extreme properties, even materials stiffer than diamond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
