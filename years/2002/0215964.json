 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for acquisition of a new state-of-the-art scanning probe microscope (SPM) for the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology research community. The instrument is an atomic force microscope (AFM) that can be modified to operate in a variety of scanning modes, including phase-imaging microscopy, electric force microscopy, magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The principal investigators have successfully used AFM imaging to support their research on ceramic film fabrication and fluid interactions with geologic materials. Other researchers will use the AFM for characterizing a variety of materials, including metal surfaces, nanocomposites, self-assembled monolayers, carbon nanotubes, buckyballs, and DNA. The projects described herein involve some 14 faculty, several post-doctoral researchers, and many graduate students, from seven different academic departments at NMT. The microscope will enhance graduate student training and undergraduate teaching through experience with one of the best surface characterization tools available. \r\n%%%\r\nAFM detects surface topography by monitoring molecular force interactions between a probe tip and the sample. STM detects surface topography by monitoring the tunneling current between an electrically conductive probe and the sample. SPM offers resolution of surface features on the order of a few nanometers, the highest of any imaging technique. An additional important advantage of SPM over other techniques is the ability to image samples in air or under liquids without extensive preparation. Environmental and biological samples may be examined under near-natural conditions. Instruction in SPM techniques will be integrated directly into existing graduate and undergraduate courses and into a new short course. Budgeting for an instrument manager/trainer will ensure instrumentation access for those with little or no prior experience with SPM techniques. \r\n\r\n",
