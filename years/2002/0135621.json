Multiscale simulations of the electrodeposition process including both continuum and non-continuum behavior will be performed.  Hypotheses for how additives influence surface roughness evolution will be inferred from large datasets obtained through atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements carried out in conjunction with high throughput electrochemical cells and well-characterized model additive systems.  Hypotheses will be refined through quantitative comparison of these data with multiscale simulations of roughness evolution.  Non-continuum phenomena will be modeled by a three-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo method that simulates how roughness evolution is controlled by additives.  Verification experiments that measure shape evolution on surfaces of convoluted geometry will be carried out to test predictions over multiple length scales.  This work will lead to a better understanding of processes used in the manufacture of novel structures formed by electrodeposition of metals, alloys and semiconductors.\r\n",
