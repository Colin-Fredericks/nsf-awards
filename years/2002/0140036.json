 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central theme of this proposal is the development of \r\nnew methods for approximately solving the Schroedinger\r\nequation for atomic nuclei and their application to problems of\r\ncontemporary importance in nuclear structure physics. Methods \r\nhaving their parentage in the nuclear shell model and in \r\nmean-field theory will be considered, with the goal of developing \r\nalgorithms that significantly expand their ranges of applicability. \r\n\r\nA principal focus will be on the development of the\r\nDensity Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), a method \r\nfirst introduced in the context of quantum spin lattices. \r\nHere we will focus on a new DMRG methodology that is tailored \r\nto such finite fermi systems as the atomic nucleus. We will also \r\nconsider its application to an important non-nuclear problem, the \r\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model, which is of relevance to systems \r\nthat undergo transitions to superconductivity at high critical \r\ntemperatures. \r\n\r\nA second focus will be on the properties of\r\nweakly-bound nuclei far from stability. A method recently \r\nproposed for reliably solving the Hartree Fock Bogolyubov \r\nmean-field equations for very weakly-bound nuclei will be \r\ndeveloped further, so as to make it computationally more viable, \r\nand will then be applied systematically to both spherical and \r\naxially-deformed nuclei throughout the periodic table. Other \r\nmethods for solving the Hartree Fock Bogolyubov equations in \r\nweakly-bound systems will also be considered, to make sure \r\nthat the spatial properties of such systems are being reliably \r\ntreated.\r\n",
