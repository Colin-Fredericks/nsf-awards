 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the role of self-regulated\r\nlearning (SRL) in students' understanding of science with hypermedia. SRL is\r\nemerging as a significant issue in educational and psychological research. SRL is an active, constructive process\r\nwhereby learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor,\r\nregulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior in the service\r\nof those goals. SRL is guided and constrained by both personal characteristics\r\nand the contextual features of the environment (Pintrich, 2000). The focus of\r\nSRL research over the last three decades has been on learners' academic learning\r\nand achievement and has progressively included emphases on cognitive strategies,\r\nmetacognition, motivation, and task engagement (for a recent review see Paris &\r\nParis, 2001). The broad scope of SRL appeals to educational researchers who seek\r\nto understand how students become adept and independent in their educational\r\npursuits. Whether SRL is viewed as a set of skills that can be taught explicitly\r\nor as developmental processes of self-regulation that emerge with experience\r\n(within a domain, topic, or task), teachers can provide information and\r\nopportunities to students of all ages that will help them become strategic,\r\nmotivated, and independent learners. There are, however, several theoretical and\r\nempirical issues that need further research before practical classroom\r\nimplications can be put forth. How do students' regulate their own learning when\r\nusing a hypermedia environment to learn about complex science topics? Which\r\nprocesses related to self- and co-regulation do student pairs and teachers use\r\nduring collaborative learning of complex science topics with hypermedia? What\r\nkinds of instructional conditions are more effective in fostering SRL? How can\r\nscience teachers provide information and opportunities to students of all ages\r\nthat can help them become more strategic, motivated, and independent learners?\r\nCan SRL be taught explicitly as a set of skills or is it a developmental process\r\nthat emerges from experience (within a task, topic, or domain).This NSF Career project will explore these\r\nquestions through research that forges new directions in the area of students'\r\nself-regulated learning of two complex science topics (the circulatory system\r\nand ecological systems) with hypermedia environments (CircSysWeb and RiverWeb).\r\nIn doing so, the research goals will be: (1) To scale-up research on\r\nself-regulated learning across developmental levels and contexts; (2) To examine\r\nthe role of self- and co-regulation during individual and collaborative learning\r\nwith hypermedia environments; (3) To examine the effectiveness of\r\nco-construction of goals (between teacher and students) during learning of\r\nscience with hypermedia environments; (4) To examine the effectiveness of\r\nstrategy instruction training in fostering students' self- and co-regulated\r\nlearning with hypermedia; and, (5) To examine the effectiveness of adaptive\r\nweb-based hypermedia environments in detecting, modeling, and fostering\r\nstudents' self- and co-regulated learning of science.\r\n\r\n",
