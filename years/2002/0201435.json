The\r\nLoewner differential equation describes the flow associated with\r\nthe conformal mappings onto a continuously decreasing sequence of\r\nsimply connected planar domains. It relates a sequence of domains\r\nto a real-valued function, the driving term of the equation.\r\nSchramm's recent discovery of the stochastic Loewner evolution\r\nSLE, the Loewner equation driven by one-dimensional Brownian\r\nmotion, has opened up a new area of investigations involving\r\nconformal mappings, probability theory and mathematical physics.\r\nThe Loewner equation is also related to an algorithm for\r\nnumerical conformal mapping.\r\n\r\nConformal mappings have applications  in many areas, both within \r\nand outside of  mathematics, such as control theory, heat\r\nconduction, fluid dynamics, and complex dynamics. They are often\r\nused to change  coordinates from one region to a simpler region\r\nlike a disc. Regions with smooth boundaries are well understood.\r\nHowever, the appearance of fractals in many branches of science \r\nled to the natural problem of investigating regions bounded by \r\nhighly nonsmooth, fractal curves, from the  conformal mapping\r\npoint of view. In recent years, fractal curves generated by\r\nrandom processes arising,  for instance, in statistical physics,\r\nhave received enormous attention. The core of Marshall's and\r\nRohde's research is to better understand random fractal curves\r\nby means of conformal mappings, and conversely to study some\r\nproblems about conformal mappings by  analyzing domains bounded\r\nby fractal curves.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
