 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for a planning grant that aims to prepare a full proposal in the future to develop professional development materials for teachers in the area of environmental science.  Most of the funds requested in the planning grant are to assemble a group of scientists, science educators (some of whom have led the development of national standards in science, math, and geography) and teachers for a two-day conference.  The purpose of the conference is to develop a synthesis of best practices toward education about the environment.  The ultimate goal is to produce a publication (tentatively titled \"Resources for Environmental Literacy') that will identify the concepts and principles every American should know in order to make thoughtful public and private choices; to participate in a rational discourse about issues related to the environment; and to appreciate the interrelation of the human and natural worlds.  This publication will assist teachers by demonstrating how environmental knowledge can be achieved through the integration and application of learning across the disciplines, on issues that are of considerable interest and great importance to students\r\n",
