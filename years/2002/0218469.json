Friedman\r\nAmherst College\r\n\r\nToward Quantum Computing with Molecular Magnets; Studies of Spin Dynamics\r\n\r\nThe viability for using molecular magnets as qubits, the processing elements of quantum computers by using pulsed microwave and millimeter-wave radiation to perform quantum operations on the spin states of these systems are being investigated.  In the process, some important issues regarding the tunneling mechanism by which the magnetic moments of these systems reverse direction at temperatures below a few Kelvin are also investigated.\r\n\r\nA series of experiments are being performed to measure the effect of the applied radiation on the magnetic relaxation of the molecular magnets. These experiments include photon-assisted relaxation, which occurs when the radiation helps the molecule's spin reverse direction, Rabi oscillations of the probability of reversal with radiation-pulse duration, and free-precession of a quantum superposition of spin states produced by a series of radiation pulses.  These experiments are aimed at providing a measure of the decoherence time of the excited spin state, a crucial parameter for determining whether the molecular magnets can be used as qubits.  The project is also investigating methods of mitigating inhomogeneous broadening effects due to dipole interactions with neighboring molecules, nuclear spins and defects.\r\n\r\nThe project has potential impacts for the fields of quantum computation and information storage. It is also promoting the education of undergraduate students, especially underrepresented groups like women and minorities.\r\n\r\n",
