Daniel P. Lathrop and Jean-Francois Pinton will lead in the US and France respectively in experiments in magnetic field generation in liquid metals flow.  This research is relevant to understanding nonlinear dynamics associated with turbulent flow conducting fluids.  Such conditions are thought to occur in the Earth, planetary bodies, and stars.  The experiments take advantage of access to a new experimental sodium facility constructed and funded by the French Ministry of Research.  This facility has a larger capacity than similar experimental facilities at the University of Maryland.  The US and French groups have complementary skills in fluid turbulence, nonlinear dynamics, and in fluid experiments. Reciprocal visits of students are emphasized to advance their research training and encourage future international partnerships.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and graduate students.  CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers and graduate students to the United States. The collaboration will advance fundamental understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and the magnetic fields of other planetary and astrophysical bodies.   \r\n",
