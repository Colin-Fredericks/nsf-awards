Accumulating genomic data generates the need for rapid biological interpretation of genome sequences and integration of this knowledge into databases of genomic information for immediate use by biomedical and environmental scientists. Proteins comprising signal transduction networks control most vital functions in any given organism, beneficial or harmful. However, current interpretation of genomic data for signal transduction proteins fails to provide sufficient information for understanding their biological role. The goal of this research project is to significantly improve prediction of biological functions for signal transduction proteins and to unravel potentially novel signal transduction mechanisms and pathways in various beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms. This will be achieved through a systematic computational approach, which integrates in-depth analysis of functional elements (domains) of individual proteins and evolutionary and genome context information. The results obtained will be incorporated into primary databases and will allow automated detection of biologically important proteins. The research proposed in this project will contribute to a better understanding of the organization and evolution of signal transduction systems (fundamental aspect).  This, in turn, will assist experimental scientists in identification of targets for antimicrobial drug design in pathogens and in improving beneficial capabilities of microorganisms used for biofertilization and bioremediation purposes (applied aspect).",
