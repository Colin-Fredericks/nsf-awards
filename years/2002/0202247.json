The project focuses on the development of a 3-D Solid Modeling (Unigraphics) course, professional development for secondary school teachers, student enrichment and outreach activities for high school students, and adaptation and implementation of South Carolina ATE Gateway to Technology program.\r\n\r\nThrough the legislative and former governor's leadership and financial support from the state of Missouri, St. Louis Community College at Florissant Valley has already been involved in an extensive upgrade of its facilities and programs. In the last three years the state of Missouri has awarded over $1.5 million to the college to enhance its laboratory facilities for manufacturing related programs, and has appropriated $2.1 million to expand the physical facilities. Scope of the project includes developing one course at the associate's level in a manufacturing related topic, organizing workshops and training sessions in manufacturing related topics for high school teachers and students, and implementing Gateway to Technology (developmental) program to improve preparedness of SLCC-FV students for engineering and engineering technology programs. \r\n\r\n. \r\n\r\n",
