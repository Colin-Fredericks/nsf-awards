 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose running a five day conference in July 2002 on the use of symbolic computation in algebra, geometry, and analysis, preceded by a two day workshop for graduate students and non-specialists.  This will be a joint U.S. and Canadian event and will take place at the University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.  We request funds from the NSF to provide travel and support costs for participants from the U.S.\r\nThe conference is intended to bring together researchers from a broad variety of areas within symbolic computation.  The topics included will be computational algebra (both commutative and non-commutative) and algebraic geometry, solving polynomial equations, differential algebra, coding theory and geometric invariant theory.\r\nThe conference will consist of approximately 10 one hour talks and 20 half hour talks.  The one hour talks will be designed for an audience of nonspecialists, in particular, for students and researchers wishing to learn about the area.  The shorter talks will be designed to discuss current developments in the field.  In addition, the PIs plan to hold a two-day workshop before the start of the conference featuring coding theory and geometric invariant theory.  The workshop will be aimed at graduate students and non-specialists.\r\nThe conference is modeled in its scope, program and organization after the AMS-IMS-SIAM joint summer research conference Symbolic Computation:  Solving Equations in Algebra, Geometry, and Engineering that was held at Mount Holyoke College in June 2000 and organized by the PIs.  The Mount Holyoke meeting in turn was inspired by the special semester on Symbolic Computation in Algebra, Geometry and Analysis that was held at MSRI in the Fall of 1998.  The proposed conference will serve as a platform to present the most exciting results obtained since the summer of 2000.\r\nWe already have approved funding from the Fields Institute, Ontario Research Center for Computational Algebra (ORCCA), and the University of Western Ontario.  The organizers plan to make a special effort to attract graduate students and recent Ph.Ds, as well as women working in the areas within the scope of the conference.  A substantial portion of the requested funds would be used for support of graduate students and recent PH.Ds from the U.S.\r\n",
