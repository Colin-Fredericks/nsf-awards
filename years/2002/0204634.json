A broad aim is to discover how\r\nclosely the symplectic geometry relates to the smooth structure on\r\nthe original manifold, and how the complex geometry reflects the\r\nRiemannian properties. Also, since much symplectic infomation is\r\ncontained in properties of compatible complex structures, it is also\r\ninteresting to relate the symplectic and complex geometry. Cotangent\r\nbundles are the simplest examples of symplectic manifolds, yet many\r\nfundamental problems in symplectic geometry are still elusive in\r\nthese cases. The investigator will conduct research into the\r\nuniqueness of symplectic structures and of isotopy classes of\r\nLagrangian submanifolds. The complex manifolds we study arise\r\nnaturally in many branches of mathematics, notably algebraic geometry\r\nand representation theory. Important aspects of their geometry\r\nremain to be understood, together with analytical problems which\r\nshould have applications to number theory.\r\n\r\n\tSymplectic geometry originated as the modern mathematical\r\nlanguage of classical and quantum mechanics. It is now an exciting\r\narea of pure mathematical research, but continues to benefit from\r\ncurrent physical ideas. Since the eighties it has been clear that\r\nmuch insight into symplectic geometry can also be gained from\r\nstudying compatible complex structures. Fortunately the study of\r\ncomplex geometry has long been a main focus of mathematics. This\r\nproject will conduct research into both symplectic and complex\r\ngeometry, focussing on interactions between the two. The specific\r\nobjects of study arise as the first examples of symplectic\r\nmanifolds, and as examples of complex manifolds occuring frequently\r\nin many branches of mathematics and theoretical physics.\r\n\r\n",
