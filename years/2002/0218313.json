 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central tenet of evolutionary biology is that natural selection  leads to \r\nadaptation.  Studies of house finches in Montana and Alabama have \r\ndocumented that indeed, these birds have rapidly adapted to the local \r\nenvironment, despite having colonized these highly ecologically distinct \r\nareas only in the last few decades. Local adaptations include different \r\nsizes and shapes for males and females but these changes have occurred too  \r\nrapidly to be explained by genetically based changes alone. It has been \r\ndocumented previously that rapid changes in how male and female house \r\nfinches grow and develop in Montana and Alabama are responsible for \r\ndifferences between the populations.  In particular it is the allocation of \r\nmales and females to different positions in the laying order and strong and \r\nsex-specific effects of laying order on growth and development that led to \r\nrapid changes in the populations.  How such maternal effects can affect the \r\ngrowth of males and females is the focus of this study. This investigation \r\nwill test whether female allocation of hormones such as testosterone and \r\nprolactin, specific nutrients such as carotenoids and lipids, overall \r\nnutrient content of eggs, or the timing of egg incubation varies across \r\nlaying order and how each of these factors affects the growth and \r\ndevelopment of male and female offspring. Our investigation is fundamental \r\nto a better understanding of how natural selection can lead to rapid \r\nadaptation to local environments.  The ability to adjust the growth patterns \r\nof males and females as an adaptation to local environments may have \r\nenabled the house finch and some other invasive vertebrate species to \r\ncolonize highly distinct and changing environments.\r\n",
