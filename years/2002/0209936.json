 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how interactions, microstructure and microscopic mechanics determine\r\nthe macroscopic properties and responses of complex fluids is a fundamental problem that\r\nimpacts materials processing and development, biology and medicine. For particulate gels\r\nthat occur in the manufacture of ceramic parts, coatings, mineral recovery and lubricant\r\ndegradation, we seek to understand the microscopic origins of viscoelastic, yield, and non-\r\nlinear behavior that ultimately affects processing and final properties, such as the thermal\r\nand mass transport characteristics. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to explore the use of direct microscopic manipulation\r\nand imaging to understand the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic properties\r\nin particulate gels. The PI will develop and employ new experimental tools based on optical\r\nmicromanipulation and visualization, including optical trapping in combination with video,\r\nfluorescence, and confocal microscopies. Because the techniques will allow investigation of the\r\nbasic, microscopic mechanisms of rheological and mechanical behavior by quantifying struc-\r\ntural rearrangements, stresses and interactions in situ, they are powerful complements to\r\nscattering and rheological methods used by other groups.\r\n\r\nSpecific research aims are:\r\n\r\n1.  Directly measure the micromechanical properties of models of the gel back-\r\nbone. To understand fundamental mechanisms of gel elasticity, shear and compressive\r\nyield behavior in particulate gels, the PI will develop optical trapping and microscopy tech-\r\nniques to measure the bending stiffness, frequency response, and relaxation timescales\r\nof model aggregates of the gel backbone. With videomicroscopy, the PI will characterize\r\nparticle rearrangement mechanisms that are relevant to creep, yield and non-linear be-\r\nhavior. The PI will systematically vary interparticle interactions, particle concentration,\r\nand polydispersity, and characterize surface heterogeneity.\r\n\r\n2.  Measure the mechanical properties of  flocs and floc- floc interfaces. Using\r\nthe experimental techniques designed for measuring gel backbone properties, the PI will\r\nmeasure the frequency response and rupturing mechanics of flocs formed during the\r\naggregation process. Concurrent videomicroscopy and optical trapping will enable the PI\r\nto characterize and correlate mechanics and structural rearrangements in flocs that give\r\nrise to strain-hardening in fractal colloidal gels. The PI will measure mechanics between\r\nflocs to distinguish the contribution of internal and floc- floc mechanics in the rheology\r\nof gels.\r\n\r\n3.  Develop optical trapping and microscopy for dense, gelling suspensions.\r\nEstablishing the relationship between individual aggregate mechanics, microrheology\r\nand rheology of particulate gels will require micromechanical measurements in bulk\r\nsuspensions. The PI will develop the appropriate core-shell particles and experimental\r\ntechniques to take advantage of simultaneous optical trapping and confocal microscopy\r\nin dense suspensions. This will enable the PI to directly visualize structure while inducing\r\nlocal deformation and stresses in the concentrated, bulk gel, ultimately providing a\r\nmeans of characterizing mechanisms of stress relaxation.\r\n",
