Several uniformization and \r\nrigidity problems are discussed.  The central problem\r\nis Cannon's conjecture that a hyperbolic group with\r\nboundary homeomorphic to the two-sphere is a lattice\r\nin the isometry group of hyperbolic space.  A resolution\r\nof this conjecture would be a major step toward Thurston's\r\nHyperbolization conjecture.  The second part of the \r\nproposal addresses the Weak hyperbolization conjecture,\r\nthe other missing step in the proof of Thurston's conjecture.\r\nThe proposed attack uses geometry and dynamics of\r\nsurface laminations in three manifolds.\r\n\r\nOne of the major open problems in Mathematics is to determine \r\nthe possible shapes (topologies) that a three dimensional space \r\nmight assume.   In the 1970's, Thurston formulated his famous\r\nGeometrization conjecture, which is a precise statement about\r\nhow the classification of such spaces should look.  The \r\nproposal addresses a piece of Thurston's conjecture known \r\nas the Hyperbolization conjecture.  The general line of attack \r\nis to associate a two dimensional self-similar fractal sphere \r\nwith each three dimensional space, and reduce the original\r\nconjecture to showing that one can find \"good\" coordinate systems\r\nfor this associated fractal sphere.\r\n",
