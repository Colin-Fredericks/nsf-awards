 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational complexity is the study of the inherent difficulty of\r\ncomputational problems. The theory considers various models of \r\ncomputation, such as classical computers, probabilistic computers, \r\nand quantum computers. For each of these, it aims to describe how many \r\nresources are needed to compute the solution to a problem as a function\r\nof the problem size.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent open question in complexity theory is whether the\r\nability to efficiently verify the validity of a candidate solution \r\nimplies the ability to efficiently compute a valid solution (assuming\r\none exists). The question is usually stated in terms of the \r\ncorresponding classes of computational problems: Is NP contained in P? \r\nLots of computational problems from virtually any discipline fall in\r\nthe class NP but are not known to be in P. Therefore, a positive answer \r\nto the P versus NP question would have tremendous algorithmic implications. \r\nIt would also imply a way to break any public-key cryptographic system, \r\nas the security of such systems rests on the assumption that a particular \r\nproblem in NP does not belong to P.\r\n\r\nThis research project aims to develop techniques for determining the \r\nrelationships between complexity classes like P and NP: separations \r\nand inclusions. On the separation side, the investigators focus on \r\ntechniques that do not suffer from the known pitfalls of relativization \r\nand natural proofs. In particular, they concentrate on indirect \r\ndiagonalization and exhibiting distinguishing properties of complete \r\nproblems. On the inclusion side, the emphasis lies on efficient \r\nclassical simulations of time and space bounded probabilistic and \r\nquantum computations.\r\n\r\nThe educational goal consists of the development of graduate courses \r\non pseudo-randomness and derandomization and on quantum computing. At \r\nthe undergraduate level, the investigators plan to further the \r\nintegration of discrete structures in the core curriculum.",
