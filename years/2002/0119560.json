 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  project provides three years of partial  core support of the Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS) and full core support of its Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS), both  groups  being committees of the National Research Council.  The BMS is the only  prominent  group in the United States wherein representatives from all the mathematical   sciences---core  mathematics,  statistics,  applied  mathematics, operations  research,  and scientific computing---regularly meet to discuss ways to  ensure and improve the intellectual vigor of the field.  CATS is perhaps the premier  assemblage  of  statistical  researchers  in  the  country,  and  it is similarly  concerned with the intellectual vigor of its field.  Both the BMS and CATS  actively promote that vigor by organizing workshops and studies that focus attention  on  research  opportunities that are ripe for exploration and, often, help  to  build  links  between  the  mathematical  sciences and other fields of science, engineering, and medicine.  To a lesser extent, they occasionally study policy issues that directly affect the health of the mathematical sciences.  The requested core funding provides for two meetings each year of both CATS and BMS, an  annual  Department Chairs Colloquium, initiation of all projects, continuous oversight  of  all activities, and continuing cognizance of issues that need the attention of BMS and/or CATS.",
