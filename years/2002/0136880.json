Recent work incorporates aspects of both into a single framework, highlighting the central role of social movement culture in simultaneously fostering 1) group identity, 2) an alternative interpretational frame of cause and effect, and 3) a sense of political efficacy among potential movement participants. Little empirical attention, however, has been devoted to examining the role media may play in forging movement culture across geographic space. \r\n\r\nThe PIs will examine the largest labor mobilization in U.S. history --the southern textile strike campaigns of 1929-1934, where upwards of 400,000 workers walked off their jobs --and the extent to which media (and radio specifically) played a vital role in fostering a cohesive social movement culture across rural, mill communities. Indeed, the worker mobilization that occurred remains an anomaly to social movement theorists and labor researchers, given the lack of union involvement and the geographically disbursed nature of mill towns during the time period in question.  Specifically, the project will investigate following: 1). Was there an empirical correspondence between radio station foundings during the era in question and strike events, even controlling for other influential factors? 2). What were transmission ranges at the time and to what extent were they heard in and across mill towns? Who owned these stations, and was there autonomy in terms of what could be broadcast? And, did mill workers have radios? 3). What national, regional, and state-level political information was transmitted that may have had the consequence of altering worker perceptions of political opportunity? 4). What was the role of radio in forging, or at least opening opportunity to, oppositional cultural messages. Were solidarity and a sense of similarity across mill towns manifested as a consequence? \r\n\r\nThe project will make important contributions to theoretical debates regarding movement formation, communication technology, cultural transmission, labor dynamics, and spatial diffusion processes most generally.  The analyses will be embedded in a historical context, while simultaneously highlighting broader themes and debates pertaining to the study and understanding of media, social movements, labor, and culture. \r\n",
