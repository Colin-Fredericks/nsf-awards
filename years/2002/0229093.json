This  model  will  be  designed  to  permit scaling up  from an information technology  kernel to a fully integrated industrial  engineering  undergraduate curriculum.  The  model  will  also  serve  as  a  deployable  template  for  the  redesign  of  other  baccalaureate  degree engineering programs through its use of problem-solving approaches that draw directly from fundamental models in the physical and biological sciences, and its emphasis on the use of nontraditional learning methods.  A secondary objective for the planning project is an assessment of the appropriateness and likely impact of the new model.  \r\n  \r\nFor the first time, a planning process will be developed that will lead to the identification of opportunities to extend tested asynchronous learning mechanism and synthetic environments to support an industrial engineering curriculum in systems and engineering design as it relates to the three emphasis areas of information technology, biotechnology and cognitive theory. The successful completion of this effort will lead to the ability to fill a state and national need for well-prepared industrial engineering graduates. \r\n \r\nImpact:  The planning project activities presented in this proposal are expected to lead to a novel curriculum model that will impact both the education of industrial engineering students and, through time, the education of students in other engineering disciplines.  \r\n \r\n   \r\n",
