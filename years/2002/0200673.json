 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator plans to investigate detailed connections among\r\nrepresentation theories of finite groups of Lie types, algebraic groups, Lie\r\nalgebras, and quivers.  The research will concentrate on relating the\r\ncohomology theory of finite groups of Lie type and that of restricted Lie\r\nalgebras and infinitesimal group schemes. The goal is to describe, for a\r\ngiven  rational module for an algebraic group, its support varieties over\r\nfinite groups of rational points over  finite fields in terms of its support\r\nvarieties  over the higher  Frobenius kernels.  The principal investigator\r\nwill also study the connections between representations of quivers and\r\nrepresentations  of Kac-Moody Lie algebras and quantum groups (and their\r\ngeneralizations). This will involve the study of subalgebras of Hall\r\nalgebras using perverse sheaves, construct canonical basis of generic\r\nsubalgebras, realize affine Lie algebras in terms of representations of\r\nquivers, and relate them to Fock spaces.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe beauty of mathematical research lies in linking many different subject\r\nareas together to apply available theory in many different fields.  This project is in the area of mathematics known as representation theory.  At its core, representation theory derives from the study of symmetries, i.e., the symmetries that natural objects, from subatomic particles to planetary orbits, have.  Nowadays there are many different kinds of representation theory, each having evolved as the best way to deal with different kinds of problems.  The purpose of this project is to find and explore some of the links between some of the different kinds of representation theory.  Such links will benefit not only the study of representation theory, but also physics and other sciences that use representation theory as a standard tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
