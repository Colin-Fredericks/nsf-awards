 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT - DMS 0203527\r\n\r\nGeometric tomography uses data concerning sections by planes and\r\nprojections on planes of geometric objects to obtain information\r\nabout these objects.  The latter include general compact sets,\r\nbut often they are convex bodies, polytopes, star-shaped bodies,\r\nor finite sets.  One advantage of this setting is that it becomes\r\nmore probable that inverse problems have a unique solution.\r\nGenerally, the a priori knowledge that the unknown object is of\r\nuniform density can be exploited to retrieve more information\r\nthan would otherwise be possible.  This can lead to algorithms\r\nthat are more effective when few measurements are available, and\r\nless sensitive to measurement errors or noise.  Geometric\r\ntomography has links to functional analysis, convex geometry,\r\nMinkowski geometry, and combinatorics. The project will continue\r\nthe development of geometric tomography.  New directions include\r\nan extension of Lutwak's dual Brunn-Minkowski theory by the\r\nintroduction of moments of sets; work towards a coherent discrete\r\nBrunn-Minkowski theory that applies to finite sets, with volume\r\nreplaced by cardinality; and an investigation into the\r\npossibility of a Brunn-Minkowski theory for capacity. In related\r\napplications, the plan is to consolidate links between geometric\r\ntomography and a practical method called local stereology, and to\r\nsolve an inverse problem concerning finite sets with an\r\napplication to medical imaging. New discoveries about\r\nintersection bodies are anticipated, with an application to the\r\nreconstruction of star bodies from the volumes of their sections\r\nthrough the origin. Also included is a program designed to\r\nstimulate undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nCAT scanners are machines that save lives daily.  They take\r\nX-rays in a number of different directions, and synthesize the\r\ninformation to create an image of a two-dimensional section of\r\npart of the body.  The mathematics behind this process is called\r\ncomputerized tomography.  It is very successful, but not perfect;\r\nthe reconstructed image is only approximate, and to get a better\r\npicture with the same procedure one has to take more X-rays,\r\ncausing greater expense and likelihood of side effects.  In\r\ngeometric tomography, only homogeneous objects are allowed - the\r\ndensity of the object is the same everywhere inside it.  An\r\nexample from medicine would be a bone or a kidney.  One can use\r\nthis information to find better reconstruction procedures.  The\r\nscope of geometric tomography is actually much wider.  Any\r\nmeasurement involving sections of a homogeneous object by lines\r\nor planes or its shadows on lines or planes can be considered.\r\nBecause of this, it has many links to other areas, both in\r\nmathematics (there is a large overlap with convex geometry, the\r\ngeometry of shapes without holes or dents) and outside.  For\r\nexample, a new technique called local stereology depends on\r\nmeasurements of planar sections of biological tissue; each section\r\npasses through a fixed point, usually the nucleus of a cell, and\r\nthe measurements can be made optically rather than physically.\r\nThis project continues the development of several aspects of the\r\nmathematics of geometric tomography. Also included is a program\r\ndesigned to stimulate undergraduate research.\r\n \r\n",
