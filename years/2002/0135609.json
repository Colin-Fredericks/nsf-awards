 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the workshop is to facilitate use of Internet-enabled technologies in conducting fundamental and applied research, disseminating results and data between collaborating universities, and transferring research and applications to the interested public.  Specifically, the workshop will foster interaction among ESS researchers at GPN alliance-member Universities who are interested in 1) enhancing their individual research efforts, 2) developing new collaborative research efforts, and 3) exploring the potential for GPN resources in enhancing research infrastructure at member Universities.  GPN Alliance Universities include:  \r\nNorth Dakota University, North Dakota State University, University of North Dakota, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, South Dakota State University, University of South Dakota, University of Kansas, University of Kansas Medical Center Kansas State University, University of Nebraska - Lincoln, University of Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, University of Tulsa, Oklahoma State University, University of Arkansas, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, University of Missouri-Columbia, University of Missouri\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the objective and goals of the workshop, researchers will be provided an overview of the network and its resources, exposed to examples of technologies that are currently available, and will hear from fellow GPN ESS researchers about research projects and tools being developed in the other universities.\r\n\r\nTo support and facilitate follow-up meetings, discussions, future proposals and collaborative efforts, and to facilitate use of the high performance network in the ESS  research community, each workshop attendee will be provided with a PolyCom ViaVideo (H.323) videoconference unit.  The PolyCom ViaVideo is USB-based desktop videoconference unit that utilizes Internet2 networking and provides business-quality video.  The equipment will provide attendees with an important tool to assist in follow-up discussions and in continuing collaborative research and proposal development efforts.\r\n",
