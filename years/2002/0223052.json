 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate a new class of stochastic probabilistic models, that make inferences and extract high-order dependencies from high-dimensional data. This research builds upon work that recasts existing unsupervised algorithms such as factor analysis, principle component analysis, and independent component analysis as energy-based feedback models. The diffusion network perspective investigated in this project affords new nonlinear generalizations of existing models, generalizations which are easily extended to overcomplete and undercomplete cases, and in which inference is relatively simple. Learning in diffusion based approaches is efficient and neurally plausible, making them good candidates for engineering applications and for modeling of neural and cognitive processes.\r\n\r\nThe new models will be explored using a synergistic combination of theoretical work and computer simulations. Their practicality will be tested by applying them to a variety of exciting and difficult machine perception tasks, including efficient representation of natural scenes, person identification and facial expression recognition, and reconstructing three-dimensionally transformed faces from 2-D video.\r\n\r\nBecause of their unique capabilities to model high-dimensional data in a nonlinear fashion, the diffusion networks studied in this project are likely to be important in a diverse group of fields including data mining, computer vision, and computational neuroscience, and could outperform existing algorithms in a wide variety of applications, including human computer interaction, image processing, and law enforcement.\r\n",
