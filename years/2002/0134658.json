 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Patrick Holland, Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a Career Award to utilize coordination chemistry to uncover novel modes of reactivity and address issues in enzymatic, surface and solution catalysis.  Three-coordinate transition metal complexes will be used to develop knowledge applicable to metalloproteins and catalysts.  A particular focus is on modelling the reduction of unsaturated organic compounds by the enzyme nitrogenase.  Research and education will be integrated by training undergraduates to be involved in the research effort and incorporating team learning into undergraduate and graduate inorganic chemistry courses at the University of Rochester.\r\n\r\nThis research cuts across such fields as biology and chemical catalysis and focuses on metal sites with less than a full complement of ligands.  Dr. Holland's research aims at a fundamental understanding of the reactivity of such sites that will aid in understanding how enzymes function and in developing new types of catalysts.  Team learning in undergraduate and graduate courses will involve students in chemistry as a social activity to better integrate science  into their lives.\r\n",
