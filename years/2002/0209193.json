Project Summary\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop and demonstrate\r\ncapabilities for analyzing complex interactions between heterogeneous\r\nembedded systems specification domains.  Three research activities are\r\nbeing undertaken: (i) development of domain models for important\r\nembedded systems requirements domains; (ii) development of semantics\r\nfor combining heterogeneous embedded systems specifications; and (iii)\r\ndevelopment of techniques for predictive analysis of composed\r\nspecifications.  The results of this research are being evaluated\r\nusing problems from the Ambient Computing Environments (ACE) research\r\ncenter at The University of Kansas / ITTC.\r\n\r\nThe facet-based approach being investigated involves modeling and\r\nintegrating heterogeneous specifications using domain specific\r\nsemantic systems.  Each system model, or facet, is defined by\r\nextending a domain.  A domain provides a vocabulary and model of\r\ncomputation for describing a system from one perspective.  Facets use\r\ndomains as modeling semantics and are composed to describe components\r\nand systems.  Specifically, individual models are composed to define:\r\n(i) multiple aspects of the same component; and (ii) heterogeneous,\r\nmulti-component systems.  Projection functions and morphisms support\r\nspecification transformation and composition using category and\r\ninstitution theoretic semantics.  Special projection functions, called\r\ninteractions, model how and when models from one domain interact with\r\nmodels from another. Interactions support integrated component\r\nanalysis and modeling communication between heterogeneous components.\r\n\r\nDeveloping domain models, domain interaction models, and prototype\r\nanalysis tools demonstrates the effectiveness of the facet-based\r\napproach for modeling embedded systems.  The first and second research\r\ntasks encompass the development of domain and domain interaction\r\nmodels for defining embedded components.  Both functional and\r\nperformance constraint models are being supported.  Domain models are\r\nbeing developed to represent basic models of computation and\r\nvocabularies for specification. Interaction models consisting of\r\nprojection functions and specification morphisms are being defined to\r\nmove information between domains.  The third research task is the\r\ndevelopment of software systems for analyzing specifications.  Two\r\ncomplimentary approaches are being explored: (i) formal analysis; and\r\n(ii) simulation.  Formal analysis is achieved by mapping domain\r\ndefinitions to existing formal analysis environments.  Specification\r\nsimulation is achieved by mapping domain definitions to communicating,\r\nheterogeneous simulation environments.\r\n\r\nChallenge problems from the NSF and DARPA sponsored Ambient Computing\r\nEnvironments (ACE) research infrastructure at ITTC are being used to\r\nevaluate ongoing research.  ACE provides an environment where\r\ncomputing moves seamlessly with individuals within a physical\r\nenvironment.  ACE is implemented as a collection of highly mobile,\r\nheterogeneous embedded systems that perform tasks including personal\r\ndata management, control of robotic devices, and various sensor\r\nrelated tasks The results of this research have widespread impact on\r\nthe research and industrial communities.  The Rosetta systems level\r\nspecification language is being used for domain models, interaction\r\ndefinitions and system specifications for embedded systems.  Rosetta\r\nis being standardized by the Accellera CAD standards organization as a\r\nnext-generation systems level design language.  Successful results\r\nfrom this research activity are being disseminated as a part of the\r\nbase Rosetta domain system and are being integrated into the\r\ncollection of standard Rosetta domain models.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
