 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0206464\r\nWalter Neuman\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of this project concerns a continuation of the investigator's\r\nsuccessful application of topological methods to the study of\r\nsingularities of complex surfaces and the topology of plane affine\r\ncurves. One issue to be addressed is explicit analytic description of\r\nsingularities with given topology. The general question is notoriously\r\ndifficult, but the investigator and J. Wahl have identified a\r\nremarkably broad class of topologies where significant advance can be\r\nmade.  Another issue is the study of the global topology of\r\ntwo-variable polynomials, as well as classification issues, which are\r\nboth of intrinsic interest and also have potential to contribute\r\nto the resolution of the famous Jacobian Conjecture.  A significant\r\ntool in this work are the splice diagrams of Eisenbud and the\r\ninvestigator and a recent generalization of them.  In a rather\r\ndifferent direction, the investigator will study invariants of\r\n3-dimensional manifolds that relate to number theory and algebra,\r\nnamely the so-called character and eigenvalue varieties and the Bloch\r\ninvariant. Connections are emerging between these invariants that will\r\ninform both topology and algebra/number theory.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic Geometry, which is essentially the study of the zero sets of\r\nfamilies of polynomials, has always been an important area of\r\nfundamental research, and is also important in such diverse\r\napplications as control theory and communications.  Such zero-sets\r\narise, for instance, as the parameter spaces of processes and the\r\ncontrol spaces of automata. The singularities (places where the nature\r\nof the topology changes), are of fundamental significance. This\r\nproject has two thrusts: to understand better the link between the\r\nanalytic description and the topology of singularities, and to\r\ninvestigate invariants of low dimensional manifolds that link topology\r\nwith other fields.\r\n",
