 "awd_abstract_narration": "0140179\r\nHubler \r\n\r\nOne aspect of biocomplexity is the ability of biota to self-adjust to their\r\nenvironment.  Previous studies of adaptive behavior have shown that\r\nadaptive systems will evolve over time to states that are weakly chaotic, a\r\ncondition known as the edge of chaos.  These studies typically use a\r\ngenetic algorithm (computer-based evolution) to implement adaptation.  It\r\nis conjectured that most self-adjusting dynamical systems that initially\r\nhave chaotic behavior will also adapt toward the edge of chaos.  A model\r\nfor self-adjusting dynamical systems is introduced which treats the control\r\nparameters as slowly varying, rather than constant.  The dynamics of these\r\nparameters is assumed to be governed by some low-pass filtered feedback\r\nfrom the dynamical variables of the system.  Under the influence of noise,\r\nat least in numerical models, the probability of chaotic breakout shows a\r\nuniversal scaling with the duration of the breakouts.\r\n\r\nApplications of the model to biochemical oscillators as the simplest\r\npossible adaptive system relevent to environmental dynamics will be\r\ninvestigated.  A high degree of interdisciplinarity is required, as the\r\nresearch involves expertise in dynamical systems, plant biology,\r\ninstrumental measurements, cybernetics, enzymology, chemistry, and physics.\r\n The system is chosen to be \"biocomplex,\" yet simple enough that meaningful\r\nmeasurements can be made and quantitative models can be evaluated.\r\n\r\nWe intend to experimentally demonstrate adaptation using the\r\nperoxidase-oxidase oscillator as an example.  This system is known to\r\nexhibit non-linear, complex, and even chaotic behavior.  We will explore if\r\nthe in situ behavior of this enzyme provides the first experimental\r\nevidence for adaptation to the edge of chaos in a naturally occurring\r\nsystem.  Detailed chemical models are available to guide our experiments.\r\nWe will experimentally implement low-pass filtered feedback from the\r\ndynamical variables to the control parameters through:\r\n1. a computer based probe-actuator system, and \r\n2. the comparatively slow response of the metabolism of a thin section\r\n   of horseradish root tissues suspended in a reactor, and check for\r\n   adaptation to the edge of chaos, and critical scaling of chaotic\r\n   outbreaks of chemical oscillations.\r\n\r\nOutreach activities to local secondary schools will be incorporated into\r\nour existing collaborations with high school science teachers.  If our\r\ninitial experiments on plant peroxidases show the anticipated complexity,\r\nwe will then explore the related complexity in the behavior of peroxidases\r\nand oxidases in human neutrophils, cells associated with anti-bacterial\r\nactivity and response to systemic afronts.\r\n",
