From its early stages, analytical and numerical methods in this field have developed together, and analytical understanding contributes in the design of high performance computational algorithms.  In recent years there has seen a very fruitful exchange between ideas in the theory of kinetic equations and the theory of weak solutions for hyperbolic systems.  At the core of this exchange is the issue of deriving continuum theories from microscopic models of kinetic theory of gases or statistical physics. This project will make use of this exchange of ideas to develop mathematical techniques to better understand the wide variety of important physical systems that are modeled by conservation laws.\r\n\r\n",
