 "awd_abstract_narration": "9983840\r\nDesai\r\nA great deal of consideration has been given in recent years to the biological uses of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).  However, such devices are not yet found in many clinical settings due to the lack of appropriate interfacing between these devices and the biological world. The capability of surfaces to interact intelligently with their environment is essential for any diagnostic or therapeutic device to be placed in contact with biologic cells and tissues. The overall thrust of this research, therefore, is to develop, characterize, and integrate functional biomolecular surfaces with implantable MEMS, in a manner that is both reproducible and fully integrated with existing technologies.\r\n\r\nA strategy will be explored based on the covalently coupling of small bioactive peptides to microdevices.  Such peptides will be incorporated onto silicon substrates to modulate the interfacial response, while at the same time ensuring compatibility with microfabrication and micromachining processing. A central goal will be able to create stable multifunctional surfaces by attaching peptide/cell recognition sequences or multifunctional biopolymers to surfaces in order to modulate cellular response at various locations.  By integrating surface modification with MEMS processing, we can create device surfaces that interact appropriately with multiple populations of cells and the surrounding tissue. Besides identifying principles for engineering surfaces that are biofunctional, this research will foster advances in developing therapeutic bioMEMS, lab on a chip platforms, and drug delivery systems that can more effectively interface with the biological world.\r\n\r\nThe proposed educational plan aims to enhance the educational experience of students at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  In addition to substantial curriculum development for a new focus area in bioengineering called Interfacial Tissue Engineering, there will be new initiatives in industrial and educational outreach.  Specifically, an industrial advisory committee will be formed to help foster industrially relevant bioengineering activities and opportunities for students including internship and cooperative research experiences in the Chicago area. The PI will promote greater interest in bioengineering by increasing student and teacher exposure at the high school level.  Working with the Chicago Public School System, bioengineering career/educational materials will be developed, including an informational website.  We hope to use these tools to attract students not traditionally represented in bioengineering and raise awareness in the community.    \r\n\r\n",
