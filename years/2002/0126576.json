As part of this institutional effort, the Chemistry Department is transforming course material to contextual formats. In this project, the faculty in chemistry are working together with Forensic Scientists from a regional crime laboratory to incorporate GC/MS experiments across the two-year college chemistry curriculum, including Organic Chemistry, Forensic Chemistry, College Chemistry, and General Chemistry courses. The objectives of the proposal are to: 1. adapt, adopt, and pilot test laboratory experiments in organic, forensic, general, and college chemistry courses; 2. provide faculty development on the use, calibration, and maintenance of the GC/MS; and 3. expand outreach to high school chemistry teachers and students through a Sinclair program called the Friday Visitation Program. The project is meeting the needs of high school and two-year college students for GC/MS experience as they matriculate to universities and enter the workforce as technicians. The results of the project will be disseminated through presentations at professional conferences and articles in journals. \r\n",
