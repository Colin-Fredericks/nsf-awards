These projects include \r\ninvestigating various properties of the Turaev-Viro\r\ninvariants including the construction of universal \r\npolynomials relating the representation theory of the \r\nfundamental groups of manifolds to these invariants and the \r\nextension of these invariants away from the unit circle. \r\nIn addition, the PI will consider, given a tetrahedral \r\ndecomposition of a knot, how one may define a rigorous\r\npath integral over the space of cross ratios of the tetrahedra \r\nto compute the Turaev-Viro invariant of an integral surgery \r\non the knot.  The PI will also investigate the structure of \r\nthe Kauffman bracket skein module in terms of the geometry \r\nof  character varieties,and, more generally, use quantum \r\ninvariants in the study of Dehn surgery on knots.  Finally, \r\nthis award provides support for the PI's graduate students \r\nto assist him in this research.   \r\n\r\nTopology is a kind of geometry where the congruence \r\ntransformations do not preserve metric properties such \r\nas distance and angle. The objects the PI studies are \r\ngiven as the result of gluing together polyhedra along faces. \r\nTo know when two such objects are different topologically one \r\nneeds to make measurements that are unchanged by \r\ntopological congruence transformations. An example of \r\nsuch a measurement is the Euler characteristic of a \r\nsurface, which is the number of vertices minus the\r\nnumber of edges plus the number of faces. If two surfaces \r\nare topologically equivalent they have the same Euler \r\ncharacteristic.  One of the most celebrated theorems of \r\ngeometry is the Gauss-Bonnet theorem which relates the \r\nEuler characteristic of any surface to a quantity \r\ncomputed metrically. Quantum invariants of three manifolds \r\nare like Euler characteristic, but more delicate. They \r\nare constructed statistically from a probability space \r\nmade up of \"states\" which come from the description \r\nof how polyhedra are glued together to form the object. \r\nThe PI's work is about relating these invariants to \r\nmetric quantities derived from the geometry of the\r\nunderlying object. To this end, the PI shows that \r\nthe space of states can be replaced by spaces of \r\ngeometric measurements made on the object. The goal \r\nof the project is to see how the geometry and topology \r\nof the object are determined by its combinatorial \r\ndescription in terms of polyhedra.\r\n",
