 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is to create new synthetic routes for the preparation of resorcinol and phloroglucinol from glucose.  A pathway using the intermediacy of gallic acid/pyrogallol, 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose/hydroxyhydroquinone or myo-2-inosose/1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybenzene will be explored as will a pathway involving the intermediacy of hexahydroxybenzene and pentahydroxybenzene derived from myo-inositol and myo-2-inosose.  Microbes will be constructed that are capable of high-yielding, high-titer conversions of glucose into gallic acid, myo-inositol, 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose and myo-2-inosose.  Also, experiments will be conducted to compare the microbial synthesis and reaction in near-critical water of 3-dehydroquinic, 3-dehydroshikimic and protocatechuic acids as routes for the synthesis of catechol from glucose.  \r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. John W. Frost of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University.  Professor Frost will focus his work on devising methodology to prepare aromatic chemicals from carbohydrate precursors.  These methods will allow for the replacement of toxic starting materials such as benzene.  The research has broad and important potential impact for the chemical industry and for the environment in general.  The research also provides an excellent training ground for graduate students and postdoctorals.",
