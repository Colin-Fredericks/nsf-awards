 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2002.  The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"The directionality of acoustic communication in passerine birds.\"  The goal of the research is to develop a system for mapping the radiation of sound from vocalizing animals.  The system is to be used to measure the directionality of different call types from passerine birds in open and forest habitats, and to test hypotheses about the functional significance of directionality in acoustic communication.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
