This technology was investigated extensively by the oil industry and university groups between approximately 1960 and 1986, when most work was discontinued owing to a decrease in oil prices to less than $10 per barrel.  Now the prices seem unlikely to drop below $20-$25 per barrel, it is desirable to reconsider technology, especially in view of developments since 1986, including application of surfactants for remediation of ground water aquifers, which indicate that both costs and uncertainty in process performance can be reduced.  Approximately 30 people from universities, NSF, DOE, major oil companies, and smaller companies, which operate many of the fields in the U.S. where the technology would be most attractive, are invited to the workshop.  A final report will be prepared and submitted to the National Science Foundation. \r\n",
