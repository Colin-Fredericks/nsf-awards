 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will focus on several problems concerning\r\nthe boundary behavior of analytic functions and their\r\napplications in functional analysis and mathematical\r\nphysics. In analytic function theory the PI plans to\r\nstudy the interaction between singular and non-singular\r\ncomponents of Cauchy integrals near the boundary of a\r\ncomplex domain. The results will then be applied to\r\nstudy the resolvent functions of linear operators in\r\nperturbation problems. This area has connections with\r\nmathematical models of solid state physics, which\r\nprovides most of the motivation. Another part of the\r\nproject is the study of the connections between the\r\nBeurling-Malliavin theory, inverse spectral problems\r\nfor partial differential equations and properties of\r\nkernels of Toepliz operators.\r\n\r\nAnalytic Function Theory is one of the classical yet\r\nrapidly developing parts of modern mathematics. The\r\npresent stage of its development features many\r\npromising new applications in various parts of\r\nmathematics and physics. One of the cornerstones of\r\nAnalytic Function Theory is the integral formula\r\nnamed after the famous French mathematician Cauchy.\r\nThe importance of this formula is due to the fact\r\nthat most analytic functions in complex domains can\r\nbe defined through Cauchy integrals. The  PI plans\r\nto study various properties of Cauchy integrals near\r\nthe boundaries of their domains. The results will\r\nthen be applied in several areas of mathematics as\r\nwell as in mathematical physics. The applications\r\nin mathematical physics will concern, among other\r\nthings, mathematical models of wave propagation.\r\nThe general question that will be considered is how\r\nto recover full information about a disordered\r\nenvironment from the spectrum of the wave operator and\r\npartial information on the potential field.",
