The College will undertake a comprehensive assessment of community needs as well as institutional strengths and weaknesses in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nAssessment outcomes will drive systemic reform strategies, lead to more effective use of limited resources and further the development of the nation's technologically based workforce.  Primary goals of the project are threefold: (1) assessment of community and employer needs and opportunities for STEM-related education and professionals; (2) identification of strategies for increasing student enrollment, retention and graduation in STEM foundation courses and program areas; and, (3) evaluation of STEM student performance to eliminate bottlenecks and strengthen STEM competencies.\r\n",
