 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geography (88)\r\nThis project supports NSF's goal of integrating technology into education. It enhances and revitalizes the undergraduate GIS curricula at University of Wisconsin Oshkosh (UW Oshkosh) by adapting and implementing high-quality educational materials and effective educational practices in geographic information science, including the GIS core curriculum developed by the NSF supported National Center of Geographic Information and Analysis, and the remote sensing core curriculum being developed by the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing. This project is engaged in a major curriculum renovation that will integrate GIS, remote sensing and Global Positioning System technologies into undergraduate education and research. In particular, this proposal demonstrates two major changes in the development of the new GIS curricula. First, three current geographic technique courses are being enhanced and two new technique courses developed to provide students with laboratory-based learning and additional opportunities to enhance their critical thinking abilities. Students now have the opportunity to learn cutting-edge technologies in geography. Second, a new GIS Laboratory is being assembled using high-end personal computers in a network environment for use in the new technique courses. This lab is also enhancing opportunities for student-faculty collaborative research. The University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh is a comprehensive, suburban, commuter campus. These improvements in teaching geographic information science may serve as a model for many similar institutions.\r\n",
