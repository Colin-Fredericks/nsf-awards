 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is aimed at producing novel images of a scene from arbitrary new \r\nviewpoints using a sparse set of compressed panoramic snapshots or sample \r\nimages of the scene. The samples are taken from a relatively small number of \r\nstrategically placed cameras. A major application and evaluation testbed of \r\nthe proposed work is to enable walkthroughs of a 3D scene by generating the \r\nimages of the scene along a trajectory dynamically chosen by a remote user. \r\nThe focus of the proposed work is on the acquisition of panoramic stereo \r\nimages which serve as scene samples, and their interpolation (or \r\nextrapolation) for producing a new stereo pair of images of the scene from an \r\narbitrary new viewpoint. The user follows a dynamically chosen arbitrary \r\ntrajectory and wishes to continuously teleview the scene from along the \r\ntrajectory points. It is assumed that relative locations of the objects in the \r\nscene for which walkthroughs are to be generated are known; the object \r\nlocations are sparse; and that the strategic placement of the cameras does not \r\nchange significantly to warrant camera replacement. Development and \r\nimplementation of a stereo panoramic camera is proposed. Limited work is \r\nproposed on joint image compression. The topology of the camera network also \r\nallows the determination of which cameras are to be used to generate the \r\nwalkthrough image at any given point along the user drawn trajectory. \r\nApplications of the proposed work include video surveillance, virtual museums \r\nand video conferencing.\r\n",
