 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project lays out our plan for research and development aimed atdramatically improving the process\r\nand outcome of scientific data analysis and visualization. The improvement will be achieved by coupling an expressive and extensible metadata management framework with novel visualization interfaces that facilitate\r\neffective reuse, sharing, and cross-exploration of visualizationinformation and thus will make a profound\r\nimpact on a broad range of scientific applications. The process of scientific visualization is inherently iterative. A good visualization comes from experimenting with visualization and rendering parameters to bring out the most relevant information in the data.\r\nThis raises a question. Considering the computer and human time we routinely invest for exploratory and\r\nproduction visualization, are there methodologies and mechanisms to enhance not only the productivity of\r\nscientists but also their understanding of the visualization process anddata used?\r\nRecent advances in the field of data visualization have been made mainly in rendering and display\r\ntechnologies (such as realtime volume rendering and immersive environments), but little in coherently managing, representing, and sharing information about the visualization process\r\nand results (images and insights).\r\nNaturally, the various information about data exploration should be shared and reused to leverage\r\nthe knowledge and experience scientists gain from visualizing scientific data. A visual representation of the\r\ndata exploration process along with expressive models for recording and querying task specific information\r\nhelp scientists keep track of their visualization experience and findings, use it to generate new visualizations, and share it with others.\r\nWhile previous research has addressed some related issues, a more comprehensive study remains to be\r\ndone. Thus, we propose two complementary avenues of research: (1) new user interfaces for data visualization tasks, and (2) expressive metadata models supporting the recording and\r\nquerying of information related to data exploration tasks. In addition, a set of user studies will be\r\nconducted on a Web-based visualization testbed realizing (1) and (2) in order to refine the proposed\r\nmethodologies and designs.\r\nTraditional user interfaces cannot support the increasingly complex process of scientific data exploration.\r\nA fundamental change in the conventional designs and functionality must be made to offer more\r\nintuitive interaction, guidance, and enhanced perception. We will begin our study with enriching the graphbased and spreadsheet-like interfaces we have developed, and also investigate alternative designs. An expressive and extensible metadata model representing the data exploration process and its embedded data visualization process is needed.                                                                                                                        Such a model along with an appropriate user interface makes it possible to manage diverse information about the input and results of the visualization process, analyze parameter coverage and usage, identify unexplored visualization spaces, and incorporate findings on the process and results in form of visualization metadata. The model is independent of the actual visual interface used and is open in that its realization in form of a metadata repository can be loosely coupled with a variety of different visualization tools. A set of interfaces and protocols to the repository will be designed to manage, query, and analyze visualization metadata gathered from and utilized by different visualization tools.\r\nOur goal is ambitious and can only be accomplished by working closely with application scientists.\r\nThey will help us understand application-dependent and independent visualization requirements, processes,\r\nand information. In return, we will offer them a new and greatly improved way to understand their scientific\r\ndata, which will help them lead to new discoveries quicker, likely with reduced cost.\r\n\r\n",
