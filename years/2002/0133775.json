In particular, the proposal focuses on developing approaches to investigate the mechanisms by which VEGF induces permeability of individually perfused microvessels in frog mesentery and how that permeability is influenced by cAMP.   \r\n\r\nThe educational component of the plan focuses on creating research education seminars and conferences, supervising graduate students, creating new graduate level courses, relevant introductory undergraduate courses and providing research training for undergraduate and high school students, including outreach efforts to women and minorities and developing international research/education  collaborations with West China Medical University and the National University of Singapore.\r\n",
