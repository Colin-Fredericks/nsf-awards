 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe University of Washington (UW) requests funding for the Northwest Alliance for Access\r\nto Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to increase the quantity and\r\nquality of people with disabilities in STEM careers.\r\nIntellectual Merit and Qualifications of Partners\r\nThe lead agency is the UW's award-winning DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking\r\nand Technology) program, which has conducted successful NSF PPD projects since 1992.\r\nRegional site teams at the two largest STEM research institutions in the State of Washington, the\r\nUW and Washington State University (WSU), will collaborate with K-12 and postsecondary\r\nschools, employers, and leading STEM research institutions in neighboring states - the\r\nUniversity of Idaho, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and the University of\r\nAlaska in Anchorage and Fairbanks. The project will partner with ENTRY POINT! to place STEM\r\npostsecondary students with disabilities in paid internships. It will collaborate with MESA\r\n(Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement) adapting for students with disabilities the\r\nhands-on science activities and teacher training strategies it uses with racial/ethnic minority and\r\nfemale students. The Alliance builds on established collaborations and brings together practices\r\nthat have proven successful individually, to create a unique, comprehensive set of interventions.\r\nObjectives and examples of interventions include:\r\n1. The Northwest Alliance will increase the number of students with disabilities pursuing\r\nSTEM academic programs and careers. Interventions: Motivational college/career transition\r\nand STEM fairs for precollege students and STEM academic/career activities for college\r\nstudents that identify participants for the AccessSTEM Team in objective 2 interventions.\r\n2. The Alliance will provide on-going support and encourage high school and college\r\nstudents with disabilities who show interest and aptitude in STEM with peer and\r\nmentor interaction, work experiences, and other activities as they transition to college,\r\ngraduate school, and employment. Interventions: Students join the AccessSTEM Team to\r\nengage in an on-line community, mentoring, fields trips, research, paid internships, and other\r\nactivities to assure their success in STEM careers and promote the success of others.\r\n3. The Alliance will provide precollege educators and staff with strategies, tools and\r\nsupport to create more inclusive programs for students with disabilities, where they are\r\nencouraged to pursue STEM studies and careers. Interventions: Training and curriculum\r\nmaterials through established networks of MESA, Educational Services Districts, teacher\r\ntraining programs, and professional organizations; provide educators with opportunities to\r\nwork with students who have disabilities.\r\n4. The Alliance will help STEM postsecondary faculty, support staff, counselors, and\r\nemployers fully include students with disabilities in their courses and programs and create\r\naccessible facilities and electronic resources. Interventions: Opportunities for faculty to\r\nreceive training and work with students with disabilities in research; assistance in making\r\nfacilities, equipment, distance learning, and Web pages accessible.\r\nEach intervention is associated with measurables that provide evidence of effectiveness. The\r\nNational Center on Postsecondary Educational Supports (NCSPES) will evaluate project\r\noutcomes and impacts, conduct research on factors that promote success for students with\r\ndisabilities, describe replication models, and help disseminate results.\r\nBroader Impacts Resulting from the Northwest Alliance\r\nCollaborations with MESA and other programs will broaden the participation of racial/ethnic\r\nminorities and females with disabilities in STEM. Wide distribution of a replication model, curriculum\r\nmaterials, and other project products and creation of a searchable Knowledge Base on the project\r\nWeb site will enhance scientific and technological understanding and maximize project impact.\r\nProject outcomes will benefit society by making STEM opportunities available to all citizens and\r\nincreasing the number of STEM professionals and leaders who have disabilities.",
