 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research focuses on new approaches for exposing concurrency and improving performance in modern\r\nsuperscalar microprocessors.  These approaches include semantic decomposition of instruction \r\nsets and bitslice decomposition of data paths to expose elements of the processor's control and data path \r\nto allow flexible, programmable control over at least a subset of the microarchitectural features \r\nthat are available.  Preliminary analysis shows that there are significant opportunities for reducing ALU \r\ncycle time, power consumption, and the deleterious effects of wire delay with little or no harmful \r\neffects on throughput measured in instructions per cycle.  Further, the research proposes pre-execution \r\nusing partial operand knowledge to resolve conditional branches, identify references that miss the cache, and mitigate the effects of other problematic instructions.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the proposed educational plan are to integrate advanced topics into the \r\nUniversity of Wisconsin's computer architecture curriculum at the graduate and undergraduate level; \r\nto continue to involve undergraduate students in research to enhance their educational experience \r\nvia exposure to leading-edge research topics; to incorporate advanced pedagogic techniques into the \r\nclassroom environment in order to accommodate all learning styles; and to exploit emerging web-based \r\ntechnologies to streamline interactive and off-line communication between instructor and students.\r\n",
