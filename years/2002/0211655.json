 "awd_abstract_narration": "McLaughlin\r\n0211655\r\n     The investigator and colleagues have been developing a\r\nbiologically constrained large-scale computational model of the\r\n\"front-end\" of the cortical visual system -- the primary visual\r\ncortex (V1).  To date, their work has focused upon local\r\nproperties of individual cells within the large-scale network --\r\nproperties such as orientation selectivity and simple vs complex\r\ncellular dynamics.  In this project, they scale up to a more\r\nglobal model of V1, reaching scales large enough to study some\r\nelementary optical illusions of psychology and psychophysics.\r\nThis involves several square millimeters of lateral cortical\r\narea, together with a multi-layered architecture -- with emphasis\r\ngiven to cortical dynamics.  First, a \"coarse-grained mixed\r\nrepresentation\"  is derived mathematically and tested numerically\r\n-- a representation that combines spatially coarse-grained\r\n(local) mean firing rates, representing local background cortical\r\noperating points, with an idealized representation of a\r\nsub-network of individual point neurons embedded within this\r\nbackground and retaining the detailed firing patterns of\r\nindividual neurons.  These two components interact with each\r\nother -- with the coarse-grained local operating points\r\ninfluencing the responses of the individual neurons, and vice\r\nversa.  Second, the global mixed representation is used to study\r\nspecific dynamical phenomena in visual cortical processing: (i)\r\nthe layer-specific \"dynamics of orientation selectivity\" (as\r\nmeasured by reverse time correlation methods); and later (ii)\r\n\"bistability in figure-ground assignments\" (as detected in\r\npsychology and psychophysics experiments).  In both cases, the\r\nphenomena involve extensive lateral regions of V1, its layered\r\nstructure, and (likely in the case of figure-ground assignment)\r\nother cortical regions.  And in both cases the work involves\r\nclose interaction with the experimental work of neural scientist\r\nRobert Shapley.\r\n     Today, through new biological experiments combined with the\r\npower of modern scientific computation, scientists and applied\r\nmathematicians are making significant strides toward\r\nunderstanding the human brain.  Visual perception and the cortical\r\nprocessing of visual information provide important starting\r\npoints.  By focusing upon the \"front end\" of the cortical visual\r\nsystem, McLaughlin and his colleagues develop computational\r\nmodels of the visual cortex that are strongly constrained by\r\nbiological experiments.  In this project the investigators\r\ndevelop computationally efficient numerical methods that permit\r\nscale-up of the models to global representations of the primary\r\nvisual cortex -- reaching cortical scales large enough to study\r\nsome elementary optical illusions of psychology.  This work\r\nrequires the direct interaction of applied mathematicians,\r\ncomputational scientists, and neural scientists -- and involves\r\ntheoretical, computational, and experimental components.\r\n",
