 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this program is to increase the number of economically disadvantaged\r\nstudents entering the technological workforce through the achievement of two specific\r\nobjectives:\r\n1) increase the number of economically disadvantaged students graduating with\r\nmathematics degrees from Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) and\r\n2) increase the number of Northeastern Illinois University mathematics graduates\r\ngoing on to Ph.D. programs in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThese objectives will be accomplished by creating a program at NEIU that\r\nsupports, motivates and monitors student progress through their undergraduate or masters\r\ndegree and by providing a bridge program to the doctoral degree in mathematics at the\r\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago.\r\n\r\nTwelve students, ten undergraduate and two graduate students, have been selected as\r\nChicago Math Scholars. Undergraduate scholars were recruited from undergraduate\r\nmathematics majors, from promising incoming high school students and from targeted\r\ncommunity college transfer students. Scholars had GPA of 3.0 and were\r\neconomically disadvantaged as determined by their eligibility for Pell grant awards.\r\nGraduate Chicago Math Scholars were selected from among those students admitted to\r\nthe masters degree programs in mathematics at NEIU. Students were economically\r\ndisadvantaged by virtue of their eligibility for Graduate Assistance in Areas of National\r\nNeed (GANN) and express an interest in pursuing a Ph.D. degree in mathematics.\r\nKey strategies for achieving the program objectives include: the provision of\r\ntuition waivers and monetary stipends; mentoring of students by both undergraduate and\r\ngraduate faculty; academic and personal support; career guidance and enrichment;\r\ntechnology training; professional development through activities such as membership in\r\nprofessional associations and conference attendance; job placement assistance;\r\ninteraction with Ph.D. program faculty and students; GRE preparation courses; graduate\r\nseminars and orientation programs; and research participation.\r\n\r\nNortheastern Illinois University is an urban, comprehensive university, serving\r\nthe northwest side of metropolitan Chicago. Seventy nine percent of its enrollment is\r\ncomprised of first generation college students. Sixty four percent are female, 75.6%\r\nwork full or part-time, and 60% receive some form of financial aid. NEIU is the only\r\nfour year, federally designated, Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) in the Midwest. By\r\nvirtue of its demographics, the students most likely to benefit from this program are\r\nunder-represented minorities.\r\nThe National Science Foundation's report \"Science and Engineering Indicators\r\n2000l\" notes that only 2.2% of all graduate students in mathematics and computer science\r\nare Hispanic. In 1997, only 34 Ph.D. degrees were awarded to Hispanics in math or\r\ncomputer science. By facilitating student retention, graduation and transfer to Ph.D.\r\nprograms in mathematics, this program has the potential to significantly impact the\r\nnumber of under-represented minorities attaining advanced degrees in mathematics and\r\nwho are prepared to enter the U. S. technological workforce at the highest levels.",
