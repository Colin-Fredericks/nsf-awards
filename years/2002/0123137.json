 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe scholarship program is structured to support 32 minority and/or female student participants.\r\nScholars are selected from students who have or will receive associate degrees in science\r\nand technology from appropriate programs and who express intent to major in one of the\r\nCSEMS disciplines. Students are recruited primarily, but not exclusively, from the\r\nlocal/state community college(s) participating in articulation agreement(s) with Southern\r\nUniversity. Scholars are selected based on financial need and academic achievement.\r\nStudents are co-advised by academic mentors. They participate in structured mentoring programs and various student development seminars/workshops, register with the SU Career Services Office, and participate in Career Services-offered career workshops.\r\nThe scholarship program helps improve retention rates for capable\r\nstudents citing financial difficulties as reasons not to complete bachelor's degrees in CSEMS\r\nfields. Retention will also improve due to better preparedness of students having received\r\nneeded remedial instruction before they come to the four-year college.",
