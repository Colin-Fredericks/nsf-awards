The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).\r\nThe partners include the University of New Mexico (Lead Institution), Sandia National Laboratory, City of Albuquerque, Connect New Mexico, National Hispanic Culture Center, New Mexico Trains, Aquila Group, Bandelier EFX, Big Byte, ContiFilms, Drumfire, IBM, Intel, National Indian Telecommunications Institute, Pixar, Poeh Center, Pueblo of Zuni, Vizeon, and The Studio.  The proposed goal is to create a Digital Arts and Technology Pueblo that will create an infrastructure in New Mexico for economic development and innovation in the digital arts and science industry. Three state-of-the-art centers with equipment and facilities for digital arts, which are similar to incubators to create and nurture innovations in the digital arts are being developed. Curricula in digital arts for training and education are being developed and implemented. Infrastructure to enable the innovation, technology commercialization and entrepreneural process is being established. \r\n\r\nNew Mexico is rich in culture and art as well as science and technology. Much of the well-trained talent has been forced to leave the state owing to lack of job opportunities.  The state's isolation is an obstacle to entrance into the information technology sector. This partnership establishes the infrastructure for innovation leading to economic well being in the digital arts and sciences industry. The effort brings expertise in digital science and technology with the expertise in graphic arts to create an infrastructure for digital graphics industry in New Mexico.  The new companies and new jobs will bring economic well being to the region.  A strong emphasis is placed on recruitment and involvement of Native Americans and Hispanics in the new industry in New Mexico.\r\n",
