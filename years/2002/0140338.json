For instance,  a flame front propagating in a layered medium brings together the interaction of the fast phase transition at the edge of the flame, with the linking of large scales (front speeds) and small scales (possibly random , thin layering).\r\nRecent models of front formation, bring together the interaction of\r\noptimal allocation,that provides the \" variational framework\" for front\r\nformation (the Monge Ampere equation ) with the issue of how vorticity is\r\ntransported within, and affects the front. Finally, problems in financial engineering, bring together fully non linear equations ( for instance as \"extremals\" or intervals of\r\n\"trust\" when only rough bounds on volatility and correlations are\r\navailable) with issues of phase transition , when trading strategy\r\nchanges discontinuously at certain values of the parameters,or there are\r\nconstraints on the range of trading, and  homogeneisation, when the\r\nunderlying space changes randomly.\r\n\r\nWe plan to study several  models from different sciences  that bring\r\ntogether interactions of complementary non linear phenomena.\r\nA good example would be flame propagation in a thinly layered\r\nmaterial: Observed at short range, the flame front will \"wiggle\", moving\r\nfaster in some of the layers, depending on their composition.\r\nFrom far away, the flame will appear as a homogeneous front.\r\nIts speed , though, will depend in a very subtle way from both the nature\r\nof the ignition process at the edge of the flame ( free boundary\r\nproblem) and the properties of the very fine, ( possibly randomly\r\norganized, as it usually occurs in nature) thin layering.\r\nAnother example has to do with the formation of weather fronts: according\r\nto some models, globally the front organizes itself trying to \" spread its\r\nenergy\" in an optimal way, and within, vorticity ( the \"rotational\r\ncomponent\" of wind) is transported in an interactive way with the front\r\norganization. A third example comes from financial engineering when seeking optimal ( or\r\nsafest) trading strategies, but , as in most cases, only a rough knowledge\r\nis available of the way different ways in which different components of\r\nthe portfolio, or parameters ( interest rates, exchange rates, etc\r\n) interact.This rough or incomplete knowledge, gives rise to non linear\r\nstrategies, that couple with constraints in the trading range,\r\ndiscontinuous trading strategies, etc.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
