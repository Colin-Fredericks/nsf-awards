Taylor will study wave propagation in fairly rough media, \r\nin which rays of geometrical optics are just barely defined, and in even\r\nrougher media, in which such rays are not uniquely defined.  He will examine\r\nto what extent wave propagation in such media behaves like that in more\r\nregular media and to what extent it differs.  He plans to pursue the effects\r\nof curvature bounds on a manifold on the nature of such wave propagation,\r\nand also investigate propagation, reflection, and diffraction of waves at\r\na boundary for a rough medium.  Taylor will also continue a program of\r\nstudying elliptic equations with rough coefficients on Lipschitz domains.\r\nThis will include nonlinear equations, such as arise in the study of\r\nharmonic maps between manifolds with rough metric tensors.  In the area\r\nof functional calculus, one attack is to synthesize general functions\r\nof the Laplace operator from the solution operator to the wave equation.\r\nA detailed knowledge of wave propagation can then yield highly nontrivial\r\ninformation on such functional calculus.  Taylor is pursuing a variety\r\nof projects in this area, ranging from detailed behavior of eigenfunction\r\nexpansions to singular perturbation problems arising in the study of \r\npattern formation.\r\n\r\nWave motion, from sound passing through air to pressure and shear waves\r\npassing through the earth to radio waves traveling through space, is\r\na ubiquitous phenomenon, whose mathematical analysis has for a long time\r\nbeen a major part of mathematics.  A variety of partial differential\r\nequations have arisen to describe different aspects of wave motion, and their\r\nstudy continues to stimulate work on analytical tools to elucidate the\r\nbehavior of solutions to such PDE.  Analyzing a wave as a superposition \r\nof various frequencies gave rise to the area of harmonic analysis.  \r\nLocalizing the study of a wave simultaneously in space and in frequency is \r\nat the heart of the more recent area of microlocal analysis.  Taylor has  \r\nbeen active in developing tools in these areas and using them to produce\r\nresults in PDE.  Some of his efforts have focused on treating PDE with\r\nrough coefficients and PDE in domains with rough boundary.  These arise\r\nto describe waves traveling through complicated media, whose boundaries\r\nhave many corners and other irregularities.  While harmonic analysis \r\ntechniques have provided much insight into partial differential equations,\r\nthe reverse direction has also led to significant results in harmonic\r\nanalysis.  Taylor is continuing to investigate how results on Fourier\r\nsynthesis of singular functions can be explained in terms of propagation\r\nand focusing of waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
