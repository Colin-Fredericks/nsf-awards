 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides up to four years of scholarship support to 25 talented, low-income undergraduates pursuing bachelor degrees in mathematics or computer science along with a carefully crafted program of enriched student support activities. Special consideration is given to recruiting women, ethnic and racial minorities, and persons with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThe project also includes a strong collaboration with South Puget Sound Community College (SPSCC), a neighboring two-year institution from which many of our students transfer.\r\nCollaborative elements include integrated recruitment activities, cross-institution advising and student support services, and transfer agreements. Integrated into this project is the scholarship award process, which ensures that successful students at SPSCC are given priority for CSEMS scholarships at Evergreen. \r\n\r\nThe project has a clear and effective management plan and collaboration with an existing Evergreen student services program, Keep Enhancing Yourself (KEY), which has proven highly effective in retaining and graduating low-income students. An Individual Action Plan has been developed with each student and monitored regularly. Additional student support activities include faculty advising, career planning support, internships and work study opportunities on and off campus, and workshops on various subjects known to be relevant to student success. A required biweekly Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics seminar is the vehicle for structuring many of these activities. \r\n\r\nA unique feature of the project is a three-day summer institute for CSEMS students, relevant faculty and staff, and industry partners. Partnerships with industry and state, federal government agencies and MESA (Math, Engineering and Science Achievement) Program, are also part of the project through advisory board participation, involvement in the seminar and summer institute, in some cases, internships and field placements.\r\n",
