The principal scientific focus of this international meeting is deciphering the clues to the origin and evolution of the solar system that are contained within the chemical, petrologic, and isotopic properties of meteorites. Meteorites made available to researchers through the US Antarctic meteorite program sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Smithsonian Institution are an important aspect of international meteoritical research. This award will provide travel support to enable students to participate in the meeting. The student travel awards will be made on a competitive basis and will support primarily U.S. and also some foreign students. Additional financial support for the meeting is anticipated from NASA, The Barringer Foundation, and a number of scientific instrument manufacturers (JEOL USA, Inc., Cameca, Inc., Finnigan, Inc., and Micromass, Inc.). This award will provide a scientifically enriching experience to the student recipients of the travel support",
