 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objects of investigation of this project are weak Hopf algebras\r\n(also called quantum groupoids in literature). These are group-like \r\nobjects that generalize both Hopf algebras and usual groupoids and that \r\nappear naturally in the theory of semisimple tensor rigid (fusion) categories, \r\nconformal field theory, symmetries of algebra extensions, and the quantum \r\ndynamical Yang-Baxter equation. The investigator develops the general \r\ntheory of weak Hopf algebras and their representations and applies it to \r\nthe study and classification of fusion categories (every such a category is\r\nequaivalent to the representation category of a semisimple weak Hopf algebra).\r\nOne goal is to extend the results known for the representation categories of\r\nordinary semisimple Hopf algebras, such as e.g., Larson-Radford theorems, \r\nStefan's finiteness result (Ocneanu's rigidity), and Class Equation to general\r\nsemisimple tensor categories. Another goal is to use weak Hopf algebra\r\ntechniques to reveal the structure of modular categories which are important\r\nbecause of  their applications to physics and geometry. The investigator\r\nalso studies weak Hopf algebras arising from dynamical twists (these twists \r\ngive rise to solutions of the quantum dynamical Yang-Baxter equation of Felder). \r\nThe goal here is to get a conceptual explanation of new intriguing phenomena \r\nrelated to dynamical twists,  such as, e.g., non-minimizable  dynamical twists \r\nin group algebras and self-duality of dynamical quantum groups.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal the investigator studies problems of the theory  of quantum groups. \r\nThe origins of this theory which was created in 1980s are the classical theory of\r\ngroups and  quantum physics. The theory of groups is the classical mathematical\r\nsubject that describes in mathematical terms the phenomenon of symmetry\r\n(e.g., groups describe the symmetry of molecular structure). Groups are fundamental\r\nobjects as they provide a universal language used in all areas of mathematics.\r\nThe quantum theory reveals the laws of physics that determine the behavior \r\nof very small particles and interactions between them.  This theory led to many\r\ntechnological advances of the 20th century such as, e.g., development of the\r\nnuclear physics. In order to give an adequate mathematical  description of  \r\nthe structure  of quantum physical systems the theory of classical groups \r\nis not sufficient, this is why the new theory of quantum groups was invented. \r\nAmong these  new objects the notions of weak Hopf algebras and quantum \r\ngroupoids are of special interest, as they have recently seen many applications \r\non both sides of the mathematics-physics divide.  The present proposal is devoted \r\nto the study and classification of weak Hopf algebras and exploring their applications \r\nto various  areas of  mathematics and physics.",
