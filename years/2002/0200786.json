 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of asymmetric methods for activating carbon-carbon pi-bonds for attack by external nucleophiles and for the stereospecific cross-coupling reactions of stereogenic secondary carbon centers will be developed. In the former, Pd(II)-catalyzed processes will be used to develop both carbon-heteroatom and carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions.  In the latter, palladacyclic intermediates containing Pd sigma-bonded to a stereogenic secondary carbon will be used to develop the reaction chemistry for stereospecific catalytic cross-coupling of stereogenic secondary carbons.  \r\n\r\nWith this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr. Larry E. Overman in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.  Professor Overman will focus his work on developing catalytic, asymmetric reactions for the formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds.  The research has broad implications for the environment by minimizing the production of chemical wastes and resulting methodology could be of great interest to the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  This area of research has proven to be a valuable setting for the training of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students.\r\n",
