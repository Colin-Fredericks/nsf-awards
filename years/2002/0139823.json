 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this work the PI will exploit the mode selectivity properties of two-dimensional arrays of closely spaced leaky-mode VCSELs to achieve spatially-coherent light sources. \r\n\r\nTwo-dimensional arrays of closely spaced antiguided VCSELs offer a unique platform to study the optical modal properties of an active photonic lattice. He proposes the first comprehensive above-threshold study of the leaky-modes supported by such photonic lattice structures. The allowed leaky-mode photonic bands of 2-D active photonic lattices have not been studied to date. An understanding of the propagating leaky-modes and the influence of nonlinear gain, carrier-induced-index variations, and thermal lensing, above laser threshold will result in a valuable knowledge base for the development of next generation optical sources. He proposes a closely coupled experimental and theoretical program to study the unique properties of these structures and exploit these properties for the development of novel diode laser sources. \r\n\r\nThese structures have high potential for the realization of compact monolithic surface emitting sources with high-spatial coherence. Unlike conventional VCSEL arrays, the proposed devices have gain placed in the low-index lattice sites, thus relying on long-range (coherent) coupling via leaky waves. Based on an MOCVD regrowth process, the built-in refractive index step of the antiguides can be quite large (Dn = 0.10 - 0.20), making the structure less sensitive to waveguide pertubations which occur above laser threshold. \r\n\r\nNovel device structures based on 2-D active photonic lattices are proposed for achieving spatially-coherent surface emitting sources:\r\n\r\n1.   Laterally resonant, large-area spatially-coherent 2-D phase-locked arrays: Antiguided VCSEL devices involving large-area phase-locked arrays of rectangular- as well as of triangular-lattice configuration relying on radially resonant leaky-wave coupling, which in turn insures uniform intensity profile across the entire array structure, and thus coherent operation to high drive levels above threshold.\r\n2.   Radiation fanout vertical cavity semiconductor optical amplifiers: Arrays of leaky-wave-coupled vertical-cavity surface-emitting amplifiers (VCSOA) hold potential not only for providing high amplified output powers but also act as a large-volume gain media for nonlinear interactions such as four-wave mixing. \r\n3.   Low-index defect based lasers: lattice-defect\" VCSEL devices are proposed relying on radially antiresonant devices, which allow single-mode operation from emitting areas an order of magnitude larger than conventional VCSELs. \r\n\r\nThe proposed devices have potential as high-coherent-power (> 100 mW), circular-beam monolithic sources for use as transmitters (l=1.3-1.55mm) or amplifier pump sources (l=0.98mm) in fiber-optical communication systems. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
