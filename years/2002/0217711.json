 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to advance our understanding of organizational innovation, learning, and adaptation to technological change. It examines organizational structures that are relatively new and unstudied alternatives to traditional corporate R&D programs in pursuit of the development and commercialization of technology. The study will gather real-time longitudinal data on the adaptation and selection of organizational programs and practices in the face of increasingly adverse macroeconomic conditions. This research continues and expands on exploratory work funded by a Small Grant for Exploratory Research from NSF. \r\n\r\nThis research is theoretically grounded, rooted in prior research seeking a better understanding of how R&D spending may more efficiently translate into the effective creation and diffusion of innovations. This project was designed and will be executed in collaboration with research partners in nine technology corporations: Intel, Sun Microsystems, Adobe, Compaq, Tektronics, Comcast, Oracle, DOW, and 3M and four venture capital firms. The findings should have direct practical applicability for all organizations, private and public sector, that are grappling with technological and strategic change.\r\n\r\nA research team composed of faculty, doctoral students, and corporate collaborators is pursuing five objectives: 1) conducting an historical analysis of internal corporate venture investing (CVI) arms; 2) developing a typology of organizational structures for housing and pursuing CVI; 3) delineating the strengths, weaknesses, and effectiveness of these structural alternatives; 4) identifying \"best practices \" for pursuing corporate venturing and for codifying and diffusing these practices; 5) gathering real-time longitudinal data on the adaptation and selection of CVI programs and practices in the face of increasingly adverse macroeconomic conditions. Six interrelated studies have been designed to pursue these objectives. The studies collect varied types of data (secondary financial and economic data, semi-structured interviews, organizational documents, and non-participant observations).These data are being analyzed using varied methods (econometric forecasting, multivariate analysis, computer-based content analysis, and grounded theory building). The multi-method, multi-level and multi-theoretic approaches are well integrated with the overall theoretical approach.",
