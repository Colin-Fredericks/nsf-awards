 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to  develop a novel low-voltage periodic poling technique for creating highly efficient quasi-phase matched waveguides in nonlinear optical materials. The key innovation of the proposed  technology is the use of co-planar micro-comb electrodes to periodically pole waveguides embedded in a nonlinear optical material such as potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP). Periodically poled waveguides will enable highly efficient, quasi-phase matched (QPM), nonlinear optical frequency conversion of continuous wave and low peak power quasi-continuous radiation. The proposed technique will allow multiple waveguides with different QPM gratings to be fabricated onto a single device, thereby building in wavelength flexibility as well as reducing cost. The anticipated benefits of low-voltage poling are waveguides with significantly improved conversion efficiency, low scattering loss, and increased manufacturing yields.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project are in the areas of bioanalytical instrumentation (such as medical diagnostics, flow cytometers and medical imagers) and  telecommunications.",
