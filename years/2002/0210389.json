 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project examines how social environments at the family, neighborhood, and school levels affect individuals' achievement of their genetic potential in late adolescence and young adulthood.  When genetic predispositions influence a particular human behavior,  the expression of such predispositions are moderated by environmental influences.  At birth, each child has a genetic potential, but the chances of achieving the potential are conditioned by environmental factors.  Thus, advantaged family environments generally boost the realization of youth's genetic potential for educational achievement.  Social contexts such as neighborhoods and schools also moderate the expression of the genetic propensity for educational achievement and early work success.  Educational success will be measured using data on college plans, grade point average, grade retention, intellectual development, and high school graduation.  Data will be drawn from genetically informative sibling data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.   The project will develop statistical methods that permit analysis of the heritability - environment interaction for binary outcomes such as college plans and event history outcomes such as grade retention.",
