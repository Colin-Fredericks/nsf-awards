 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 0134750\r\nRita Sambruna\r\n\r\nDr. Sambruna, of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, is awarded a grant to continue her observational, multi-wavelength studies of relativistic jets.  These jets somehow form near the centers of active galaxies, and are thought to originate from black holes.  These enormous jets extend to many times the size of the galaxy itself. Dr. Sambruna's research will take advantage of new and upcoming instrumentation in order to probe the underlying physics of these poorly understood phenomena. The proposed observations include facilities such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray telescope in space, the ground-based radio Very Large Array and Very Long Baseline Array, and the upcoming VERITAS (Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System) ground-based gamma-ray observatory. She will address questions such as the origin of the multi-wavelength emission, the mechanism for particle acceleration, and the calculation of kinetic energy in the jets. \r\n\r\nDr. Sambruna will also use her grant to enhance her educational activities.  She will implement peer instruction techniques into her introductory astronomy courses,  establish an astronomy club for the departmental majors, and organize a series of workshops for local science teachers.\r\n",
