 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues NSF support for the American Statistical Association's Federal Statistics Fellowship Program.  The program also is supported by the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Center for Education Statistics.  The general objective of the program is to foster collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts that will continue to stimulate the development and advancement of methodology and social science research relevant to issues on which Federal statistical agencies seek to provide information.  The program accomplishes this by bringing academic researchers into the supporting federal statistical agencies to work with agency statisticians and social scientists for up to one year on problems of mutual interest.\r\n\r\nSeveral specific objectives of this research fellowship program include: to provide academic scholars with the unique opportunity to have \"hands on\" access to federal agency data through the establishment of research fellowships that bring scientists with diverse academic backgrounds to the agencies; to bring about an improvement of the quality of the data collected and disseminated by each agency; to develop a research group of personnel for the future recruitment of statisticians and other research scientists to help fill government needs; to stimulate methodological and substantive research in academia on the problems of collecting and analyzing data that provide the basic information for making decisions that can have significant effects on society; and to increase the interaction and collaborative research and education among federal agencies and between federal agencies and academic institutions.",
