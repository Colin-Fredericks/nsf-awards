 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n0203932\r\nGortler, Steven\r\nHarvard University\r\n\r\nImage based rendering is a promising area of innovation in computer graphics. In image based rendering,\r\none starts with an input set of images or a video sequence. One then applies some degree of processing\r\nto this data to obtain an intermediate representation. This intermediate representation is then used in an\r\ninteractive computer graphics setting. These interactive uses include but are not limited to: viewing the\r\nscene from novel points of view that were not available in the input sequence, relighting the scene using\r\nvirtual lights that were not available in the input sequence, and geometrically manipulating the objects that\r\nmake up the scene. This functionality greatly enlarges the uses of digital photographs, and introduces a rich\r\nsource of content for use in interactive computer graphics.\r\nFor image based rendering, we plan to focus on lumigraph representations, which are a sampled repre-sentation of the light that travels along the rays in the scene. In particular, the visual information of a static scene is represented by the five dimensional radiance function. This function describes the intensity and color of light for every 2D direction at every 3D spatial position (x; y; z). If we consider only the\r\nsubset of light leaving the convex hull bounded object (or equivalently entering a bounded empty region of\r\nspace), the fact that radiance along any ray remains constant 1 allows us to reduce the domain of interest of\r\nthe radiance function from five to four dimensions.",
