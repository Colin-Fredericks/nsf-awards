 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to use equivariant methods to study\r\nproblems concerning algebraic varieties with group actions.  Part\r\nof this project involves moment graphs of varieties with torus\r\nactions.  For a variety on which a torus acts with finitely many\r\nfixed points and curves, one can define a combinatorial object\r\ncalled a moment graph.  There has been much recent progress in\r\ncomputing topological invariants, such as cohomology or\r\nintersection homology, in terms of the moment graph.  The\r\ninvestigator proposes to extend this to K-theory.  Schubert\r\nvarieties are among the most important varieties with this type of\r\ntorus action; the investigator plans to continue work with Brian\r\nBoe on a conjecture that would simplify determining if a point in\r\na Schubert variety is rationally smooth.  Moreover, he plans to\r\nextend some facts known only for Schubert varieties to the more\r\ngeneral setting of varieties with this type of torus action.  In\r\naddition, the investigator plans to use equivariant methods to\r\nstudy certain interesting varieties: he plans to calculate\r\nChern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of degeneracy loci, and to\r\ncalculate interesting invariants (degrees, push-forward measures)\r\nof nilpotent adjoint orbits of reductive Lie groups.\r\n\r\nThis project is in the area of mathematics referred to as\r\n\"algebraic geometry.\"  Algebraic geometry studies geometric\r\nobjects by describing them as solutions to polynomial equations\r\n-- such objects are called \"algebraic varieties.\"  Fortunately,\r\nalthough algebraic varieties can be very complicated, many of\r\nthem have a great deal of symmetry.  Mathematicians have been\r\nintensely investigating such varieties with extra symmetry for\r\nseveral reasons:  The presence of such extra symmetry makes\r\nthese varieties easier to study, so that these varieties are\r\nvaluable test cases in developing methods to investigate all\r\nvarieties. Moreover, varieties with extra symmetry are of great\r\ninterest in their own right: they play important roles in\r\nvarious areas of mathematics, including number theory,\r\ncombinatorics, and representation theory. There has been\r\nconsiderable recent progress in developing techniques to\r\nunderstand these kinds of varieties; this project is about\r\nextending these techniques, and using them to study particular\r\nclasses of varieties.",
