 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a surface coating technology that will be used to create improved materials for regulating cell behavior for research, tissue engineering and cell therapy applications. For these applications, advanced materials are needed that display multiple types of active proteins, while preventing nonspecific protein adsorption. Current methods of protein immobilization do not meet these requirements. This project will use a previously developed technology, based on an end group activated Pluronic (EGAP), that tethers proteins to materials while preserving protein activity. In the proposed Phase I research, this technology will be further developed to facilitate  coimmobilization of multiple proteins in predetermined proportions. The specific objectives of this project are (1) to develop a new form of EGAP that contains a versatile protein binding tag, (2) to evaluate the feasibility of using this new coating to coimmobilize multiple biomolecules on a substrate, in controlled ratios, and (3)to  create materials that display two important regulators of cell growth and differentiation, namely fibronectin and epidermal growth factor.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project are in a number of areas, including proteomics, drug development, toxicology, environmental testing, tissue engineered devices and medical implants.",
