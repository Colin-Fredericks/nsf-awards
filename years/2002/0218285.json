 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is a systematic computer-aided design system for the synthesis of mechanical devices that guide spatial movement.  Existing design systems can display and animate a predefined device, but none have the ability to assist an inventor in finding a new device given a description of its desired function.  This function to form synthesis process has been developed for planar mechanisms, and our goal is to extend it to spatial mechanisms and robots.  The basic strategy is to evaluate the kinematics equations of an articulated chain at goal positions that define the desired movement workspace.  The solution of these equations define the physical dimensions of the chain.  The architecture of the design system is structured to provide platform independence and to be compatible with collaborative use and development via the Internet. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will provide the theory and an example implementation of a design system that enables mechanical designers to specify a desired spatial movement and the topology of a device, to automatically formulate and solve the associated design equations, and then to interactively survey, evaluate, and modify candidate designs.  Preliminary results show that this has the potential to make available a large number of devices for inventive applications.  The resulting products can provide effective low-cost automation for the home, office and factory.\r\n\r\n",
