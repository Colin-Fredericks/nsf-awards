 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted into models of diffusion-limited reactions and\r\nthe method of empty intervals which we introduced originally for the \r\ntreatment of coalescence, A + A -> A.  We have extended the method of \r\nintervals to annihilation, A + A -> 0, the branching- and double \r\nbranching-annihilating process, and the q-state Potts model in the T=0 limit. \r\nThe method yields detailed information: we derived explicit expressions for \r\nthe n-point correlation functions of coalescence and annihilation, for all n.\r\nDifferent research groups have recently adopted the method of intervals  for \r\nthe analysis of models not amenable to the complementary method of free\r\nMajorana fermions.\r\n\r\nResearch will be conducted into several abstract open questions, including\r\nthe kinetics of reactions with anomalous, subdiffusive transport; exactly \r\nsolvable models of nonuniversal kinetic phase transitions; and the shielding \r\neffect in coalescence, as a basis for more exact solutions and for novel \r\napproximation methods. \r\n\r\nResearch will be conducted also into a number of practical questions motivated \r\nby our work so far.  These include: (1) A new method, due to Fokas, for\r\nsolving PDEs in convex domains with arbitrary boundary conditions; (2) Speedy \r\ncomputer algorithms for the simulation of reaction-diffusion systems; \r\n(3) Stability of networks, such as the Internet, in the face of random failure \r\nor a coordinated attack; (4) Mechanisms of signal transduction in eukaryotic \r\ncells; and (5) Statistical physics interpretation of various experiments in \r\ncontemporary chemistry.  \r\n \r\nThe project is particularly well-suited for educational purposes. One student \r\nhas completed a M.Sc. in physics and another is graduating with a Ph.D.\r\ndegree. Several undergraduate students have already been involved (mainly with \r\ncomputer simulations), and their effort has resulted in at least three\r\npublications in refereed journals.  We forsee many more opportunities for \r\nstudents involvement.\r\n",
