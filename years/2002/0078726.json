 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves development of an integrated sensor system that will accurately and rapidly measure small quantities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) both in air and in aqueous environments. At present, no inexpensive sensor system is sufficiently sensitive and rugged for use in continuously monitoring of VOCs in underground water streams, soil, effluent discharge, fugitive emissions and in spent liquid and vapor streams. To capture this business opportunity, this project involves the development of low-cost continuous organic chemical sensors based on the change of fluorescence of dyes embedded in polymeric and sol-gel thin films. This program is innovative in combining sensitive diode laser-excited fluorescence with total internal reflection methods of analysis to provide a continuous monitor of VOCs. The Phase I research program was successful in demonstrating the feasibility developing several highly sensitive polymer/dye films for use in detection of aqueous and gaseous phase VOCs. Detection limits in the part-per-billion (ppb) range for both aqueous and vapor phase trichloroethylene were achieved using fluorescence detection spectroscopy. The Phase II research and development program will accomplish the feasibility demonstrated in Phase I by developing a turnkey sensor system for multiple chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nThe Phase II Research Objectives include synthesis of polymer and sol-gel solid matrices with pendant functional groups, development of a fluorescence monitoring array and algorithms for multi-chemical analysis, design and integration of miniaturized total internal reflection fluorescence array instrument, acquisition of families of test data to establish instrument specifications, and demonstration of the total-internal reflection fluorescence instrument at environmental remediation facilities and a water treatment plant. This sensor platform together with sensitive polymer/dye films is significant in providing rapid on-site identification and quantification of volatile organic compounds and environmental pollutants in groundwater, soil, effluent discharge and fugitive emissions.",
