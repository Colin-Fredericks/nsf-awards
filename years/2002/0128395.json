 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n     This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project seeks to develop a meshless Petrov-Galerkin geo-environ technology for wide scale field uses.  Groundwater supplies are increasingly threatened by organic, inorganic, and radioactive contaminants introduced to the environment by improper disposal or accidental releases.  Estimates of remediation costs at U.S. government sites alone range into the billions of dollars.  Geo-environ assessment tools play an important role in design and evaluations of remediation alternatives and long-term management of groundwater.  Proposed mesh free geo-environ technology will open a new era for easy simulation of large complex systems without grid generation.  Node density will adjust dynamically for accurate solution.  A Petrov-Galerkin based model will provide stable robust technology for contaminant transport and remediation alternative evaluations.  Interfaced 2D and 3D displays and animations will provide efficient means for easy communications within project team, decision-makers, and regulators.\r\n     Consultants for Environmental System Technologies' proposed technology has applicability to numerous waste site restoration programs and groundwater management projects that are implemented at an enormous cost by Federal agencies, states, counties, petroleum facilities and chemical industries.",
