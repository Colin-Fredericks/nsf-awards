 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lempp proposes research in both applied and pure computability\r\ntheory.  In the former area, Lempp proposes to investigate the\r\ncomputational complexity of models of uncountably categorical\r\nfirst-order theories, and of Boolean algebras. He also propose to\r\nstudy the proof-theoretic strength of combinatorial statements,\r\nesp. variants of Ramsey's Theorem, in order to find new\r\nproof-theoretic systems of weak second-order arithmetic. In the\r\nlatter, i.e., in pure computability theory, Lempp plans to reach\r\na better understanding of three important degree structures, the\r\ncomputably enumerable Turing degrees, the enumeration degrees of\r\nthe Sigma^0_2-sets, and the Turing degrees of differences of\r\ncomputably enumerable sets, by investigating their finite\r\nsubstructures, in particular the embeddability of finite lattices\r\nand extensions of embeddings of partial orders into these degree\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nComputability theory is the study of the theoretical limitations\r\nof computation by machines, irrespective of limitations of bounds\r\non memory space or run time. It is thus in some sense the\r\ntheoretical cousin of complexity theory, an area of computer\r\nscience studying computability within given time or memory space\r\nbounds. Typical results in computability theory show that certain\r\nmathematical problems cannot be solved by any computer, no matter\r\nhow fast or how large. Up until the late 19th century,\r\nmathematics was essentially algorithmic: If you solved a problem,\r\nyou could also give an effective procedure to find a\r\nsolution. However, in the late 19th century, it turned out that\r\nmany mathematical proofs could be done more abstractly and more\r\nelegantly, at the expense of effectiveness. Suspicions about this\r\napproach came to the front in the 1930's with the first\r\nundecidability results, showing that this abstraction often led\r\nto \"non-algorithmic solutions\". Lempp's research focuses on the\r\nanalysis of unsolvable problems, mainly in algebra and\r\ncombinatorics. Techniques and results in this area are often not\r\nonly of great theoretical interest, but also have practical\r\napplications in computer science.\r\n",
