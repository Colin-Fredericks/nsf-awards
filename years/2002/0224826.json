 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award supports the development of a strategic plan for the Big Sky Institute, a newly formed interdisciplinary research and education organization located at a site near Yellowstone National Park.  Over the past decade researchers at Montana State University and other institutions have made great strides in understanding the diversity and dynamics of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), especially in respect to three important aspects: processes that govern biological diversity, especially as it relates to ecosystem management; adaptations that permit life in the diverse thermal features of GYE; and, variations in the local climate over the last thousand-plus years as judged by proxy records of such variability and of ecosystem response.  At present, efforts to build on this progress are limited in scope and integration by lack of modern laboratory and educational facilities at or near field sites in the GYE.  Using the funds provided through this award, BSI will engage in an institutional planning process that will lead to development of a new, multi-user research and education facility.  The development of BSI as a research and education facility will increase access to the GYE for field research and teaching in the areas of  biodiversity, thermal biology, and climate change. The improved infrastructure will allow increased public participation in, and improve public understanding of federally-supported research activities while forging a unique partnership between the private sector tourist industry and a land grant university in a rural area.\r\n",
