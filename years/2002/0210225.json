Savage\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project has four goals: a) to develop realistic models for chips with\r\nnanometer-size dimensions, b) to explore the computational limits that apply\r\nunder the physical constraints imposed by nanotechnologies, c) to develop\r\narchitectures and algorithms reflecting these constraints, and d) to\r\nincorporate the knowledge acquired in advanced and early graduate instruction.\r\n\r\nWhile computational nanotechnologies exist only in the most primitive forms\r\ntoday, we have an opportunity to influence their use akin to that which arose\r\nwhen the VLSI model was developed in the late 1970s.  In this model gates are\r\nso small that the area of wires is significant.  Efficient use of this\r\ntechnology required new algorithms whose efficacy was demonstrated through the\r\ndevelopment of new complexity-theoretic lower bounds involving chip area and\r\ncomputation time.\r\n\r\nOur approach will be a) to model technologies such as orthogonal arrays\r\n(crossbars) of nanowires and nanotubes and masses of nearly uniform\r\nself-assembled elements, b) to extend existing VLSI theory by incorporating\r\nthe new constraints that emerge, c) to explore new architectures that cope\r\nwith the complexity-theoretic constraints exhibited by the proposed highly\r\nregular architectures and ways of programming them, and d) to devise lectures\r\nand/or courses to bring nanocomputation to the attention of students.\r\n",
