 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced composite materials are widely utilized because of their low weight and relatively high strength and stiffness.  Traditional composites rely on the use of macro or micro-scale reinforcements to increase their properties and performance.  Through the use of nano-scale reinforcements and structures, either alone or in conjunction with macro-scale structures, composites with superior mechanical, transport, and environmental properties and performance characteristics can be developed.  It is necessary however, to understand the fundamental phenomena behind nano-reinforcement in the form of a phase as well as scaling issues if this technology is to be effectively applied.  Modeling analyses that focus on viscoelasticity and molecular-level anisotropy and heterogeneity will support this investigation and the scaling of material properties on a nano/micro/macro level.  Therefore, the proposed research will investigate the trinity of nanoscale structures, nanoscale processes in the environment, and manufacturing processes at the nanoscale.  \r\nThe development of nanotechnology represents a fundamental change in the way materials are designed, manufactured, and envisioned. The realization of the above research objectives will be accomplished through the development of a diverse and global team that will incorporate experts from both industry and academia, with diverse areas of expertise (polymer chemistry, polymer physics, interfacial and surface science, advanced composite materials, and environmental science) and age groups varying from scientists with many years of experience down to graduate and undergraduate students.  The team will consist of three nodes, in the US, Korea and Switzerland. The diverse nature of this team will allow for a global investigation of this project on many levels and from many angles in an unprecedented fashion. Furthermore, it will provide unique opportunities to students and young researchers in the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology.  Interdisciplinary teams are needed to study nanotechnology and are also needed to educate people about the advancements and varying disciplines in this field.  \r\n",
