 "awd_abstract_narration": "Todd\r\n0209457\r\n     In this project, the investigator and his students study\r\nimproved interior-point algorithms for convex, especially\r\nsecond-order and semidefinite, programming problems.  In\r\nparticular, they investigate finding more accurate solutions to\r\nlarge-scale problems of this kind, interpreting the output of\r\ninfeasible-interior-point methods as searching for infeasibility\r\ncertificates when applied to infeasible problems, using ideas of\r\nRiemannian geomentry to develop new interior-point methods for\r\npossibly infeasible problems, and studying new barrier functions\r\nto be used in highly asymmetric problems, where usual primal-only\r\nor primal-dual methods would be inefficient.  All these ideas are\r\ntested out by implementing them in the software package SDPT3,\r\ndeveloped by the investigator and two of his collaborators, which\r\nis a competitive primal-dual code available over the internet (e.g., at\r\nhttp://www.math.cmu.edu/~reha/sdpt3.html) and within the NEOS \r\nsystem (http://www-neos.mcs.anl.gov/neos/server-solvers.html)\r\nfor distributed computing.\r\n     Interior-point algorithms are a new and exciting\r\ncomputational method for solving large-scale resource allocation\r\nand other optimization problems.  For example, they have been\r\nused to develop better designs for truss structures, such as\r\nbridges, that are better able to resist a wide range of external\r\nloads.  Another application is the design of antenna arrays to\r\nhighlight the receptivity in certain directions while muting that\r\nin all other directions.  In finance, they are used to develop\r\n\"optimal portfolios\" to balance an acceptable rate of return with\r\nlow volatility (unfortunately, these methods are only as good as\r\nthe data they employ, and past history often does not give a good\r\nindication of future performance).  In this and other contexts,\r\nthe idea of robust optimization, to find solutions to problems\r\nthat satisfy all constraints even when the data are perturbed a\r\nlittle, and that give good performance measures even when the\r\ndata are slightly changed, is very attractive, and this class of\r\nmethods is successful in treating some problems of this kind\r\nalso.  A last application mentioned here is currently being\r\nstudied by the investigator and a statistics colleague: trying to\r\nfind a good way to classify new data into one of two classes\r\n(e.g., with or without a cancerous tumour) on the basis of some\r\ntraining data (with known classification).  This problem is of\r\ninterest in data mining and biomedical fields.  In all these\r\nproblems, there is a desire to solve larger and larger instances\r\n(involving tens of thousands of variables and constraints) more\r\nand more accurately.  The investigator and his collaborators\r\nstudy theoretically and practically ways to improve existing\r\nalgorithms to extend their capabilities in these directions.\r\n\r\n",
