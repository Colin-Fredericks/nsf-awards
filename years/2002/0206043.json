 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the kinds of inquiry activities that have become increasingly prevalent as\r\neducational tools assume that certain basic understandings are in place, for example the\r\nunderstanding that multiple variables may act simultaneously to codetermine an outcome.\r\nRecent research, however, suggests instead that this and related forms of meta-level\r\nunderstanding are hard-won cognitive achievements that require support if they are to\r\ndevelop during the elementary and middle-school years and provide a needed foundation for\r\nmore advanced inquiry learning. The goal of the proposed project is to better understand\r\nthe basic cognitive skills that underlie inquiry learning and to examine how they develop.\r\nAs part of their science curriculum, middle-school students will engage in a 10-week\r\nsoftware-based inquiry curriculum under several different conditions offering different\r\nkinds of cognitive support. Employing a microgenetic method, researchers will closely\r\nobserve development, maintenance and transfer of cognitive skills. The proposed work\r\nstands to inform both the design and use of educational technology to support inquiry\r\nlearning, and in addition should help to provide a clearer conceptual base for teachers\r\nregarding the cognitive goals of inquiry curricula. The project is situated at the\r\nintersection of quadrant II and quadrant III in terms of the objectives identified in the\r\nROLE RFP.",
