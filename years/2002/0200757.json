 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Michaela Vancliff to work in\r\nnon-commutative algebra, with special emphasis on problems arising \r\nfrom the theory of regular algebras and non-commutative algebraic \r\ngeometry. Vancliff's main objective is to add to the body of knowledge\r\non regular algebras and to further the existing geometric techniques.\r\nIn particular, she is interested in the graded-module category of such\r\nan algebra viewed as a geometric space, with certain graded modules \r\nplaying the role of geometric objects. The linear geometric modules \r\n(point modules, line modules, etc) are parametrized by so-called \r\nlinear schemes. Vancliff plans to study how the structure and role of\r\nhigher-dimensional linear schemes generalize the structure and role of\r\npoint schemes. She is also interested in connections between this type\r\nof geometric analysis and that of various Poisson-geometric \r\nstructures. Some of these activities entail the development of \r\nfundamental computational algorithms, and their implementation using \r\na computer-algebra package, in order to enable explicit computation of\r\nlinear schemes.\r\n\r\nSystems of polynomial-style equations and their solutions play a \r\ncritical role in almost every scientific field, such as statistical \r\nmechanics, elementary-particle physics, quantum mechanics, robotics, \r\ncrystallography, networking, etc. The solutions are often results that\r\ncannot be found by experimentation nor other methods, and often they \r\nare not numbers but are functions (e.g., differential operators or \r\nmatrices), and so, in general, they do not commute. The business of \r\nseeking methods that find all solutions to any system of \r\npolynomial-style equations in non-commuting variables is called \r\nnon-commutative algebra. The main idea to find the solutions is as \r\nfollows. One associates to such a system of equations an abstract \r\nobject called an algebra, which encodes all the properties of the \r\nsystem. To the algebra is associated abstract objects called modules,\r\nand these encode all the properties of the solutions. Hence, in order\r\nto find all the solutions, one should find and understand all the \r\nmodules for the associated algebra.  In many of the applications, the\r\nalgebras that arise in this way tend to share certain properties; they\r\nare called regular algebras and are the main focus of Vancliff's\r\nprojects. One of the goals of non-commutative algebraic geometry, the\r\nsubfield in which Vancliff works, is to use geometric techniques to \r\nfind some of the modules (point modules, line modules, etc) of the \r\nregular algebra, and then to use those modules to find the modules \r\ngiving the solutions to the original system of equations. Vancliff's \r\nunderlying goal is to improve on these geometric techniques and to \r\nunderstand better how they relate to the structure of the category of\r\nmodules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
