HACU, a national, non-profit organization, has a long and distinguished record of providing summer internship opportunities through the organization's National Internship Program (NIP).  Through the NIP academically prepared students throughout the US and Puerto Rico have received quality internship assignments through various federal government agencies. Students who participate in the NIP are exposed to various career options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping them make informed career choices and solidify career objectives.  By partnering with the Federal government, HACU has been able to successfully place over 3,400 students, representing 30 states and PR, in summer positions since NIP commenced in 1992.  In an effort to continue its collaboration with HACU, the National Science Foundation, a participating government agency for the last six years, will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of 16 students pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  Internship opportunities create an unique opportunity to assist in the fulfillment of two core strategies related the goals of NSF's mission: developing intellectual capital, and integrating research and education.  As a result the Foundation actively participates in strengthening the infrastructure to achieve excellence in STEM education.\r\n",
