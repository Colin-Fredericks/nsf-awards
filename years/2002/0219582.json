 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data storage systems represent one of the pillars supporting\r\nthe modern information age. Advances in computing and communication\r\ntechnologies, and the networks that incorporate them, have increased\r\nthe demand for high capacity  data storage devices in applications\r\nranging from biological research (e.g., the visualization and analysis\r\nof massive multimedia data-sets)  to consumer electronics (e.g., the\r\nstorage of high-resolution image, audio, and video data in digital cameras).\r\n\r\nThe research addresses\r\nanalytic and numerical methods for determining the information-theoretic\r\nlimits on achievable storage densities and data transfer rates in\r\nrecording channels. It also develops and evaluates modulation, coding,\r\nand signal processing techniques that can approach or achieve these limits.\r\n\r\nThe research considers both one-dimensional channel models applicable\r\nto \"track-oriented\" storage devices, such as disks and tapes, as well as\r\nhigher-dimensional models relevant to exploratory page-oriented and\r\nvolumetric storage technologies, such as holographic recording and\r\nthermomechanical recording based upon atomic force microscopy.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, new information-theoretic and algorithmic methods are\r\nbeing used to study lower and upper bounds on the capacity of recording\r\nchannels, using analytical and empirically-based models for both longitudinal\r\nand perpendicular recording systems. Bounds on the  information rates of\r\nchannels in two and higher dimensions are also being developed.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve performance approaching the theoretical limits, new\r\nsignal processing and coding methods are required. In the area\r\nof constrained modulation coding, the project is exploring the analysis\r\nand design of one-dimensional constrained codes that more efficiently\r\ncombine the functions of modulation and error-correction. The nascent\r\ntheory of constrained coding in two and higher dimensions is also being\r\ninvestigated, with a focus on fundamental problems, such as representation\r\nof multi-dimensional constrained systems, determination of constraint\r\ncapacity, and efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.\r\n\r\nChannel coding techniques based upon concatenation architectures,\r\ngraphical code models, and iterative decoding have been shown to effectively\r\nachieve capacity on certain memoryless channels. The channel coding\r\ncomponent of this project addresses theoretical and algorithmic problems\r\nassociated with the application of these new  and powerful coding concepts\r\nto data storage channels. In particular, the research considers the design\r\nand performance analysis of turbo-like and low-density parity-check codes\r\nfor channels with intersymbol-interference, the trade-offs between latency\r\nand complexity in message-passing decoder architectures, and new approaches\r\nto combining coding, equalization, and detection that can more closely\r\napproach the recording channel capacity. The project also addresses\r\nfundamental problems of channel coding and detection in two-dimensional\r\nrecording systems.\r\n",
