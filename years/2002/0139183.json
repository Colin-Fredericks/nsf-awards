This ten-week summer program will involve eight students annually in the multidisciplinary field of electronics packaging research through the Integrated Electronics Engineering Center (IEEC). Students will have the opportunity to interact with scientists and engineers from industry.  The research teams will include undergraduate students, faculty, graduate students, and industrial mentors.  A broad mix of students, including women and under-represented minorities, not only from Binghamton but from other institutions as well, will be recruited for the program.  While independent research will be stressed, students will have the opportunity to experience working in a team environment.  Oral and written communication of research results will be required.  \r\n\r\n",
