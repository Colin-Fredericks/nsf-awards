 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovative Programming Technology for Embedded Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to provide innovative programming technology for\r\ndesigning and implementing reliable distributed embedded systems.  The proposal\r\naddresses a critical generic problem and a major opportunity.  The generic\r\nproblem is that the research community does not know how to scale logical\r\nmethods that are known to improve programs and small systems to the task of\r\nimproving larger systems.  The opportunity is that new methods of factoring are\r\npossible for embedded systems, and new kinds of specifications are important.\r\nThis project approaches the problem/opportunity by creating advanced logical\r\nmethods and tools to structure embedded systems in a new way and to draw on\r\nrelevant formal knowledge about them to accelerate both the design and coding\r\nprocess and to improve the quality of the system code and its documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will add extensive formal knowledge to a logical programming\r\nenvironment (LPE) and use it to generate system components that are correct by\r\nconstruction and to combine components based on semantic methods.  The\r\nsemantics supports formal classes and aspect-oriented programming.  One test\r\ncase for the new methods is a particular distributed embedded system called\r\nMediaNet -- a system for processing various media (audio, video, text) over a\r\ndistributed computing network to adaptively respond to quality of service\r\nconstraints.\r\n\r\nThe project will use mathematical knowledge about media streams and transition\r\nsystems to precisely formulate design requirements and component functionality.\r\nQuality of service constraints will be incrementally added to the functional\r\nspecifications and used to automatically modify the proof and the extracted\r\ncode so that these requirements are met.  This is a very high level example of\r\nformal aspect-oriented programming and proof reuse.\r\n\r\nThe library of formal knowledge about the system will be organized as a\r\nmathematical theory.  That organization draws on concepts about stream\r\ntransformers, the distributed network of machines, quality of service\r\nproperties and communication services.  An expressive logic will be used to\r\nstate properties of the system and keep track of logical dependencies among\r\nsystem components.\r\n\r\nThe project team has considerable experience working together building and\r\nsupporting distributed communications systems by specifying and verifying\r\ncommunication protocols and optimizing them using formal methods.\r\n",
