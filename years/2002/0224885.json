 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on Early Child and Brain Development will be held in Bucharest, Romania June\r\n12-15, 2002. The primary objective of the workshop is to open a dialogue between Romanian\r\nresearchers, academics and practitioners and their American counterparts. The state of\r\nknowledge in Romania on early child development and brain development has suffered as a\r\nresult of long communist rule, and has advanced slowly in the decade since the fall of Nicolae\r\nCeausescu. As such, the workshop will also provide an introduction to the Romanian participants\r\nto state-of-the-art knowledge in early child development and early brain development. The\r\nRomanians and Americans participating in the workshop will be able to work together to\r\ndetermine the specific information and resource needs of the various fields represented by\r\nRomanian workshop participants. Finally, the workshop will enable the American participants to\r\nmake connections with possible collaborators and/or likely recipients for future\r\nacademic/research support.",
