 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Science Center, in collaboration and with support from the Washington NASA Space Grant Consortium, proposes a three-year program to develop and test a model for delivering mid-scale, astronomy and space-themed exhibits and programming in a shopping center environment, especially in rural locations.\r\nThe program targets an audience that does not have easy access to a science center or that may not be inclined to take advantage of such a facility.  The exhibits and curriculum for this project will be based on Pacific Science Center's well-tested Space Odyssey Van Program, which presently tours elementary schools in Washington State.  Phase One of the project will be a test delivery of the existing exhibits and programming to two malls.  Phase Two involves construction and testing of the final, larger exhibits and reworking existing programming to better fit a mall delivery  environment.  Phase Three takes the newly tested devices to ten malls in suburban and rural Washington.  \r\n",
