 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project would develop a twenty-credit certificate program in evaluation that students could complete in 9 months to1 year.  In addition to regular course work in evaluation, this certificate program would include a practicum to give students the opportunity to work directly on evaluation projects.  Students would be recruited from the surrounding area, which has  large minority populations.  It is expected that many students would be employees of State and Federal government agencies in the region and letters of support from many of these agencies were included.  There are no other certificate programs in evaluation known to exist at this time.",
