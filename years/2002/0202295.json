 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, the investigator and collaborators study problems in\r\nalgebra, algebraic geometry and topology. Three of these projects\r\nstudy families of noncommutative algebras arising naturally in various\r\nbranches of algebra. The first project is to study finite dimensional\r\nirreducible representations of Clifford algebras of forms of higher\r\ndegree. The approach in studying these algebras is to work on a\r\nreformulation of the questions in terms of moduli spaces of certain\r\nreflexive sheaves on hypersurfaces. Another goal is to investigate\r\narithmetic applications of these results. The second project (joint\r\nwith D. Chan) is continuation of previous work on sheaves of maximal\r\norders on complex, projective, algebraic surfaces. The main goal is to\r\nclassify various classes of such sheaves of maximal orders. This work\r\nfollows recently developed ideas in noncommutative algebraic\r\ngeometry. The third project (joint with A. Ram) is to investigate\r\nwhether the Springer correspondence can be set up for rational\r\nCherednik algebras along the lines of single graded Hecke\r\nalgebras. Another goal is to investigate whether these algebras can be\r\nrelated to N. Wallach's approach to the Springer correspondence. The\r\nlast project (joint with M. Banagl) is to investigate whether there\r\nexist self-dual sheaves compatible with the intersection chain sheaves\r\non reductive Borel-Serre compactifications of locally symmetric spaces\r\nassociated to semisimple algebraic groups defined over rational\r\nnumbers. \r\n\r\nIn the last few decades, the interaction between various branches of\r\nmathematics and theoretical physics has proved to be especially\r\nenriching for all the fields. One important thread in these\r\nconnections has been algebraic geometry, a very old subject that dates\r\nback at least to ancient Greece.  Algebraic geometry is the area of \r\nmathematics that studies solutions to multi-variable polynomial \r\nequations as geometric objects.  It has found applications not only in\r\nmathematics, but also in computer science, coding theory, robotics and\r\nstring theory in physics to name a few areas impacted by it. The first\r\ntwo projects of this proposal use tools from this subject to study\r\n\"algebras\" that are of interest to a wide range of mathematicians and\r\nphysicists. It is useful to describe the whole family of such classes\r\nof algebras as a geometric object, and a goal of this project is to\r\nobtain such descriptions.  The third aspect of this research is part\r\nof a subject called representation theory. The main objects of study\r\nhere are \"representations\", processes which encode information about\r\nsymmetry in nature. The last part of this proposal stands at the\r\nintersection of three subjects: number theory (where number systems\r\nare studied), representation theory, and topology. In topology spaces\r\nare studied to determine which properties do not change under elastic\r\ndeformations such as twisting and stretching.  The spaces to be\r\nstudied in this research encode number theoretic information. The goal\r\nis to investigate whether there are invariants of these spaces which\r\nthemselves satisfy some symmetry.",
