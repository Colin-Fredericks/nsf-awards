 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to develop a unified framework\r\nfor synthesis and control of infinite-state reactive systems based on\r\ntemporal specifications.  With synthesis, the full program is\r\ngenerated directly from its specification. With control, part of the\r\nsystem is given and the task is to generate the modules interacting\r\nwith the given components such that the overall system satisfies its\r\nspecification.  The framework will include a computational model to\r\nrepresent the notions of infinite games, control, realizability, and\r\nsynthesis of reactive systems, a specification language that can\r\nassign goals (winning conditions) to sets of system components, and\r\ndeductive-algorithmic methods to solve the synthesis and control\r\nproblems in their various forms for the infinite-state case.\r\n\r\nThe starting point for this framework will be a theoretical foundation\r\nbuilt on the models and methods developed for algorithmic synthesis\r\nand control of finite-state reactive systems. These methods will be\r\ncombined with methods developed for deductive verification and\r\nabstract interpretation of reactive systems, and with deductive\r\nsynthesis techniques for functional programs to allow the synthesis\r\nand control of infinite-state systems. Preliminary investigations into\r\nthis approach, described in this proposal and also accepted for\r\npublication, are promising.\r\n",
