Nano-scale pore structures, also called mesoporous structures, are ubiquitous in geologic and engineered materials. Our preliminary studies, both experimentally and theoretically, indicate that chemical reactions in mesopores can be significantly modified, both thermodynamically and kinetically, due to the nano-scale confinement.  The objective of this proposal is to (1) clarify the sorption behavior of chemical species in a nano-scale pore space confinement as compared to that in bulk solutions and test the hypothesis that metal sorption on mesopore surface can be greatly enhanced by the confinement effect; and (2) to determine the rates of aqueous species diffusion in nano-scale channels to test the assumption that these channels can provide passages for mass transport during chemical reactions.\r\n\r\nTo isolate the effect of nano-scale pore space confinement, we will conduct parallel sorption experiments on non-mesoporous materials, and the measured sorption capabilities will be compared between mesoporous vs. non-mesoporous materials. Particular attention will be paid to the possible effect of electric double layer (EDL) overlap in mesopores on ion sorption and diffusion. Based on the experimental data, a new surface complexation model will be proposed to explicitly include the effect of EDL overlap.  The issues to be addressed in this proposal are fundamental, and the proposed work will highly impact many aspects of geochemical research.  The proposed research will establish a theoretical foundation for the development of high-performance functional materials for solving challenging environmental issues we are facing today.\r\n\r\n",
