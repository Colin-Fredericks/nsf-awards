 "awd_abstract_narration": "While hormonal responses to stress are well known, the mechanisms of neural \r\ncontrol in regulating such responses are not well understood.  An animal under \r\nstress shows increased blood levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH.  \r\nACTH in turn stimulates steroidogenesis in the tissue of the adrenal cortex, which \r\ngenerates and releases corticosterone, a steroid glucocorticoid compound.  \r\nHowever, there has been a long-standing problem that the patterns of ACTH \r\nlevels in the blood often do not match changes in circulating glucocorticoid levels.  \r\nRecent discoveries suggest that this steroidogenic response of the adrenal \r\ncortex also is regulated by activity of the splanchnic nerve coming from the spinal \r\ncord.  This renewal project combines physiological and molecular approaches to \r\nidentify the mechanisms involved.  Experiments will test how blocking neural \r\nactivity changes the expression of biochemical enzymes and receptor proteins \r\nthat are part of the steroidogenic pathway, how neuronal stimulation might \r\nmodulate changes by regulating adrenal blood flow, and which nerve fiber types \r\n(preganglionic sympathetic or primary afferent fibers) mediate the observed \r\nchanges in steroidogenesis.\r\n    Results will define a novel mechanism for regulation of hormone activity in \r\nresponse to stress, which will have an impact on understanding neural control \r\nsystems in general, and can be important for management of stress in contexts \r\nsuch as agriculture as well as human behavior.  The project also involves student \r\ntraining in state-of-the-art technology in a very productive laboratory.\r\n\r\n",
