 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will take advantage of advanced technologies and\r\nstrategies proven successful in online role-playing games to create\r\nexciting opportunities for children in an after school context. There are\r\nalmost no examples of learning environments that build on lessons and\r\nstrategies from the commercial success of 3D online, role-playing games,\r\nenvironments that are populated by tens of thousands of users each day.\r\nLeveraging 3-D technologies and principles so successful for the gaming\r\ncommunity to develop educationally meaningful environments is a topic of\r\nwhich we, as an educational community, know very little and which has much\r\npotential to engage typically underrepresented groups in SMT learning.\r\nThis work is exploratory and has exciting potential both in terms of its\r\ndirect service to the disadvantaged children at the local Boys and Girls\r\nClubs and in terms of the broader implications of the research to inform\r\nthe education community.\r\n \r\nOur 18 month relationship with the Boys and Girls Clubs is currently\r\nstrong and recently Compaq and Microsoft donated $100,000 in equipment,\r\nsoftware, and service to both local Boys and Girls Clubs to create\r\nTechnology Centers. The Quest Atlantis program is viewed as an exciting\r\nopportunity to integrate the computers in Club programming, and staff, and\r\nspace will be committed to the project. Continuing this relationship and\r\nleveraging this still-new technology and the current interest in\r\ninnovating with this equipment and software creates a timely opportunity.",
