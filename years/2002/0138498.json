 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a medical imaging technique in which\r\nlow levels of current are applied through electrodes on the surface of the\r\nbody, the resulting voltage is measured on the electrodes, and an inverse\r\nproblem is solved computationally to determine the conductivity distribution in\r\nthe interior.  In EIT the imaged region is often a cross-section of the body, such as\r\na patient's chest.  The tissues and organs in the body have different\r\nconductivities, a fact which enables one to form an image from the\r\nconductivity distribution.   There is an essential interplay in EIT between \r\nengineering and mathematics.  The design of a fast and accurate EIT system \r\nposes many engineering challenges. Mathematics has helped solve design issues \r\nsuch as what are the optimal current patterns to apply, what number and size of \r\nelectrodes should be used, and what measurement precision is need to distinguish\r\ninhomogeneities. In order to image human processes in real time, the \r\nreconstruction algorithms that solve the inverse problem must be very efficient.  \r\nFurthermore, for certain applications, such as distinguishing a breast tumor \r\nfrom a cyst, the reconstructed conductivity values must be accurate.  The design \r\nof reconstruction algorithms draws on many areas of mathematics including \r\npartial differential equations, analysis and complex variables,\r\nmathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and scientific computation.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Mummy Range Workshop in Electrical Impedance Tomography is to \r\nbring together mathematicians, engineers, and physicians working in EIT to \r\nincrease the communication between the groups and address current problems in \r\ndesign issues, applications, and reconstruction algorithms.  To the organizers' \r\nknowledge, this is the first conference in EIT specifically designed to bring \r\ntogether these groups. The workshop will be held at the Pingree Park Campus of \r\nColorado State University, a conference center located in the Mummy Range of \r\nthe Rocky Mountains.  By bringing these groups together, we hope to expand the\r\nclinical applications of EIT and push the technology forward in terms of system\r\ndesign and reconstruction algorithms. Several important existing clinical \r\napplications of EIT include monitoring heart and lung function, diagnosis of\r\npulmonary embolis (a blood clot in the lung), diagnosis of pulmonary edema, \r\nmonitoring for internal bleeding, and the early detection of breast cancer.\r\nGroups attending the workshop will be presenting work on these applications \r\nand others such as imaging changes in the brain during epilepsy and stroke \r\nand monitoring of cancer tissue during hyperthermia by impedance spectroscopy.  \r\nSeveral groups are presenting work on the design of new systems for specific \r\napplications such as  breast cancer detection, and novel reconstruction algorithms \r\nwill be presented.
