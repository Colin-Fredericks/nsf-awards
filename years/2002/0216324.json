 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop photonic devices based on a new and proprietary family of rare earth oxide - aluminum oxide glasses, the real glasses, doped with Yb, Tm, and Er oxides. Phase I research showed exceptionally broad emission from Yb 3+, efficient energy transfer in co-doped glasses, and fluorescence lifetimes and spectra of Tm and Er that meet device requirements at high dopant concentrations. Feasibility of scaled-up production of the glasses was demonstrated. The Phase II activities include: collaboration with firms engaged in the glass and optical device business; scaled-up glass synthesis; optimization of dopant concentration and optical properties for devices; and construction and characterization of prototype laser devices.\r\n\r\nMarkets for optical device products are extremely large, multinational, and growing though expanded applications and displaced technologies. The Phase II R&D is focused on lasers, amplifiers, and optical devices for communications, laser surgery, and emerging military applications. The patent position and the absence of complex proprietary interests in the technology place this work in a strong commercial position.",
