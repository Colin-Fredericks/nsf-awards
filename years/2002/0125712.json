Experiments are being adapted from the research and educational literature and implemented into the undergraduate curriculum. In the Instrumental Analysis laboratory, students are performing project-based, comprehensive investigations typical of those they will be expected to carry out once employed in an industrial setting. Each project involves real world problems, utilizes several instruments, includes a literature review, method development, and laboratory preparation, and requires 2-4 weeks for completion. The LC-MS is playing a significant role in several of these projects. The instrument is also being used extensively in undergraduate research, both within the Department and in collaboration with faculty members outside the Department.",
