 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for funding to establish and operate an IGERT National Recruitment Program (INRP) that will serve all of the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) sites in the United States (soon to be 100 sites).  The goal will be to identify potential IGERT students and to facilitate their recruitment by the IGERT sites.  A high priority will be to increase the participation of under-represented groups including women and minorities.  The national recruitment program will identify these students and educate them and their mentors regarding IGERT programs and future career opportunities. The INRP will assess student backgrounds and creer interests and will facilitate contact between prospective students and the directors and faculty of the appropriate IGERT program(s).  This represents a partnership between the INRP and the IGERT directors and faculty to recruit students into appropriate IGERT sites and related opportunities.  Recruitment will occur at colleges and universities throughout the United States and at national and regional minority student science conferences.",
