For these aspirations to be realized, policy makers require information on how ICT impacts schooling and learning and how ICT might best be used to achieve a range of educational goals.  This proposal requests partial financial support for an international conference to disseminate results of major research efforts of these issues in 23 OECD countries.\r\n\r\n",
