Such observations have been made at \r\nMcDonald Observatory for more than 30 years.  The data provide for varied, multi-disciplinary \r\nand inter-disciplinary science results in areas of solid Earth sciences, geodesy and geodynamics, \r\nsolar system ephemerides, terrestrial and celestial reference frames, lunar physics, general \r\nrelativity and gravitational physics.  Standing alone or combined with data from other observing \r\ntechniques, LLR expands the understanding of the precession of the Earth.s spin axis, the lunar \r\nnutation, Earth orientatation, the Earth.s obliquity to the ecliptic, the intersection of the celestial \r\nequator and the ecliptic, lunar and solar solid body tides, lunar tidal deceleration, lunar physical \r\nand free librations, the structure of the moon and energy dissipation in the lunar interior.  LLR \r\nprovides input into lunar surface cartography and surveying and helps determine Earth station \r\nand lunar surface retroreflector locations and motions, mass of the Earth-Moon system, lunar and \r\nterrestrial  gravity harmonics and  Love numbers, relativistic  geodesic precession, and the \r\nequivalence principle of general relativity.  Due to the passive nature of the reflectors  and the \r\nimprovement  of  observing  equipment  and  data  analysis  capabilities  with  time,  LLR  data  will \r\ncontinue to provide for improved results.  Gains are steady and, as the data base expands, we are \r\nstriving to learn even more by applying more clever observation strategies. \r\n \r\nUnder this proposal, we continue the LLR observational effort at the McDonald Laser Ranging \r\nStation (MLRS).  With routine single-person operation and a 24 hour/day, 7 day/week schedule, \r\nlunar coverage will be substantial in the years to come, as we share the use of the MLRS with \r\nartificial satellite laser ranging (SLR) efforts.  We are cooperating with other observing efforts \r\naround the world, especially the French LLR/SLR station in the south of France.  In addition to \r\nthe observations, an analysis effort with world-wide communication, cooperation, and \r\ncoordination will be ongoing here at the University of Texas at Austin. We cooperate with \r\nanalysis efforts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the \r\nParis Observatory, and the BKG in Frankfurt and Munich. \r\n \r\nAlso,  the  University  of  Texas McDonald  Observatory,  since  the  inception  of  the  International \r\nLaser Ranging Service (ILRS) in 1998, houses the ILRS LLR Operations and Analysis Center.  \r\nThe small size of the LLR observing network, and the relatively small number of LLR analysis \r\ncenters, dictate the unique nature and operational procedures of this LLR Operations/Analysis \r\nCenter. The responsibility of the LLR Operations Center has evolved to be one that assures the \r\nsmooth flow of data through the LLR network, in a form and format that is useful for obtaining \r\nscientific results.  The center also coordinates the observations and their scheduling in a manner \r\nto maximum the scientific gains.  Predicts are coordinated on-site at each LLR station and the \r\ndata are automatically transferred from all observing sites to the  ILRS data centers.  LLR data \r\nanalysts  can secure their data directly from the data centers as needed.   Feed-back  from these \r\nanalysts often goes directly back to the individual observing stations. \r\n \r\nUnder the auspices of  this National Science Foundation Grant, we are looking forward to \r\nadditional  years  of  successful LLR  observation  and  analysis,  resulting  in  the  steady  and  rapid expansion of scientific results. \r\n***",
