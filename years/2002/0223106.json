This project is motivated by the drive for advanced CMOS integrated circuits with sub-micron feature sizes and the need to scale the gate dielectric, while preventing quantum mechanical gate current between the silicon inversion layer and the overlying gate electrode. The Si02 gate dielectric will be replaced with a single or dual -dielectric film consisting of one or more monolayers of SiO2 to form the interfacial transition region covered with a high dielectric constant (high-K) insulator. The rationale for a collaborative proposal effort lies in the capabilities of the two universities with Texas Tech University expertise in high-K gate materials and Lehigh University integrating these materials into an advanced gate insulator for CMOS devices. Texas Tech University will form high-K, Hf02 or ZrO2 gate dielectrics with a custom electron-beam deposition system to be incorporated into advanced CMOS devices and test structures fabricated at Lehigh University. The collaborative project will employ the combined and complementary analytical techniques at both universities, such as reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) at TTU combined with angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) at LU. Electrical characterization will be performed with unique test structures and measurement techniques to determine carrier trapping in the high-K dielectrics. The PI's multidisciplinary faculty will bring together students from different departments and universities in a project to foster a broad research and educational experience. The project is enhanced with close collaboration and outreach to industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
