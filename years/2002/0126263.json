 "awd_abstract_narration": "The future high-speed networks are expected to support a variety of services such as data,\r\nvoice, image, and video with diverse traffic flow characteristics and Quality-of-Service (QoS)\r\nrequirements. Developing a framework for the design, control and management of wide\r\narea packet networks which can effciently support such QoS requirements is a fundamental\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nConventional frameworks for the teletraffic analysis of networks and QoS guarantees are\r\neither deterministic or probabilistic. In the deterministic approach, the worst-case traffic\r\nenvelopes are used. This most likely will lead to conservative resource allocation policies\r\nand inefficient usage of the network resources. In the standard probabilistic frameworks,\r\nthe traffic is usually modeled as a variant of Poisson process, e.g., MMPP, MAP, etc. Such\r\nmodels are amenable to traditional teletraffic analysis but only capture simple and limited\r\ncorrelation structures in the data.\r\n\r\nThe researchers propose to significantly expand the analytical methodology in solving complex teletraffic problems arising in modern computer and communications networks. Their approach\r\nwhich is rooted in classical ballot theorem handles a large class of arrival processes including\r\nthe standard Markovian processes, general periodic processes, processes described by\r\ntime-series (auto-regressive and moving average), or even general processes described by the\r\njoint distribution of number of arrivals in equally-spaced non-overlapping discrete intervals.\r\nSpecial attention will be paid in deriving algorithmic solutions which are numerically robust\r\nand efficient even when the system utilization is high.\r\n\r\nThe researchers proposed approach is unifying, it avoids root-findings, and unlike the matrix analytical approach or recently introduced state-space spectral decomposition method, it does not\r\ninvolve potentially expensive iterations. Further, it is transform-free and may provide a\r\nsimple form of solution amenable for further analytical studies such as tail behavior or\r\nasymptotic analysis.\r\n\r\nThe researchers general arrivals processes could be used for the end-to-end performance analysis once the departure process from a network node is appropriately approximated or probabilistically\r\nbounded. Since they are not limited to traditional Markovian models, such an approach\r\nappears to be viable.\r\n\r\nThe researchers  propose to implement our general algorithms and make them available as a scientific package to the research community.",
