 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIn this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Sanov will combine  femtosecond spectroscopy with photoelectron imaging to monitor the evolution of molecular orbitals in the course of chemical reactions. The initial systems to be studied include isolated and hydrated sulfur-containing molecular anions, and cluster anions. These are chosen for their practical importance and for serving as prototypes for the development of the new methodology. Photodissociation and unimolecular decomposition, dynamics at conical intersections, microscopic solvation, wave packet evolution, and  bimolecular reactions in ionic clusters will be investigated.  The results of this research will find immediate application in modeling the structure and dynamics of negative ions and solutions. \r\n\r\nMany important chemical processes involve ionic reactions, and the reactivity is affected strongly by interactions with the environment.  In this research cluster ions are used as model micro-solutions for the studies of elementary processes relevant to biological and environmental chemistry. The results will provide insight into how the intermolecular interactions affect the behavior of electrons and chemical bonding. Photoelectron imaging experiments will be incorporated in the undergraduate Physical Chemistry program as a way of providing the students with hands-on research experience.  A fast-track Internet-based mechanism for publishing the results of student research will be developed. Students will be trained in research techniques in preparation for advanced studies and for entry into the scientific/technical workforce.\r\n\r\n",
