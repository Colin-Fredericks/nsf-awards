WeBWork and WWWAssign are adapted and used in conjunction with other methods to provide and collect information through the Internet to offer college mathematics homework assignments and college and high school mathematics algebra review and practice modules across the web. The project has the following outcomes:\r\n(a) WeBWork is adapted in mathematics courses of all levels at our institution.\r\n(b) Homework assignments and tests are offered in the resource center in electronic form using WeBWork and/or WWWAssign, with automatic grading and reporting of scores to instructors and immediate feedback to students.\r\n(c) Web-based review materials containing WeBWork practice problem sets are written to accompany the assignments and tests so that students who encounter difficulties can review and practice the material between attempts. \r\n(d) Web-based practice tests are created.\r\n(e) Workshops are conducted and assistance is provided for regional postsecondary and secondary teachers interested in learning about the WeBWork and WWWAssign systems.\r\nOngoing evaluation and dissemination programs also are fully integrated into the project.\r\n",
