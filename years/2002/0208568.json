 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increasing requirements on data rate and quality of\r\nservice for wireless communications systems call for new\r\ntechniques to improve radio link reliability and to increase\r\nspectral efficiency.  The three key technologies to achieve these\r\ngoals are equalization, diversity, and channel coding.\r\nMathematics is of fundamental importance to these technologies,\r\nproviding the theoretical basis as well as the means for\r\nefficient numerical implementations.  The investigator derives a\r\ntheoretical and numerical framework for designing equalization\r\ntechniques for time-varying channels.  Using methods from\r\npseudo-differential operator theory and time-frequency analysis,\r\nhe develops a qualitative and quantitative theory for the\r\napproximate diagonalization of operators associated with\r\ntime-varying systems.  These theoretical results form a keystone\r\nin the construction of fast and reliable numerical equalization\r\nmethods that are based on Krylov subspace techniques.  The\r\ninvestigator also studies the use of frame theory in wireless\r\ncommunications.  Using concepts from sphere packings and group\r\ntheory, he analyzes theoretical properties of special frames such\r\nas Grassmannian frames.  Furthermore, he develops theoretical and\r\nnumerical schemes in connection with multi-carrier communication\r\nsystems such as OFDM.  This includes the design of transmission\r\nsignals with specific properties using a generalization of the\r\nconcept of prolate spheroidal wave functions.  By taking recent\r\ntools from harmonic analysis into the wireless communications\r\ncommunity, this project enables further advances and\r\nbreakthroughs in wireless communications.  At the same time it\r\nstimulates new research areas in applied mathematics and paves\r\nthe road for further interactions between applied mathematicians\r\nand communication engineers.\r\n     The goal of this project is to develop mathematical concepts\r\nand computational methods for wireless communications technology.\r\nThe investigator combines modern tools from mathematics with\r\nmethods from information theory and signal processing to develop\r\nnew concepts and algorithms for key technologies in wireless\r\ncommunications, such as coding, transmission, and equalization.\r\nMathematics is of fundamental importance to these technologies,\r\nbecause it provides the theoretical basis as well as the means\r\nfor efficient numerical implementations.  By providing tools to\r\nimprove radio link reliability and increase data rates, this\r\nproject is instrumental in meeting the increasing requirements on\r\nfuture wireless communications systems.  The project produces\r\nconceptual deliverables in the form of new mathematical methods\r\nto analyze and construct wireless transmission systems.  The\r\nproject also produces concrete deliverables in the form of\r\nnumerical algorithms for use in the scientific and industrial\r\nsector.",
