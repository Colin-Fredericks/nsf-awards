 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance understanding of how information technology is perceived, used, and reconfigured in diverse cultures in Central Asia. By conducting an empirical investigation into the cultural factors that affect information technology adoption, and articulating which of these elements are most significant in determining the success rate of IT initiatives, the research will provide a blueprint that can be used by programs delivering IT-related programs in disparate settings. The research will focus on Central Asia because of that region's unique combination of infrastructure and literacy combined with relatively low exposure to Western culture and early stages of Internet adoption. The project will draw on qualitative and quantitative methods, using survey instruments, statistical analysis, coded interview data, and ethnographic observation. Surveys will be developed based on previous research, and they will be distributed at Internet access sites in Central Asia. Interviews will also be conducted in Central Asia. The survey and interview data will be analyzed in an effort to correlate usage habits with local cultural factors. As information technology becomes increasingly important, effective implementation becomes even more critical. This project will make a significant contribution to understanding how culture affects technology adoption, thus advancing broad-based approaches to bridging the digital divide.",
