 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tAs tropical forests are cleared for agriculture, tropical \r\ntrees become restricted to isolated \"islands\" of habitat.  If pollen \r\nand seeds do not move effectively among these fragments, local mating \r\noccurs, increasing inbreeding and the erosion of genetic diversity. \r\nInbreeding and reduced genetic diversity, in turn, can diminish seed \r\nproduction and seedling vigor, threatening population viability. \r\nThis study uses genetic markers to study how fragmentation affects \r\npollen movement and inbreeding in three animal-pollinated tropical \r\ntree species in Costa Rica. DNA fingerprinting will be used to \r\ndetermine pollen sources for seeds produced in forest fragments and \r\nhow levels of inbreeding and genetic diversity are affected by pollen \r\nmovement.  Comparing patterns of gene flow and seedling vigor between \r\nfragments and a nearby continuous forest will allow assessments of \r\ngenetic threats posed by fragmentation.  Geographic analyses will \r\nshow how patterns of gene flow are affected by fragment size and \r\nsurrounding landscapes. \r\n\r\n\tDeclines in biological diversity represent a profound global \r\nthreat. This study will illuminate how habitat loss and fragmentation \r\nare affecting reproductive success, genetic diversity and inbreeding, \r\nall of which can reduce population viability.  Because they depend so \r\nobviously on animals for pollination and seed dispersal, tropical \r\ntrees in forest patches are at particular risk of extinction.  As \r\nplants represent the foundation for biological productivity and \r\ndiversity, such losses can result in cascades of extinctions.  The \r\ndata from this study are thus needed to identify both proximal \r\nthreats to tropical trees and to guide longer-term management. \r\n",
