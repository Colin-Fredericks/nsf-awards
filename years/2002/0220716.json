 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the first year, the project team plans to award scholarships to twelve first \r\nyear students who are enrolled in a mathematics or a computer science major. \r\nThe scholarships are renewed each year for up to a total of four years. During the \r\nsecond year of the project, an additional six scholarships are awarded to sophomore \r\nmajors students to support and encourage them to change their majors to math or \r\ncomputer science. These scholarships are renewed for a total of three years. The `\r\nawards are renewed as long as students make satisfactory academic progress and \r\nremain within the major.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this scholarship program is to increase the number of and the\r\nretention of majors in computer science, computer information systems and \r\nmathematics. Because our curricula provide a solid theoretical and practical \r\nfoundation for careers in these fields, increasing the number of majors will have \r\nthe effect of increasing the number of skilled and knowledgeable workers \r\nqualified for many high-tech jobs. A secondary, but equally important, goal is to \r\nincrease the number of women and minority majors. This is especially important \r\nin computing where women and minorities are traditionally under represented. To \r\nmeet these goals, the project team is enhancing existing student support systems \r\nand extend existing research and project opportunities to provide training and job \r\nexperiences. \r\n\r\nIthaca College has extensive recruiting programs through the admissions office \r\nand the Higher Educational Opportunity Program (HEOP). The latter program \r\nspecifically targets minority recruiting. Both of these programs provide additional \r\nsupport for new initiatives such as this scholarship program. Faculty members are \r\ntraveling to selected high schools to inform faculty and staff about these \r\nscholarships. The project team is providing printed and on-line materials to \r\nprospective students, and is encouraging prospective students to communicate \r\ndirectly with mathematics and computer science faculty. The selection of students \r\nfor the program is made by a team that is composed of two faculty from mathematics, \r\ntwo faculty from computer science and one academic advisor staff member from \r\nthe student Adacemic Advising office . Students Academic qualifications data are \r\nprovided by the admissions office, and financial need data are provided by the financial \r\naid office. Combining the requested scholarships with college funds and other federal \r\nfunds, we aim to meet 100% of financial need while minimizing loans. \r\n\r\nSupport for matriculated students to remain in a mathematics or computer science \r\nmajor is provided through many venues. Upper level students serve as teaching and \r\nlab assistants in open labs during evening and weekend hours and in walk-in \r\nhelp rooms. Courses are available to provide academic prerequisites for students who \r\nare lacking some specific skills. Additional opportunities for faculty and upper-level \r\nstudent mentoring especially for women and minorities have been established. \r\nReal-world experiences are provided within courses and by providing the students \r\nwith relevant work experiences, e.g., as assistants in courses and computer laboratories. \r\nThe project team plans to establish a networking program between recent graduates \r\nand current undergraduates to provide regular communication channels to support \r\nmentoring. Processes are in place to aid and ensure that students effectively use the \r\nservices provided by career planning function at Ithaca College.",
