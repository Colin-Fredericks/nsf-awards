 "awd_abstract_narration": "Delamination fracture is a major design concern for load bearing structural components manufactured from composite materials.  Current standard test methods describe procedures for the determination of inter-laminar fracture toughness or the number of fatigue cycles for the onset of delamination growth using Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) theories.  These methods carry severe limitations resulting in an inadequate characterization of the fundamental design parameters of the materials.  A fundamental approach, which has so far been ignored, is the correlation of these material design properties with Non Destructive Inspection (NDI) parameters such as those detected by Thermal Wave Imaging (TWI) or other methods.  If such relationships exist, the prediction capability of the standard test methods in evaluating design and durability related parameters of materials and structures, should be considerably enhanced. The Thermal Wave Imaging System to be used in conjunction with the existing state of the art mechanical properties characterization equipment will enable the researchers to conduct fundamental research on the delamination fracture behavior of composite materials as well as damage tolerance studies on other metallic and nonmetallic structures. The aim is to develop guidelines to establish delamination behavior of composite structures and damage tolerance of materials and relate them to structural performance, as determined by standard test methods.  This will enhance the prediction capability of the current standard test methods and reduce the premature failure of structures in service.\r\n\r\nThermal Wave Imaging system will not only enhance the quality of many research projects at TU, but strongly help in training graduate and undergraduate students at a historically black institution.  At least two graduate and two undergraduate students will be trained in this area of research every year.  The PI and two of his research associates, with a strong background in materials characterization, will guide and advise the students' research, which will be in the form of graduate M.Sc. thesis and senior research projects.  Some of the PI's and the research associates' time will be devoted to maintaining the equipment.  \r\n",
