 "awd_abstract_narration": "0205148\r\nHansen\r\n \r\nThe focus of the proposed research is to analyze controllability and \r\nstabilization properties of systems of partial differential equations (PDE's) \r\nthat model layered elastic media. Specific layered elastic systems we are \r\nconcerned with include constrained-layer damping models, laminated \r\nplates, plates with surface-mounted and/or embedded actuators and \r\ngeneral multilayer plate theory.  For a given layered structure, generally \r\nthere are many different PDE systems of varying complexity that could be \r\nused to model the vibrations. Often the various PDE's are connected \r\nthrough a perturbation, which may be singular. The central concern will be \r\nto determine the dependence of stability and controllability upon the \r\nperturbation parameters that connect the possible models. This way model \r\ndependence, accuracy, and robustness properties of control and feedback \r\nstrategies can be tested. The plan is to apply this type of analysis to \r\npractical control applications such as optimal design for constrained-layer \r\ndamping and the stabilization of elastic structures using surface-mounted \r\nand embedded piezoelectric actuators. Several theoretical challenges \r\npresent themselves in attempting to develop control methods that are \r\nuseful for multilayer plates.  In particular, it is hoped to develop a theory \r\nof Carleman multipliers that is applicable to boundary control of layered \r\nsystems. The objective is to obtain the sharpest possible results regarding \r\nboundary control.\r\n \r\nUnderstanding the modeling, control and stabilization of layered elastic \r\nsystems is becoming increasingly important due to the rapid advances in \r\nmaterial sciences, fabrication of composite materials, and speed of \r\nprocessing. The models considered are motivated by practical real-world \r\napplications involving composite layered structures.  These include the \r\ndesign of ship hulls and airplane fuselage, sound-proofing in auto bodies \r\nand the design of sporting goods such as skis and tennis rackets. Often, it \r\nis possible to utilize a composite construction to achieve a far superior \r\ndesign compared to what is possible with a single material.  Developing a \r\ntheory for control and feedback of these structures is a challenging \r\nproblem due the complicated nature of the coupling between the layers.  \r\nOn the other hand, for a model to be useful in practical engineering \r\napplications, various crude approximations need to be made to reduce the \r\ncomplexity. Thus, a large part of the goal is to quantify the connection \r\nbetween an accurate, but complex mathematical model and a simplified, \r\nbut more useful engineering model.   Specific problems of practical \r\ninterest which will be addressed include: feedback control of vibrating \r\nstructures using strategically placed actuators, optimal design and stability \r\nanalysis for damping in layered and laminated composites.\r\n",
