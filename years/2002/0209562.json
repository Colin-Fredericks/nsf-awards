 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work investigates the numerical and analytic solution of inverse\r\nspectral problems in one and two dimensions. In one dimension, the\r\nappearance of an eigenparameter in the boundary condition of a\r\nSturm-Liouville problem causes a loss of self-adjointness. Although\r\nuniqueness of the inverse problem has been established, there are no\r\nconstructive schemes available that lend themselves to numerical\r\ncomputation. This work (with William Rundell) develops and analyzes two\r\nconstructive schemes involving to recover the potential in this type of\r\nproblem. In two dimensions, the eigenvalues of particular membranes are used\r\nto find an approximation to a function representing the nonhomogeneity in\r\nthe boundary value problem governing the elastic membrane. Projection of the\r\nboundary value problem and its coefficients onto appropriate vector spaces\r\nleads to a matrix inverse problem, which is solved using optimization\r\ntechniques. This work will consider various domains and investigate the\r\nrecovery of multiple coefficients. Theoretical questions regarding circular\r\ndomains will also be investigated. In particular, the recovery of a radial\r\ndensity using techniques from differential geometry and the properties of\r\nthe radial spectrum of a vibrating circular membrane will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThere are many situations in which it is not practical to measure an object's\r\n properties directly.  Doctors do not perform surgery to determine the size\r\nof a brain tumor prior to a patient's treatment.  An engineer does not\r\ndismantle an airplane to determine the level of corrosion in its wing.\r\nInstead external measurements of an object are made and used to determine\r\nthe internal properties of the object.  This research focuses on the use of\r\nvibrational information to determine physical parameters of an object. If\r\nthese parameters are known, the vibration is modeled mathematically by a\r\nboundary value problem.  If the parameters are not known, but the vibration\r\nis known, then the problem to be solved is an inverse boundary value\r\nproblem - also known as an inverse spectral problem.  This project develops\r\nseveral constructive algorithms for the solution of this type of problem.  It\r\nis important to realize that while mathematical inverse problems often have\r\nmultiple solutions, their physical counterpart may not.  Choosing the\r\n\"correct\" solution is also addressed in this work.",
