 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to use hydrothermal synthesis techniques to expand the inorganic materials chemistry of metal oxides and specifically to discover new open framework structures with potential for use as sorbents or heterogeneous catalysts. An important direction is an emphasis on microporous solids with stability and intracrystalline reactivity. Two major classes of inorganic materials have been targeted, the group VB transition metal phosphates, and the group VB transition metal silicates and germanates. Initial studies indicate that many new microporous framework silicates can be constructed and this a major focus of the research. New synthesis techniques that will be developed include the modification of standard hydrothermal reaction conditions and the use of higher pressures where necessary. Training of both undergraduate and graduate students will be emphasized. In particular the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in the research will be emphasized. \r\n\r\nNew nanoporous inorganic solids with improved properties that will have applications in molecule separations and as catalysts in chemical reactions are vital to the needs of the petrochemical industry in areas that include oil refining and chemicals production. Improvements in chemical processing are important for more effective use of U.S.  hydrocarbon resources and to increase energy efficiency. \r\n",
