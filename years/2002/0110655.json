 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has as its objectives the exploration of supramolecular chemistry with special emphasis on supramolecular photochemistry. One facet of this exploration involves the changes in properties of molecules when they are contained within -- and interact with the interior surface of -- zeolites. An extension of this concept to the area of radical polymerization draws upon the analogy of the chain-end radical being contained within a polymeric vessel. Electron spin resonance and other spectroscopic techniques will be employed to charactersize these radicals and to measure their rate constants of addition to monomers. These investigations will provide knowledge concerning the crucial polymer chain propagating steps, which are of fundamental importance to critical issues in the field of free radical polymerization. Starburst dendrimers will be employed as probes inside DNA and liposome supramolecular containers, giving insight on the ability of some dendrimers to assist in the transfection of DNA into cells.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support of the research and educational activities of Professor Nicholas J. Turro of Columbia University. Professor Turro's research is in the area of suprameolecular chemistry, wherein smaller molecules are contained within or otherwise interact with larger molecules with attendant alterations in their properties. These principles are likely to have important practical consequenses in the areas of polymer chemistry as well as DNA transfection technologies. In addition, one is able to gain knowledge about the properties of molecules as discrete, individual entities. These studies provide important multidisciplinary educational and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students of chemistry as well as for postdoctoral associates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
