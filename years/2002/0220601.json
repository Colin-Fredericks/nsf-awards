Gersting\r\nInstitution:\tUniversity of Hawaii at Hilo\r\nTitle:\t\tALOHA - A Learning Opportunity for High Achievers\r\n\r\n\r\nThis CSEMS program provides support for a cohort of 15 students for 4 years to complete the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Three target population groups have been identified, with the intent to secure, as much as possible, an equitable representation of students from each group: traditional high school graduates, community college transfer students, and students from U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands, including U.S. territories of American Samoa and Guam, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (CNMI), and the Republic of Palau (Belau).\r\n\r\nStudents are selected based not only on academic ability and financial need, but also on their understanding of the rigors of the degree requirements. Student support services for the first two years include both academic and social support structures in an attempt to improve retention. These services concentrate on mentoring and providing supplemental instruction. The following two years include an emphasis on skills and opportunities to transition to a high technology workforce, and exposure to career opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe program builds on existing strengths such as the quality of the computer science degree program, a caring faculty, a high sense of identity among computer science majors, and support services and activities designed to broaden the path to graduation for students. Consistent with the program guidelines, academically talented but financially disadvantaged students are identified, challenged, supported, and guided through completion of the degree and on into the workforce.\r\n\r\n",
