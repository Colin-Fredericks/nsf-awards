Dwyer of Notre Dame) \r\nstudies the classifying spaces of Lie groups and p-compact \r\ngroups with the goal of finishing the classification of \r\n2-compact groups and their automorphisms.  Wilkerson and \r\nSmith study actions of finite groups on arbitrary finite \r\ncomplexes. The goal is to construct a moduli space\r\nthat classifies actions with given fixed point data.\r\nMcClure and Smith will continue their work on chain \r\noperads and chain models for homotopy theories.  Specifically, \r\nthey propose to find a small chain model for the framed \r\nlittle-disks operad, to show that the category of \"unstable\" \r\ncoalgebras over a certain chain operad is a model for HZ-local \r\nhomotopy theory of spaces, to give a similar model for \r\nHZ-local spectra, and to create a chain model for the model \r\ncategory of K(n)-module spectra.  They also propose to \r\ninvestigate the properties of a symmetric monoidal\r\nstructure on the category of cosimplicial chain complexes.\r\nMcClure uses the joint work with Smith to study the homotopy\r\ntheoretic properties of the Snaith splitting.  He hopes \r\nto find a simplified proof of the theorem of Goerss-Hopkins \r\ntheorem which gives the spectrum E(n) a commutative \r\nmultiplication. He also studies the rational homotopy \r\ntheory of equivariant spectra when the group is the circle.\r\nSmith and Grodal are studying homotopy G-spheres. That is, \r\nspaces that are homotopy equivalent to a sphere and have \r\nan action of a finite group G. They hope to give a complete classification based on algebraic invariants of the group.  \r\nThey also study the moduli space of homotopy G-spheres.\r\n\r\nHomotopy theory is the most fundamental of all geometries. \r\nIt studies those geometric properties which do not change \r\nno matter what continuous deformations are made.  The \"equality\"\r\nof donuts and coffee cups is a well known example.  Yet, \r\nsurprisingly, geometry as studied by homotopy theory has \r\nan intrinsic algebraic nature.  The PIs study the \r\ngeometric properties of spaces using techniques \r\nthat come from algebra, with homotopy theory providing \r\nthe bridge between these different areas of mathematics. \r\nIn fact, all homotopy information of a space can be \r\ndescribed using algebra.  The algebra is complicated \r\nbut homotopy theory gives a correspondence \r\nbetween geometry and algebra that has many important \r\napplications.",
