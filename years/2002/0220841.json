 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing a scholarship program for students entering the degree programs developed through the activities of The Southeast Consortium for Advanced Network Technology Education (SCANTE). The level of intensity of these advanced network technology degree programs dictates that students in these programs devote a great deal of time to their studies. In addition, work-based learning experiences give students the necessary job experience to enter into the workforce and/or further their education. Full time faculty educated and trained by the SCANTE activities direct this project.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are to:\r\n1. Increase the numbers of well educated and skilled employees in technical areas of national need by targeting recruitment efforts toward females, minorities, nontraditional students, and first-generation college students;\r\n2. Improve educational opportunities for students in the following disciplines: Advanced Computer Network Technology --- Local Area Networking, Wide Area Networking; Computer Programming; Internet Development Technologies; Computer Servicing Technology; and Telecommunications Technology;\r\n3. Increase retention of students to degree achievement (A.A.S. or an A.A. degree) by providing mentoring and work-based learning experiences;\r\n4. Increase success in transfer of students into baccalaureate degree programs by increasing the initial communication between the student and the faculty in the baccalaureate degree program;\r\n5. Improve student support programs through faculty, industry, and peer mentoring of students; successful student participation in work-based learning opportunities; on campus student seminars focusing on workplace behaviors, attitudes, and dress; and\r\n6. Strengthen partnerships between Jones County Junior College and the industries in the southeastern United States through participation of the industries in JCJC job fairs, work-based learning opportunities, mentoring of students, and the hiring of graduates; participation of industries in student field trips and presentations to student organizations.\r\n",
