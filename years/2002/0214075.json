 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop  a miniature electrochemically operated antimicrobial agents generator for suppression of dental plaque and halitosis control. Plaque, oral malodor, gingivitis, periodontal disease, and discoloration of the teeth are all undesirable conditions that affect many people. It is broadly estimated that 25-85 million Americans have halitosis, especially due to gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. While good oral hygiene, as achieved by brushing the teeth with a cleansing dentifrice, reduces the above-mentioned conditions, it does not necessarily prevent or eliminate their occurrence. Microorganisms contribute to both the initiation and progression of these conditions. Thus, suppressing microorganisms is the key to good oral hygiene. In this Phase I project, optimization of the electrocatalyst (to improve current and energy efficiencies as well as long term stability) and biocidal properties of the dual disinfectants will be conducted. In the follow on Phase II project, the miniature device will be constructed. This miniature mouthwash generator, simultaneously producing two FDA approved antimicrobial agents, has a significant potential for commercialization. The device is expected to be robust and maintenance free, and will require only  the replacement of penlight batteries and inexpensive consumables.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in the area of dental hygiene for general household use.",
