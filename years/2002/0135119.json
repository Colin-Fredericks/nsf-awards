 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER\r\nGarnero\r\n0135119\r\n\r\nThis proposal describes a long-term research directive for studying \r\nEarth's deep interior and related activities in science education in \r\nseismology and geophysics. An undergraduate and graduate course in \r\nseismology will be developed in Arizona State University's Department \r\nof Geological Sciences, a department that has experienced recent \r\nexpansion in geophysics/seismology. Many topics in seismology are \r\nbeyond the scope of an undergraduate course that uses traditional \r\nlecturing approaches. The new courses will utilize more three \r\ndimensional visualizations using computer imaging and animation, \r\nalong with more interactive learning methods and analogies. Both the \r\nundergraduate and graduate course will utilize already in-house \r\nresearch tools to study aspects of seismic data from recent and past \r\nrelevant earthquakes. Emphasis on individual student and group \r\ndiscovery will be emphasized in both classes. Research activities for \r\nthe proposed period focus on seismic studies of Earth's interior, \r\nwith emphasis on the deep mantle. Three main areas of focus are: (1) \r\ndetermination of seismic heterogeneity, which is used to infer \r\nthermal and/or chemical heterogeneity; (2) detection and \r\ncharacterization of seismic wave speed anisotropy, which is related \r\nto rheology, dynamics, and flow in the mantle; and (3) detection and \r\nmapping of boundary layers and/or discontinuities in seismic \r\nproperties, which may relate to chemical or phase boundaries in the \r\nEarth. The proposed work utilizes travel time and waveform analyses \r\nof relevant seismic waves and tomographic analyses, and will utilize \r\ntwo state of the art computer labs in the department, which are both \r\noutfitted with modern PC and UNIX computers. Research efforts \r\ncharacterizing heterogeneity, anisotropy, and boundary layering will \r\ninclude 2- and 3-D travel time and waveform analysis and propagation \r\ntools, an important next step in deep Earth seismology.\r\n-- \r\n",
