 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdomain  routing  performs  the  critical  function  of  gluing  together individual  pieces of  the  Internet topology to create a connected data delivery infrastructure. Today this critical function is performed by the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [rfc1771] which establishes  reachability information among Autonomous Systems (ASes). However despite its importance, current measurements and analysis have not led to a basic understanding  of  BGP's  dynamics,  performance  under  stress,  fundamental  weaknesses,  and  potential breaking  points  (if  any).  Although  a  few  data  collection  points  have  been  set  up  in  the  last  few  years \r\n[ipe,routeviews],  the  routing  data  collected  by  these  measurement  points  are  mixed  with  measurement artifacts [ftntalk], thus the data do not necessarily reflect the protocol's behavior in actual operation. \r\n \r\nIn  order  for  the  Internet  to  continue  its  unprecedented  growth,  the  interdomain  routing  protocol  must continue  to  evolve  to  meet  ever  increasing  and  sometimes  contradictory  requirements.  There  is  a  general belief  that  the  current  BGP  routing  protocol  may  be  unable  to  meet  its  new  requirements  (for  instance, accomodating  the  sharp  increase  in  use  of  site  multi-homing,  which  keeps  routing  tables  from  optimally small  sizes[huston:scale:2001]).  BGP  is  generally  thought  to  be  reaching  the  end  of  its  useful  lifetime, although  this  has  not  been  validated  by  analysis  or  measurements [nimrod,irtfrr,huitema:ipng,huston:scale:2001]. Due to the lack of a shared understanding of the problem and lack  of  sufficient  data  and  analysis,  there  is  no  consensus  on  where/when  BGP  collapses  and  what  (if anything) should be done.  \r\n \r\nTo address the above critical questions facing interdomain routing, the researchres have assembled a team with research and operational experience, and expertise in network protocols, algorithms, modeling and analysis. The resarchers have identified the following fundamental technical requirements that the global routing must meet: it must scale in order to handle the growth (both in the number of users and in the richness of connectivity); security and resilience are critical issues, so it must continue to function in face of ever increasing faults and attacks; it must be able to fully utilize the rich Internet connectivity; and it must both allow network operators to apply various policy constraints and implementors to easily extend the protocol's functionality when needed. \r\n \r\nBased on the above criteria the researchers propose to tackle the challenge with the following 3 steps.  (1) Develop measurement methodologies and collect data necessary to understand the current BGP operation, its overhead, dynamics under stress, potential vulnerabilities, inadequacies in functionality. The research  will base this measurement effort on precise requirements that isidentiied as lacking in existing data, such as for the data not to be collected over vulnerable multihop links [ftntalk].  A new effort at University of Oregon, separate from this proposal, is the measurement companion, if funded. (2) Guided by our measurement and analysis, evaluate several proposed design approaches, including meeting the requirements by tinkering with BGP, by a NIMROD-like [nimrod] maps-approach, by two different approaches to handling multihoming scalability, and by a Clean Slate approach of a complete BGP replacement.  Each of these approaches emphasizes different aspects of the interdomain routing problem. The researchers believe there are fundamental trade-offs between many of the desired technical requirements and that these trade-offs are currently not well understood.  The combination of measurement and rigorous analysis with a team including operations expertise will bring these trade-offs into clear view. (3) Based on the data analysis and design evaluations the researchers will produce a final approach as the recommendation for moving forward.   \r\n \r\nThrough  iterations  of  the  above  steps,  the proposed  research  undertaking  is  expected  to  produce  new understanding  of  current  interdomain  routing  operations,  their  dynamics  and  resilience  (or lack  of  it), and vulnerabilities;  a  new  analysis will also be produced that  draws  on  direct  and  intensive  measurement  and operations  knowledge  to capture  the  fundamental  trade-offs  among  interdomain  routing  requirements;  and a conclusion will be reached on how to meet the future Internet's interdomain routing needs.",
