 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most modern single processor architectures focus on exploiting instruction-level parallelism. However, despite continued performance improvements, there is increasing doubt that aggressive ILP architecture techniques would continue bringing the desired improvements and that there will come about a diminishing return in the performance of single-chip architectures.\r\n\r\nMultithreaded execution models promise to exploit thread-level parallelism (TLP) beyond a pure ILP approach. Multithreading can be applied directly at the level of uniprocessor instruction-set architectures. For example, Simultaneous MultiThreading (SMT) is a promising approach, which is attracting the attention of a number of academic and industrial research groups. This technique allows the various pipelines of a \"superscalar\" processor to be efficiently utilized by scheduling from several \"coarse-grain\" threads of one (or several) program(s). Although exploiting both ILP and TLP is attractive, the following questions are investigated in the project:\r\n\r\n- Can an architecture model, which integrates fine-grain multithreading support with a coarse-grain multithreaded architecture model such as SMT, be developed?\r\n\r\n- What are the design trade-off when mapping these architecture features to single-chip implementations?\r\n\r\n- What compiling methodology for the proposed architecture model would exploit thread-level parallelism at both coarse and fine-grain levels?\r\n\r\n",
