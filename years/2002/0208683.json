 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop techniques for trusted systems that can provide correct information and take correct actions when needed and where needed.  The focus will be on peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, where computers or nodes operate autonomously, without any central control.  In a P2P system, each node provides storage and compute resources. It connects to other neighbor nodes, and the community provides services like file sharing, document archiving, or data analysis.\r\n\r\nP2P systems are especially well suited as the \"backbone\" of a trusted system because nodes operate independently, without reliance on particular network connections or on nodes with a fixed functionality.  Thus, a P2P system can adapt to a changing environment, and with the proper mechanisms, can isolate or ignore malicious nodes.\r\n\r\nAs part of the project, several important problems will be addressed such as: \r\n\nDenial of Service (DoS): How does one protect against malicious sites that generate excess load to prevent others from receiving resources or service?\r\n\r\nSearching: How does one efficiently find information without using centralized index facilities, and in a dynamically changing environment?\n\r\nInformation Authenticity: How does one verify the authenticity of documents or information?\r\n\nPreservation: How does one preserve information past the lifetime of the originating node?\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is high risk, but there is also the potential for a large payoff.  The research is high risk because the problems faced are difficult: Building a trusted community out of building blocks that may be transient and malicious, is not an easy task.  However, the only way to build a trusted system is, as proposed, by making as few assumptions as possible about the trustworthiness of its components. The techniques to be developed, if successful, will provide a solid foundation for building truly reliable, secure, and trusted systems for electronic commerce, military applications, healthcare, and many other applications.",
