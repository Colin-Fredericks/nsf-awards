 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Charles Campbell and his coworkers at the University of Washington are measuring the detailed adsorption and reaction energetics of small molecules and metal atoms adsorbed on well-characterized metal and semiconductor surfaces.  Using a unique microcalorimetric approach, adsorption energies and bond strengths of metal-carbon and metal-oxygen bonds are determined.  Adsorption and interaction of larger, more complex organic species are also examined.  This accurate data is useful in developing an understanding of the reaction mechanisms relevant to heterogeneous catalysis, chemical vapor deposition processes, and adhesion at solid surfaces.  \r\n\r\nThe strength of a chemical bond between an adsorbed molecule and a solid surface is a crucial piece of information for developing an understanding of technologically important processes such as heterogeneous catalysis and electronic device manufacture.  This information is very difficult to obtain in a direct way.  Professor Campbell and coworkers at the University of Washington have developed a unique microcalorimetric approach to obtaining this information that has been applied to a wide range of important surface chemical systems.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, these important measurements will continue and be extended to organic molecules interacting with metal and semiconductor surfaces.  \r\n",
