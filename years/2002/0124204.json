 "awd_abstract_narration": "During secondary aluminum processing, oxidation of the aluminum in reverberatory furnaces leads to the formation of dross, which contains aluminum in metallic form that is entrapped within its oxide.  Among the detrimental effects are loss of aluminum, promotion of metallurgical defects in aluminum products and reduced furnace efficiency, due to the insulation effects of the dross layer.  The PI proposes to study the transport processes that lead to dross formation through a numerical and experimental study of the oxidation of molten aluminum alloys in a furnace environment. The goal will be to determine optimal furnace conditions that will minimize the formation of dross.  The project is collaborative between the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Gas Technology Institute. Reduction of dross formation has potential for significant increases in energy efficiency and reduction of waste in this industry, which produces 1/3 of the aluminum produced in the United States.",
