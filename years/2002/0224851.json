 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Merriam-Powell Research Station for construction of new housing units at the Centennial Forest, 19,114 hectares of land set aside by the State of Arizona for research, educational, and outreach on the Colorado Plateau. The construction of the housing and related infrastructure is part of a facilities development project for the recently established Merriam-Powell Research Station (MPRS), a collaboration of Northern Arizona University, Arizona State University, The University of Arizona, and The University of Nevada-Las Vegas. The MPRS supports research in the Greater Grand Canyon-San Francisco Peaks Ecosystem centered along the 3,000 m elevation gradient first characterized by C. Hart Merriam in developing his Life Zone Concept.  The Centennial Forest is a primary site within the Southwest Ecological Gradient Network, a latitude/climate gradient extending from Tucson, Arizona to Las Vegas, Nevada. The Forest includes old growth ponderosa pine, pinyon-juniper woodland, and high elevation grasslands. Existing research infrastructure includes elevational gradient plots with weather stations, a 5-year experimental fire history gradient, 20-year regional ponderosa pine common gardens, and replicated 50 ha ponderosa pine old growth restoration plots.  Although the region has been used extensively for field research, the Centennial Forest lacks housing and laboratory facilities.  Eventually MPRS expects to have 25 visiting scientist/student housing units, in addition to buildings that include wet and dry labs, classrooms and offices, and a greenhouse complex. The housing units are designed to resemble the traditional Navajo Hogan, and will provide low-cost on-site accommodations for visiting scientists and university classes, and thus promote interdisciplinary and interagency collaborations for study of the Greater Grand Canyon-San Francisco Peaks Ecosystem.",
