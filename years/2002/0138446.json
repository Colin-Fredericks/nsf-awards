Many degenerate situations \r\ncan be expressed as a root of a multivariate system of \r\npolynomials.  We propose to study the use of toric resultants \r\nto detect degenerate situations in solid modeling applications.  \r\nBy taking advantage of the underlying monomial structure \r\nof a system of polynomials, the toric resultant can provide \r\na method for solving systems of polynomials that is \r\ndramatically more efficient than the classical \"dense\" \r\nresultants of Macaulay and Cayley.  We will focus on \r\napplication to boundary evaluation for curved solids.\r\nOur work will include enumeration of degenerate conditions \r\nand identifying detection algorithms for each category, \r\nusing the toric resultant where appropriate.  The work \r\nis intended to foster future collaborative research \r\nendeavors on topics including resolution of geometric \r\ndegeneracies, general algebraic number computation, and\r\ncomputational Morse theory.\r\n\r\nGeometric degeneracies occur when a minor perturbation \r\nof the geometry would cause a qualitatively different \r\npositioning between the objects.  Degeneracies, such as \r\ntwo overlapping surfaces or a vertex of one object lying \r\non the face of another, are common occurances in many\r\nreal-world solid modeling examples.  The problems of \r\ndetecting and dealing with degenerate situations becomes \r\nparticularly difficult when dealing with curved surfaces.  \r\nUsually, detecting such cases involves finding roots of \r\npolynomials.  Thus, accurate and efficient root-finding \r\nis crucial to an effective approach for handling\r\ndegeneracies.  The toric resultant is an approach for \r\nfinding solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  \r\nBecause of its efficiency compared to other methods of \r\nsolving such systems, it is a promising approach\r\nfor detecting and treating degeneracies.  We propose \r\nto address degeneracies in solid modeling applications \r\nthrough the use of the toric resultant.\r\n",
