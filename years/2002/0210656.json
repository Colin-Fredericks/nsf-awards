 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nBioelectronic interfacing of living cells via self-assembled microwires\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWe propose to develop a new method for creating bioelectronic circuits that will allow targeting and electrically interfacing specific molecules on the membrane of living cells, incorporating the cells into larger electrical circuits. This method is based on a new technique reported recently by one of the PIs (Science, 294, 1082, 2001) that allows the assembly of long, electrically conductive microwires directly from suspensions of metallic nanoparticles. The microwires are assembled via dielectrophoresis, the particle mobility and interactions in alternating electric field. We will devise techniques for controlled growth of microwires in thin chambers and microfluidic channels, and will develop experimental and theoretical tools for cell and wire manipulation in the electrical field leading to cell interfacing. \r\n\tBioelectronic interfacing is one of the promising, yet underdeveloped, areas of nanoscience research. The success of this project could lead to development of new sensors, where the response of living cells to different toxins, biological or chemical agents is detected with greater precision and sensitivity. It can also help in developing tools for in situ interfacing of cells in living tissues (such as neurons). Current techniques either let the cells sit on top of electrode arrays or impale them via microelectrodes. In contrast, we will complete the connection between the cells and the electrical circuits via nanoparticle self-assembly, a potentially much more flexible and powerful approach. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
