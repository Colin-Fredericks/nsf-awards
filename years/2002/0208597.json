 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n  As the recording technology further matures, more complex coding\r\nalgorithms for recording channels are challenging integrated circuit\r\nmanufacturing technology limits. The implementation of recent major\r\nconceptual advances in coding theory, including iterative decoding,\r\ncodes on graphs as well as constrained codes, has been limited mainly by\r\nthe speed and recording density requirements of modern recording\r\nsystems. This research is developing coding schemes for\r\nultra-fast high-density recording systems that can lend themselves to\r\nvery low complexity implementations.\r\n  The focus of the research is the idea that good codes can be\r\nconstructed without using random interleavers or random sparse parity\r\ncheck matrices. The constructions are based on combinatorial\r\ndesigns and finite geometries. Such codes have a simple and well-defined\r\nstructure, which means lower decoder complexity. This approach also\r\noffers a large flexibility in choosing code parameters. The fundamental\r\ncode construction issues addressed in this research include\r\nunderstanding a structure of good codes and tradeoffs among code length,\r\nrate and structure as well as matching a code to a partial response\r\nchannel. The second class of codes studied in this research are\r\nconstrained codes and graph constrained codes.",
