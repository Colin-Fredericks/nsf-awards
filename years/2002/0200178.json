Among the systems to be considered are those from\r\nordinary and partial differential equations, systems of lattice differential\r\nequations (that is, spatially discrete systems), differential delay equations,\r\nand nonlinear maps on cones.  Issues such as existence of equilibria and their\r\nstability, spontaneous formation of spatial patterns and spatial chaos, and\r\nexistence and qualitative properties of traveling fronts, will be studied for\r\nthese equations.  In addition to established techniques (both theoretical\r\nand numerical) from differential equations and dynamical systems, a significant\r\nportion of the proposed research involves the development and implementation\r\nof new tools and techniques with which to study these systems. Among the\r\ntechniques to be employed are those involving singular perturbations,\r\ninvariant manifolds, exponential dichotomies, and topological methods (Morse\r\ndecompositions, fixed point theorems, degree theory).\r\n\r\nWe are developing new mathematical techniques for analyzing and understanding\r\ndifferential equations and difference equations which arise as models in\r\nvarious areas of science.  Very broadly, these types of mathematical systems\r\nmodel time-dependent or evolutionary behavior, as it occurs in a wide range\r\nof scientific areas, including biology, chemistry, electrical circuit theory,\r\nimage processing, and material science. While this is a very broad scope of\r\ninquiry, the specific problems to be studied exhibit features in common --\r\nspontaneous formation of patterns, self-sustained oscillations, regulation by\r\ninternal feedback (often with time delays) -- which can be analyzed with some\r\nof the basic tools of dynamical systems theory.  It is expected the resulting\r\nmathematical advances arising from these studies will increase the knowledge\r\nof and will provide insight into both the abstract theory of dynamical\r\nsystems and the scientific areas of inquiry.\r\n\r\n",
