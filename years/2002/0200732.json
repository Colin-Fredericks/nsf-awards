 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Maciej R. Zworski, UC-Berkeley. DMS-0200732\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThe main interest of the PI is the study of quantum mechanics from the\r\nmathematical point of view, and of its many manifestations in the theory\r\nof partial differential equations and geometry. Specific current interests are \r\nthe classical/quantum correspondence, resonances, geometric scattering, and\r\nnon-hermitian quantum mechanics. More precisely, the PI is interested in resonances, \r\nwhich are mathematical objects modeling states which have certain frequencies of \r\noscillations (or rest energies) and rates of decay, such as unstable molecules or \r\nclassical system responding to resonant forcing terms. Despite a long tradition and a \r\nlot of recent progress our understanding is still very limited. Current experimental\r\nand numerical advances provide new stimuli for our studies. Another interest of the PI is\r\nnon-hermitian quantum mechanics, which deals with systems in which energy is not conserved.\r\nThat is almost always present when we localize a part of a system and the global \r\nconservation of energy disapears. In a subtle way resonances already fall into this \r\ncategory of phenomena. The mathematical problems present here are the stability of \r\neigenvalues and measuring the size of the resolvent of non-self-adjoint operators. \r\nThat leads to the study of ``pseudospectra'' which is then related to \r\nmany interesting phenomena in PDEs. Finally, the PI's interest involves mathematical \r\nscattering. It replaces spectral theory for problems on non-compact domains, and in physics \r\nalmost all the data comes from scattering experiments. Many new things are constantly \r\ndiscovered now, ranging from scattering on locally symmetric spaces to problems\r\nrelated to conformal field theory.\r\n\r\nMany of the phenomena discussed in this proposal are in fact more general: for instance, \r\nelectromagnetic scattering can be used to model quantum scattering, and its understanding\r\ncan benefit from the development of the classical/quantum correspondence.\r\nThe PI's work focuses on the search for general mathematical principles,\r\nand the detailed study of specific examples is motivated by that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
