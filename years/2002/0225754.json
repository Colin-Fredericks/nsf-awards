 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to subsidize the travel and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the sixth SIGART/AAAI Doctoral Consortium, which will be held on July 28 and 29, 2002, in Edmonton, Canada. The consortium will be collocated with the Eighteenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (NCAI), which will be held from July 28 to August 1 in Edmonton. ACM/SIGART and AAAI together organized the first six Doctoral Consortia, which have also been collated with NCAI (except for last year, when the consortium was collocated with the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)). \r\n \r\nAt the consortium, Ph.D. students who are doing their dissertations on AI-related topics present their proposed research, and receive feedback from a panel of established researchers as well as from the other students.  This provides the students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work, at a critical time in their research, and also enables them to explore their career objectives. There will also be a panel on career options as part of the consortium. This workshop contributes to the professional development of young scientists who will lead this growing field in the coming decades.\r\n",
