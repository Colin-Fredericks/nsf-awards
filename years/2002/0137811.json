 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visualization in Technology Education (VisTE) is a standards-based initiative designed to promote the use of graphic visualization tools among students in grades 9-12.  By using simple and complex visualization tools, students can conduct research, analyze phenomena, solve problem and communicate major topics identified in the Standards for Technology Literacy (STL) as well as topics aligned with national science and mathematics standards.  VisTE has forged a national coalition of institutions and individuals committed to the development of these materials, including North Carolina State University, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, Research Triangle Institute, the Southern Regional Education Board, and the International Technology Education Association, among others.  Over three years, partnership members will create 12 modules reflecting the 20 STL standards and corresponding benchmarks.  Combined, the modules will form a discrete course in graphic visualization. However, each of the 12 modules could be used in existing technology education courses as a stand-alone activity.  Modules will be piloted in SREB \"High Schools that Work\" sites, selected to provide student diversity and to facilitate the collection of evaluation data.  VisTE's final products and outcomes will include 12 standards-based modules (in electronic and print formats) written for a diverse student audience; national dissemination of the materials through teacher training workshops, local and national presentations, and a web site; and a formal evaluation of the project's process and student outcomes.\r\n",
