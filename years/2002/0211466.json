The primary objective of this conference is to present, discuss, and to kindle new research approaches and directions at the interfaces between chemistry, toxicology, and environmental engineering. The conference is unique in the field of environmental engineering, due to its informal and intimate setting, cutting- edge science, interdisciplinary nature, and small number of participants. This particular Conference has been a forum for the consideration of critical or even controversial ideas that have frequently led to the development of new research agendas. In general, the Conference has a long record of stimulating advanced research in industrial laboratories, colleges and universities, research foundations, and government laboratories, and establishing linkages amongst these communities of scientists and engineers. The conference consists of nine formal sessions having 2-3 speakers each, with discussions in each session led by a leading scientist/engineer in the field. Speakers include established experts as well as promising younger investigators, and are from the United States, Canada, and Europe. Several poster sessions are also offered to maximize exchange and interactions among participants. At the last session of the conference, two exceptional posters are selected and the authors are invited to give short oral summaries. Graduate student attendance and participation in the poster sessions is strongly encouraged. The session topics include: Bioavailability and Reactivity, Reaction Mechanisms, Heterogeneous Particles, Arsenic and Selenium Cycling, Mercury Cycling, Frontiers in Biogeochemistry, PAH Exposure and Effects, Emerging Contaminants of Concern, and Environmental Modeling. ***",
