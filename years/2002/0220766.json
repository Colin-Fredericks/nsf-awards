 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project (MACSTECH Scholars: Mathematics and Computer Science Technology Scholarship Program) allows the Mathematics and Computer Sciences Programs to provide 28-45 scholarships each year for four years to financially needy, academically talented students. Both programs have been identified as \"economic development programs\" by the Board of Regents because of their strong technology emphasis and the critical need for graduates in these areas within the state of South Dakota. MACSTECH is designed to strengthen the current programs and to provide a foundation for future success.\r\n\r\nThe project contains a comprehensive management plan that incorporates student recruitment (particularly to develop a critical mass of students in the Mathematics major and to increase underrepresented populations and women in the programs), develops multiple mechanisms to improve student retention at various points in their degree studies, increases the number of highly qualified double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science, and provides an extensive student enrichment and support structure.\r\n\r\nA strong retention program involving continued support for successful scholars fosters the success of those individuals to degree completion. This is accomplished through advising, building group cohesion, and extensive use of student support services, tutoring, enrichment activities and the resources and activities of existing university programs.\r\n",
