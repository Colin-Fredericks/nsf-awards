 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Bruce Kohorn at Bowdoin College in order\r\nto purchase a confocal laser scanning microscope. The microscope will\r\nprovide the ability to obtain high resolution fluorescent images from both\r\nlive and fixed biological samples, and will become the only such instrument\r\nin Maine at a liberal arts undergraduate college. The microscope will be\r\nused to explore fundamental questions in neurobiology and behavior, plant\r\ndevelopment, nuclear protein transport, evolutionary genetics, and\r\nbiomechanics. Seven faculty and their students from the Biology and\r\nPsychology departments of Bowdoin  College, and two faculty from Bates and\r\nColby College will use the instrument to achieve high resolution images for\r\nbasic  biological research.\r\n\r\n The new instrument will be used by many faculty in their research on\r\ntopics that include the function of the nervous system, the organization of\r\ncells, and the comparison of cellular structures so as to understand basic\r\nprocesses of evolution.  The students in research labs will be exposed to\r\ncurrent and standard technologies that they too will need to use once in\r\nmore advanced degree programs. Students will be prepared for careers in\r\nBiology and related fields by providing the technical and theoretical\r\nbackground for one of the most common methods of imaging in cell and\r\nmolecular biology.\r\n",
