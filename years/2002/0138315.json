 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for an investigation of the normal subgroup\r\nstructure of groups of rational points of algebraic groups over\r\ngeneral as well as over special (primarily, global) fields. The\r\nprincipal investigator attempts to prove a new conjecture on\r\nsolvability of finite quotients of the groups of rational points of\r\nsimple algebraic groups over arbitrary infinite fields.\r\nHe also plans to analyze finite quotients of the multiplicative group\r\nof a finite dimensional division algebra in order to obtain their\r\nreasonable classification. Another central problem is investigation\r\nof the Margulis-Platonov conjecture for special unitary groups over\r\nglobal fields. The principal investigator collaborates on these problems\r\nwith Gopal Prasad, Yoav Segev and Gary Seitz. He also plans to work\r\nwith Gopal Prasad on a joint book project in the congruence subgroup\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nQuestions related to the normal subgroup structure of linear groups\r\nhave historical roots in the 19th century (Galois, Jordan, Dixon),\r\nand have been an area of active research in the 20th century. Recently,\r\nnew techniques for analyzing this problem for anisotropic groups\r\nover general fields have been discovered in the joint work of the\r\nprincipal investigator with Y.Segev and G.Seitz. These techniques enable\r\none to investigate groups over general fields using methods of the\r\ntheory of valuations, which were previously used only in the\r\nnumber-theoretic setting of global fields. This approach fits into\r\nthe general area of investigation of the congruence subgroup problem,\r\nwhich is connected with other fundamental problems in number theory,\r\ncurrently applied in data transmission, data processing and communication\r\nsystems.",
