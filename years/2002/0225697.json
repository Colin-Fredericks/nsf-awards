 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our objective is simple and straightforward - use novel porous SiC materials to develop an all- solid state fuel cell that it'll more than double the output power of Si based fuel cells while completely eliminating the problem of CO poisoning of expensive Pt electrodes! Currently available proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC5) suffer from three major limitations connected to cell design and materials used. First, most PEFC designs require elaborate manifold design and hydrodynamic control schemes which include humidification modules and rotating components such as pumps and compressors. The second major limitation comes from the Pt anode electro catalysts, which are extremely CO intolerant down to the 5 to 10 ppm level. Thirdly, poor thermal dissipation from the exothermic process limits membrane lifetimes and power density output. Our objective is to make use of rapid advances in novel SiC nanoporous materials to completely eliminate the need for platinum and low-temperature polymer membranes. Preliminary results from catalytic reactor studies show that SiC has a high degree of catalytic activity and. due to its wide band gap, high output fuel cells operating at higher thermal budget efficiencies will be possible. The objective of this work is to demonstrate such a fuel cell that will revolutionize the portable power storage industry. Advantages/advances over conventional PE FC s are summarized below:\r\n\r\no\tCompletely passive operation designed run on dry, low pressure, solid-source hydrogen and atmospheric pressure air without the need for humidification modules. Elimination of compressed gaseous hydrogen fuel and negative public perception (e.g.. hydrogen bomb, Hindenburg, etc.).\r\n\r\no\tElimination of hydrodynamic auxiliaries such as pumps, compressors, fans or blowers resulting in completely quiet operation. Increased power, efficiency and reliability by eliminating the parasitic power required to run auxiliaries and absence of moving mechanical parts.\r\n\r\no\tElimination of the costly Pt electrode and CO poisoning problems.\r\n\r\no\tSolid-state microfabrication, thin-film deposition, and micromachining approaches\r\nprovide a manufacturable modular, self-contained unit.\r\n\r\no\tGreatly improved fuel cell stack size and weight, fuel storage and delivery, packaging,\r\nrobustness and thermal management due to microfabrication and material properties of\r\nSIC.\r\n\r\no\tSignificantly improved thermal budget efficiencies due to the high thermal\r\nconductivity of SiC, which is higher than that of copper at room-temperature, 430 verses 540 W/mK respectively.\r\n\r\nRapid development of this technology is critical.  Therefore a seed grant to get these novel ideas from the concept stage to the demonstration stage is needed. Traditional proposals to expand this research at the University of South Florida are planned. However the graduate students who are already working on this project were being funded on a grant that has just ended. Therefore immediate funding is required to cover this research if progress is to continue.\r\n",
