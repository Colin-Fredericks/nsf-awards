The primary goal of the conference is to bring together investigators from diverse disciplines studying a wide variety of materials systems to share their approaches and progress in unraveling basic mechanisms and applications that arise from laser/material interactions. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this conference is to focus on current state-of-the-art and necessary future directions for the field where interactions between all participants is facilitated by several key presentations by a leading scientist in the area. Topics of high current interest include applications to life sciences and medicine; laser processing applicable to nanotechnology, optoelectronics, and future electronics systems; and applications of ultrafast lasers. The program will emphasize participation of a diverse group of participants, including women, minorities, and young investigators\r\n",
