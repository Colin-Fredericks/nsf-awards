 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test a novel method for\r\nVacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) measurements for process control\r\nand monitoring in semiconductor lithography applications. It builds on the demonstrated\r\nsuccess of employing planar grating diffraction to achieve SE measurements in the visible\r\nwavelengths. For SE measurements in the VUV, it is necessary to employ conical\r\ndiffraction geometries which do not require sheet-type polarizing elements in the\r\ndetection system. This permits the construction of a Conical Diffraction- Grating\r\nDivision of Amplitude Photopolarimeter (CD-GDOAP) that is the analyzer/detection system in\r\nthe VUV-SE. By intercepting four or more dispersed orders of the cone of diffraction, a\r\nCD-GDOAP can measure the polarization state of light over the full spectrum in the VUV\r\nwith no moving parts. The VUV-SE will: (i) operate in the 140-280 nm spectral range, (ii)\r\nhave no moving parts, and (iii) provide high temporal resolution. In Phase I, we propose\r\nto characterize the performance of a laboratory breadboard CD-GDOAP by investigating (i)\r\nconical diffraction geometries, (ii) robustness of polarization detection, and (iii)\r\nperformance of optical components in the VUV. If successful, it will lead to a compact,\r\nhigh-speed VUV-SE for use in semiconductor processing.\r\nPotential Commercial Applications of the Research\r\nThe proposed SE based on CD-GDOAP will permit real-time measurements for VUV lithography\r\napplications at 157, 193, and 248 nm in a single instrument. Presently there are no\r\ncommercially available instruments (used in production facilities) that can access all of\r\nthese wavelengths. Successful completion of this project will ensure rapid entry into the\r\nmarketplace, through the business relationship that CRI is developing with major\r\nsemiconductor metrology equipment companies.",
