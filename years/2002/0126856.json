 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Engineering Technology (58)\r\nThe Learning Factory concept was first developed as part of the TRP/NSF funded Manufacturing Engineering Education Partnership (MEEP). The objective of the Learning Factory (LF) is to integrate a practice-based engineering curriculum that balances analytical and theoretical knowledge with physical facilities for product realization in an industrial-like setting. The LF model, which emphasizes practical experience, moves Engineering programs closer to the Engineering Technology (ET) model; which by design is oriented to practical applications. Consequently, ET programs are well suited to implementing the LF. This project's goal is the adaptation of the LF model for implementation in ET programs. Under this project, five carefully selected courses in the current programs are being modified. This will lead to the use of coordinated projects across those courses. The specific coordinated projects focus on the design and building of functional model engines. In the various courses, students generate CAD drawings of all the engine 1components, produce process plans for the engine components, fabricate the engine components and assembling and testing the engines. This education process provides the students with a good understanding of engines. That is, the students gain the exposure to the full range of issues involved in the product design phase, in the manufacturing planning phase, in the fabrication phase, in the assembly phase and in the testing phase. Since the implementation component of the project is modifying of existing courses rather than developing new ones, it is highly likely that the results of the project will be widely accepted by the ET community. The results will be disseminated through conferences and journal publications geared to the Engineering and Engineering Technology community. There will also be particular outreach to area community colleges to encourage coordinated implementation of the LF concept.\r\n",
