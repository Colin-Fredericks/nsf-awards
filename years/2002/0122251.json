The techniques used will combine classical nondestructive methods, semi-destructive methods, statistical data analysis and simulation, and laboratory verification.  The planned semi-destructive methods measure mechanical and physical properties and involve removing micro- wood specimens using a core drill and evaluating compression strength to measure the modulus of elasticity.   The nondestructive methods employ stress wave timing, resistance drilling and digital radioscopy.  The team's overall goal is to systematically derive a comprehensive assessment technology for historic buildings that can contribute to our knowledge of asset management for wooden structures.\r\n\r\nThis engineering project concerning infrastructural materials and structural mechanics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
