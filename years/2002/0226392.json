The specific objectives of the workshop will be to produce a standard set of parameters and a set of model \"experiments\" to be performed by the all models. Representatives from the modeling groups are expected to perform the full suite of model runs, providing the specific set of output required by the standard protocol. The results will be subsequently compiled and evaluated to determine the sources of differences in model output. The results of the model runs will presented at a special session of the joint AGU-EGS-EUG meeting in April 2003. It is expected that a synthesis of this model intercomparison activity will lead to identification of a number of critical conceptual, experimental, and observational gaps, and the production of a \"Community Model,\" which can be used for future development and direct comparison with newly acquired observations. As these are brought to light, the research community can most effectively move forward to address these gaps in subsequent research within the experimental and observational, as well as modeling sectors.\r\n",
