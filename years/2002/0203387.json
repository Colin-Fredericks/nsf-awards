 "awd_abstract_narration": "0203387\r\nLin\r\n\r\nThis program will systematically develop a nonsmooth feedback design \r\nmethodology for the control of genuinely nonlinear systems that may not \r\nbe dealt with, even locally, by any smooth feedback. Nonsmooth feedback \r\ndesigns offer the potential to overcome some topological obstructions of \r\nthe system that cannot be addressed by smooth controls, for example, to \r\nglobally stabilize a nonlinear system that is not stabilizable by any linear \r\nor smooth state feedback. The research will address some of the most \r\ncritical and challenging issues in the field of nonlinear control, including \r\nglobal strong stabilization, practical output tracking and adaptive control \r\nfor nonlinearly parameterized systems with uncontrollable unstable \r\nlinearization.  A unique thread in our development is the explicit \r\nconstruction of homogeneous-like Lyapunov functions and non-Lipschitz \r\ncontinuous controllers, based on a synthesis of methods drawn from \r\ndifferential geometric control theory, homogeneous systems theory, as \r\nwell as the development of feedback domination design techniques for the \r\ncontrol of nonlinear systems whose Jacobian linearization contains \r\nuncontrollable modes associated with eigenvalues on the right-half plane.   \r\nThis work will also include a geometric characterization and a higher-\r\norder normal form for a significant class of nonlinear systems.\r\n\r\nMany control systems of practical importance (e.g. internet network, \r\nmanufacturing systems, biomimetic actuator systems, electrically \r\nstimulated muscles, underwater or aerospace vehicles and so on) have \r\ngenuinely nonlinear characteristics that cannot be dealt with by existing \r\nfeedback design methods; most of them are smooth in nature. In fact, a \r\ngoal of active research has been to transform a physical dynamic system \r\ninto a linear one for which the well-developed modern control techniques \r\n(linear systems theory) are readily applicable. These \"linearizing\" \r\ntechniques have serious limitations due to canceling the system \r\nnonlinearity by feedback or neglecting the complexity of dynamic \r\nsystems. Consequently, these design methods have not found wide \r\napplications in a number of new real-world problems, such as control of \r\ncomplex network (e.g. internet or power systems network) or controlling \r\nthe position and speed in sophisticated weapons (e.g. missiles and \r\nadvanced combat aircraft). The purpose of this research is to find ways to \r\ntake advantage of the potentially dramatic, though nonintuitive, effects \r\ncaused by the inherent nonlinearity or complex interactions of physical \r\nforces with physical systems. The main outcome of the proposed research \r\nwill be new, nonsmooth feedback design methodologies for the control of \r\ndynamic systems. It is expected that the benefits to a systematic approach \r\ntowards using nonsmooth control will be becoming widely appreciated, \r\nparticularly in industries (e.g. manufacturing, aerospace, power and \r\nbiomedical engineering) where many applications of nonsmooth control \r\ncan be found.\r\n",
