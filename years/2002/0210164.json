 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop on \"Hybrid Systems:  Computation and Control\" was held at Stanford University, March 25-27, 2002. The importance of hybrid discrete and continuous control has emerged over the last several years, as hardware and software technology provide ever more applications, ranging from everyday life to mission-critical situations.  At the same time, the lack of a satisfactory, cost-effective design methodology for reliable and efficient hybrid controllers has become apparent.   This workshop, emphasizing issues in computation and control, was one in a series dedicated to developing a scientific community and a body of knowledge that synthesizes discrete and continuous technologies.  The purpose of the workshop series is to provide a regular, annual forum for novel results, methodologies, and tools in the emerging area of hybrid systems.   The proceedings of the workshop are published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.",
