 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns birational geometry of complex varieties \r\nand the study of rationally connected varieties.  The main \r\nobjective is to study spaces of rational curves on rationally \r\nconnected varieties, with the goal of constructing new birational \r\ninvariants of these varieties and determining the relationship \r\nbetween these varieties and unirational varieties.  The secondary \r\nobjective is to develop further some of the techniques and tools \r\nof algebraic geometry: to develop techniques for determining when \r\nmoduli stacks are rationally connected, to construct and study \r\nnew compactifications of the space of smooth rational curves in \r\nprojective space, and to refine the Behrend-Manin stratification \r\nof the Kontsevich moduli stack so that it detects mutliple covers.\r\n\r\nSystems of polynomial equations in some collection of variables \r\narise in every branch of mathematics, science and engineering.  \r\nDetermining the solutions of these systems of equations is of \r\nparamount importance. \"Unirational varieties\" precisely correspond \r\nto those systems of equations where the set of solutions is most \r\neasily described -- the set of solutions is the set of all outputs \r\nof some sequence of polynomials with arbitrary inputs.  So it is \r\nvery important to recognize which systems of equations correspond \r\nto unirational varieties.  From the point of view of geometry, a \r\nclosely related notion is \"rational connectedness\".  This notion \r\nis far simpler to recognize in practice.  Potentially both notions\r\nare equivalent.  If one could prove that both notions are\r\nequivalent, this would give a simpler way to recognize which \r\nsystems of equations correspond to unirational varieties.  The \r\ninvestigator intends to continue his research of this problem.\r\n",
