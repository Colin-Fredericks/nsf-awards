This project will perform a proof of concept study in designing and prototyping a  learning  environment  where  students  (a)  learn  to  effectively  use  information  technology  solve real world engineering problems, (b) develop their cognitive ability to structure schemas in industrial  engineering  knowledge  domains,  (c)  develop  their  metacognitive  ability  to  apply discipline-specific knowledge to solve engineering problems and monitor their problem solving strategies, and (d) fully appreciate the connection between isolated relevant course content. The key concept of this proposal is therefore a learning environment based on new and emerging information technology tools and concepts that will integrate isolated course content. In addition, this learning environment will reflect current thinking in learning theory. The environment will thus be learner-centered, knowledge-centered, and assessment-centered.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed approach to achieving the objectives is through a set of active learning modules in \r\nwhich students use domain knowledge, data, methods, and software tools to achieve a pre-defined \r\ngoal for a set of simulated industrial engineering scenarios. These scenarios will not only draw on \r\nthe  knowledge  base from  each  course  but  also  explicitly make  connections with material  from other courses.  For each scenario, students must independently define goals, formulate problems, and develop solution strategies while mastering the course material.  This environment is thus a fundamental  shift  from  an  emphasis  on  the  traditional  lecture  format  to  active  learning.    The modules are also an ideal tool to encourage cooperation with other students. \r\n\r\n",
