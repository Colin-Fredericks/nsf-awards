Project SMART recognizes that effective student education requires authentic, inquiry-based learning. By solving open-ended problems based upon real world examples, students will link the relevance of their education with their daily lives and appreciate\r\nthe intrinsic and tangible values of science and mathematics in modern society. The five goals of Project\r\nSMART include:\r\n\r\n\tImproving science and mathematics achievement of ALL students, consistent with our overarching\r\ngoal ioTo Leave No Child Behind.l_\r\n\tTraining secondary science and mathematics educators to incorporate authentic, inquiry-based\r\neducation into current secondary science and mathematics curricula.\r\n\tAttracting secondary school students to engineering; enhancing the perception of career opportunities in engineering; and improving students SMET related skills to become successful engineers.\r\n\tInstilling an awareness of the importance of learning science and mathematics skills in K-6\r\nadministrators, teachers, parents, and students.\r\n\tIncreasing the quantity and quality of gender and ethnic student diversity in SMET related courses.\r\n\r\nThe partners  form a unique alliance among engineering and education faculty of the University of\r\nCincinnati (UC), the Southwest Ohio section of High Schools That Work (HSTW), and the Greater\r\nCincinnati Tech. Prep. \r\n\r\nFor this planning proposal, we have presented our preliminary thoughts on the main elements envisioned\r\nfor Project SMART, including: 1) teacher professional development; 2) educational resources for\r\nteachers; 3) student programs: out of the classroom and into the world of science and mathematics; 4) pre-\r\nengineering program for high school students; and 5) evaluation, assessment and improvement. In\r\nparticular, we have proposed special programs specifically targeting traditionally underrepresented groups\r\nin SMET related fields including ethnic minorities and girls. In addition, we have presented our views on\r\nininstructional theorylu which will form the context for the planning and development of these elements.\r\nThe Project Committee believes that the implementation of Project SMART in the microcosm of\r\nCincinnati is transferable to other school districts struggling with similar education problems. During the\r\nlast century, Ohio lead the nation as a strong manufacturing state. Now, we must change our educational\r\nstyle to keep up with society's technological demands. Project SMART is envisioned to transform the\r\nlives of students it touches by tearing down barriers to high paying jobs and creating informed citizens.\r\n",
