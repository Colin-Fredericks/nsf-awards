 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been much recent work on scheduling techniques that\r\nensure fairness, temporal isolation, and timeliness among\r\napplications multiplexed on the same resource.  Many systems that\r\ncould benefit from the use of fair scheduling principles have\r\nworkloads that necessitate the use of multiple processors; consider,\r\nfor example, the proliferation of Internet service providers that\r\nhost third-party websites on multiprocessor servers.  Unfortunately,\r\nmost prior work on multiprocessor fair scheduling has been rooted\r\nin task models that are too rigid to apply in many settings.  The\r\nlittle research on more flexible models that has been done has been\r\nalmost entirely experimental in nature, with little or no formal\r\nanalysis of the scheduling algorithms being tested.\r\n\r\nIn this project, fair scheduling algorithms based on rate-based\r\nscheduling principles will be developed and analyzed, both formally\r\nand experimentally.  Specific project objectives include the\r\ndevelopment of (i) fair scheduling algorithms that minimize task\r\nmigrations; (ii) extensions to these algorithms that allow tasks to\r\nsynchronize and share resources; (iii) extensions that allow real-time\r\nand non-real-time applications to execute under a common framework;\r\nand (iv) techniques for managing dynamically-changing workloads in\r\nwhich tasks may join and leave the system.\r\n",
