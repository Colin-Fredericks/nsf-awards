 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to implement a\r\nconversational intelligent environment\r\ncontaining a distributed array of active cameras and other sensors,\r\nand communicating with users via natural dialogue, augmented where useful\r\nwith imagery and pointing devices.\r\nThis artificial spatial intelligence, termed a\r\nVoluble Intelligent Environment or VIE, will actively obtain information about,\r\nand provide assistance within a real physical domain.\r\n\r\nThe project requires grounding natural language understanding in\r\nmachine perception.\r\nA major difficulty is that outputs supplied by\r\ncurrent perceptual algorithms are too low-level\r\nto serve as primitives for traditional understanding and reasoning systems.\r\nTo address this, the PIs will integrate the results of machine vision\r\nand  other perceptual functions into mid-level representations termed\r\n\"perscripts\", which represent items of perceptual information of the sort that\r\nwould typically be described by a phrase or simple sentence.\r\n\r\nThe project also requires advances in\r\ndistributed systems technology to permit the\r\nvarious perceptual, computational, and communication components to\r\nbe efficiently and flexibly configured.\r\nThe integration framework will be based on\r\na prototype distributed resource interface, InterWeave,\r\ndeveloped at the University of Rochester.\r\nInterweave provides an efficient implementation\r\nof a network-wide global name/address space that directly supports\r\nthe proposed approach to grounding language in perception.\r\n\r\nThe work will be validated in\r\na ``Household Assistant'' application that provides occupants of a\r\n``smart house'' with information useful in activities of\r\ndaily living (such as ``where did I leave my glasses?'' or\r\n``did I take my meds?'').\r\nThis application is being developed in conjunction with the University\r\nof Rochester Center for Future Health.\r\nIt addresses needs of\r\nthe elderly and the disabled, and has the potential to have a significant\r\neconomic impact as part of an overall system that unloads caregivers for\r\nthis population.\r\n",
