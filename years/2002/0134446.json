 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is to develop mechanism-based multiscale modeling and simulation to understand dislocation behavior in strained heteroepitaxial layer structures, which has been of central interest in developing high-speed microelectronics in the semiconductor industry. Discrete dislocation nucleation, motion, and interaction will be studied by incorporating atomistic information into a variational boundary integral method in the Peierls-Nabarro framework. Critical conditions for dislocation nucleation from the perfect surface and surface heterogeneities such as ledges, defects, microcracks, and quantum dots will be determined by solving the embryonic saddle-point dislocation configurations and their associated thermal activation energies. Short-range dislocation interactions and the effect of lattice resistance to dislocation motion will be evaluated as well. Collective behavior of dislocations will be investigated by incorporating the obtained mechanisms of dislocation nucleation, interaction, and motion into a finite element enhanced dislocation dynamics simulation, which has been developed in collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The emphasis will be placed on fundamental mechanisms of threading dislocation density reduction and dislocation pattern formation in strained heteroexpitaxial layer structures.\r\n\r\nThe proposed education plan consists of the development of the new laboratory and curriculum that emphasize mechanics and materials at the small scale and interdisciplinary education at UC Riverside. Extra efforts will be made to enhance undergraduate students' interest in science and engineering. The objective is to develop a first-rate new mechanics and materials education program that meets the future demands of nanoscale science and engineering. The proposed education and research plans are integrated to reinforce each other.\r\n\r\n",
