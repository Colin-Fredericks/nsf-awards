 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Phillip Danielson at the University of Denver to fund the purchase of a Transgenomic   Nucleic Acid Fragment Analysis System. Based on established DNA size separation and mutation detection technology, this system will increase the quality and cost effectiveness of undergraduate/graduate research and\r\neducation in molecular biology. Specific research programs that will benefit immediately include National Science Foundation-funded studies to identify novel genes that encode: (1) endocrine hormones in the brain; (2) cytochrome P450 toxin-metabolizing enzymes - which are critical to the control of crop pests and disease-carrying organisms; 3) microbial proteins that can be used to clean up of toxic waste sites contaminated with heavy metals and 4) molecular markers that can be used to identify and track genetic diversity in endangered species - work is conducted in collaboration with the Denver Zoological Gardens and Denver Museum of Science and Nature. \r\n\r\nUntil recently, the identification of mutations required the laborious screening of hundreds to thousands of genes for subtle variations in DNA sequence. Analysis of a single novel gene by the direct sequence approach currently used, can require a day or more to complete. The Transgenomic WAVE System funded by this grant will reduce the analysis time to 2-4 minutes/sample. The discovery and analysis of genes that encode proteins involved in toxin breakdown, as well as neuropeptides linked to stress is the focus of several research programs. Since these genes often exist as duplicates with subtle but critical differences, it is essential that both copies be isolated. The WAVE  system will be used to reduce the potential number of competing non-target gene fragments by precise size fractionation of the initial pool of DNA used for gene amplification reactions. The instrument's mutation detection and fragment capture functions will be used to increase the efficiency with which these related genes are identified and recovered - even where two genes sequences differ by less than 0.5%. In research focused on conservation biology and microbial ecology, the WAVE  system will provide an extremely sensitive approach to the analysis of DNA sequence differences among and within species. Finally, the WAVE's high-speed genotyping capabilities will be used to gather gene frequency data from hundreds of samples for large-scale, multi-state conservation genetic projects. \r\n\r\nBeyond the benefit to the research activities at the University of Denver, a broad range of\r\nlaboratory and classroom-oriented educational goals will be advanced at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Benefits will be particularly evident in the molecular-oriented laboratory courses that are at the heart of the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees in Molecular Biology. On a broader level, department-sponsored biotechnology classes offered to high school students and teacher-training workshops that promote hands-on science education at the secondary school level will also be greatly enhanced by providing first-hand experience in one of the most modern methods of genetic analysis. The benefit to high school outreach efforts will immeasurable given that these programs target students in urban and low-income school districts who have traditionally been underrepresented in the natural sciences. In short, acquisition of the\r\nWAVE Nucleic Acid Fragment Analysis System will provide significant and immediate\r\nbenefits to education at the high school, undergraduate and graduate levels.\r\n",
