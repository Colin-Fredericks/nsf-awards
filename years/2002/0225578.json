Gilbert Clark\r\n\r\nDescription:  This award supports a US-India cooperative research project entitled Spin and Charge Dynamics in Conducting Polymers by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Studies.  US PI W. Gilbert Clark, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) will collaborate with Reghu Menon and two other researchers from the premier Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.  The objective is to investigate the dynamics of charge carriers in electrically conducting polymers by NMR measurements.  They will carry out related electrical transport and electron spin resonance studies and synthesis of the appropriate samples.  This research will address many key questions on the mechanisms for electron transport in conducting polymers that are of current interest such as the length scale of disorder and nature of the metal-insulator transition.  The ultimate research goal is to increase understanding of the mechanisms for electron transport in these materials.  \r\n\r\nScope:  Professor Clark is a well-known expert in applying the NMR technique to study properties of conducting molecular crystals and solids.  He has extensive experience with NMR, electrical transport, and measurements at ultra-low temperatures and high magnetic fields.  His Indian collaborators, who have complimentary expertise, will carry out sample synthesis and well-defined transport measurements at the IISc, Bangalore.  The PIs will use UCLA facilities, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in  Tallahassee, and the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratories in France.  This collaboration takes advantage of a synergy between Clark and Menon first established during Menon's tenure at UCLA as a post doc.  This project will provide an international experience for a UCLA postdoc and graduate student, and will enhance collaboration between UCLA and the IISc.  This project is jointly supported by the Indian Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST program.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
