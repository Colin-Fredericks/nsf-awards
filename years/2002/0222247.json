 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will be a five-week summer school on the topic of spatio-temporal statistical analysis and its application to multi-platform, multi-sensor bio-optical oceanic data.  The summer school seeks to address some of the analysis challenges anticipated as the Integrated Ocean Observing System is established.  These are associated with the very diverse range of spatial and temporal sampling afforded by the different components of such a system and contemporaneous process experiments.  Statistical experts in spatial information engineering with experience in collaboration with ocean scientists will discuss some of the modern tools for statistical analysis of such data and associated challenges, while ocean scientists will introduce students to the data and the underlying science questions.  The primary focus will be on analysis of the distribution of phytoplankton, which is known to be a patchy and intermittent field, the interpretation of measurements of which are complicated by advection.  This should serve as a model for the study of statistical techniques that can then be applied to other environmental fields.  An interdisciplinary group of approximately 16 students will be recruited, half with background in mathematical sciences and half with ocean science backgrounds.  The goal is to introduce students to interdisciplinary research questions and provide stimulating ideas that they can subsequently apply in their dissertation research.",
