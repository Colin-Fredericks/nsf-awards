 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project is concerned with three classes \r\nof problems of algebraic combinatorics.   They are related to \r\nseveral aspects of Schubert calculus and its links with \r\nrepresentation theory, inverse boundary problems, algebraic \r\ngeometry, and physics.  The first part is devoted to the inverse\r\nboundary problem for certain class of networks.  This problem \r\nemerged in an attempt to explain, generalize, and simplify \r\nalgebraic and combinatorial constructions related to \r\nrepresentation theory of general linear groups and canonical \r\nbases.  It is directly linked to the study of total positivity on\r\nGrassmann manifolds.  The second part focuses on combinatorial \r\nand algebraic problems came up in quantum Schubert calculus, which \r\ndeals with quantum cohomology of complex flag manifolds and \r\ncorresponding Gromov-Witten invariants.  The third part is devoted \r\nto a new approach to smoothness of Schubert varieties.  The \r\ninvestigator and his colleague suggest how to extend the notion \r\nof pattern avoidance in a general context of root systems. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of the proposed research project is to investigate \r\nseveral problems that originally came from various areas, such as \r\ngeometry and physics, and all share a discrete nature.  The \r\ninvestigator suggests an approach to the problem of identification \r\nof networks by boundary measurements.  These networks present a \r\nsimple model for computer microchips.  The problem can be rephrased\r\nas follows: \"How to identify a microchip by external examination?\"  \r\nAnother problem is related to certain geometric invariants that play \r\na role in mathematical physics and algebraic geometry.  These \r\ninvariants are usually extremely hard to calculate.  The \r\ninvestigator and his colleagues suggest a new efficient technique \r\nfor computing invariants of this kind.   The last part concerns \r\nwith a new approach to the classical problem of smoothness.",
