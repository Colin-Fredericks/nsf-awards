 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a fundamental question of brain evolution:  how well conserved is the main brain circuit diagram across the vertebrates?  Specifically, this project aims to resolve contradicting predictions arising from two recent lines of research into a structure called the basal ganglia, which is important in initiating and learning complex behaviors.  One set of work, primarily on traditionally studied bird species such as pigeons and chickens, has shown close similarities between birds and mammals.  Another line of work, using the specific brain structures of songbirds, which learn their vocalizations, has found some key differences in how the basal ganglia circuits are organized.  Work proposed here will determine how portions of the chicken basal ganglia are wired, and how individual nerve cells in those structures work.  Emphasis will be on how similar or different the structure and function of these brain regions are between birds and mammals.  Data gathered through this sort of comparative research has two major beneficial effects:  they shed light on how brains have evolved; and they provide information on how different species have solved problems in similar or different ways.\r\n",
