 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator studies fundamental groups and absolute\r\nGalois groups of varieties, especially in finite characteristic.  In\r\nparticular, he investigates the fundamental groups of affine curves over\r\nan algebraically closed field of finite characteristic; the absolute\r\nGalois groups of function fields of curves over non-algebraically closed\r\nfields of finite characteristic; and the fundamental groups and absolute\r\nGalois groups of higher dimensional varieties over algebraically closed\r\nfields of arbitrary characteristic.  This study is in large part guided\r\nby possible generalizations of Abhyankar's Conjecture for curves, which\r\nthe Principal Investigator has proven.  A major goal is to determine the\r\nproperties of the fundamental groups and absolute Galois groups in\r\nquestion, and to determine which finite groups are quotients of these\r\nprofinite groups, in order to obtain greater insight into the algebra\r\nand geometry of these spaces.  Methods include formal patching,\r\nembedding problems, cohomology, valuation theory, and group theory.\r\n\r\nThe area of this project relates aspects of algebra and geometry in a\r\nway that makes it possible to solve problems that would be intractible\r\nin either field alone.  The linkage between the algebra and geometry\r\narises from geometric spaces that are defined by algebraic equations. \r\nThese spaces can have complicated patterns of symmetry, which manifest\r\nthemselves both in the algebra and the geometry.  This project seeks to\r\nunderstand what types of symmetries can occur in the context of these\r\nspaces, and how spaces with one type of symmetry can relate to a given\r\nspace with another type of symmetry.  These spaces are in many cases\r\ndefined with respect to an algebraic system in which a particular prime\r\nnumber plays a special role; and the properties of those spaces can be\r\ninterpreted as giving information about the solvability of equations\r\ninvolving prime numbers.\r\n",
