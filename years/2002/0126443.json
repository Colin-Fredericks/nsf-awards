 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nThis project outlines the needs, equipment and implementation plans to integrate digital imaging technology into the Cell and Molecular Biology (CMB) curriculum at SMSU. This technology is currently used in biomedical and biotechnology fields. Adapting this technology to teaching laboratories is expected to enhance student learning and job opportunities available to SMSU students. This instrumentation is to be retrofitted on an existing shared microscope, an Olympus BX60, used for undergraduate courses and research. The technology enhancement of this microscope 1) provides for collection and analysis of data in laboratory courses and student research to allow use of learned computer skills to develop knowledge in the scientific process of data analysis; and 2) provides for faculty opportunities to become current with skills in digital imaging technology to allow for integration into the undergraduate laboratory curriculum and research projects. This experience benefits all CMB majors, those interested in basic science and in allied medical careers, by providing the opportunity to obtain the skills and knowledge base in digital imaging techniques required to be competitive for jobs and positions within the growing biomedical field. This request for instrumentation updates and enhances the capabilities of existing equipment in use within the program, and enhances the career opportunities for the mostly rural and female students in the CMB program at SMSU.",
