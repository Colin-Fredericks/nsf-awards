 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to design and analyze discrete algorithms\r\napproximating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.Because\r\nmany of these problems are NP-hard,an exact solution is often not feasible;\r\nin such cases approximation algorithms are a viable alternative.In addition\r\nto attacking approximation problems that seem to require new strategies,\r\nanother main goal is to investigate the applicability of design principles de-\r\nveloped successfully for traditional discrete optimization problems to com-\r\nparable tasks occurring in other areas.In any ase,a rigorous performance\r\nanalysis is always intended.\r\nA .rst focus is the #P-complete permanent problem,which is of much\r\nimportance in statistical physics and combinatorics.Rough approximations\r\n(up to an exponential factor)can be obtained in deterministic polynomial\r\ntime and possibly even mu h faster on a parallel machine.Such a solution\r\nwould allow to solve the outstanding bipartite matching problem of parallel\r\ncomputing.Even though the matching problem is easy for a sequential\r\nmachine,it is very hallenging to coordinate the many processors of a parallel\r\nmachine to worksimultaneously and e .ciently on the same matching.It is\r\nalso proposed to attackthe parallel matching problem with a novel version\r\nof more traditional network .ow methods.\r\nAnother theme of this proposal is the approximation of NP-hard opti-\r\nmization problems by traditional methods like lo al search,the comparison\r\nmethod,semide .nite optimization,or some combination of these.It is even\r\nproposed to investigate the approximation of some problems in P,as this\r\ncould have interesting applications in parallel computing.",
