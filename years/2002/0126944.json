The computers, software, and physiology peripherals to be acquired are allowing the inclusion of experiments in which the students generate and analyze data. Performance is being assessed by laboratory reports, oral quizzes and lecture exams. Exam and quiz results from previous classes are available for comparing achievement. Written lab reports are being used to assess student comprehension, and analytical and collaborative skills. The effort builds upon and is adapted from experience gained at a workshop sponsored by the American Physiological Society on teaching investigative laboratories in physiology.",
