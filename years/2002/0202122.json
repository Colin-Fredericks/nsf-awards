New ideas and stimuli came up a couple of years ago when \r\nit was found that they are the mathematical framework for the new proposal \r\nADS/CFT correspondence in string theory. Therefore the study of conformally \r\ncompact Einstein manifolds has even become important for physics. The author \r\nhas done work on the geometry of such manifolds, but there remain many problems \r\nto be studied. In the future the author hopes to tackle the problem of existence.\r\nIf the conformal infinity has enough symmetry one hopes to find explicit\r\nsolutions. The global uniqueness is also a challenging problem and\r\nrequires new ideas. Many recent results have shown that there is a\r\nprofound relationship between the global geometry of ambient manifolds\r\nand the conformal geometry of the boundary. The author intends to further explore \r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal studies a class of geometric objects called conformally\r\ncompact Einstein manifolds. They are not only mathematically interesting,\r\nbut also important for physics because they serve as the framework for\r\na deep correspondence in string theory. The author will study various\r\ngeometric aspects of these manifolds as well as problems arising in\r\nphysics. The study of this special class of noncompact manifolds whose\r\ngeometry at infinity is well under control will also provide insights\r\nand ideas to study more general noncompact manifolds.\r\n",
