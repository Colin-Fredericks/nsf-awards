Unlike many\r\nprograms that offer only a brief research experience, this program will work\r\nwith students over a 2-4 year period and mentor them through to graduation\r\nwith a bachelor's degree. The PIs on this program have graduated more than\r\n25 Native Americans over the last 7 years, and most of these graduates have\r\ngone on to attend graduate school.\r\n\r\nThis award includes a supplement from the Central and Eastern Europe Program\r\n of NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering to fund student and mentor \r\ntravel to Siberia for research on indigenous knowledge as part of a collaboration\r\n with scientists and students at Gorno-Altaisk State University.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this program lies in recent discoveries that Indigenous\r\ncommunities represent stores of knowledge that both add to and compliment\r\nscientific knowledge obtained through the methods of the Western scientific\r\ntradition, e.g. indigenous knowledge 1) reveals connections between\r\necological communities that are studied separately and remain unlinked\r\nunder Western scientific paradigms, and 2) give insight into the role of\r\nhigh quality individuals within population dynamics that are obscured by\r\nWestern traditions of population level thinking. Students completing this\r\nprogram will be better prepared to conduct scientific research within the\r\ncontext of indigenous knowledge than any other group. Such approaches can\r\nsimultaneously increase scientific awareness without losing sight of\r\nspiritual dimensions of human experience. \r\n",
