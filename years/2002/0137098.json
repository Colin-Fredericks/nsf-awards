The former, an adaptive grid method for simultaneous, fully implicit solution of coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations arises from the modeling of complex 2-dimensional (2D) physical systems, such as those encountered in fluid flow, heat transfer, and combustion applications. The LRR method will be expanded to 3D, making it a viable tool for simulating real-world 3D systems, including solidification and combustion processes. The completed adaptive code on 3D thermofluids applications will be tested, quantifying its accuracy and efficiency by comparison with a structured-grid code. The latter, a new application for the LRR method, involves collaboration with WU, an expert in nucleation theory. His work will be embedded within the existing LRR-2D code and later with the 3D code. Because microscopic material properties such as strength and hardness depend strongly upon microscopic quantities (e.g., grain size distribution), the ultimate goal is a numerical model which will predict the grain size distribution in an aluminum alloy part of simple 3D geometry, under various processing conditions.\r\n\r\n",
