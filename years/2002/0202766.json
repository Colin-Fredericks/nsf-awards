 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thin film deposition processes are capable of nanometer and even\r\natomically precise fabrication of layered structures.  While the\r\ncapabilities of deposition are well developed to the point of routine\r\nuse by the optics and semiconductor devices manufacturers,  application\r\nof deposition methods to extreme precision patterning and lithographic\r\nfabrication has received, at best, limited consideration. \r\nThis degree of precision is especially needed in the fabrication of\r\nsub-wavelength diffractive optics. \r\n\r\nThis study is aimed at a preliminary evaluation of the potential of\r\nmultilayer stacks to be fabricated and processed into three dimensional\r\nmaster stampers for molding or casting  high aspect ratio, nanoscale\r\nfeatures in polymers.  The vertical dimension of the pattern is produced\r\nby cleaving the material, polishing the cleaved surface as required, and\r\nchemically etching back selected layers of one material type to produce\r\na bi-level topography.  Not only can stamps for one-dimensional\r\nbragg-type gratings be produced by deposition, but curved stamps (used\r\nto mold sub-wavelength lenses) can be produced by deposition onto curved\r\nsurfaces (e.g. optical fibers or anisotrpically etched silicon.)  Layers\r\nof from 5 to 200 nanometers will be deposited using and extending our\r\nrecent electroplating methods that are noted for increased mechanical\r\nstrength, reduced grain size and the potential for producing films on\r\nthe order of one nanometer roughness.\r\n \r\nOne of the most significant outcomes of this study would be the\r\nsuccessful demonstration of electrodeposition to fabricate precisely\r\ncontrolled layers as an alternative to the more traditional, but much\r\nmore expensive, physical deposition methods of sputtering and\r\nevaporation.",
