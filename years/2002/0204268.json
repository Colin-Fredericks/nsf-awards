 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns the question of whether some solutions of the equations of incompressible, inviscid fluid flow develop spontaneous singularities in finite time. The objective is to uncover the mathematical structure of possible blowup flows suggested by the PI previous investigations. Two projects are planned. The first will be to use advanced computational techniques to reveal the asymptotic behavior associated with collapse and blowup. Previous work indicates that there exists an inner Leray-type self-similar solution which exhibits a finite-time singularity, a regular  outer solution and a matching region of poloidal vorticity. The other project expands upon the observation that all candidate blowup flows found by all investigators have one or more discrete symmetries and can be associated with the finite number of point and space groups. All fluid field variables can be associated with irreducible representations. How the characteristics of the discrete point groups, such as degeneracy, commutivity, associated lattices and space groups effect flow solutions will be explored. \r\n\r\nThe equations that govern the motion of an incompressible fluid, such as water, are routinely used by engineers and scientists for design and research. The most fundamental question about these equations, however, has been open for more than 250 years and reflects directly on the validity of using these equations as a model of fluid flow: whether solutions remain smooth or blowup in finite time. Finding an answer to this question for frictionless flow is addressed in this work. It is a very challenging problem computationally and will be a severe test on modern numerical  techniques. Because of its importance, the related viscous problem has been selected as one of seven Clay Millennium prize problems regarded as the Hilbert problems for this century.  \r\n",
