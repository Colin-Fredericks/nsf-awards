 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the 1940s, the birth and development of modern computers suggested the notion that minds, or brains, are computers. This thesis combined the advent of computers with both the old idea that reasoning is a form of calculation (from Hobbes to formal logic) and the materialist doctrine that reasoning, and more generally cognition, is carried out by the brain. The view that the mind-brain is a computer, here called computationalism, is the topic of this dissertation research project. The project will trace different versions of computationalism from their historical root in the cybernetics movement to the many disciplines that incorporated it. It will complement recent scholarship in related areas by showing how early attempts at mathematical modeling of the brain, the development of new mathematical and modeling tools, and new hypotheses about memory mechanisms came together to form a novel conceptual and methodological framework for studying the functional organization of the mind-brain. The study will interest not only historians, but also those who work in the sciences of mind and brain and those who are interested in their foundations. This research includes both a philosophical and a historical component. The pioneers who developed computationalism and many of today's concepts--A. Turing, J. von Neumann, N. Wiener, and W. McCulloch--had clearer motivations for their views than their followers of today. Through understanding the reasoning of the pioneers--the roots of today's positions--within their historical context, and studying how that context has since changed, the investigators hope to shed light on today's views. In order to carry out the historical component of this project, they will rely on published material in history, philosophy, and science, as well as unpublished material. Funding for this project will support four trips to archives containing the unpublished papers of Turing,  McCulloch, Wiener, and von Neumann. Aside from its historical interest, clarifying the history of computationalism has several potential benefits.  In the philosophy of mind and brain sciences, this project would illuminate current discussions of computationalism by showing what historical role computationalism played and still plays in shaping research programs in different disciplines. In addition, in philosophy of mind, it may stimulate functionalist philosophers, many of whom rely on computationalism, to rethink some of their views. It may equip funding agencies to more efficiently distribute research funds. And, finally, it would affect science and technology education. Through the future\r\npublication of articles directed at the general public and the design of an undergraduate course on Computers, Minds, and Brains, the expertise developed in this project would contribute to the education of the general public about computers and their relationship with psychology and neuroscience.\r\n",
