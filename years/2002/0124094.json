 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2002 Keystone Symposium on \"Chromatin Structure and Activity\" will be held January 26-31, 2002, in Sante Fe, New Mexico.  The objective of this meeting is to provide a forum for graduate students, postdocs and leading chromatin researchers to interact and discuss the current status of the fiels.  Many exciting discoveries have revealed an intimate relation between chromatin structure and transcriptional activity.  Some transcriptional coregulators function to modulate chromatin structure.  Other coregulators catalyze reversible chemical modifications of chromatin that enhance or repress gene expression.  Beyond the basic chromatin filament, higher-order chromatin structures are involved in the regulation of enhancer activity and in global transcriptional repression.  In addition, new experimental approaches to the study of chromatin structure and function are being devised.  It is anticipated that current models will be refined and, in some instances, disputed.  In this manner, there will emerge new concepts and ideas on the molecular mechanisms by which chromatin functions in the cell. This project will provide funding for the participation of graduate students, postdocs, and new independent investigators that lack funding. Specific emphasis will be placed upon the financial support of individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups.",
