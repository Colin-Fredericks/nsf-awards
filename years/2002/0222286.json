 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear problems with multiple scales, heterogeneity, and\r\nuncertainty are pervasive in science and engineering.  In this\r\ncontext, analytical theories are limited by unrealistic modeling\r\nassumptions, and extensive large-scale physical experiments are\r\nimpractical.  Computational modeling and experimentation, the\r\n\"third methodology\" of science, has a critical role to play in\r\nconjunction with theory and physical experiments.  This project\r\ncombines the three methodologies to study multiphase flow in\r\nporous media, specifically the remediation of groundwater\r\ncontaminated by dense nonaqueous-phase liquids (DNAPLs).  Field\r\nscales are much too large for small-scale effects to be directly\r\nrepresentable in practical computations.  Multiphase flow in\r\nheterogeneous subsurface formations involves local phenomena at\r\nmaterial interfaces whose valid effective representation at\r\nlarger scales is not understood.  Uncertainty is central, because\r\nof the lack of complete or precise data, and because of the\r\nrandomness of small-scale properties and flows when viewed from a\r\nlarger scale.  The project develops a nonlinear upscaling\r\nmethodology based on a macro-scale stochastic theory of multiphase\r\nflow and transport that accounts for local phenomena at\r\nmicro-scale material interfaces.  The theory is applied\r\nnumerically, so that limiting theoretical assumptions are local\r\nin space and time.  The model is validated by multiple-scale\r\nheterogeneous laboratory experiments, using realistic chemicals\r\nand soil properties, that creates a \"physical Monte Carlo\"\r\ndatabase for comparison.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental restoration is important to society.  Remediation\r\nof contaminated groundwater often requires the study of the\r\nsimultaneous flow of multiple non-mixing fluids through porous\r\nsubsurface soils and rocks.  These aquifers consist of many\r\ndifferent materials and exhibit features such as layers and\r\nfaults on a multitude of scales, all of which affect the fluid\r\nflow.  In small-scale detail, these effects are uncertain in\r\npractical situations, because available data are insufficient\r\nto describe the subsurface precisely, and because these details\r\nare quite random from the standpoint of the larger field scale\r\nat which a hydrologist wants to analyze the appropriate strategy\r\nfor a remediation project.  This project develops a methodology\r\nthat enables a scientist to describe the aquifer at the field\r\nscale, so that strategies can be formulated and tested in the\r\nsetting where they will be applied.  This \"upscaling\" methodology\r\nbased on probabilistic concepts is an advance with wide\r\nimplications beyond environmental restoration itself, important as\r\nit is, because similar issues arise throughout science and\r\nengineering.  The project's combination of theory, computation,\r\nand physical experiments requires the close interdisciplinary\r\ncollaboration of a mathematician and a geoscientist.\r\n",
