 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sensors used to measure neural activities are currently based on direct attachment of the electrodes to the nerve or the nerve bundle.  Although this method has been very effective, there are serious limitations, most significant is the intrusive nature of the process.  For example, to use electrodes for simulation or as a sensor to detect signals in the brain, it is necessary to open the skull to attach the electrodes to the nerves.  It is highly desirable to develop a method that can be used with least intrusion in diagnostics and therapeutic activities of the brain.   The idea presented by the PI in this exploratory proposal is to measure the nervous activities by inserting electrodes in the blood capillaries adjacent to the nerve.  The hypothesis is that since the blood plasma and the extracellular fluid are in ionic and osmotic equilibrium, the nervous activity signals propagate into the adjacent capillaries and, therefore, can by detected with electrodes placed inside the capillaries.",
