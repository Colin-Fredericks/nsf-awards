 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project creates new technology and materials that emphasize data analysis in science education.  Data analysis makes scientific concepts and processes concrete and gives students another way - besides memorization or analytical understanding - to learn quantitative science, often bypassing the need for advanced symbolic mathematics.  This project will emphasize physics classes in high school and beyond, where labs are often cookbook demonstrations of phenomena and the data analysis mere verification.  The first phase of this research, with the help of new technology, provided evidence those students understanding and competence could be improved beyond their previous capabilities.  This project enhances that technology-Fathom Dynamic Statistics Software (KCP Technologies 2000) - to make it more useful in the science classroom, and it develops curriculum materials that use this software.  Specifically, the firm will produce complete manuscripts for two supplemental books in physics appropriate for the high-school, AP, or college introductory course: a lab manual and a book of problem sets.  In addition, Epistemological Engineering will begin to explore and prototype additional materials in physics, materials for other sciences, and staff development offerings.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will lead to significant enhancements to Fathom software and open the door to creating curriculum materials in science education using tools previously available only to math educators.  Epistemological Engineering proffers technology that will contribute to strengthening science education in this country by teaching students to thoughtfully approach the world with a zest for measurement and prediction.",
