 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to pursue a diverse set of projects related to\r\nSelmer groups, elliptic curves, modular forms, p-adic L-functions and\r\nIwasawa theory. Selmer groups have traditionally been an important tool\r\nfor studying the Mordell-Weil group of an elliptic curve over a number\r\nfield. They have also played an important role in proving special cases\r\nof the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture which provides a relationship\r\nbetween arithmetic properties of an elliptic curve E and the behavior of\r\nthe Hasse-Weil L-function for E.  In recent years it has become clear that\r\ncertain natural generalizations of the Selmer group should provide similar\r\nconjectural relationships to the behavior of much more general kinds of\r\nL-functions. Iwasawa theory provides a framework for studying these\r\nconjectures by allowing the L-functions to vary in families defined by\r\ncongruences modulo powers of a prime p. This leads to the notion of a\r\np-adic L-function and to the formulation of analogous conjectural\r\nrelationships relating the behavior of such p-adic L-functions to the\r\ncorresponding Selmer groups. The investigator, together with several\r\ncollaborators, intends to study this kind of conjectural relationship in\r\nsome new settings: (1) p-adic analogues of classical Artin L-functions,\r\n(2) families of L-functions associated to certain families of Galois\r\nrepresentations of varying dimension. In addition, the investigator\r\nintends to study relationships between Selmer groups associated to modular\r\nforms and ideal class groups of certain number fields and to study some\r\nunresolved questions about the derivatives of p-adic L-functions.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental questions in the theory of numbers is the study\r\nof solutions of an algebraic equation. The difficulty of this question\r\ndepends on the degree of the equation and the number of variables. It\r\nhas been understood since antiquity how to study this question when the\r\ndegree is one or two and the number of variables is also one or two.\r\nHowever, the question becomes much more subtle when one considers\r\nequations of degree three, even if the number of variables is just two.\r\nA fundamental conjecture concerning this kind of equation was formulated\r\nin the 1960s by Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer. Although considerable progress\r\nhas been made since then, the conjecture remains unresolved. Such equations\r\ndefine a class of curves known as \"elliptic curves.\" The study of their\r\nproperties has proved to be of importance in crytography - designing codes\r\nfor the secure transmission of information. Professor Greenberg intends to\r\ncontinue his study of \"Selmer groups\" which have been a traditional tool in\r\nunderstanding the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves and in studying\r\nthe conjecture of Birch and Swinnnerton-Dyer. The ultimate goal is to\r\nachieve a deeper understanding of the solutions to the algebraic equations\r\nthat define an elliptic curve, and to develop a more general point of view\r\nconcerning conjectures analogous to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
