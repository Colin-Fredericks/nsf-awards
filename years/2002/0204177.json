 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS - 0204177.  PI: Peter Petersen\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to investigate manifolds with integral curvature bounds as opposed \r\nto the usual pointwise curvature bounds. Many traditional results carry over, \r\nbut people do not have a complete picture of what can go wrong with the weaker \r\ncurvature assumptions. The second and main part of the proposal addresses the specific \r\nbut very hard question of which 3-sphere bundles over the 4-sphere have positive curvature. \r\nOnly one of these spaces, namely the 7-sphere, is know to have positive curvature. \r\nWe expect that several exotic spheres of this type have positive curvature and also that \r\nwe will get some interesting infinite families of manifolds in dimensions 6 and 7 out of\r\nthis project.\r\n\r\nThe PI is proposing to work on two separate projects. The first deals with gleaning \r\ninformation from objects where one has fuzzy rather than specific assumptions about \r\nhow they curve. The PI has already established some interesting results in this direction, \r\nbut much is still unknown. The second and more ambitious part is an investigation of \r\nhow round one can make twisted objects. Here one imagines a sphere as perfectly round and\r\n untwisted. There are no intuitive examples in the dimensions that can be visualized,\r\n but in dimension 7 there apear to be several objects which are not spheres but still \r\ncould be fairly round. A positive solution to this problem would solve one very prominent \r\nproblem and two lesser known problems.\r\n\r\n",
