 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal deals with the design and analysis of efficient algorithms for\r\nthe class of hybrid systems called (discrete-time) piecewise linear (PL)\r\nsystems. \r\n\r\nThe area of hybrid systems concerns issues of modeling, computation and\r\ncontrol for systems which combine discrete and continuous components.\r\nThe subclass of PL systems, which we investigate in this project,\r\nprovides one systematic approach\r\nto discrete-time hybrid systems, naturally blending switching mechanisms with\r\nclassical linear components.\r\nPL systems are of interest as controllers as well as identification models,\r\nand they can be thought of as arbitrary interconnections of finite automata\r\nand linear systems. \r\nTools from automata theory, logic and related areas of computer\r\nscience and finite mathematics are used in the study of PL systems, in\r\nconjunction with linear algebra techniques, all in the context of a ``PL\r\nalgebra'' formalism. In this project, we will study basic algorithmic\r\nand computational problems for these problems with applications to\r\nmodelling of biological systems.\r\n\r\nMore concretely, \r\nbasic questions for any class of systems are those of equivalence, and, in\r\nparticular, whether state spaces are equivalent under a change of variables.\r\nThis project will address various algorithmic and computational challenges\r\nrelated to this state-space equivalence and isomorphism problem for PL\r\nsystems, as well as questions of learnability and representability for such\r\nsystems. The project also suggests the use of PL models for differential gene\r\nexpression testing.\r\n",
