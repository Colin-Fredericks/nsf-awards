 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the geometry of algebraic \r\nvarieites. It builds on past experience which indicates that \r\nmuch can be learned about the geometry of a given algebraic \r\nvariety by studying its Chow group. The Chow group is obtained \r\nfrom the free abelian group on all subvarieties of a given variety \r\nby modding out by the relation of rational equivalence. For \r\nalgebraic curves the Chow group is a close relative of the \r\nJacobian. While the Chow group is known to have good functorial \r\nproperties, it is often very difficult to compute. Thus it is \r\ndifficult to gain access to the subtle and valuable information \r\nthat it frequently contains. This investigation focuses on three \r\ndifferent aspects of the problem of computing Chow groups. First \r\nthe torsion subgroup of the Chow group is being studied with an \r\nemphasis on the quotient by the subgroup generated by cycles \r\nalgebraically equivalent to zero. Secondly, the relationship\r\nbetween the Chow group and singular cohomology with rational \r\ncoefficients is being investigated. The Hodge Conjecture is an \r\nimportant concern here. The theory of Abelian varieties and \r\ntechniques from classical algebraic geometry will be brought to \r\nbear on this problem.  The third line of investigation involves \r\nthe relationship between the Chow group and singular cohomology \r\nwith integrer coefficients. An ancient guidepost here was the so \r\ncalled Integral Hodge Conjecture. It has turned out that the \r\nIntegral Hodge Conjecture is false in some instances. The extent \r\nof its failure is poorly understood, so the principal investigator \r\nand a PhD student are working to clarify this.\r\n\r\nTo a significant extent, the value of basic research in algebraic \r\ngeometry results from the tendency of mathematicians to reduce \r\nproblems in various other fields of mathematics to problems in \r\nalgebraic geometry. This tendency is due to the ultimate \r\nsimplicity of algebraic geometry, where remarkably effective \r\napproaches to certain geometric problems have been developed\r\nwith minimal reliance on infinite processes. While the initial \r\ntranslation of a problem from the physical world into mathematics \r\nfrequently involves limits, derivatives, integrals, and further \r\nnotions involving infinite processes which go well beyond ordinary \r\ncalculus, mathematicians have learned to search for hidden aspects \r\nof these problems which are essentially of an algebraic or finite \r\nnature.  Neither the task of translating real world phenomena into \r\nmathematical problems, the task of discovering a hidden algebraic\r\ncore in a problem formulated using infinite processes, nor the \r\ntask of solving this core problem using algebraic geometry is\r\noften easy. Nonetheless, this lengthy process has led to profound \r\ninsights.  For example, algebraic geometry and some of the \r\nalgebraic varieties studied by the principal investigator are of \r\ngreat interest to physicists in their current attempts to unify \r\nquantum mechanics with the theory of gravity.",
