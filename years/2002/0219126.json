 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foltz\r\n\r\nThere is a rapidly growing trend toward embedding wireless capability into a\r\nwide variety of information technology products; recently in the form of\r\nsingle chip transceivers, and in the future perhaps integrated on-chip with\r\nthe main product function.  These devices must have low power consumption to\r\nsatisfy battery conservation and thermal considerations.   Good receiver\r\nsensitivity and signal handling are also essential in a crowded radio\r\nfrequency (RF) spectrum; however, this requirement conflicts with low power\r\ncircuit design.  The PI proposes to develop low power CMOS circuits that improve\r\nthe trade-off between power consumption and RF performance.  \r\n\r\nCurrent CMOS low noise amplifiers (LNA) have noise figures as low as 0.8 dB,\r\ninput intercept points up to +18dBm, and power as low as 1.5 mW; however,\r\nthese specifications cannot be obtained simultaneously.  Likewise, CMOS\r\nmixers can meet demanding CDMA communications standards for linearity and\r\nnoise figure, but only at high power cost.\r\n\r\nTo address these problems the PI proposes a number of strategies for (a) reducing\r\npower consumption for a given level of performance, and (b) allowing a\r\ndynamic trade-off of power versus RF performance.  These strategies include:\r\n(1) reuse of amplifier stages at two different frequencies through reflex\r\narrangements, thus reducing the number of high performance, high current\r\nstages required in receivers,  (2) dynamically controlled positive feedback\r\nand bias in LNA stages, to allow power, signal handling, and noise figure to\r\nbe traded off based on signal strength and interference, and (3) integration\r\nof charge pumps into individual drain supplies, to optimize the voltage for\r\nRF-critical stages while allowing the non-critical portions of a CMOS chip\r\nto operate at low voltage.\r\n\r\nSuccessful implementation will lead to improved range and life for wireless\r\nsensors, more reliable communications under adverse interference conditions,\r\nand ultimately to wider application of information technology in industry\r\nand science.\r\n\r\n",
