 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1997, Louisiana State University began construction of GULFNET, a geodetic system\r\nconsisting of continually operating reference stations and episodic campaign targets.\r\nOriginally built to support high precision measurement of subsidence and lateral normal\r\nfault related strain, the system was also designed to support geodetic-quality\r\npositioning. This system currently consists of four continuously operating stations and 24\r\nepisodic campaign targets and is supported by contracts with the National Science\r\nFoundation (NSF-EAR 9725330) and the Louisiana Board of Regents. The continuously\r\noperating stations will soon become certified by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) as\r\nofficial parts of the Continuously Operating Reference System or CORS, that supports the\r\nNational Spatial Reference System (NSRS). Funds originating from US Army Corps of\r\nEngineers (New Orleans District) through this proposed contract will permit the expansion\r\nof GULFNET by adding three additional continuously operating sites and the infrastructure\r\nto continue operation of the network. This new part of the system will come on line in\r\nearly 2002 and will provide near complete coverage of the Louisiana coast.\r\n",
