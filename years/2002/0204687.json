The groups the PI is \r\ninterested in are lattices in Lie groups, groups generated \r\nby finite automata, random and hyperbolic groups in\r\nthe sense of Gromov, groups acting on buildings. \r\nThe PI found recently new examples of groups with \r\nproperty (T) and the PI intends to continue the study \r\nof groups with this property.  In particular, the PI would \r\nlike to find other groups with property (T) and continue \r\nthe study of automata groups. During this study the PI \r\nplans to investigate properties of these groups related \r\nto amenability, torsion, growth and the following famous \r\nconjectures:  the Atiyah conjecture about L2  Betti numbers, \r\nthe Baum-Connes conjecture, and the Kaplansky-Kadison conjecture \r\nabout the idempotents. The PI proposes also to continue \r\nthe study of spectral properties of random walks operators\r\nand more generally the Hecke operators for groups generated \r\nby finite automata and buildings.\r\n\r\nProperty (T) is a quite abstract property of some groups,\r\nbut which found applications in constructions of computer and communication networks. The PI proposes to find new groups\r\nwith this property which would have applications to several \r\nproblems related to efficiency of certain algorithms.  The \r\nother project concerning automata groups combines the \r\nproblems from the abstract group theory and applications \r\nin computer science. The PI plans to give several mini-courses \r\nfor graduate students based on this research.\r\n",
