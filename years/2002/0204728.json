The first area\r\nputs emphasis on the determining the internal structure of\r\nextender models, fine structure theory and infinitary\r\ncombinatorics. The PI has done extensive research here, making\r\nsubstantial contributions to the existing results. Extender\r\nmodels are generalizations of Goedel's constructible universe\r\nwhich admit a very complex structure of large cardinal\r\naxioms. The key element behind the inner model theory is\r\niterability -- a method which enables us to iterate countable\r\nstructures that are elementarily embeddable into initial segments\r\nof these models. Granting iterability, the author and his\r\ncollaborators were able to develop a fine structure theory of\r\nthese models, which is a means enabling to investigate the\r\ninternal structure and combinatorics (Jensen's principles) of\r\nthese models abstractly, without any direct reference to\r\niterability. The aim of this project is to extend the existing\r\nmethods in a manner that would yield the complete description of\r\ncombinatorial properties of extender models. The open problems\r\nare related mainly to cardinal transfer theorems and stationary\r\nreflection. This part of the project includes also direct\r\napplications of the inner model theory in determining the\r\nconsistency strength of various principles from infinitary\r\ncombinatorics. The focus here is on improving the PI's results on\r\nJensen's guessing principle. The second part of the project\r\nconsists of two areas that are less tightly related to the PI's\r\npast research, namely the construction of inner models,\r\niterability and applications in the descriptive set theory.\r\n\r\nThe subject of set theory is the analysis of methods which arise\r\nin mathematics. The methods that are widely accepted by the\r\nmathematical world have been formalized into so-called\r\nZermelo-Fraenkel system of axioms (briefly ZFC). However, it\r\nturns out that we more and more often encouter questions whose\r\nsolutions require more than mere ZFC. Set theory provides us with\r\ntools for recognizing such problems and approaches which enable\r\nus to determine which methods to use. More precisely, set theory\r\nprovides us with a general method for determining the complexity\r\nof various problems quantitatively. The scale used here is the\r\nhierarchy of the large cardinal axioms. Extender models play a\r\ncrucial role here -- there are the actual technical means which\r\nenables us to establish the connection between various concrete\r\nproblems from mathematics and large cardinal axioms.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research focuses on various aspects of the inner\r\nmodel theory and can be divided into two areas.
