 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nWith the purchase of a Varian Saturn gas-chromatograph mass-spectrometer (GC/MS) equipped with electron ionization (EI) and chemical ionization (CI) capabilities, we are adapting and implementing GC/MS-based laboratory experiments into four courses, Organic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Instrumental Methods of Analysis, and Environmental Chemistry at Philadelphia University. In addition, we are developing disciplinary and interdisciplinary guided-inquiry projects for the four courses. The GC/MS system is used as the catalyst in the development of these guided-inquiry projects. In these laboratory projects, students are given chemistry problems to solve as in an actual research setting. Solution to these problems requires the students to work as a team to formulate a response and use GC/MS and other instrumentation to solve the problems. The projects increase in complexity as students gain experience with the instrumentation. For example, in organic chemistry a two-component mixture is analyzed by GC/MS to gain insight into reaction mechanisms. Identification of the compounds in natural and manmade products with high vapor pressures and unique smells is explored in physical chemistry. And, in environmental chemistry, a GC/MS required project examining sediment contamination in the local Philadelphia area will soon be undertaken. The overcharging goal of our project is to enable our students acquire highly valued technical skills, develop critical thinking, and improve their communication and teamwork skills. Furthermore, with the knowledge and expertise gained working with modern research-grade instrumentation, our students would be well equipped for entering into chemistry-related industrial positions and/or highly competitive graduate programs. \r\n\r\n",
