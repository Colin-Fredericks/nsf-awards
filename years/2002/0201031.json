 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nActuators (motors) are a key element of mechanical design   Significant advancements have been made using smart materials, with piezoceramics delivering compact, high energy density actuators useful for vibration, shape, flow and noise control.  Unfortunately, current piezoceramic actuation technologies suffer from reliability problems limiting their use in practical applications.  The fabrication of monolithic functionally graded piezoceramic (MFGP) actuators promise to overcome the reliability issues associated with delamination and stress discontinuities commonly found in the current bonded-layered piezoceramic technologies.  Additionally, MFGP's graded in multiple directions could produce complex motions such as bending, twisting, warping, and dimpling from a solid, one-piece actuator.  The goal of this research is to investigate the capabilities of monolithic functionally graded piezoceramics to improve the reliability of piezoceramic actuators and to open the door to multi-dimensional distributed piezoceramic actuation technologies.  Specific objectives of this research effort are:\r\nDevelop analytical and finite element models that accurately predict the quasi-static actuation                          behavior and evaluate any performance penalties due to grading.\r\nExperimentally characterize the variation in graded material properties through monolithic                          functionally graded piezoceramics and extend the current one-dimensional doping process to                             multi-dimensions.\r\nInvestigate the reliability of monolithic functionally graded piezoceramics with respect to the                 current state of art of piezoceramic benders. This research will begin to lay the fundamental science (models, manufacturing processes, experimental data) for monolithic functionally graded piezoelectrics enabling us to tap into the potential of piezoceramics for reliable high performance and multi-dimensionally graded actuators for complex motion in practical applications.  \r\n",
