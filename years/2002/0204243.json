 "awd_abstract_narration": "New classes of materials are processed as liquid mixtures of \"designer\" macromolecules either in  viscous solvents or in flexible polymer solutions.  These  macromolecules range from small \r\n molecular weight, rod-like liquid crystals to  nano-clay platelets,  targeting a diverse family of high-performance materials and devices.  The molecules are well  approximated as  \r\n ellipsoids,  precisely falling  within  the class of   macromolecular  fluids accessible \r\n by emerging theory,  computation,   and   experiment.  Furthermore,  rigid-unit, \r\nmonodisperse molecules suspended in viscous solvent are fundamental  model systems. \r\n Mathematically, they represent the leading edge of theory; physically, they are the \r\nfoundation from which many micro-fluidic systems can now be ideally modeled, and \r\neventually understood.      Conductivity or barrier  properties, while  governing \r\nmaterial  end-use, are passive during processing.  Rather, the fundamental issue for\r\n design and control is the emergence  of  structures during   processing at length \r\nscales (up to microns) far removed from individual molecules, called\r\n mesostructures, which empirically  dominate ultimate performance features. \r\n Examples include sequestered island arrays of liquid crystals and distinguished \r\n patterns that arise in rod-like and disc-like  nano-composites.  The onset, \r\ndevelopment, and saturation of mesostructures in prototypical flows of rigid-unit \r\nmacromolecular fluids is the primary focus of the workl.  The work identifies \r\nopen mathematical, numerical, and experimental issues, and constructs collective \r\nstrategies toward their resolution, combining experimental, theoretical and computational\r\n expertise.  \r\n\r\nNew class of materials are processed as liquid mixtures of \"designer macromolecules\"\r\neither in viscous solvents or in polymer melts and solutions, in which the designer\r\nmacromolecules are of simple geometry in a few to several hundred nanometers (1 nanometer is\r\nequal to 1 billionth of 1 meter). The material properties are dominated by the emergence of the mesostructure at the micron level (1 micron is 1 millionth of 1 meter) during the material processing. \r\nThe PI, teamed up with a group of leading experimentalists in the field of complex\r\nfluids, identifies the open mathematical, numerical and experimental issues and constructs\r\ncollective strategies toward their resolution combining experimental, theoretical and computational\r\nexpertise.",
