 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a CAREER award that combines research and educational activities.  The research topic is strongly correlated electron systems.  The research component adopts a strategy of considering particular systems with a goal of developing general tools for studying the role of interactions in fermionic and bosonic systems, and bringing out a common framework for understanding the physics of strongly correlated states of matter.  Intrplay of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the high Tc cuprates will be investigated to understand electron systems with competing instabilities.  Stripes in the quantum Hall systems at integer filling factors will be studied as an example of electron systems with phase separation on mesoscopic scale.  The relation between bosonic and fermionic mechanisms of suppression of superconductivity and the role of dissipation on the superconductor to insulator transition will be considered in the case of one-dimensional systems (wires and chains of Josephson junctions) as a typical example of quantum phase transitions.  Spinor bosonic atoms in optical lattices will be studied to learn about the role of interactions in bosonic systems.  Investigation of fundamental and universal properties will be complemented by concrete calculations of observable quantities that can be verified in experiments. \r\n\r\nThe educational component involves developing an undergraduate course that presents condensed matter physics from the point of view of relevance to practical applications.  By discussing recent developments in technology the course will motivate students to learn about progress in condensed matter physics and show the science in its dynamics: from basic research to industrial innovations.  The course will use examples of modern microelectronics, semiconductor optics, magnetoelectronics and others to show how discoveries in condensed matter physics initiated major transformations in industry in the past.  It will also address areas of current academic research that may play a crucial role in technologies of the future, for example, nanotechnology, and quantum computations and communications.  Presentations will be accessible to an audience with only a superficial knowledge of quantum physics.  \r\n \r\nThis is a CAREER award that combines research and educational activities.
