Narasimha\r\nCantrell, Pierce E.; \r\nShi, Weiping\r\nTexas A & M University (TX Engineering Experimental Station) \r\n\r\nTitle:  CISE RR: Secure Networked Storage Systems\r\nThis proposal, building an experimental testbed for research on high performance networked storage systems and the resulting issues in network resources management, builds system level software support for secure networked storage systems possible through iSCSI type of storage devices that directly attach to IP networks. Test applications comprise multimedia (i.e., videoserver application) and VLSI CAD (distributed fault simulation). An experimental networked implementing partial state architectures will be developed. The network element will utilize partial state to provide a better handle on networked and end-host traffic by regulating high bandwidth flows through individual state while aggregating the rest of the flows (similar to how caches are employed in current memory systems). Using realistic VLSI CAD and multimedia applications, the work will evaluate an integrated system consisting of storage and network elements. The project will employ video delivery as an application to evaluate the impact of attaching devices to the network, the storage services (i.e., third party transfers and data filtering), network centric issues (e.g., QoS, congestion management, and transport protocols), and new architectures and mechanisms in protecting storage systems against Denial of Service (DOS) attacks. Moreover, the equipment will be used for developing the target applications and for staffing DOS attacks against the new experimental systems. Specifically the proposed research encompasses:     \r\n Providing third party transfers and\r\n Network security: QoS regulation for mitigating DOS attacks and security enhancement through partial state network architectures\r\n\r\nThe infrastructure is expected to offer students valuable training in systems-building, I/O and networked software, parallel and distributed programming, performance evaluation of real systems and interdisciplinary research.\r\n",
