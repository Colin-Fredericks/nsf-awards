The focus of\r\nthe proposal is on the generation of quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes for medical data obtained\r\nfrom structural studies (MR and CT) of human organs.\r\nThe generation of good quadrilateral and hexahedral (quad/hex) meshes is not well-understood\r\nand several important questions remain open. By exploiting the geometry that is central to these\r\nproblems, we aim to develop algorithms for generating guaranteed-quality surface and volume\r\nmeshes composed of quadrilateral and hexahedral elements. Algorithmic techniques and data struc-\r\ntures from computational geometry will be utilized towards this end. We also investigate adaptive\r\nquad/hex meshes, i.e., meshes designed to have varying levels of refinement depending on factors\r\nsuch as the desired level of detail in a localized part of the input domain. The algorithms will be\r\ndesigned for and tested on medical imaging data. Improved surface and volume meshing algorithms\r\nwill directly impact automated clinical analysis of medical data, which is typically carried out by\r\nprocedures that require finite element simulations on discrete anatomical models. Some examples\r\nof such procedures are elastic matching and viscous uid ow. Our work will be done in collabo-\r\nration with researchers in the area of brain image analysis in the Department of Radiology at the\r\nUniversity ofPennsylvania.",
