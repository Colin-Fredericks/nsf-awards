 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Meersmann will combine continuous-flow laser-spin-polarized 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with pulsed-field-gradient diffusion techniques to develop a non-invasive analytical technique that allows the study of porosity, pore-size distribution and pore connectivity in porous host materials. A combination of magnetic stray fields with continuous flow laser polarized xenon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) will be used to study long range structural order in materials with small diffusion constants. An important system that will be probed with this new technique is the gas dynamics in one-dimensional nanochannels that is driven by very slow single-file diffusion processes. A variety of novel phenomena such as the correlation of xenon lineshape with diffusion or concerted cluster diffusion can be probed for the first time with these experiments. \r\n\r\nA non-invasive analytical technique will be developed to provide information about the porosity, pore-size distribution and pore connectivity of porous materials. Nano-channels play an important role in a wide range of industrial catalytic, geologic and biological processes. The results of this research are expected to make a significant contribution to material science concerned with heterogeneous catalysis, separation processes and in the understanding of fundamental physical chemistry. Graduate and  undergraduate students will participate in this research. They will gain excellent training in forefront research techniques in preparation for advanced studies or entry into the scientific/technological workforce.  \r\n",
