 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe chemistry department is enhancing student experiences in physical chemistry by shifting the laboratory experience towards a more research-rich project environment. Students are undertaking projects that make use of a laser light scatter instrument, a laser Raman spectrometer, additional and computers and software. Expanded projects in quantum chemistry and molecular modeling are creating a more comprehensive link between experimental data and theoretical constructions. Experiments are being adapted primarily from the research literature. Many of these experiments allow students to work with macromolecules. The new studies assist students in creating a deeper understanding of the correlation between structure and function, enhance their skills in experimental design and create a more research-like approach to their laboratory studies. This approach is expected to make physical chemistry students more aware of the process chemists utilize in exploring the chemical world, create greater interest in the course, and provide a stimulus for the students to pursue undergraduate research with a physical chemist.\r\n",
