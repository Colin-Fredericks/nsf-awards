Such processes\r\ninclude viscous and thermal flows as well as diffusive motion, chemical\r\nreactions, in both classical and quantum systems. Recent work by the PI\r\nand co-workers has shown that for most systems of interest, there is an\r\nunderlying chaotic dynamics which can be viewed as the source of the\r\nirreversibility. The sensitivity of the motion of a chaotic system of\r\nparticles to the precise values of the initial conditions of the particles\r\nreflects itself as an apparent randomness in the dynamics of the system.\r\nCurrent research is devoted to a study of entropy production and related\r\nirreversible phenomena in classically chaotic systems, as well as to the\r\nquantum mechanical versions of the systems and their processes. This\r\nlatter direction is stimulated in part by recent work by many authors on\r\nthe quantum behavior of classically chaotic systems which can be\r\nfruitfully applied to a study of irreversibility in quantum systems.\r\n Finally, work will be carried out to determine the analogous\r\nproperties of non-chaotic systems, or of mixed chaotic and non-chaotic\r\nsystems, with transport to study the modifications of the theory needed to\r\ntreat such systems, as well.\r\n\r\n",
