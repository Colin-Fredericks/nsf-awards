 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bioluminescence the emission of light by living organisms is a fascinating phenomenon that\r\nhas enchanted children and challenged those who have tried to fully understand it. Fireflies are\r\nexamples of bioluminescent beetles capable of emitting light of various colors from green to red.\r\nThe basic biochemistry of the firefly light emission process has many practical applications\r\nincluding drug development, clinical trials and food testing. This project will investigate the key\r\nfirefly protein called luciferase that is responsible for the extraordinary biochemical light\r\nprocess. The research is designed to identify important components of firefly luciferase and to\r\ndetermine how specific amino acids work together to efficiently produce light of varying color.\r\nMolecular biology techniques will be used to create and evaluate new luciferase proteins. The\r\nresults should contribute to a better understanding of firefly bioluminescence and the\r\nfundamental process by which living organisms convert chemical energy into light. The\r\nelucidation of the light-emitting process of firefly luciferase is important to the continued\r\ndevelopment of significant useful applications. Additionally, a better understanding of the firefly\r\nluciferase structure-function properties is important to fundamental biochemical processes with\r\nsignificant practical applications extending beyond the realm of bioluminescence. This project\r\nwill be carried out at Connecticut College, a liberal arts college with a strong commitment to\r\nundergraduate research experiences. Previous bioluminescence work directed by the principal\r\ninvestigator for approximately 25 years has been highly appealing to undergraduate students.\r\nProfessional and students participants in this project will be involved in modern mainstream\r\nbiochemical and molecular biology research. It is expected that student participants will become\r\nscientists well prepared for entry into graduate programs and professional scientific careers.",
