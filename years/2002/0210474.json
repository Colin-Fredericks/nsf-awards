 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cushing\r\n0210474\r\n     The project entails a theoretical and experimental study\r\nthat examines nonlinear population dynamics phenomena in the\r\ncontext of stochasticity and that addresses fundamental concepts\r\nof how stochastic and nonlinear forces combine to produce\r\nobserved population phenomena.  The methodology involves an\r\ninterdisciplinary effort that features a thorough integration of\r\nbiologically based modeling (deterministic and stochastic),\r\nmathematical and numerical analyses of model dynamics, and the\r\nderivation and application of statistical techniques for\r\nconnecting models with data (including parameter estimation and\r\nmodel evaluation).  The investigators study the fundamental\r\nquestion about how (demographic) stochasticity at the individual\r\nlevel propagates to the population level.  A promising class of\r\nmodels that incorporates both demographic and environmental\r\nstochasticity is pursued.  A variety of statistical and\r\nmathematical questions that arise from these studies are\r\ninvestigated.  The validity of this modeling methodology and\r\naccuracy of a priori model predictions is directly testable by\r\nexperiments.  The project study includes an experimental test of\r\nthis modeling approach to demographic and environmental\r\nstochasticity, using a laboratory model that the investigators\r\nhave successfully used in a wide variety of population dynamics\r\nand modeling studies during the last decade.  The modeling\r\nmethodology is also applicable to field populations and the\r\ninvestigators pursue the development of field studies with\r\nseveral researchers who have expressed interest in such a\r\ncollaboration.  These collaborators include colleagues at (1) the\r\nCenter for Environmental Analysis at California State University,\r\nLos Angeles in a project modeling the spatially structured\r\ndynamics of seashore species, (2) the University of California,\r\nDavis in a project to model a lupine-caterpillar-nematode system,\r\n(3) Andrews University on mathematical/statistical models of the\r\ndistribution of marine birds and mammals on Protection Island\r\nNational Wildlife Refuge in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and (4)\r\nthe Virginia Institute of Marine Science on nonlinear models of\r\nthe blue crab in the Exuma Cays.\r\n     An understanding of the dynamics of biological populations\r\nis fundamental to the understanding of ecological and\r\nenvironmental problems.  Mathematical models can be a valuable\r\ntool that provides this understanding.  They can also provide the\r\nmeans to predict the future of ecosystems and the species that\r\nthey include.  An accurate descriptive and predictive capability\r\ngained through mathematical models provides not only a basic\r\nunderstanding of ecological problems, but also the ability to\r\ndesign programs for the assessment, management, and control of\r\necosystems and for the solution of environmental problems.  A\r\nfundamental difficulty in the application of mathematical models\r\nto ecological problems has been the lack of a close connection of\r\nmodels with biological data.  A key problem is the ability of\r\nmodels to incorporate random effects and disturbances.  The\r\ninvestigators extend, analyze, and apply a modeling methodology\r\nthey have developed during a decade of experimental studies, in a\r\ncontrolled laboratory setting, that addresses these difficulties.\r\nThe methods are not restricted to laboratory populations,\r\nhowever, and the project also includes collaborations with new\r\ncolleagues for the purpose of applying the methods to field\r\nstudies of natural populations.\r\n",
