Symington\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator proposes to use singular Lagrangian fibrations to \r\ngain insight into the topology of symplectic manifolds.  The ultimate goal is \r\nto develop an effective language for constructing and analyzing symplectic \r\nfour-manifolds, analogous to Kirby calculus for smooth four-manifolds.\r\nThis work lies at the intersection of toric geometry, integrable systems\r\nand smooth four-manifold topology.  Progress on this project will allow the \r\npresentation of symplectic four-manifolds as generalized sums of well-understood \r\nmanifolds.  For instance, this approach has allowed the Principal Investigator \r\nto specialize a smooth surgery to the symplectic category and thereby determine \r\nthe existence of symplectic structures on an infinite family of four-manifolds \r\nwith exotic smooth structures.  Further work will include extensions to \r\ndimension six where such fibrations arise in the ground-breaking theory of \r\nmirror symmetry.\r\n\r\nA manifold is the generalization of a surface to other dimensions.  For a \r\nmanifold to be symplectic it must have an internal structure akin to the space \r\nof positions and velocities of a mechanical system such as a pendulum. \r\nSymplectic manifolds are ubiquitous in topology, geometry and physics.\r\nRecently great progress has been made in understanding symplectic manifolds,\r\nespecially of dimension four, but many basic questions remain unanswered.\r\nFor instance, given a manifold there is no general way to determine if it \r\npermits the internal structure required for it to be symplectic.  One way to \r\nattack such a question is to require some additional structure on the manifold.\r\nThe Principal Investigator proposes to deepen our understanding of these \r\nmanifolds by appealing to a higher-dimensional analog of topographic maps for \r\nmeasuring elevation.  The additional structure could be thought of as the analog \r\nof lines of constant elevation.  In essence, the Principal Investigator plans to \r\ndevelop two-dimensional maps that yield enough information to completely \r\ndetermine the terrain (the four-dimensional manifold) and a legend that make \r\nthese maps interpretable.\r\n\r\n",
