 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel and living expenses for 8 to 10 US advanced students to participate in a near-surface volcano-geophysics field camp on Montserrat.  The purpose of the field camp is to train these students in the use of advanced geophysical equipment in the study of active volcanic terrains.  The request for student training takes advantage of an existing US0-NSF and UK-NERC sponsored effort to understand the science and hazards of the relatively silisic volcanic system on Montserrat.  The student training is further being organized so as to take advantage of the advanced volcano-geophysics and near-surface enivornmental-geophysics field camp that will be run on Montserrat by J. Neuberg (Leeds University, the UK).  As a result, there will be no costs for renting or transporting heavy geophysical equipment to this island volcano.  It is also anticipated that the results of the field camp will be used in planning the installation of the geophysical observatories that are part of the NSF/NERC sponsored science program on Montserrat.\r\n\r\nThe educational purpose of the field camp will be two fold:  (1) to demonstrate the techniques and value of 3D geophysical surveying and data in active volcanic geology, and (2) acquaint a large group of students with the scientific objectives and research possibilities of the Montserrat progrm. The student fieldwork and data analysis include advanced training in modern geophysical investigation methods and extensive interactions between industry, government, and the universities involved in the Montserrat science program.",
