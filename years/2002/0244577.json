  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNORTH AMERICAN ALMA CONSTRUCTION PROJECT\n\nThe National Science Foundation supports facilities that provide research capabilities in wide range of scientific disciplines.  One such facility, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Observatory, provides telescope capabilities and instrumentation for research in radio astronomy, as well as public information and outreach to enrich the understanding of the Universe. \n\nALMA is the largest, ground-based astronomical project in existence.  Effectively, it is a single telescope of revolutionary design, composed of sixty-six (66) high-precision antennas located on the Llano de Chajnantor (a plateau at 16,400 feet altitude), in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.  The Chajnantor site was selected because it is one of the driest places on Earth and more than eighty-five percent (85%) of the celestial sphere is visible from there.  ALMA is the world\u00c6s most powerful telescope for observing the \u00e6cool\u00c6 Universe - molecular gas and dust, as well as the relic radiation of the Big Bang.  Astronomers and astrophysicists use ALMA to study the building blocks of stars, planetary systems, galaxies, and life itself.  It provides scientists with detailed images of stars and planets being born in gas clouds near our Solar System, and detecting distant galaxies forming at the edge of the observable Universe &hellip; which are seen as they were roughly ten billion years ago.  In a very real sense, ALMA is a time machine which allows us to peer into the distant past and address some of the deepest questions of our cosmic origins.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF), along with its international Partners (principally the European Southern Observatory and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan) built and operates the ALMA Observatory.  The NSF engaged Associated Universities, Inc. and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (U.S.) to support its role in construction and operation of the ALMA Observatory.  The North American ALMA Construction Project is the NSF\u00c6s largest, single Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) expenditure to-date.  Closure of the North American ALMA Construction Project (and transition to Operations) in March 2015 represents the fulfilment of a thirty-two-year-long effort that progressed from conceptual design and site selection, through a series of Critical Design Reviews, tests and evaluation, to implementation and commissioning.  A multitude of scientists, engineers, and business professionals collaborated in this effort.\n\nNew, highly sophisticated technology was developed to build and operate ALMA.  The reflecting surface of each 40 foot diameter antenna dish is precisely aligned to within one thousandth of an inch of a perfect parabolic shape.  The signal from each antenna is synchronized to within one millionth of a millionth of a second.  Essentially, this is achieved by means of a master clock transmitting a reference signal - at the speed of light - to each of the 66 antennas via a fiber optic network.  The incoming signal from the sky is detected by exquisitely sensitive radio receivers (in each antenna), operating at minus 452&deg;F.  The signal is converted from analog to digital format, and then processed by a custom-designed supercomputer.  The supercomputer (called a \u00e6Correlator\u00c6) collects and assembles the signals from each antenna and transforms them into an astronomical image.  This requires the Correlator to make upward of 17 quadrillion mathematical operations per second!  Each antenna is transportable and can be positioned onto any one of 192 foundations.  In the most dispersed array of antennas, system performance is equivalent to one giant antenna that is 8.7 miles in diameter.\n\nALMA has already yielded impressive scientific results.  For example, this revolutionary new image (Figure 2) reveals in astonishing detail the planet-forming disk surrounding HL Tau, a Sun-like star located approximately 450 light-ye..."
