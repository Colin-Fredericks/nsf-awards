 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rice University engineering faculty, Texas Southern University education faculty, and Houston\r\nIndependent School District teachers and administrators, propose Engineering Bridges, a\r\nplanning project to develop a comprehensive program to systemically change science,\r\ntechnology, mathematics, and engineering instruction and culture in high-minority high schools\r\nin order to increase the number of underrepresented minority students excited and well-prepared\r\nto enter engineering university (STEM) majors.\r\n\r\nFor over thirty years our nation has attempted to increase participation of African American,\r\nHispanic, and Native Americans in STEM fields. And even though there has been some growth\r\nin engineering degrees granted to those groups over the last twenty years, that growth has not\r\nkept up with those groups population growth in general. This program brings together a strong\r\nand varied collaborative to develop a systemic, coherent plan to tackle this problem in a systemic\r\nway.\r\n\r\nTo develop a plan that will\r\n\r\nPrepare underrepresented minority high school students so they will succeed with\r\nconfidence and enthusiasm in university STEM courses;\r\nInform, excite, and motivate underrepresented minority high school students towards\r\nengineering careers, and\r\nIncrease underrepresented minority students admission into university engineering\r\nmajors.\r\n\r\nTo meet these goals, the planning team will research and design engineering\r\n\r\n. Curriculum materials with appeal to students of underrepresented groups;\r\n. Career-driven professional development for teachers, principals, and counselors;\r\n. Content-driven professional development for science and mathematics teachers; and a\r\n. Multi-level (high school through university faculty/industrial worker) support\r\ncommunity that provides academic support and personal and professional role models.\r\n\r\n",
