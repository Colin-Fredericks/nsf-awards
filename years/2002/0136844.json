 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Gutow at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, is studying the modification of hydroxylated oxide surfaces.  Using a novel wet-chemical zinc alkyl treatment, he and his undergraduate students are exploring the quality and kinetics of formation of thin films formed using this approach.  In collaboration with Professor Tysoe at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, these films are characterized using infrared spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance measurements, and ultra-high vacuum surface analytical methods.  Strategies for the growth of well-characterized monolayer, multilayer, and composite films are being developed. In addition, this research program serves as an important training ground for undergraduate scientists at this primarily undergraduate institution. \r\n\r\nEffective routes to the formation of robust coatings on oxide surfaces are needed for technological applications in electronic materials chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis.  With support from the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Gutow and his collaborators are examining novel zinc alkyl methods for forming these coatings.  Synthetic methods, film characterization, and undergraduate training in state of the art research methods will result from this work. \r\n",
