 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental challenge in network  design is how to choose  the right protocol,  with   the  right   parameter  settings,   for  some  given circumstances. A key problem that lacks a systematic formal  framework is the scalability  issue in the  design space: networks  rapidly grow not  only  in  size  and  heterogeneity,  but  also  in  the number of available design  choices, such  as the  right protocol  to select, or just setting the right parameters for a given protocol.\r\n\r\nTo help remedy this situation we propose MERIT, a formal framework for systematically  assessing  protocols  in  dynamic  scenarios.  The key novelty  of  the researcher's solution  is  its  inherent scalability: rather than comparing the  different protocols  directly, the researchers compute an  inherent measure of  the protocol.  Using this  measure the researchers  define a  spectrum,\r\ncalled a MERIT spectrum, for  the protocol that characterizes it  in a way that  ensures comparability  with other  protocols without porting them to the same platform. In addition, we develop a systematic way of analyzing these spectra.\r\n\r\nWhile  the  traditional  qualitative  and  quantitative  measures  areinformative,  they  do  not  provide  a  satisfactory  framework for a systematic and unified comparison of protocols. For example, as  shown in the literature, the resulting ranking often strongly depends on the chosen simulation model.  The researchers take a  new, orthogonal direction  in the assessment  of  routing  protocols  in  MERIT. Specifically, the MERITframework provides  a systematic  and general  way to  rank any  given routing protocol  by comparing  it to  a theoretical,  yet efficiently computable, optimum  in its  own system,  rather than  to a  competing protocol.\r\n\r\nFor the problem of  routing in a mobile  ad hoc network, the researchers show that the theoretical optimum can be meaningfully defined and computed.  The basis of the researchers approach is a characterization based on the ratio of  the MEan ``Real'' to the ``Ideal'' cosT, or MERIT, of the protocol, and the researchers call the measure  the MERIT ratio.  The MERIT ratio  as a function  of\r\nsome parameters defines the MERIT spectrum of the protocol, yielding a multi-faceted representation of protocol effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThe successful preliminary theoretical and experimental results of the MERIT framework have encouraged  the researchers to develop three  primary research directions: (1) Further development  of the mathematical model  in the MERIT framework, with special  emphasis on creating formal  methods to analyze MERIT spectra. (2) Creating a software tool for the systematic study of routing  protocols using the  MERIT framework. (3)  Extensive experimentation   with real routing   protocols   to capture and systematically compare their  behaviour through analyzing  their MERITspectra.\r\n\r\nRegarding the broader impact of the project, the contributions combine to impact the research in the field of dynamic networks. For mobile ad hoc networks, there is an impact in both theoretical model development and  also  simulation  based  performance  analysis. The three primary research  directions  of  the  project  are  appropriate to help train graduate students to become highly skilled to conduct both theoretical work with  strong mathematical  foundations, as  well as  experimental\r\nwork using realistic network  models in simulation. The  methodologies will  also be  introduced  into  the  graduate  curriculum as well as research seminars that may also involve students from underrepresented groups. While the original motivation for MERIT was to assess  routing\r\nprotocols in mobile ad hoc  networks, the methods are also  applicable to other dynamic scenarios. Thus, the benefit to society, in  addition to the production of well educated and skilled  rofessionals, is  that networks will run more efficiently since MERIT provides a  methodology\r\nto select the right protocol for the job. The results will be  broadly disseminated  in  conference  and  journal  papers,  as  well  as book chapters.\r\n\r\n",
