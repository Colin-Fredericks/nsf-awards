How \r\nthese axons find their targest is one of the fundamental questions of \r\ndevelopmental neuroscience. When many axons take similar pathways and \r\nform a nerve bundle or axon tract, individual axons are often highly \r\norganized within the larger tract. How such sorting within axon \r\ntracts is achieved is a basic question of axon guidance that has been \r\nstudied very little.\r\n\r\nIn the visual system, retinal axons exit the eye and form the optic \r\nnerve, where they are organized in a very precise array according to \r\ntheir point of origin. Shortly after passing through the optic \r\nchiasm, these retinal axons reorganize in a characteristic way, so \r\nthat they are sorted out according to a different order as they grow \r\nthrough the optic tract on their way to visual centers in the brain. \r\nThis sorting of retinal axons in the optic tract allow the proper \r\nformation of normal visual connections, and is therefore critical for \r\nnormal vision.\r\n\r\nThis project will study the mechanisms of axon sorting in the visual \r\nsystem of the zebrafish, Danio rerio. The zebrafish visual system has \r\nmany fundamental similarities (both genetic and anatomical) to humans \r\nand other vertebrates, and so the principles discovered here are \r\nlikely to have wide applicability. In a particular zebrafish mutant \r\nstrain, called boxer, a subset of the retinal axons fail to \r\nreorganize normally within the optic tract. Thus, normal function of \r\nthe boxer gene is critical for normal development of the visual \r\nsystem. The proposed experiments will analyze whether boxer function \r\nis required in the eye or in the brain, and will clone boxer to \r\ndetermine which mutated gene is responsible for the visual system \r\ndefect. These experiments will shed light on a critical aspect of how \r\nthe brain is properly wired during development.\r\n",
