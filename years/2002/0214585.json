 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drew\r\n0214585\r\n     The investigator derives and studies mathematical models for\r\nseveral different processes involved with cell division, focusing\r\non E. coli cells because of the wealth of data available.  A\r\nmature cell replicates its DNA.  The daughter DNA strands must\r\nmove into the halves of the mature cell, and finally, the cell\r\ndivides.  The relative timing of these events is crucial for the\r\ndivision into viable daughter cells, and placement of the septum\r\nmust divide the cell and its DNA into relatively equal halves.\r\nOnce replication begins,the cell then must become unable to start\r\nreplication again until the cell is sufficiently mature.\r\nSequestration is responsible for this eclipse period, where the\r\nnew DNA strand binds to sites in the membrane, thereby blocking\r\nthe oriC site and dnaA transcription regulation site, keeping the\r\nreplication initiation from occurring too soon.  This process of\r\nsequestration and de-sequestration is therefore (at least\r\npartially) responsible for the timing of cell division events.\r\nThe mathematical model predicts the probability of each of the\r\nsequestration sites being sequestered, as a function of time.  The\r\nreplicated DNA strands are moved apart in the longitudinal\r\ndirection (towards the cell poles) in order to assure exactly one\r\nset of chromosomes in each daughter cell.  The process by which\r\nthis occurs is unknown, but the timing of this event is crucial\r\nto viability.  The project studies viable models for this\r\nseqregation.  The site for septation is marked by formation of a\r\nZ-ring at the center of the rod-shaped cell, halfway between the\r\npoles.  This Z-ring is involved in causing the cell to form a\r\nseptum between the daughter halves.  Placement of the Z-ring at\r\nthe center is a result of the cooperative actions of three\r\nproteins from the min locus of the DNA.  Three proteins behave in\r\nan oscillatory manner, with MinD alternately forming a layer on\r\nthe cell membrane near one pole, then disassembling and\r\nre-forming at the other pole.  The investigator studies a model\r\nfor the dynamics of the Min system.\r\n     The investigaor develops mathematical models to improve the\r\nunderstanding of the biology of cell division in E. coli.  The\r\nbasic philosophy is to determine mechanisms that can describe\r\nobserved events, and to evaluate whether these mechanisms can\r\noperate for reasonable parameter values, that is, whether the\r\nkinetic rates, diffusivities, and concentrations are within\r\nreasonable ranges of observed values.  Location and timing of\r\ncellular events is an important aspect of molecular biology.\r\nMoreover, mathematical models that incorporate intracellular\r\ntransport and reactions, including reactions with organelles,\r\nshould prove to be of general applicability to cellular biology.\r\nSuch models can focus biological research on aspects of molecular\r\ndynamics that otherwise seem unconnected.\r\n",
