 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a US-Bulgarian workshop on the use of information technologies in modeling the Bulgarian firm in transition from a planned to a free market economy.  The workshop will be held in Bulgaria.  The co-organizers of the workshop are Drs. Madeline Johnson and Richard Alo from the University of Houston-Downtown and Dr. Nikola Yankov from the Tsenov Academy of Economics in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the workshop is to bring together faculty, students and other experts from the U.S. and Bulgaria to discuss and develop joint research toward the development of a strategic and tactical decision-making simulation of a Bulgarian firm in transition from operating in a planned economy to a free market economy.  The simulation will support research, training and education on the strategic and tactical processes that will speed the transformation required to operate successfully in a free market economy.  The objectives of the workshop are (a) the identification of the constructs to be modeled in the simulation and (b) the identification of the relationships among the constructs to be modeled in the simulation.  The outcomes of the workshop will include data collection, model building, and software engineering to explicate the simulation.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop in economics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
