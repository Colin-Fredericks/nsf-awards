 "awd_abstract_narration": "Co-infection of a single host by multiple viruses is very common in nature.  Within-host interactions can profoundly affect the severity of disease and efficiency of virus transmission, depending on the exact number of viruses that enter the host.  This co-infection number can be impacted by (1) the host species experiencing the infection, and/or (2) the relatedness of viruses causing the infection.  However, the relative importance of these two factors is not well-understood, and the current project seeks to fill this intellectual gap.  In particular, the project addresses the question using a family of viruses that infect bacteria.  Laboratory experiments will study the evolution of virus traits that govern co-infection numbers.  Results will show whether a host species can limit the number of co-infecting viruses, and whether viruses restrict entry of certain other virus species depending on their genetic relatedness.\r\n\r\nResults of this project are widely applicable because viruses are important disease agents in animals, plants, and bacteria.  The lifestyle of the project virus is similar to that of many human viruses (such as influenza and HIV).  Therefore, the project data should contribute greatly to a better understanding of the generalized role of virus co-infection in human illnesses.  \r\n",
