Review Analysis: The outcome of the review was an overall  show of support for the proposed project.  The proposal, for  example, was characterized by most of the reviewers as  focusing on an important topic, conceptually and  methodologically sound, involving quite capable  investigators, and likely to lead to useful results.  Even  the one reviewer who was more critical noted that the  project would have significant impact because of its  educational component.  Recommended Action: An outstanding  team of researchers has been assembled to carry out this  research, which would involve cross-university collaboration  and provide important experience for participating students.  The team includes an up-and-coming younger investigator and  two senior researchers who are at the top of the field.  The  topic is very important, and the research would be guided by  a well-conceived conceptual and methodological plan.  A  three-year continuing award is recommended.  ***",
