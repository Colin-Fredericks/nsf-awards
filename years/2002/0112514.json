Meng, SUNY Buffalo\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical characterization of turbulent flow with suspended particles has remained a challenge requiring much effort in both direct computational analysis as well as accurate high resolution measurements.  The holographic particle image velocimetry (HPIV) technique has been applied effectively for investigation and characterization of single phase flows seeded with tracer particles (small Stokes number).  Extension of this method to particle-laden flows for 'high-resolution' characterization of the behavior of the carrier fluid as well as characterization of the suspended particles (with large Stokes number) and particle dynamics has remained a challenge.\r\n\r\nThis proposal makes use of the unique HPIV facilities developed by the PI at the host institution in an attempt to develop an extended HPIV technique for full characterization of the particle-laden turbulent flow.  If successful, the approach is particularly effective since the measurements can be at the spatial resolution comparable to the resolution in direct numerical simulations (DNS).  This will allow direct comparison with DNS results, as well as complement the more engineering based models and large eddy simulations.\r\n",
