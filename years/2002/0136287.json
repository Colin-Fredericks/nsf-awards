 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Householder Symposium gathers the world's most active researchers in numerical linear algebra once every three years to review advances in the field, present recent theoretical and practical results, assess where the field is headed in the near future, and to provide an intimate atmosphere to foster close personal interaction and exchange of ideas.  \r\n\r\nThis project supports the travel of junior U.S. researchers to the 15th Householder Symposium on Numerical Linear Algebra to be held June 17 - 21, 2002 in Peebles, Scotland.  The funds are for travel expenses for U.S. graduate students and recent Ph.D.s who would otherwise be unable to attend.  The NSF funds will permit full participation by the most promising junior members of the U.S. numerical linear algebra community.  As the Householder Symposium is traditionally a gateway conference into the field, participation of junior scientists is essential. U.S. participation in the Symposium will have a positive impact on the continued strong competitiveness of the U.S. in the crucial discipline of numerical linear algebra, a field of central importance in scientific computing.",
