 "awd_abstract_narration": "0201353, Ronald Pak, U. of Colorado-Boulder\r\n\"Advanced Engineering Framework for Dynamic Foundation Interaction with Granular Soils under Multi-Directional Loads\"\r\n\r\nA major source of difficulty in obtaining consistent predictions of the dynamic behavior of foundations on sandy and gravelly soils under multi-directional excitation is the inadequacy in the conceptual and analytical framework for the dynamic contact problem, considering the complex nature of granular materials.  This problem is the foundation of many important applications in dynamic soil-structure interaction, and geotechnical and earthquake engineering.\r\n\r\nThis action is to support a comprehensive research program to: (i) develop, by means of centrifuge modeling, an enlarged experimental data base with significant parametric variations, so as to delineate the spectrum of dynamic characteristics of the embedded and surface foundation response for a variety of soils, foundations, and loading parameters; (ii) develop and implement, using the new comprehensive data base, a dual set of analytical frameworks.  The first provides a simple and conceptually succinct engineering format to address the special characteristics of the dynamic behavior of granular materials not accounted for in current approaches.  The second provides an in-depth understanding of the granular continuum mechanics problems underlying the dynamic physical phenomena.\r\n\r\nThrough these developments, an up-to-date reassessment of existing field and laboratory experimental data can be pursued.\r\n",
