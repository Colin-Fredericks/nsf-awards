 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linn-Benton Community College's (LBCC) project expands opportunities for education,\r\nincreases retention to baccalaureate degree achievement, and improves employability of low-income,\r\nacademically talented students in transfer programs in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics.\r\nThis is accomplished by providing targeted academic, career, and other support services to the\r\nrecipients of 30 scholarship awards each year.\r\nThe four main components of the LBCC Tech Scholars Program (TSP) are:\r\noFinancial support through TSP scholarships to allow talented low-income students to pursue full-time studies in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics\r\noAcademic support through existing programs and new initiatives to assist students with current coursework and prepare them for success in upper division coursework\r\noMentoring and student support to increase retention at LBCC and to promote a smooth transition to the transfer institution\r\noActivities to strengthen employability, including career explorations, preparation for internships, and development of job-seeking skills\r\n\r\nThe theme permeating all components of this project is 'community building' a focus on establishing a\r\ncohort that provides peer support; develops an increased sense of belonging; and promotes identification\r\nwith the discipline at LBCC, the target transfer institution, and the chosen profession. Enhancements to\r\nexisting support services as well as new initiatives are designed specifically to strengthen these bonds and\r\nreduce feelings of isolation. There is a great need in Oregon for skilled high tech employees. LBCC is in a prime position to work toward meeting that need because of high unemployment in parts of our service district, a large percentage of students who have financial need, strong community support for this community college, robust transfer programs in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics, and extensive articulation with both high schools and transfer institutions.\r\n\r\nLBCC initially recruits low-income students who are currently enrolled at the college and who\r\nhave demonstrated academic talent in Computer Science, Engineering, or Mathematics into the TSP.\r\nAfter the first year, the program expands to include low-income high school students who have\r\ndemonstrated academic talent and expressed an interest in majoring in one of these three areas. The\r\nfinancial support provided by the scholarships increases full-time enrollment and improve academic\r\nlife by reducing the need to work long hours for an income. TSP scholars are then able to more fully\r\nutilize the academic, career, and personal support services. TSP scholars benefit from extensive academic support systems currently available, including free tutoring; Supplemental Instruction; and a Learning Center with Math, Science, Writing, Reading, and Study Skills assistance. Enhancements and additions included as part of the project include the establishment of a Tech Scholar Center (a designated room on campus where TSP scholars can hang out, work on their studies together, and get academic assistance); expanded connections between TSP scholars and faculty, students, and organizations at transfer institutions; site visits and presentations by industry representatives; development of job-seeking skills; and increased participation in career-enhancing activities such as internships.\r\n",
