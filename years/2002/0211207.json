 "awd_abstract_narration": "A sophomore-level course will be designed that introduces computer engineering\r\nfundamentals to pre-service science and math teachers in a highly interactive, hands-on\r\nenvironment, using active, cooperative learning methods. In cooperation with existing\r\nefforts, it will also be adapted to appeal to in-service teachers seeking a Masters degree in\r\nscience or math education. It will illustrate how to use microprocessor based, mini-data\r\nacquisition systems, and robotics to create projects demonstrating physics and math\r\nconcepts satisfying the Maine Learning Results and other national education standards.\r\nThese materials will be distributed over the web.\r\n\r\nA unique aspect of this effort will be the recruitment and engagement of honors-level\r\nfirst-year Electrical and Computer Engineering and pre-service College of Education\r\nstudents to help develop curricular content that will interest middle and high school\r\nstudents. In-service teachers will be included in the development of pedagogy that\r\nefficiently conveys the engineering material to future science and math teachers.\r\n\r\nThis project will introduce the engineering application of science and math, as well as\r\nproviding a bridge between such informal science innovations as First Robotics, First\r\nLego League, Bot Ball, etc. and the classroom environment. The major benefit, however,\r\nto the engineering establishment will be the application of and emphasis on engineering\r\nconcepts to the science/math K-12 infrastructure. Through this course, pre-service and\r\nin-service teachers will be equipped with the tools to illustrate engineering principles and\r\nhow they relate to concepts normally taught in conventional science and math courses.\r\n",
