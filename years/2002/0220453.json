Special consideration for scholarships is given to increase the minorities and women's participation in these fields. Through the CSEMS Academy at the college, students in the program receive individualized support and peer mentoring, and have opportunities to participate in internships with local industries such as Verizon and IBM, and with other colleges with which the Bronx Community College has an established relationship. The Academy also provides a physical place at the college where students can form study groups; receive tutoring and other services under the guidance of faculty members. Workshops on interviewing and job search and presentations by alumni from high-technology industry are also conducted by the CSEMS Academy in order to help students find employment with local industries once they complete their program. The transfer office at the college assists students who are interested to transfer to four-year schools to complete their studies.",
