 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research topic of this award is superstring theory, which is the most promising candidate for a complete unification of the four fundamental forces of Nature (electro-magnetic, weak, strong and gravitational) into a framework consistent with all known physical principles, including quantum mechanics and general\r\nrelativity. Strings are one-dimensional extended objects which, under time-evolution, sweep out fluctuating two-dimensional surfaces. The quantitative understanding of the dynamics of superstring theory, for weak coupling, requires precise mathematical methods for defining and calculating the quantum mechanics of these fluctuating surfaces. The research carried out under this award demonstrates how to overcome certain longstanding difficulties with both the definition and calculation of these effects and leads to concrete and beautiful quantitative formulas.\r\n\r\nThe above results have exciting applications, including the first reliable calculation, at two-loop order, of a number of physically important quantities.  The first is the scattering amplitude of massless superstrings, one of the key dynamical quantities of superstring theory.  The second is the so-called cosmological constant, which provides a possible modification of the equations of general relativity, and whose effects interfere\r\nwith the presence in the Universe of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.  String theory, being a theory of quantum gravity, is expected to make the calculation of the cosmological constant possible. D'Hoker's results show that the cosmological constant in flat space-time must vanish, and provides a general expression in\r\n(more realistic) non-supersymmetric models.",
