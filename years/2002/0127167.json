 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nInquiry-based laboratories are an important means of providing students with the opportunity to learn through a process of exploration and discovery. Inclusion of inquiry-based laboratories is a critical feature of the curricular reform currently underway in the Department of Biological Science, California State University, Fullerton. This project involves the development and support of multiple inquiry-based laboratory modules integrated throughout a new four-semester series of foundational courses in the biology major. Eight modules are being developed using model organism systems drawn from the Research Link 2000 Institute. The courses served by these modules include: Biodiversity & Evolution, Cellular Basis of Life, Genetics & Molecular Biology, and Principles of Physiology & Ecology. Modules, using Aiptasia palladia (sea anemone) and Wisconsin Fast Plants, follow themes of symbiosis and stress responses, respectively, from the distinct perspective of each core course. The key innovation of this project is the creation of an iterative inquiry-based laboratory experience. Student laboratory experiences more closely resemble authentic science. We propose that students gain 1) confidence in the care and manipulation of the organisms, 2) facility in experimental design, 3) appreciation of the integrative nature of biology, and 4) a greater depth of knowledge. Student learning goals and preparation for upper-division course work, including independent research, are being evaluated.",
