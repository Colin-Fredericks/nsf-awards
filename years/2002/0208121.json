 "awd_abstract_narration": "0208121\r\nAvalos\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with studying exact boundary controllability \r\nproperties of those systems of coupled partial differential equations \r\n(PDE's) which govern structural acoustic flow within a chamber. Exact \r\nand null boundary controllability problems for two-dimensional systems \r\nof thermoelasticity will also be studied. In part, the work will entail a \r\nstudy of the dual problem; namely, the attainment of related observability \r\ninequalities for solutions of homogeneous adjoint equations. In line with \r\nthe intended engineering applications, the focus will be on situations \r\nwhich allow control of the structural acoustic dynamics on as small a \r\n(boundary) control region as possible. Moreover, this project is aimed at \r\nfinding conditions on the geometry and prescribed controls so that, with \r\ncontrol implemented on the flexible portion of the acoustic chamber only, \r\none will have exact controllability of the acoustic flow, for arbitrary initial \r\ndata of finite energy. It is anticipated that key ingredients in the work will \r\ninclude the following: (i) sharp trace regularity for the wave equation in \r\nthe absence of the so-called Lopatinski condition (intrinsic to the wave \r\nequation under Neumann boundary conditions); (ii) microlocal analytical \r\nestimates which will allow the absorption of tangential wave traces by \r\ntime derivatives on the boundary; and (iii) recent results involving \r\nCarleman's estimates for the wave equation with controlled Neumann part \r\nof the boundary. In addition, the project will focus on problems of linear \r\nand (globally) nonlinear exact controllability for thermoelastic systems. In \r\nparticular, thermoelastic PDE's will be considered which have their \r\nassociated (non-Lipschitz) nonlinearities in place; e.g., the von Karman \r\nbracket and the quasilinearities which appear in the modeling of extensible \r\nplates. This work will attempt to use, in an essential way, the now-known \r\nanalyticity of linearized thermoelastic models and our recent stability \r\nwork for uncontrolled (but fully nonlinear) thermoelastic systems.\r\n \r\nExamples of coupled partial differential equations (PDE's), such as those \r\nto be investigated, have long existed in the literature. However, recent \r\ninnovations in smart material technology, and the potential applications of \r\nthese innovations within the context of control engineering design, have \r\ngreatly increased the interest in these PDE models. The project is aimed at \r\nobtaining information about certain qualitative properties of these \r\nequations, which in turn can be used to design effective control laws for \r\nthe structures/interactions that these equations govern. For example, \r\nstructural acoustic PDE's are used to model the interaction of an aircraft \r\ncabin's interior acoustic field with the surrounding walls of the cabin. For \r\nthe benefit of the passengers, it is desirable to negate or control pressure \r\ndisturbances that act directly on the interior acoustic field. These \r\ndisturbances typically emanate from outside the cabin environment; e.g., \r\nvibrations due to aircraft engine and propeller noise, or effects due to \r\nweather turbulence. In practice, engineers attempt to control this external \r\nnoise by placing piezoelectric actuators/sensors on a portion of the cabin \r\nwall, these devices to act in such a way so as to remove, or at least lessen, \r\nthe harmful acoustic pressure effects. However, the efficacy of this \r\ntechnology is profoundly sensitive to the shape of the cabin, as well as to \r\nthe particular region of the cabin walls where the actuators are placed. The \r\ngoals of this project include: (i) the precise mathematical characterization \r\nof those cabin geometries for which active control design by piezoelectric \r\nactuation is indeed possible; and (ii) when such control design is \r\npracticable, the construction of a reliable method to prescribe the amount \r\nand region of control actuation which will be necessary to maintain a calm \r\nacoustic field within the cabin.\r\n",
