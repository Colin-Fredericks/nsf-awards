 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuropeptides are compounds in the nervous system that often modulate physiological functions, and so act as hormones.  The insect neuropeptide allatotropin (AT) is synthesized by specific cells in the central and enteric nervous systems, and is known to promote the synthesis of juvenile hormone (JH), but also has been implicated in other functions.  Recently three other allatotropin-like neuropeptides, ATL I, II and III have been discovered, encoded by alternative splicing from AT gene expression.  The mRNA for these splice variants shows specificity in the tissue and the stage of development, and the gene expression also appears to be under physiological control.  This project combines molecular, biochemical and physiological approaches to clarify when and where the different mRNAs encocde the unique peptides.  Results will provide information on the mechanisms to precisely control the overall biological response that results from the expression of a single neuropeptide gene that is an important regulatory molecule in a model insect species.\r\n   The scientific impact will extend beyond insect neuroendocrinology to more general regulatory physiology, and potentially to insect pest control.  The infrastructure impact includes cross-disciplinary postdoctoral training, which will be enhanced by the collaborative team approach.\r\n",
