 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insects face the challenge of locating hosts in a complex odor landscape.  Plants face the challenge of trying to lure pollinators while, simultaneously, deterring herbivores.  Although this predicament may be quite common, it has rarely been investigated.  Through a combination of analytical chemistry and field research the components of the scent blend of Cirsium arvense, Canada thistle, important for insect attraction will be investigated, and mechanisms by which floral volatile emissions are modified to avoid attracting detrimental insects will be identified.  C. arvense is in many ways well suited for this study. Because it is dioecious, scent, which can act as a long distance attractant for pollinators, becomes paramount to extending its distribution.  Additionally there are distinct selection pressures on the two sexes by beneficial and detrimental floral visitors.  Preliminary data demonstrates a difference in both insect visitation and scent between male and female plants.",
