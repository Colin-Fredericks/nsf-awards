 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2002. The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to increase the number of  research scientists from underrepresented minority groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled \"Role of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans in Synapse Formation.\"  The project examines the role of two chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in synaptogenesis:  one unnamed CSPG, recognized by monoclonal antibody Cat-315, which delineates synaptic sites, and aggrecan, the main CSPG of cartilage. The unnamed CSPG is being identified using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Once identified, its function will be blocked to determine if it is essential to synapse formation. To determine if aggrecan is involved in synaptogenesis, the expression of synpatic markers is being studied in cultured cortices from embryonic CMD mice, a naturally occurring aggrecan knockout mouse.  \r\n\r\n \r\n",
