 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical communication, in particular, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technique, has become a promising networking choice to meet ever-increasing demands on bandwidth from many emerging bandwidth-intensive computing/communication applications. As optics become a major networking media, optical interconnects will inevitably play an important role in interconnecting processors in parallel/distributed computing systems.   This research focuses on fundamental challenges and issues \r\non using optics in two converging areas: parallel/distributed computing and communications. The objective of this research is to design high-speed, cost-effective optical interconnects for current and future generation parallel/distributed computing and communication systems.  Due to the unique characteristics of optics, many important issues of optical interconnects, different from those of \r\nelectronic interconnects, need to be addressed. Specially, this research focuses on (1) explore unique properties and classifications of WDM interconnects; (2) optimal and cost-effective designs; (3) study the effect of wavelength conversion; (4) performance modeling; (5) fault-tolerance issues.  The proposed research combines architecture/circuit design, algorithmic, probabilistic, combinatorial and simulation \r\ntechniques to conduct comprehensive studies on the above issues.  The research results will provide viable solutions for designing high-bandwidth, high-connectivity, low-latency and low-cost optical interconnects. The proposed research will have a significant impact on next generation arallel/distributed computing and communication systems and future networking infrastructure. \r\n",
