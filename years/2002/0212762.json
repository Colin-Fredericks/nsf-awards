 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Convolvulaceae (morning glory family) is a moderate-size family (50-60 genera, 2000 species worldwide) of mostly tropical plants, which has received only sporadic attention from taxonomists. Consequently, the identity of species and the classification of these into reliably identifiable genera are problematic. A specialist on the group, Dr. George Staples of the Bishop Museum in Hawaii, is studying the mostly Asian members of the family, focusing especially on the genera Operculina, Rivea, and Blinkworthia. If this process of verifying purportedly new taxa could be streamlined then the completion of a global biodiversity inventory could be expedited through greater efficiency of research effort.  The activities include the compilation of an Internet-accessible and authenticated nomenclator for all described taxa of Convolvulaceae in tropical and subtropical Asia (Pakistan east to the Philippines and China south to Queensland, Australia). Where a genus has an accepted classification and the taxonomy has been reconciled with recently collected specimens housed in the major museum collections, those species and infraspecific taxon names will be incorporated into the nomenclator. Where no accepted classification exists (the genera Argyreia, Merremia, and Jacquemontia), revisionary work will commence on the Asian taxa, as a basis for worldwide treatments later. Special research attention will be paid to early scientific names (usually by European taxonomists) that have not been taken into account in contemporary classifications. The nomenclator will endeavor to trace all scientific names and provide their current disposition, with documentation via literature and selected specimen citations.\r\nThis research will be carried out primarily in European and British herbaria and libraries, with recourse to specimen loans for more detailed study at the PI's home institution. The products will be a series of taxonomic revisions that provide better methods of taxonomic identification, improve classification at the specific, generic, and tribal levels, and contribute to nomenclatural reform. The nomenclator itself will provide the first inventory of Asian taxa of Convolvulaceae.  And the process for creating the nomenclator will shed light onto how the process for taxonomic verification of new, undescribed species can be made more efficient and thereby enhance the taxonomic enterprise.\r\n",
