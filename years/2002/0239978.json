 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities will conduct a twelve-month national study of Hispanic-serving Institutions that will produce in-depth information on these institutions, as well as outline their unique role in the higher education of Hispanic students and their unique needs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.  The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities represents more than 300 colleges and universities across the United States and Puerto Rico, including 182 Hispanic-serving Institutions.  Currently, Hispanic-serving Institutions account for 5% of all institutions of higher education yet they enroll almost one-half of all Hispanic students. \r\n\r\nThe study conducted by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities will contribute significantly to the understanding of the educational capabilities and needs of Hispanic-serving Institutions in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines.  Project outcomes will include specific recommendations to broaden the participation of Hispanics in undergraduate and graduate STEM study and in the Nation's STEM workforce.\r\n",
