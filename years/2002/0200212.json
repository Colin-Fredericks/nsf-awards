 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2002.  The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. \r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Molecular analysis to identify genes that contribute to the establishment and maintenance of a protistan symbiosis.\"  Little is known at the molecular level about the mechanisms underlying symbiotic associations. This project seeks to identify the genes involved in the symbiosis between two protistan species.  Biological screens for symbiosis using mutagenized symbionts and 2D gel electrophoresis will yield mutants or proteins, respectively, which can be used ultimately to derive DNA sequence.  The sequence data will allow for the identification of the involved genes.\r\n",
