 "awd_abstract_narration": "RECRUIT is an experimental alternative science and mathematics teacher certification program that aims to increase the number of secondary science and mathematics teachers from underrepresented populations in the profession and simultaneously enhance the quality of their preparation. RECRUIT emphasizes two central themes: quality and innovation in science and mathematics teacher preparation. Specifically, the program: 1) creates a venue to recruit and prepare qualified secondary science and mathematics teachers from populations that are underrepresented in the teaching profession. These populations comprise recent and\r\nadvanced science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates, and mid-career scientists, mathematicians, and industry personnel contemplating a shift into pre-college teaching, 2) develops an exemplary science and mathematics teacher preparation program that is consistent with recommendations and goals put forth in recent national reform documents in teacher preparation. Toward achieving this end, the program features: a) extensive long-term collaboration between education faculty, STEM faculty, and school personnel toward the preparation of reform-minded reflective teachers; b) a support community comprising prospective teachers, veteran mentor teachers, and education and STEM faculty, that aims to provide a seamless transition from teacher preparation into teaching; c) an extended induction, support, and professional development period that extends beyond initial coursework and training, that aims to develop participants' pedagogical content knowledge and increase their retention rate in the profession; and d) advanced coursework in both content and pedagogy pursued after participants have spent time teaching in collaborating districts, with the aim of helping participants address advanced instructional outcomes, such as higher order and critical thinking skills, inquiry, and nature of science and mathematics, and 3) contributes through an intensive research component to our knowledge base on: a) developing science and mathematics teachers' cognition, and subject matter, pedagogical, and pedagogical content knowledge; b) creating and sustaining communities to support and facilitate the professional growth of teachers; and c) developing effective models for collaboration between education faculty, STEM faculty, and school personnel through investigating the disciplinary and professional commitments and barriers that often impede such desirable collaboration.",
