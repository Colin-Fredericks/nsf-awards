This project will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team composed of faculty from the College of Engineering and the College of Education. \r\n\r\nIt will address the following factors that affect the sustainability of curricular-change initiatives: \r\n\tthe role of strategic planning within the academic unit and at the institutional level; \r\n\tthe leadership role of department chairs/heads and college deans; \r\n\tthe role of faculty planning, faculty assessment and faculty autonomy; \r\n\tthe system of values and rewards for individual faculty and for their academic units; and \r\n\tthe role of constituent groups in establishing and evaluating educational program objectives and                  curricular outcomes. \r\n\r\nBioengineering was selected as the focus for this reform effort because the State of Michigan recently announced a $1B.i.e., $50M/year, twenty-year. commitment to developing \"A Michigan Life Sciences Corridor.\" \r\n\r\n",
