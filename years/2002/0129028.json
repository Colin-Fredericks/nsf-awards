 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is for a continuation of a computational study of the effects of complex magnetic fields on bulk crystal growth processes.  In the project the investigators are focusing on several stability problems that are important for the growth of compound and solid-solution semiconductor crystals. There are really two distinct, but highly synergistic, application areas are involved:  (1) Study the effects of rotating magnetic fields on vertical Bridgman or vertical gradient freeze growth of solid-solution crystals such as alloys of germanium and silicon.  The investigators will develop the first stability analysis for a RMF including the effects of the buoyant convection and the free surface that are present in the actual process. (2) Study thermoelectromagnetic convection (TEMC) for the magnetically stabilized growth of compound semiconductor crystals. The investigators will develop a linear stability analysis to predict the transition from steady to periodic melt motions with buoyant convection, forced convection and TEMC. Both problems to be studied have the potential to contribute to improved quality and sizes for advanced semiconductor crystals that are important for optical and wireless technologies.",
