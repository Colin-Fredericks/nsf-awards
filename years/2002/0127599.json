 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) Biological research has moved from the laboratory bench to the desktop computer. However, bioinformatics, the use of information technology to manage, store, and analyze biological data, is seldomly used in the biology classroom. Not only is it important for students to develop research skills in this area, but engaging in these types of activities gives students a better understanding of molecular biology. This project enables college and high school instructors to use bioinformatics in life science courses by addressing the lack of \"classroom-ready\" materials. The project is developing instructional materials that focus primarily on teaching students how to use the databases and analysis tools available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Students learn fundamental concepts in biology through the use of bioinformatics tools to perform novel experiments. Products of the project include: 1) a textbook/laboratory manual written from the perspective of how biologists use bioinformatics and providing an overview of the field and fifteen to twenty different experiments designed to help students develop skills in this area; 2) an instructor's manual to help instructors interpret results and including guidelines for implementation and inquiry-based activities; 3) a CD-ROM supplement containing data sets and examples that demonstrate how the laboratories work; and 4) on-line, animated, tutorials designed for novice users and made available through the education page at the NCBI web site.",
