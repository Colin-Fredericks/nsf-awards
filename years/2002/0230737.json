According to the 2000 census, there are more underrepresented minorities in California than other groups, which means the Charter College of Education at Cal State L.A. not only trains more students from underrepresented groups to become teachers, but their graduates are preparing more students from underrepresented groups to attend college. The Charter College of Education at Cal State L.A. graduates approximately 300 pre-service teachers a year with a full credential. Due to the shortage of teachers in California, currently 1,716 students are enrolled in Cal State L.A. who teach via an emergency credential in local elementary, middle and high schools. Revising the science content of their study to include engineering will hopefully encourage them to do the same in their classes multiplying the effect of this grant greatly.\r\n-\r\nIn order to achieve these goals the following activates will be designed and conducted:\r\n\r\n1. Provide education faculty with the theory and practice needed to incorporate engineering design\r\nand process methodology in their curriculum.\r\n\r\n2. Provide engineering faculty with knowledge of learning theories to improve their teaching\r\npedagogy.\r\n\r\n3. Redesign science-method courses for pre-service teachers to include engineering concepts and to\r\nconnect science and math with the real world. Also, provide K-12 teachers with information on\r\nrequirements needed for their students to become engineers.\r\n",
