The testing of these systems requires that a high amplitude force excitation be applied at very low frequencies (0.1 - 10 Hz), which is inherently very difficult to accomplish. The research program is focused on developing a new technique, referred to as Force Frequency Shifting (FFS), to provide such an excitation.  The FFS technique is based on the application of a high amplitude, high frequency force (at frequency fz) to a structure in a spatially time variant fashion (at frequency fx). The nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system produces an excitation at a sum and difference (fz+fx, and fz-fx) of the force and spatial motion frequencies. Of particular interest for low frequency vibration testing, is the difference frequency component (fz-fx). It is the innate ability of the FFS technique to create this low frequency component that is the focus of the project. The research will develop an FFS exciter with a computer-controlled array of variable stiffness actuators. This development will increase the low frequency force performance and control making the FFS suitable for vibration testing of the targeted systems. \r\n",
