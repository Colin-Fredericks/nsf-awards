 "awd_abstract_narration": "0212005\r\nZedler\r\nEcosystem degradation often involves the loss of topographic heterogeneity, a critical\r\necosystem property that declines as sediments fill in depressions, flatten surfaces and\r\nraise elevations. In southern California, coastal habitat that is highly valued for its\r\nsupport of endangered plants and animals has suffered catastrophic sedimentation,\r\nfollowed by altered species distributions and lowered biodiversity. When recovery is\r\nattempted, topographic complexity is typically ignored as sediments are excavated and\r\nrestoration sites contoured by bulldozer. Insufficient vertical and horizontal\r\nheterogeneity might be a key constraint on the restoration of wetlands toward structural\r\nand functional equivalency with undisturbed sites.\r\nIn this project, we will investigate how adding topographic heterogeneity might\r\naccelerate the progress of ecosystem restoration. The principal hypothesis is that adding\r\nvertical and horizontal pattern at to will facilitate the restoration of wetland structure and\r\nfunction. To test this hypothesis, an entire 8-ha tidal wetland restoration site within the\r\nTijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve (San Diego County, CA) was\r\ndesigned to support the large-scale, ecological experiment. The $3.1-million excavation\r\nwas completed in February 2000 with the connection of the site to a main tidal channel,\r\nand we have monitored several attributes over the 22 months since tidal flushing was\r\nreinstated. We propose to take full advantage of the experimental treatments and\r\nexamine the influence of (1) a vertical pattern of topographic heterogeneity, in the form\r\nof complex tidal creek networks, and (2) a horizontal pattern furnished by varying\r\ndensities of planted salt marsh halophytes, on the diversity, abundance and composition\r\nof multiple response variables and trophic levels: geomorphology, algae, vascular plants,\r\ninvertebrates, and fish.\r\nIn addition to testing methods for recovering wetlands, the integrative work proposed\r\nherein will demonstrate the power of restoration experiments and contribute fundamental\r\nnew insights into the relationship between topographic heterogeneity and the\r\ndevelopment of ecosystem structure (species composition and abundance) and function\r\n(e.g., foraging by fish). \r\n\r\nConservation and Restoration Biology (CRB).",
