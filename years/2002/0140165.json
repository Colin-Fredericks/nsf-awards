It has \r\nbeen shownrecently that a large subclass of such systems (walks\r\nin rigid environments) is completely solvable in 1D. The proposed\r\nstudy deals with the case of environments with variable rigidity.\r\nAnother part of the proposal deals with the farther development of\r\nrecently constructed first natural examples of Hamiltonian systems\r\nwith divided phase space. The goal now is to show that a rather \r\ngeneral class of such billiards has positive metric entropy in \r\nany (finite) dimension. The considered problems of statistical \r\nmechanics deal with the rigorous derivation of formulas for \r\nkinetic coefficients and for escape rate in open systems. Among \r\nthe problems which deal with infinite-dymensional systems are \r\nchaos-order transitions in Lattice Dynamical Systems and chaos \r\nin nonlinear wave equations. Other problems deal with various \r\nsystems ranging from the Ergodic Theory (Benford's law)\r\nto some simple models of brain dynamics and logistics.\r\n\r\n  Traditionally the mathematical models of real systems are \r\neither purely deterministic or purely stochastic. These two \r\nclasses of models enjoy having a rich theory, and researchers \r\nhave quite good intuition on their behavior, i.e. they basically \r\nknow what to expect. This intuition is essentially based on a \r\nrich collection of completely solvable (i.e. completely \r\nunderstood) models. However, a majority of real systems are \r\nneither purely deterministic nor purely stochastic. Instead \r\nthey have both (deterministic and stochastic) features. This \r\nproject deals with a big class of such models which were \r\nindependently introduced in communication theory, statistical \r\nphysics,chemical kinetics, theory of artificiall intellect, etc. \r\n\r\n \r\n",
