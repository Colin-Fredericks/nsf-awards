 "awd_abstract_narration": "0202851\r\nBielecki\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be organized into two principal \r\nresearch areas: 1) Development of mathematical theory for risk \r\nadjusted portfolio optimization and fixed income investment \r\nmanagement, incorporating factor modeling of security returns, \r\nand 2) Development of mathematical theory for credit risk \r\nvaluation and hedging. There are three fundamental aspects of the \r\nfirst research area: 1A) The concept of risk adjusted control \r\n(optimization) criteria for investment problems with finite and \r\ninfinite planning horizons. More specifically, we shall continue to \r\ndevelop theory and applications for mean-variance stochastic \r\ncontrol. This kind of control problems is appealing to financial \r\nindustry as it extends to more realistic dynamic framework the \r\nclassical approach of Harry Markowitz  (1990 Nobel Prize in \r\nEconomics).  1B) Development of control methodologies for the \r\nfixed income investment problems with finite planning horizon \r\ncoinciding with the maturity of the underlying bond. We shall \r\nattempt to overcome certain singularity problems arising in this \r\ncontext, which will lead to derivation of applicable fixed income \r\ninvestment strategies. 1C) Explicit consideration given to statistical \r\nestimation issues. Optimal control methodologies are rarely used in \r\nthe financial industry, largely because of statistical difficulties \r\nassociated with the estimation of constant drift coefficients in \r\ndiffusion process models of individual securities. Practitioners \r\ntypically channel their energies into forecasting security returns \r\nbased upon exogenous factors such as interest rates and firm-\r\nspecific accounting measures. The proposed research will serve to \r\nreduce the gap between theory and practice by developing \r\noptimization models, which explicitly incorporate exogenous \r\nfactors. By explicitly modeling the dependence of the assets on \r\nfactors, it will be possible to obtain more realistic models, to better \r\nunderstand the statistical estimation difficulties, and to be in a \r\nposition to apply adaptive control methods. The fundamental \r\naspects of the second research area are: 2A) Explicit consideration \r\ngiven to possibility of credit migrations of defaultable contingent \r\nclaims. This will be done in the context of conditionally Markov \r\nchains both with regard to a single defaultable claim as well as \r\nwith regard to several such claims. The latter situation is very \r\nimportant for applications to basket credit derivatives. 2B) \r\nDevelopment of mathematical theory for hedging of certain classes \r\nof credit derivatives that are vital for financial industry. This will \r\nbe done in the context of martingale representations associated \r\nwith conditionally Markov chains. 2C) Development of analytical \r\ntools for computation of certain class of functionals of conditional \r\nMarkov processes. This will build upon the classical Feynman-Kac \r\ncharacterizations, and will find applications for valuation and \r\nhedging of some fundamental (basket) credit derivatives such as \r\ndefault swaps. \r\n\r\nAlthough the proposed research will require fundamental advances \r\nwithin the areas of applied mathematics, probability, and financial \r\neconomics, it is anticipated that the proposed research will lead to \r\nnew and practical tools that eventually become widely used in the \r\nfinancial industry, and possibly in the insurance industry as well. \r\nThe main reason for this expectation is that the proposed research \r\naddresses the need of the two industries for quantitative \r\nmethodologies that would enable financial and insurance decision \r\nmakers to properly manage certain categories of risks. The major \r\nimplication of incidence of risks in financial/insurance decision-\r\nmaking is the possibility of financial losses. In general, neither the \r\npossibility of financial losses, nor their occasional severity, can be \r\ncompletely eliminated. However, workable tools, such as pricing \r\nand hedging strategies, are sought for controlling some of the risks \r\nunderlying financial and insurance industries, so that both the \r\npossibility and severity of losses are kept to minimum. The \r\nproposed research will provide mathematical basis for \r\ndevelopment of such tools.\r\n",
