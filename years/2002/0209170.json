 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates a new architecture designed to provide\r\ndata to wireless users using a broadcast technique. The objective of this research is to develop schemes for implementing the concept ``DAta in your space (DAYS)\" which combines broadcasting (push) and traditional querying (pull) techniques into one global wireless approach. In this scheme the data broadcasters (special servers) will continuously\r\nbroadcast (push) requested data to a set of ``dedicated\" wireless\r\nchannels, which will be captured by clients (users of the data) at\r\nany time and at any place.  The space will thus be used as\r\npersistent storage for all mobile as well as static devices. \r\n\r\nA universal wireless broadcast approach requires that mobile users be able to find and use the right broadcast information.   Some of the questions to mbe addressed include:\r\n1.  How can the mobile user know which channel has the correct data?\r\n2.  How is data to be assigned to channels?\r\n3.  What techniques can be used to effectively determine the best contents of each channel given many mobile users?\r\n4.  Without explicit user queries, how can the mobile user be assured that the needed data is being broadcast?\r\n5. How can the mobile user be assured that the needed data moves with\r\n  him?\r\nThese issues have to be examined on a global scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
