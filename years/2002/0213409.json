 "awd_abstract_narration": "Various fallacies in thinking interfere with judgment about\r\nmatters of tax.  In particular, people may oppose or\r\ninconsistently support optimizing reforms --- or favor reforms\r\nthat are less than optimal --- because of three clusters of\r\ncognitive biases.  One, the status-quo effect, leads people to\r\nresist beneficial change: they are apt to weigh perceived losses\r\nmore than foregone gains.  Two, manipulation of the point of\r\ncomparison affects how people perceive the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of reform proposals. Three, people underestimate or\r\nignore various \"unseen\" elements of fiscal policy, such as\r\nimputed income and the incentive effects or opportunity costs of\r\nvarious tax and transfer programs.\r\n\r\nWe shall explore these effects in a series of experiments, some\r\nconducted on the World Wide Web and others conducted with other\r\nsamples.  We shall examine these effects in a wide range of\r\nrealistic tax reform proposals, e.g., those concerned with taxes\r\non married couples, hidden taxes, payroll taxes, consumption\r\ntaxes, taxes on imputed income, pollution taxes, and taxes that\r\nsubstitute for private expenditures (such as those that pay for\r\nhealth care).  Finally, we shall attempt to \"debias\" the effects\r\nof interest, and explore the transfer of training from one domain\r\nto another (in part by using samples of people who have already\r\nbeen trained in the economic theory of taxes).",
