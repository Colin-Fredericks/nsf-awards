 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project is focused on application of the Lax Pair\r\nand the Riemann-Hilbert Method to the solution of scattering \r\nproblems in inhomogeneous geomaterials. This approach  is based on \r\na new version of the Inverse Scattering Transform suggested recently by \r\nA. Fokas for studying boundary problems for linear and integrable\r\nnonlinear PDEs. Topics of investigation include: (i) analysis of\r\nthe Riemann-Hilbert problem on the elliptic curve related to the \r\nvector Lax pair of the elastodynamic equation; (ii) explicit evaluation \r\nof scattering coefficients of Raylegh wave in a quarter-space and \r\na corner; (iii) the Riemann-Hilbert approach to scattering of elastic\r\nsurface wave at a vertical interface of two homogeneous quarter-spaces.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of seismic waves is the major source of information\r\nabout the Earth internal structure and its sesmicity. The elastodynamic \r\nequation serves as a basic mathematical model for studing diffraction and \r\nscattering of seismic waves on deep fault zone areas and  other inhomogeneities\r\nin the Earth Crust and Upper Mantle. The research program indicated above\r\nwould allow to make a considerable progress in solving some of the longstanding \r\nproblems related to realistic geometry of seismic zones. Moreover, the\r\nimportant nature of the method developed in the project is that it can  be also applied\r\nto various nonlinear versions of the elastodynamic  equation. During the\r\nlast decades it has been discovered that nonlinearity of the Earth materials\r\nmay be responsible for some peculiar characteristics of the  wavefield, hence\r\nthe research project would provide an analytic tool for studing\r\nthese completely new kind of seismic phenemena as well.",
