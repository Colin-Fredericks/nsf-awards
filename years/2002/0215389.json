 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Subsurface Modeling (CSM), part of the Texas\r\nInstitute for Computational and Applied Mathematics at The\r\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, will purchase 64 PCs, a\r\ncontrol workstation, as well as a storage device, in order\r\nto constuct a parallel computing platform capable of\r\n100 Gflops.  The network for the cluster (high speed Myrinet\r\nnetwork (1Gbit) and a 100Mb ethernet network) is already in\r\nplace.  This platform will be dedicated to research in the\r\nmathematical sciences being led by CSM.  Projects that will\r\nuse this platform include large-scale multiphysics modeling\r\nof subsurface processes, multiscale modeling of flow in\r\nextremely heterogeneous rocks, finite element coastal and\r\nocean modeling, parallel terascale iterative solvers, and\r\nDiscontinuous Galerkin discretization methods. A substantial\r\ncomponent of each of these projects is the development of\r\nnew scalable parallel algorithms as well as implementation\r\nand testing of both proof-of-concept as well as of\r\nproduction-quality codes for simulation of cases driven by\r\nenergy and environment applications.  A dedicated\r\nlimited-access resource greatly expedites such development.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Subsurface Modeling, part of the Texas\r\nInstitute for Computational and Applied Mathematics at The\r\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, will purchase equipment needed\r\nto construct a medium size parallel computer capable of\r\n100 billion arithmetic operations per second.  This computer\r\nwill be dedicated to research in the mathematical and\r\ncomputational sciences being led by CSM.  Researchers\r\ninvolved in the project have decades of experience in\r\ndevelopment of robust, accurate and fast computational\r\ntechniques. The new cluster will allow for large-scale\r\ncomputational modeling and testing of such techniques which\r\npromise to improve ability to understand, predict, monitor,\r\nand control natural and engineered processes occuring in\r\nsurface and subsurface. Significant examples include\r\noptimization of oil and gas recovery, analysis of\r\ncontamination and remediation scenarios in subsurface and\r\nsurface waters like aquifer and coastal environments. The\r\naccess to a dedicated computing resource will\r\ngreatly expedite such development.",
