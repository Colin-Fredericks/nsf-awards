 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kim\r\n0126319\r\n\r\nAntarctic marine ecosystems differ from other polar, temperate and tropical systems at the level of individuals, populations and communities. The environment is characterized by extreme seasonality in light and food availability, along with cold stenothermal conditions. Additionally, human impacts are more limited in Antarctica than in highly populated or exploited areas. A unique research opportunity will occur in 2003 with the installation of a sewage treatment plant at McMurdo Station. This will allow for the conduct of a large-scale experiment on community recovery from organic enrichment and physical disturbance. This research will test whether major hypotheses related to community structure and disturbance recovery, which were formulated and demonstrated in more accessible marine communities, applies to Antarctic ecosystems. This research will build on a ten-year time-series that follows benthic community degradation resulting from emplacement of a sewage outfall. A complicating factor in the local McMurdo ecosystem is the input of fecal matter from the abundant populations of marine mammals and large fishes. Sampling will span the implementation of sewage treatment and the data will be incorporated in a meta-analysis of community recovery from organic disturbance in a variety of habitats, to test the generality of recovery patterns. Experimental manipulations will compare the potentially complex roles of burial and patch size in recovery dynamics. The knowledge gained from this research can be applied to other examples of high organic loading in polar habitats. Significant anthropogenic inputs in high latitudes include pulp mills and increases in human occupation and visitation as well as natural sources including woody debris in river outputs and carcass-falls from the productive surface waters above also present significant carbon inputs to high latitude environments. This study will significantly further the understanding of anthropogenic impacts in polar environments using an integrated approach to evaluate the recovery of the infaunal and epifaunal assemblages after a substantial carbon-loading perturbation sustained over ten years.",
