 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on the theoretical framework of human behavioral ecology, this research will examine the importance of community-level variation in food sharing patterns, and the relationship between intra-community sharing and extra-community trading of meat resources. The importance of household-level factors in food sharing patterns has been investigated previously, but little attention has been given to differences among communities. Therefore, this research focuses on the contextual variation across two different Huaorani communities located within the same region of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and the role that this community-level variation has in predicting food sharing patterns. The PI, a graduate student in anthropology from the University of California at Davis, will investigate the hypotheses that 1) contextual differences between the two communities influence the extent of intra-community food sharing observed, and 2) the degree of intra-community sharing and the degree of extra-community trading are inversely related. Contextual factors to be considered include community layout, relatedness of households, and potential reproductive opportunities. Data will be collected through direct observation and structured interviews. In addition to providing doctoral training for a promising woman scientist, the research will contribute to understanding the potential impact of indigenous people's participation in market economies on local wildlife conservation.",
