Through collaboration between faculties of engineering and\r\neducation, team design projects that involve pre-service elementary education students and engineers at\r\nthe freshman through senior levels will be developed. Using planning grant funds, a working group will\r\nbe formed to develop and pilot-test the multi-disciplinary team design project.. In the long run, the CEL will participate in developing 1) high quality teachers prepared to include engineering in the K-12 curriculum, 2)\r\nengineering faculty applying pedagogy, assessment and learning theory to engineering curriculum, and 3)\r\na body of scholarship on how students learn engineering at every developmental level.\r\n\r\nOur approach is that multi-disciplinary team design projects, when effectively mentored\r\nby engineering and education faculty and practicing engineers, will increase students' engineering\r\ncompetency and improve pedagogy in undergraduate engineering. The development of the\r\nmultidisciplinary team design project will be driven by the input of in-service teachers and faculty from\r\nthe College of Education. The engineering content of the design project will come from the expertise and\r\nresources of academic and industrial engineers. The administrators and industrial advisor on the working\r\ngroup will address issues regarding institutional policy and industrial involvement, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe starting point of our development will be the Vertically Integrated Team Design Project\r\nconducted in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Engineering design will be learned by solving an\r\nauthentic engineering problem with a team of education students and engineers at all levels (students\r\n(freshman-senior), faculty, and industrial). Each team will be mentored by faculty members from\r\neducation and engineering, a practicing engineer, and a teacher. In this planning grant activity, four teams\r\nwill include pre-service elementary education teachers as active engineering members. Formative\r\nassessment of the project will be discussed and disseminated by all stakeholders within the working\r\ngroup. t our efforts will proceed at a rapid pace.\r\n",
