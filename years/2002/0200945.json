 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue his work on the interplay between\r\nprobability and algorithms. He has identified two distinct but \r\nvery important aspects of such study. In the first instance he will \r\nstudy randomized algorithms i.e. those algorithms that introduce randomness\r\nas a means of speeding up computation. In the second instance, he will \r\nconsider the average case performance of algorithms. Here, he wants to try\r\nto explain the good performance of simple algorithms on \r\n\"typical\" problems as opposed to the worst-case performance \r\nexemplified by the pathological examples of complexity theory.\r\n\r\nIn the area of randomized algorithms, the investigator will consider\r\nproblems arising in the study of Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms.\r\nIn particular he will study their use in problems associated with \r\ncombinatorial counting problems and with problems in Statistical \r\nPhysics. He will also continue his study of the Edge Disjoint Path \r\nproblem and the construction of a generalisation of the well known\r\nmatrix Singular Value Decomposition to multi-dimensional matrices. \r\nIn the area of average case analysis, he will continue his work on the\r\nTraveling Salesman Problem and try to extend his ideas to the \r\nindependent symmetric model. He will continue his work on analysing the \r\nefficacy of the Sequencing By Hybridization technique in Computational\r\nBiology. Finally, he will continue to work on probabilistic models of the\r\nWorld Wide Web in an attempt to find a useful model for \r\nthe testing of algorithmic ideas.",
