 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a new process for Ta chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  The deposition of TaN and Ta-Si-N films have potential applications in microelectronics, but useful methods for forming them have not been reported.  The reactants will be TaF5 and SiH4.  Calculations suggest that these materials are the simplest commercially available compounds that have favorable thermodynamics for producing Ta metal while avoiding silicide formation.  Films will be deposited over a range of operating conditions and characterization measurements will determine whether Ta metal is being deposited cleanly and uniformly.  Training of graduate students will be the primary educational impact.  The results of this project may have a significant impact on the microelectronics industry.  Tantalum and mixed Ta/TaNx thin films are the leading candidates for diffusion barrier layers, which are essential for advanced interconnect technology based on copper metallization.  The proposed work should also enhance the fundamental understanding of early transition metal chemistry.  The mechanistic implications of the observed kinetics may be useful for subsequently developing an alternating layer deposition technology for the reactants used in this study.",
