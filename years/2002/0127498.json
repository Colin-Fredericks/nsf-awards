 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nBioinformatics is central to biology in the 21st century. The use of computer based\r\nanalytical tools on electronically stored and distributed data is fundamentally changing\r\nlife science research and its application to problems in medicine, agriculture,\r\nconservation, and forensics. In light of this \"information revolution\" undergraduate\r\nbiology curricula must be redesigned to prepare the next generation of informed citizens\r\nand prepare those who will pursue careers in the life sciences. The BEDROCK initiative\r\n(Bioinformatics Education Dissemination: Reaching Out, Connecting and Knitting-\r\ntogether) is enhancing, expanding, and empowering a national community of bioinformatics\r\neducators. The project goals include: 1) Identify and support faculty who can take a\r\nleadership role in bioinformatics education; 2) Highlight and distribute innovative\r\napproaches to incorporating bioinformatics data and techniques throughout undergraduate\r\nbiology education; and, 3) Establish mechanisms for the broad dissemination of\r\nbioinformatics resource materials and innovative teaching models. To achieve these goals\r\nwe are holding a series of faculty development workshops around the country; recruiting\r\nand supporting a group of innovative faculty to implement and disseminate bioinformatics\r\neducation materials; publishing resources for bioinformatics education and building a\r\nnetworked collaboratory environment for developing and sharing bioinformatics\r\neducational approaches. This project builds on the established pedagogical philosophy and\r\nacademic community of the BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium. Specifically,\r\nBEDROCK extends our work in bioinformatics education over the last four years during\r\nwhich we have established a community of collaborators representing the diverse\r\nresources required to mount a national dissemination effort.",
