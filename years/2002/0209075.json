Instead of executing low-level\r\ncode whose sole responsibility is to control a specific piece of\r\nhardware, these future systems will be built in a layered fashion,\r\nwith the core control software surrounded by outer layers of software\r\nthat integrate the core software and the device that it controls into\r\na larger integrated, distributed system of devices and users.\r\nThe key challenge associated with realizing this vision is the need to\r\neffectively apply implementation mechanisms that enable the outer\r\nlayers to share the hardware device without disrupting the actions of\r\nthe time and safety critical core code. The economics of developing\r\nlarge software systems will ensure that most of the outer layers will\r\nconsist of standard, off-the-shelf software components from the world\r\nof laptop, desktop, and server computing. The outer layer software\r\nwill therefore have been developed to use implementation mechanisms\r\nthat are unsuited for use in time-critical control\r\nsoftware. Nevertheless, the core software and the outer layer software\r\nwill need to interact. With standard implementation mechanisms,\r\ninteractions mediated by objects shared with outer layers could easily\r\nlead to unacceptable delays and a loss of real-time control in the\r\ncore.\r\nThe focus of this research is the development and investigation of new\r\ninteraction analysis algorithms that extracts the interaction patterns\r\nbetween the core and outer layers, then uses these patterns to\r\nclassify objects into several categories. Each category can then use\r\nan implementation mechanism appropriate for how it is used in the\r\nsystem. The end result is a system in which the outer layers and core\r\nsoftware effectively cooperate without a loss of safety or\r\npredictability.\r\nThe envisioned analysis has several properties that will make it\r\nsuitable for this application. First, it is capable of extracting a\r\nmeaningful result with an analysis of only part of the program.\r\nSecond, it can effectively analyze the multithreaded programs that\r\ncome from the integration of the outer layers and the core. Third, the\r\npartial analysis is goal-driven to extract the required information\r\nwith an analysis of only those parts of the program required to obtain\r\nthe result.\r\n",
