 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program aimed at understanding the interaction of high intensity, ultrashort pulse laser light with complex systems will be undertaken. The goals are to: 1) study high intensity photoionization beyond the single active electron model; 2) study the role of laser induced resonances in multielectron atoms and diatomic molecules; and 3) develop a unified picture of photoelectron spectra and ion charge-state yields.  In order to accomplish these goals separate but complementary photoionization experiments will be pursued: 1) alkaline earth and alkali atoms at wavelengths from 400 nm to 2000 nm to isolate the role of excited states and core ionization in above-threshold ionization; 2) diatomic molecules from 400 nm to 2000 nm to understand the role of electronic resonances and nuclear degrees of freedom in ionization; and finally 3) noble gas atoms at laser wavelengths near 800 nm to directly compare current measurements with theories of photoelectron kinetic energy spectra.  This work will study the ion yields and electron energy distributions of photoelectrons emitted in strong field ionization of complex systems in order to find a unifying theory of high field processes in atoms and molecules. In addition, wavelength tuning will be used to correlate electron energy shifts with the total number of photons absorbed. This will distinguish between multiphoton absorption from the ground state or excited states. It is expected that this course of study will have a large impact on our understanding of multielectron atoms and molecules in intense laser fields.",
