 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nExercise physiology is fundamental for researchers and majors in health fitness, athletic training,\r\nphysical education, and health education. Not unlike other sciences, exercise physiology\r\ninstruction that provides students with iihands-onl. laboratory experiences creates the most\r\npositive learning climate, leads to a more complete understanding of basic physiological\r\nprocesses, and increases comprehension of scientific principles, concepts and methods.\r\nCurrently, due to lack of metabolic analyzing equipment, the instruction of many exercise\r\nphysiology laboratory activities has been done via more traditional demonstration methods than\r\nfull and active student participation in the exercises themselves. The acquisition of key\r\ninstructional equipment (metabolic analyzer and treadmill) will expand and strengthen the\r\nundergraduate student's experience in exercise physiology and help foster a direct problem-\r\nsolving approach to the learning process in scheduled laboratory sessions, independent research\r\nor other out-of-class projects. The objectives of this project are two-fold: a) to provide expired\r\ngas analyzing instrumentation to enable students to study several fundamental exercise\r\nphysiology principles that cannot be investigated with the current equipment and b) to promote\r\nand encourage active learning and student research opportunities. The improved learning and\r\nresearch resulting from the integration of the requested equipment into the curriculum will\r\nadvance the college's commitment to undergraduate research throughout the academic program.",
