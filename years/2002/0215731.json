 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of power system electromechanical dynamics and oscillations are complex and they are an integral part of most major system disturbances. Understanding these characteristics is essential for preventing catastrophic failures and blackouts. Until now, the complete picture of how the entire US power system behaves during disturbances is not well understood. Any information we have is from computer simulations that are subject to model errors and simplifications. Complete models for nonlinear loads are not available despite the critical roles they play in system dynamics. Most of all, no model could capture the time varying nature of power system operational conditions over long time spans. System frequency (and its rate of change) is one of the most important measures of the electric power system behavior. Individual frequency measurements made so far are meant for limited local use and do not have the accuracy and synchronization necessary for system level analysis.\r\n\r\nThis project proposes to develop instrumentation for a wide-area frequency monitoring network (FNET) with research focus on power system dynamics measurement, analysis, and control. The proposed integrative instrumentation has the following unique features: (1) Phasor Measurement techniques will be used for precise dynamic frequency calculations, (2) Global Positioning System (UPS) synchronized time pulses will drive data sampling and time stamps. (3) Nation-wide system frequency information will be collected from potentially hundreds of sites chosen to satisfy observability criteria. (4) Internet will facilitate continuous data collection and results dissemination.\r\n(5) Measurements will be taken at 110Volt single-phase power outlets with the proposed frequency recording units (FRUs). Here, one crucial innovation is to make measurement at the 1 1OV level to avoid many obstacles in high voltage substation installations. This will reduce overall cost and enable measurements to be made easily and flexibly at many locations.\r\n\r\nThe proposed instrumentation development work includes design and development of a GPS/Internet based frequency monitoring network (FNET) that includes (1) frequency recording unit (FRU) development. (2) information management system (IMS) design, and (3) both real-time and offline data processing algorithm development.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, the proposed FNET will make the global observation of the vast power network behavior possible. New observations from FNET could take the power system research to an entirely new level. A clear understanding of the phenomena will lead to innovative counter-measures against system blackouts, and increased reliability of nation's critical electric power system infrastructure under the deregulated environment. As more understanding of the complex power system dynamics is gained with the help of the first-hand FNET measurement data, it may be possible to devise early warning systems and activate control actions at selected points to damp system oscillations and prevent catastrophic power system failures.\r\n\r\nFNET opens a new window to the \"world\" of large power system behavior. Such information for education and training was never possible before.\r\n\r\n",
