The researchers will undertake a program of engineering research experiences for undergraduates in advanced technology in Japan.  It will focus on structural control, structural health monitoring, innovative materials, etc. for the mitigation of damage to structures when subjected to severe dynamic loading.  The program will support a total of eight students from institutions around the country to spend approximately one summer month in Japan conducting an independent research project that is relevant to their ongoing research in the U.S.  The participants will likely include minorities and women.  The remainder of the summer would be spent at their host institution in the US conducting research activities.  Participants will prepare a paper on their research outcomes and give a short presentation at a colloquium.    \r\n \r\nCurrent research pertaining to these advanced topics in structural engineering would be significantly enhanced through input from creative young minds.  Given the opportunity to participate in research experiences, students discover that they are excited by the challenges they encounter, and intrigued by the innovative ideas and technological advancements brought about by their research.  Research is also an excellent avenue for increasing students' enthusiasm to pursue advanced degrees.  The program will add an international dimension to the development of undergraduate researchers.  The exposure to research excellence abroad and the early experience with international collaboration will greatly enhance the future career opportunities of the participants.  The program will also encourage collaborative research projects and the initiation of new international collaborative efforts in advanced technology.\r\n\r\n",
