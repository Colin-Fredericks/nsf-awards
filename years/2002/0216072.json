 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Astrophysics has developed a very successful model of stellar nova explosions based on a series of reactions in which protons are captured by atomic nuclei and high-energy electromagnetic radiation is released in the form of gamma rays.  The probabilities of these reactions determine the time scale for the stellar explosion events and are unknown in many cases.  The measurement of these probabilities is a prominent research subject at a number of research facilities around the world.  In many of these studies, a high-efficiency gamma-ray detection system would provide a great increase in sensitivity for these measurements.  The aim of this project is to establish an efficient and versatile gamma-detector system which will be used for experimental research in nuclear physics and nuclear astrophysics.  The system will be used at several laboratories (most of which are capable of producing \"exotic\" ion beams) in the United States in conjunction with charged-particle detector systems and spectrometers.  The\r\ncomponents of the detector system will be maintained and calibrated with the help of Undergraduate students at Purdue University Calumet.\r\nThe students will learn essential skills and techniques of modern Nuclear Physics experiments, and will assist in the setup of the detector array in collaboration with researchers at Florida State University, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Michigan State University, and Argonne National Laboratory.\r\n\r\n",
