 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful method for structure determination in organic chemistry. In addition, it is critically important in chemical education, since interpretation of the experiments compels students to confront the details of the structural theory. Over the past decade the development of pulsed Fourier transform (FT) techniques combined with the increased capability of small computers has led to vast improvements in NMR instrumentation. It is essential that undergraduate students at small institutions have some access to this type of analytical equipment. Thus, this project has the following objectives: (1) Convert an operational continuous wave (CW) spectrometer to a pulsed FT-NMR instrument through an Anasazi upgrade (2) Use the upgraded spectrometer to enhance student learning in the organic chemistry laboratory and participation in research in organic chemistry (3) Expand student appreciation and knowledge of chemical concepts through the use of more advanced FT-NMR techniques in the physical chemistry and instrumentation laboratories (4) Make the data from the upgraded spectrometer available through online services (5) Make FT-NMR spectroscopy available to students at the College of New Rochelle. The conversion process retains the durable magnet from the older spectrometer, but transfers instrument control to a computer. The upgrade allows students to obtain hydrogen and carbon NMR spectra, perform spectral editing tasks and produce correlated two-dimensional spectra. Of considerable importance is that students are able to obtain routine spectra rapidly and in a form that is electronically portable. The FT-NMR spectrometer is being used to expand the current laboratory curriculum by adapting a number of experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education. Exposing students to the high level of understanding of molecular structure and dynamic chemical processes offered by FT-NMR is expected to have a profound effect upon their educational experience.\r\n",
