 "awd_abstract_narration": "0228143\r\nWei\r\nThe proposed work will fabricate robust, antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticle films as substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), a sensitive spectroscopic method with unmet potential for label-free chemical sensing.  The SERS activities of the nanoparticle-based substrates will be optimized as a function of interparticle spacing and periodic order.  Initial tests will be performed to recognize 2,4-dinitropohenol (DNP) in gas and aqueous environments and in the presence of several other aromatic compounds as a control for selectivity.  The demonstration of substrates for selective chemical detection of DNP can be immediately parlayed into the development of Raman-based sensors of chemical warfare agents, including explosives, nerve gases, and mustard gases and vesicants.  \r\n\r\nThe structure-activity relationships are based on theoretical considerations alone and have no experimental precedence.  However, the proposed research is hypothesis-driven and addresses both short-term objectives for chemical sensor development and fundamental issues on the plasmonic properties of nanostructured metal films, with subsequent potential for applications beyond chemical and biological sensing.  \r\n",
