 "awd_abstract_narration": "The topic of this conference is the neurobiology of bird song.  Many features of bird song have made it a useful model for research on important problems in behavioral neurobiology and have engaged the attention of researchers on species-typical behavior, communication, behavioral development, central sensory processing, motor learning, sensorimotor control, neurogenesis, and neuronal plasticity.  Recent developments involving anatomical, neurophysiological, neuroendocrine, molecular, and behavioral techniques have further increased interest in the song system.  Because many features of the bird song system also apply to vertebrate brains, studies of birdsong neurobiology have had a major impact on neuroscience research and fundamentally altered concepts of brain function. There has been no conference devoted to this topic during the past decade.\r\n\r\nA Conference on the Behavioral Neurobiology of Bird Song will take place at Hunter College, New York City, on December 12-14 th , 2002. The Conference's objectives are (a) to provide a venue for interaction among several generations of researchers, including both domestic and foreign workers, (b) to present a program of sufficient breadth to reflect major current issues and indicate future research directions, (c) to provide materials for a published volume on the topic, (d) to facilitate participation of and communication among a group of new, young and promising researchers within the birdsong community and (e) to increase ethnic and gender diversity within this important field of neuroscience,\r\nConference participants include individuals who have made some of\r\nthe most exciting advances in the field during the past few years and who are in\r\nthe middle of highly productive careers. Individuals currently at early stages of their careers, who are likely to make significant future contributions to the field will also be participants. The interactions of several generations of excellent researchers are expected to help advance discovery in this field and enhance the training and education of the younger researchers. A volume based upon Conference proceedings will be published, and will have a significant long-term impact upon a broader scientific community. \r\n",
