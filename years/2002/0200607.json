Primary emphasis will rest on  the study of Toeplitz \r\noperators on some function spaces.  The topics to be considered \r\ninclude compact operators ``closely associated with function \r\ntheory'' on the Hardy space or the Bergman space,  bounded \r\nToeplitz operators, algebraic and spectral properties of  \r\ndual Toeplitz operators, Hankel and Toeplitz  operators on \r\nthe Segal-Bargmann spaces  and quasi-invariant subspaces of \r\nthe  Segal-Bargmann spaces. This project focuses on the \r\ncentral problem of establishing the relationship between the \r\nfundamental properties of those operators and analytic and \r\ngeometric properties of their symbols.\r\n\r\n\tThe proposed work involves ideas and problems from \r\noperator theory and complex analysis. Operator Theory  \r\ngrew out of ideas used to study certain partial differential \r\nequations arising in physics,  and became increasingly\r\nimportant with the advent of Quantum Mechanics. There are \r\nat least two reasons for the continuous and increasing \r\ninterest in Toeplitz operators. In addition to differential \r\noperators, Toeplitz operators  constitute \r\none of the most important classes of non-selfadjoint operators \r\nand they are a fascinating example of the fruitful interplay \r\nbetween such  topics as operator theory, function theory, \r\nharmonic analysis and  operator algebras. On the other hand, \r\nToeplitz operators are of importance in connection with a \r\nvariety of problems in physics, probability theory, \r\ninformation and control theory, and several other fields. \r\n\r\n",
