Alexei Sokolov and Christiane Alba-Simonesco lead the US and French efforts respectively.  They will perform experimental studies of polymer dynamics using light and neutron scattering techniques, dielectric and calorimetric measurements.  The investigations focus on dependence of dynamics in polymeric systems, on molecular architecture, pressure, and aging.  The four experimental techniques cover extremely broad frequency ranges and provide a bridge between fast molecular motion and macroscopic properties, between dynamic and thermodynamic quantities in polymeric systems.  The Akron team will perform the light scattering experiments.  This is complemented by neutron scattering experiments at the Institute Laue Langevin and dielectric and calorimetric measurements performed at University of Paris Sud.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses of the US investigators and students.  The CNRS will support visits to the US of the French participants. The program trains graduate students on different techniques at large international facilities.  The collaboration will advance understanding of polymer dynamics in the high frequency range and development of new plastics for high frequency applications in information, computer and communication technologies. \r\n",
