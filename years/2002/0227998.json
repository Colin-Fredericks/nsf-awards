 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed workshop will be held as a part of the International Trends in Nanotechnology conference. The workshop scope encompasses an assessment of the probable impact of nanotechnology research on the deployment of new competitive classes of nanoelectronic circuits based on novel materials, processes and devices.\r\n\r\nIt does appear that by 2016 we will be nearing the end of MOS evolution and that continued progress in functionality-cost ratios will require the invention of replacement technologies. A range of new concepts for devices, fabrication techniques, and system architectures are emerging today under the general heading of 'nanoelectronics' that may eventually provide the basis for continuing the Moore's Law advances in information technologies that we have experienced for the last three decades. A wide range of new ideas have been proposed for post-CMOS technologies, such as molecular electronics, quantum computation etc. Characteristic of any new area, it is difficult to discern which of these concepts has the potential to provide a technological basis for information technologies of the future. This workshop will seek to identify nanoelectronic technologies that have the potential to sustain our tradition of exponential improvements in cost-performance.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will assess the status of nanotechnologies from the long-term (10 years from now) perspective of semiconductor industry applications. It will bring together industry and university researchers to consider the potential of different concepts in nanotechnology and their potential impact on semiconductor industry'. The workshop objective is to explore and develop both short- and long-range strategies for research in nanoelectronic technologies, addressing the long-term needs of the microelectronics industry.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be structured to encourage an active interchange of ideas among participants. Six major nanoelectronics themes have been identified, each of which is to be addressed by a speaker from industry and a speaker from a university. The discussion points and speaker presentations will be compiled and published after the workshop. The desired outcome of the workshop will be to visualize the direction needed to approach the long-term goals of developing nanoelectronic technologies: Where we are and what shall be done today for future nanoelectronics research. Can we think of a \"nanoelectronics strategic plan\" with milestones?\r\n",
