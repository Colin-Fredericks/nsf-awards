Furthermore, the environment immediately around a black hole is a naturally occurring laboratory in which many exotic physical processes will occur and can be studied. Some of the most interesting phenomena are associated with the \"twisting\" and \"dragging\" of space and time due to the rotation of the black hole.  This project will conduct a theoretical exploration of the effect that a spinning black hole will have on its astrophysical surroundings.  This is an extremely timely study since modern X-ray telescopes are already starting to observe such effects.\r\n\r\nTheory suggests that magnetic fields will be crucial for the phenomena associated with black hole spin.  Guided by past work, Dr. Reynolds and his collaborators will split the investigation into three parts.  1) Conducting computer simulations of the gaseous flows (including the magnetic fields) in the vicinity of a black hole. 2) Employing simplifying assumptions and approximations to study the complex behavior of magnetic loops in the region very close to the black hole.  3) Computing predictions that can be directly tested by current and future observations with the XMM-Newton X-ray observatory.\r\n***\r\n",
