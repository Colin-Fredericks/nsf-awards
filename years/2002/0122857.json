 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. William H. Isbell, Mr. Rodrigo Nararrete will \r\nconduct archaeological and ethnohistorical research in Venezuela, collecting \r\ndata for his doctoral dissertation.  His primary objective is to gain a \r\nbetter understanding of the nature and development of complex human \r\nsocieties, focusing on a perplexing Native American example.  Cultures of the \r\nCaribbean region have long been recognized as superb examples of what \r\nanthropologists call \"chiefdoms,\" political systems intermediate between \r\nsimple bands or tribes, and complex state governments.  Indeed, it is \r\nbelieved that the \"chiefdom\" represents humanity's first experiment with \r\ncomplex social organization.  Consequently, if we are to understand the \r\nevolution of social complexity, chiefdoms must be studied and comprehended, \r\nand the Caribbean offers an exceptional laboratory using archaeology and \r\nethnohistory.  \r\n\r\nVenezuela's Unare River Basin is an important area that probably provided an \r\navenue of migration between riverine Amazonian lowlands and the Caribbean \r\nCoast.  It could shed light on debates about differences in social complexity \r\nbetween the Amazonian and the Caribbean culture areas, but early descriptions \r\nof the cultures occupying Venezuela's Unare River are curiously \r\ncontradictory.  Sixteenth and early seventeenth century chroniclers describe \r\ncomplex Carib societies.  But eighteenth century chronicles describe only \r\nsimple cultures like the Cariban Karinas.  How is this to be understood?  \r\nShould these descriptions be considered historically accurate, fostering \r\nquestions about the conditions in which societies experience cultural \r\ncollapse.  Alternatively, do these descriptions reflect changes in the way \r\nEuropeans viewed and described the \"other,\" as well, perhaps, as changes in \r\nthe political goals that colored European perceptions and accounts?\r\n\r\nThe way to definitively resolve this is to compare ethnohistorical accounts \r\nwith archaeological information.  Navarrete has completed a study of the \r\nchronicles.  Funded by NSF he will conduct the first systematic \r\narchaeological survey in the Unare Depression, employing a \r\ntransects-and-shovel-test-pits strategy appropriate for heavily vegetated \r\nenvironment.  The survey is designed to reveal material correlates of social \r\ncomplexity as well as materials correlates of cultural simplification.  The \r\nresults will reveal the history of social complexity in the Unare Basin, and \r\ntheir implications for the ways changes in European philosophy and politics \r\ninfluenced conceptualizations of natives and their social conditions.  The \r\ndissertation will also establish valuable foundations for more comprehensive \r\narchaeological investigations of the Venezuelan past. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
