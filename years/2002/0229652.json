 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Peer Instruction for Student Engagement project is placing peer instructors in selected\r\nintroductory courses in STEM disciplines and measure the impact that their use has on student\r\nengagement with those courses. Departments have chosen courses (i) which students have\r\nhistorically found difficult and (ii) which are either required of majors or from which majors \r\nare normally recruited. To keep costs down, departments were asked to determine how peer\r\ninstructors could be effectively used no more than three hours per week per class. The six\r\ndifferent disciplines use four different models for peer instruction. Geology and Chemistry \r\nare following the Supplemental Instruction model, using peer instructors to provide voluntary\r\nproblem-solving sessions. Computer Science and Biology are following a model already used \r\nby the Computer Science Department in one course, using peer instructors to assist with \r\nsmall-group learning in laboratories and to hold office hours. Physics is adapting a model, \r\nbest known from the University of Washington's Physics Education Group, in which peer \r\ntutors help small groups of students to work, in mandatory laboratory sessions, through \r\ntutorials devised by faculty members. Mathematics is employing a modification of the \r\nPeer-Led Team Learning strategy, combining a web-based homework delivery system with \r\nmandatory problem-solving workshops based around problem sets written by the faculty.\r\n\r\nThe project's two objectives are (1) to increase retention in STEM majors at Radford \r\nUniversity by 15%, and (2) to measure the effect of peer instruction on student engagement\r\nin STEM disciplines. Five different assessment measures are used: retention rates, grades, \r\ncompetency exam scores, surveys and interviews of participants, and the National Survey \r\nof Student Engagement. Each department involved has a department coordinator for the \r\nproject who manages recruitment and departmental training of peer instructors, and who \r\nmeets with peer instructors as a group during the semester. Global training is provided by an\r\nexperienced consultant. The project's co-Principal Investigators are visiting workshops and \r\ntutorial sessions, talking with faculty and students involved, and conducting extensive \r\nassessment of all aspects of the project. The project addresses the NSF merit review criteria.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe primary intellectual merit of this project is the measurement of the impact of peer \r\ninstruction on student engagement with introductory courses in STEM disciplines. Peer \r\ninstruction, especially when combined with small-group work, is considered a prime \r\nstrategy for increasing engagement; this project will determine, through a number of \r\nassessments, the extent to which this is true at Radford University. It will also look \r\nfor differences in results among competing models for peer instruction.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe project improves education using proven techniques while investigating the important\r\nquestion of why those techniques work. Its results, both the expected increase in retention \r\nrates and the measurements of student engagement associated with peer instruction, should \r\nbe of interest to all who wish to increase student learning in STEM disciplines. Peer \r\ninstructors can add diversity to instruction in fields dominated by white males, and all \r\ndepartments participating have indicated that they could hire significant numbers of \r\nfemale or minority students to serve in that capacity. The principal investigators will \r\ndisseminate the project's results both through the web and through the usual outlets \r\nfor publication and presentation.",
