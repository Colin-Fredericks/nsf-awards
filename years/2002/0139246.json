 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Texas A&M University is sponsoring a NSF-Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site for undergraduate research in biochemistry during the summers of 2002 - 2004.  The major goals of this program are to prepare students to pursue graduate training and careers in research and to instill in those students an appreciation of the effort and satisfaction involved in this pursuit.  Students will be trained in a diverse array of modern biochemical methods in a vibrant department, and will develop effective oral and written communication skills to describe scientific projects.  Up to fifteen students will be selected to participate in a 10-week summer program that will coincide with the summer session at the university (typically from the end of May until early August).  Although not strictly limited to this geographical area, we will focus our recruiting efforts on students who have completed their junior or sophomore year at colleges and universities in Texas and mid-Southern states, particularly those from institutions that do not offer doctoral degrees.  Applications from students in underrepresented minority groups are particularly encouraged.  Undergraduate participants will perform cutting-edge research in biochemistry while integrated into pre-existing laboratory groups of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, undergraduate students and technicians.  At the conclusion of the program the students will present their research accomplishments in both written and oral reports.",
