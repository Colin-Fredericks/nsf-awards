The publication and the international symposium will be based on updated information and a substantial amount of additional data that were not available for similar activities in 1997-1998.\r\n\r\nActing on behalf of the U.S. federal agencies participating in AMAP, NOAA will coordinate Federal support for the publications and the symposium.  Other federal agencies are expected to contribute (or have already contributed) $85, 500 for these purposes.  NOAA's Arctic Research Office will arrange transfer of all the contributed funds to the AMAP Secretariat and will oversee expenditure of the funds by the AMAP Secretariat.\r\n",
