The new instruments will serve the following functions:  (1) provide analytical capabilities for rock, mineral, sediment, and soil research; (2) facilitate teaching and applying key concepts in geology, environmental science, and natural resources management courses; and (3) support student training in modern analytical methods.  The powder x-ray diffractometer will permit the identification of different crystalline phases, compositional determinations of solid solution minerals, and the calculation of mineral structures.  The spectroscope will provide bulk chemical compositional data for rock and mineral samples.  This instrument acquisition addresses the need for modern analytical equipment to support NMHU's mission of providing an excellent, up-to-date, undergraduate education within the sciences.  NMHU is a historically Hispanic institution committed to programs that focus on its multiethnic student body (76% minority students), especially the Hispanic and Native American cultures that are distinctive of New Mexico.  This equipment will facilitate student-involved faculty research in a number of regional projects of interest to New Mexico students including the Cenozoic volcanic history of northeastern New Mexico, the sedimentary record of local lakes, and the effects of fires on forest soils and native vegetation.  Given the 76% minority student population served at NMHU and the approximately 40 earth science majors, the instrumentation will positively impact the education and training of underrepresented groups.\r\n***\r\n",
