Wentworth (Johns Hopkins University)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes three research projects in the area of geometric analysis.\r\nThis work will produce new results on rigidity problems in low dimensional\r\ntopology, a better understanding of certain geometric structures on\r\n3-manifolds arising from complex analysis, and a new approach to regularity\r\nissues for a type of minimizing subvariety. The first project deals with\r\nhomomorphisms from fundamental groups of Riemannian manifolds to the mapping\r\nclass group of a compact oriented surface.  Examples arise as monodromy\r\nrepresentations of surface bundles.  Building on previous work in this area,\r\nthe PI will use harmonic map theory to give a new proof of the finiteness\r\ntheorem of Farb-Kaimanovich-Masur for lattices in higher rank Lie groups.\r\nNew results for lattices in rank one groups will be obtained from these\r\ntechniques.  Symplectic Lefschetz pencils also provide especially\r\ninteresting examples to which this method may be applied. The second project\r\nstudies spherical CR structures on 3-manifolds.  The PI will consider three\r\naspects of the subject: uniformizability, rigidity, and compactness.  The\r\nresearch will develop a new approach to these problems based on subelliptic\r\nanalogs of harmonic map equations.  A goal of the work will be to prove a\r\ncompactness theorem which will have implications for new 3-manifold\r\ninvariants. The third part of the proposal seeks to extend the method of\r\nTaubes to prove regularity results for certain calibrated rectifiable\r\ncurrents.  This will provide a clarifying framework for a variety of\r\ngeometric constructions that are of current interest.  In addition to these\r\nnew projects the PI will complete previous work on a conjecture of Bando-Siu\r\nconcerning the Yang-Mills flow on higher dimensional Kaehler manifolds.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most fascinating subjects in contemporary mathematics is the\r\nstudy of spaces of dimensions three and four.  These are also the most\r\nimportant from a physical point of view, since we live in three dimensional\r\nspace, and dynamical behavior takes place in four dimensional space-time.\r\nThe use of analytic techniques to understand the geometry and topology of\r\nlow dimensional spaces continues to be a fruitful avenue of research, but\r\nthere is much work still to be done.  The focus of the PI's research in the\r\narea of the geometry of low dimensions and mathematical applications of new\r\nideas in physics.  \r\n.\r\n",
