 "awd_abstract_narration": "0128140\r\nEttensohn\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of the protein beta-catenin in the nuclei of specific\r\ncells is a critical, early step in the development of multicellular\r\nanimals. In all deuterostomes that have been studied, nuclear\r\naccumulation (\"nuclearization\") of beta-catenin is polarized along one\r\naxis of the early embryo.  Nuclearization of beta-catenin is required\r\nfor mesoderm and/or endoderm formation and the establishment of early\r\nsignaling centers. Despite its fundamental importance in patterning\r\ndeuterostome embryos, the mechanisms that regulate the differential\r\nnuclearization of beta-catenin are unknown. The early sea urchin embryo\r\nis an ideal experimental system for the analysis of this problem. The\r\nembryo is highly transparent, which facilitates analysis of the dynamics\r\nof protein turnover and targeting in vivo using light optical methods.\r\nThe sea urchin system is also unique in that specific cell types can be\r\nisolated from early embryos in large quantities. This critical\r\ncharacteristic means that it is possible to isolate large quantities of\r\nearly blastomeres that have, or do not have, beta-catenin in their\r\nnuclei, and study biochemical differences in the two kinds of cells.\r\nMany of the central molecular components of the beta-catenin pathway\r\nhave been cloned from sea urchin, including several key players that\r\nhave been cloned recently in our laboratory. This powerful combination\r\nof characteristics makes the sea urchin embryo a unique experimental\r\nsystem for the analysis of beta-catenin nuclearization.\r\n\r\nThis proposal tests several specific hypotheses concerning mechanisms\r\nthat regulate the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin during early\r\ndevelopment. To test these hypotheses, a combination of time-lapse, 3-D\r\nconfocal microscopy, manipulation of embryos by microsurgical and\r\nmolecular biological methods, and biochemical approaches will be\r\nemployed. The major questions to be addressed are the following:\r\n\r\na) Do interactions between blastomeres play any role in regulating the\r\npattern of beta-catenin nuclearization during early development?\r\n\r\nb) What is the stability (half-life) of beta-catenin in different cell\r\nlineages at different developmental stages? Does the stability of\r\nbeta-catenin increase or decrease at specific times and in specific\r\ncells?\r\n\r\nc) Is the loss of beta-catenin on the animal side of the embryo mediated\r\nthrough GSK3? If so, are there measurable differences in GSK3 activity,\r\nstability, or abundance along the A-V axis?\r\n\r\nd) What is the spatial distribution of axin, a regulator of beta-catenin\r\nstability, along the A-V axis? \r\n\r\ne) Is the state of the degradation complex different in animal and\r\nvegetal blastomeres?\r\n\r\nThis research project will advance scientific knowledge by elucidating\r\nthe mechanisms of a fundamental process in animal development. It will\r\nalso contribute to the development of human resources through the\r\ntraining of undergraduate researchers, graduate students, and\r\npostdoctoral fellows.\r\n\r\n",
