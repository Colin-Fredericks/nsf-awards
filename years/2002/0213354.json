 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Rotello and co-workers will initially study the effects of redox switching on the molecular recognition properties of a number of small molecules (imide-diaminopyridine dyads).  They will use EPR, NMR, and density functional computational methods to determine the factors that control the efficiency of redox modulated molecular recognition processes.  They will then apply redox modulated recognition process to the controlled formation of supramolecular polymers and polymer networks.  This polymer work will involve development of redox active cross linkers for use in electronically controlled cross linking processes and redox controlled polymerization, both at surfaces and in solution.    \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Vincent M. Rotello of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Dr. Rotello and his students will work on the development of small molecules which can be electrically induced to change their recognition and polymerization properties.  The goal is to prepare materials which can be manipulated to change binding partners electronically or change oligomerization/polymerization state electronically.  The organic based molecular devices developed will have the potential to function as information storage/switching systems in computers or sensors.  Students trained during the course of this interdisciplinary work will gain skills needed by the pharmaceutical, polymer and speciality chemicals industries. \r\n",
