 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symbolic Representation Based Partial Order Methods\r\nS. Purushothaman Iyer\r\n\r\n Symbolic representations are used in analysis of finite and infinite\r\nstate concurrent system.  However, they could be subjected to\r\nconstraint explosion much like state explosion in analysis of finite\r\nstate designs of concurrent systems.  The reason for both of these explosions\r\nis the consideration of all interleavings, of a concurrent system, during their\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nPartial-order techniques depend upon the notion of independence among\r\nactions to avoid considering all possible interleavings.  The  proposed\r\nresearch will investigate the notion of unfolding, which aids both in\r\ndiscovery of independent actions and in succinctly representing the state\r\nspace of systems.  In particular, the proposed research will address the \r\nfollowing topics:\r\n\r\n o How to build unfoldings for real-time automata as available, for \r\n      instance, in the tool-set UPPAAL.\r\n\r\n o Implementation of an unfolding-based partial order method for UPPAAL.\r\n\r\n o A comparative (theoretical) investigation of unfoldings and current partial\r\n      order methods, with a view to generalizing unfoldings to other infinite\r\n      state systems.  \r\n \r\n o Empirical evaluation of the proposed implementation against current\r\n      practices.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will aid in faster, and more complete, analysis of\r\ninfinite state concurrent systems than is currently possible.\r\n",
