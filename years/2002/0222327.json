This work \r\nis a collaborative effort between geophysicist Ed Garnero and two \r\napplied mathematicians, Anne Gelb and Rosie Renaut.  This effort will \r\ntrain two graduate students in a cross-disciplinary approach between \r\nthe fields of applied math and seismology. While 3D images of Earth's \r\nmantle have come in clearer focus over the last 25 years, many \r\nchallenges remain, most notably because of incomplete data coverage. \r\nInversions of seismic data require smoothing and damping that \r\neffectively blurs resulting images.   The investigators are motivated \r\nto better resolve the gradients and shapes of seismic velocity \r\nheterogeneity since they relate to temperature and/or compositional \r\nchanges in Earth's interior. The project will employ the following \r\ntwo methods.  (1) Data reprocessing and inversion methods: \r\ndeconvolution methods will be used to intelligently preprocess \r\ndifferential travel time computations. Inversion may also be improved \r\nby regularization through a total variation type penalty term. (2) \r\nImage reconstruction methods: apply the Gegenbauer reconstruction \r\nmethod for high resolution post-processing reconstruction, which has \r\nproven effective for removing Gibbs oscillations without compromising \r\nthe finer image features even near jump discontinuities in other \r\napplications, such as magnetic resonance imaging. The tasks can be \r\nsummarized as follows.  (1) Pre-inversion processing: travel time \r\nseries cleanup evaluated for blind and knowledge-based deconvolution, \r\napproximated from structural models of the Earth's interior.  (2) \r\nInversion experiments: determine effectiveness of a total variation \r\nregularization model, particularly in conjunction with the impact on \r\npost-inversion processing. (3) Post-inversion processing: sharpen \r\nimages through removal of artifacts with the Gegenbauer \r\nreconstruction method. (4) Assess solution images with data: data \r\nfrom geographical regions with best data coverage will be analyzed \r\nand modeled to test solution structures.\r\n",
