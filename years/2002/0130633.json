 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current scenarios of predicted environmental change raise fundamental\r\nquestions about the expected responses of animal populations to changes in\r\nlocal climate and food availability.  Animal responses to environment are\r\nmediated by physiological functions such as metabolism, digestion, growth\r\nand reproduction.  Using parallel simulation modeling and experimental\r\nstudies in the laboratory and in nature, the PI will investigate the effect\r\nof food availability on reproduction in the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus\r\nhorridus) in northwest Arkansas.  Rattlesnakes are excellent subjects for\r\nthese studies because of their abundance and large size which allows the\r\nuse of radio-transmitters (for location and body temperature information).\r\nThe simulation model is based on information about energy flow through\r\ntimber rattlesnakes discovered under a previous grant (IBN 9728470).  New\r\nstudies will build upon and complement previous work.  A laboratory\r\npopulation of snakes will be maintained under three feeding regimes\r\ndesigned to produce variation in reproduction.  In nature, an experimental\r\nfood manipulation will test model predictions by comparing reproduction\r\nbetween supplementally fed and control groups of radio-tagged female\r\nrattlesnakes.  Information gathered from these experiments will be used to\r\ntest previous predictions made by the simulation model, and then to refine\r\nand improve the simulation.  The results of this study will enhance our\r\nability to predict the responses of animal populations to environmental\r\nchange.  The described studies will also provide multiple opportunities to\r\nenhance science literacy and involve students (from grade school to\r\ngraduate school) in the process of science. \r\n\r\n",
