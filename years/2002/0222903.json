 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite many advances in the visualization community over the past decade,\r\neffective and efficient representations for three-dimensional flow fields are still elusive.\r\nMany techniques show promise, but do not represent a complete picture of\r\nthe flow.\r\nThis project  consists of a systematic investigation of the current\r\ntechniques, their advantages and disadvantages, research and analysis of combined techniques which complement each other, and research into new techniques.\r\nCognitive analysis and user studies will be undertaken to investigate existing research. Many of these techniques, including those of the PIs, proposed a method of representing or rendering a flow\r\nfield, with little selfexamination of the limitations towards garnering a true understanding of the flow\r\nfield.\r\nSeveral of these techniques have obvious limitations, but present an improvement over\r\nthe dearth of any good techniques for three-dimensional flow visualization. By\r\ncombining several techniques appropriately, more improvements can be\r\nmade. \r\nAre these improvements sufficient? What combinations work and which ones do not?\r\nThese questions will be investigated and quantified in this research.\r\nFinally, we will ask: How can new techniques be developed that will overcome some of these\r\nlimitations?Our subjective understanding of the field allows us to propose several\r\navenues of investigation. These include an-isotropic volume renderings, embedded\r\nwith flow differentiators; schematic texture algorithms for opaque and semi-transparent stream\r\nsurfaces; level-of-detail models for representing the flow; multi-resolution representation\r\nof underlying features; and new representations that provide a more meaningful context\r\nfor the flow.\r\nThis research will greatly aid computational scientists across many disciplines: computational fluid dynamics scientists, environment scientists, atmospheric scientists, computational geological scientists and biomedical researchers.\r\nA primary component of their research is the investigation or simulation of natural phenomena.\r\nThis phenomena is generally dynamic, leading to complex and interesting flow fields. For\r\nthree-dimensional computations, effective tools to understand, represent and convey these\r\nflows are lacking. This research will provide a firm foundation for research in this area, as well as lead to new algorithms offering a much clearer representation for flows.\r\n\r\n",
