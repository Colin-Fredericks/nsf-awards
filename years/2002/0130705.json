Gao-Adaptive Neurally-Inspired Computing:  Models, Algorithms, and Silicon-Based Architectures\r\n\r\nRapid advances in silicon technology over the past few decades have allowed digital\r\ndevices to achieve ultra-high speeds in numerical computation. However, a majority of\r\nthese devices are prone to catastrophic failure when confronted with circumstances\r\nunforeseen at programming time. Endowing such devices with the ability to adapt and\r\nlearn from experience is rapidly becoming a problem of fundamental importance in\r\ninformation technology. We propose a new approach to solving this problem: building\r\ninformation technology systems based on neurobiological computation and learning.\r\n\r\nWe intend to achieve this goal by developing computational models of plasticity and information processing in neurons and networks of neurons in selected sensory and motor areas of the brain; testing these models and their corresponding algorithms in software-based simulations, and designing real-time implementations of these algorithms in silicon using synapse transistors and field-programmable learning arrays (FPLAs).\r\n\r\nWe expect our research to provide a better understanding of computation within neuronal\r\nnetworks, and to lead to a new generation of adaptive neuromorphic devices that could be\r\nused for a variety of information technology applications, ranging from signal processing\r\nand pattern recognition to ubiquitous computing and robotic control.\r\n",
