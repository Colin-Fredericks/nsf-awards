 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe investigator attempts to classify square-integrable tamely ramified \r\nrepresentations of split  reductive p-adic groups G and their inner \r\nforms, by means of homomorphisms from the tame Weil-Deligne group into \r\nthe dual group of G. This project is part of the local Langlands \r\nconjecture for such groups. The representations are partitioned into \r\nfinite sets, called ``L-packets\". The method is a p-adic analogue \r\nof Lusztig's Jordan decomposition for finite reductive groups. \r\nFrom a functorial point of view, the tame L-packets are bijective \r\nlifts of unipotent L-packets for quasi-split groups and their inner \r\nforms. Properties of the L-packets, such as formal degrees \r\nand Whittaker models, will also be investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymmetry is an effective way to study mathematical and \r\nphysical objects. A Group is a collection of symmetries, and \r\nRepresentation Theory is the study of how these symmetries manifest in \r\ndifferent ways. As a simple example, there is a group of sixty \r\nsymmetries consisting of permutations of five objects, and this group \r\nalso manifests as the sixty symmetries of an icosohedron, and of the \r\nfullerene molecule. The investigator studies certain infinite groups of \r\ninfinite dimensional symmetries. In the past forty years, \r\nmathematicians and physicists have guessed that there may be deep \r\nrelations between such symmetries and fundamental, as yet undiscovered, \r\nproperties of numbers. The investigator attempts to confirm part of \r\nthese conjectures, and make them more explicit. \r\n\r\n",
