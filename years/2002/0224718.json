 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Virtual Proving Ground Simulation will focus unique capabilities and facilities for vehicle system simulation at the University of Iowa and electromechanical system simulation and design at the University of Texas at Austin on the goal of creating fundamental new capabilities for virtual proving ground simulation of complex vehicle and equipment systems, including off-road equipment, hybrid-electric vehicles, and next-generation enhanced vehicle mobility and vehicle power systems.\r\n\r\nThe I/UCRC will create and make available to its members an internationally unique virtual proving ground using (1) state-of-the-art networked computing facilities for high fidelity engineering simulation, (2) the National Advanced Driving Simulator at Iowa for driver-in-the-loop virtual proving ground simulation, and (3) unique capabilities at UT-Ausgtin, including access to facilities at the Center for Electromechanics.  With these assets and significant extensions to be developed in the proposed research program, the I/UCRC will support its members with internationally unique modeling , analysis, and virtual prototyping capabilities for simulation of complex vehicle and equipment systems.\r\n\r\n",
