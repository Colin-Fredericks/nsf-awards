 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experience of providing or receiving medical care has a very\r\npersonal dimension.  Quoted from the Hippocratic oath:\r\n\"Whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my dealings with\r\nmen, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will never\r\ndivulge, holding such things to be holy secrets\".  The 1996\r\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)\r\nrequired the Administration to issue regulations protecting the\r\nprivacy of health information. Such a regulation gives consumers\r\nthe right to see, copy, and correct their own health information\r\nand the right of being notified as to how their health\r\ninformation is going to be used and shared. It also imposes new\r\nrestrictions on those who hold health information.\r\nHowever, legal protection alone is not enough as it can only be\r\napplied after the problem has occurred, when the damage has\r\nalready been done. Moreover, law enforcement is usually\r\nexpensive, slow, and complex.  The goal of this project is to\r\ndesign a comprehensive technical infrastructure that guarantees\r\nthe enforcement of health information privacy protection.  The\r\nproblem of data protection and privacy is addressed on a\r\ntechnical level, thus preventing any violation of a privacy\r\npolicy in advance rather than correcting it after it has\r\noccurred.  The intend of the project is to demonstrate that\r\nhealth information privacy solutions can be designed to achieve\r\nmeaningful benefits without penalizing society with undue\r\nfinancial burdens or worse, with the compromise of public safety.\r\n",
