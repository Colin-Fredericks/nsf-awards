Iterative methods for the \r\nsolution of linear and nonlinear systems of equations play an \r\nincreasingly important role in the numerical simulation of physical \r\nphenomena. Preconditioning is the key for significant improvement of the \r\nperformance as it allows one to find a path between Scylla of expensive \r\nfactorizations of direct methods and Charybdis of slow convergence. The \r\nrecent surge of activity in computational biology creates new \r\nopportunities for iterative methods. As an example, the protein folding \r\nproblem involves predicting the native state of a protein.  This is \r\naccomplished by minimizing a complex energy function.  Global \r\noptimization methods for solving this problem employ iterative methods, \r\nbut computational limitations have restricted the application of such \r\nmethods to small proteins (fewer than 100 amino acid residues). High \r\nperformance computing is one avenue researchers are taking.   The \r\nprotein folding problem is only one of a great many applications that \r\ncan use iterative methods to solve them.  Some of the specific topics \r\ntargeted at this meeting are:  applications (with new emphasis on \r\ncomputational biology), domain decomposition, preconditioning, parallel \r\nmethods, nonsymmetric solvers, nonlinear systems and eigenvalue solvers, \r\nmultilevel methods, Krylov methods, interdisciplinary research, student \r\npapers, and open problems. \r\n\r\n     The International Association for Mathematics and Computers in \r\nsimulations (IMACS) International Symposiums on Iterative Methods in \r\nScientific Computing are meetings that have been held regularly since \r\n1988. The investigator and colleagues organize the sixth such meeting. \r\nThe conference is dedicated to providing an overview of the state of the \r\nart in the use of iterative methods with an eye to contributions of the \r\npast, present and future. The emphasis is placed upon identifying future \r\nresearch directions in the mainstream of modern scientific computing. Of \r\nparticular interest are talks on interdisciplinary research, open \r\nproblems, and applications, particularly in computational biology. A \r\nspecial issue of the IMACS Journal Applied Numerical Mathematics is \r\ndevoted to the meeting. \r\n",
