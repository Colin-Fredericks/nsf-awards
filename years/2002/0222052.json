 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spoilage and pathogenic bacteria affect the quality and safety of fresh produce such as strawberries and mushrooms.  The surfaces of these products can be naturally contaminated with molds such as Botrytis cinera and bacteria such as E. coli O157:H7.  For many years foods have been treated with antimicrobial agents however, packaging materials may also provide the same benefits using similar or different additives.  A packaging system that allows for slow release of an antimicrobial agent into the produce could significantly increase the shelf life and improve the safety of fresh produce.  The use of these packaging systems is not meant to be used as a substitute for good quality control standards.  It can, however serve as an additional protective measure to help ensure safe and high quality foods.",
