 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant increases in the number of engineering and related technology graduates from the Utah State System of Higher Education will be required over the next several years to advance the intellectual and economic well being of the state and its citizens. In response, the State Board of Regents has developed an Engineering and Computer Science Initiative within the state system of higher education with intentions to double the number of graduates in engineering and related technology majors by the year 2006. The faculty within the College of Engineering believe that efforts to improve retention, and to increase enrollment opportunities for students from underrepresented minorities, will contribute significantly toward that goal. Central to this effort is an increase in the number of scholarship opportunities available to engineering students within each of the 5 departments in the College of Engineering. For each year of the four year duration of this project, 30 need-based scholarships at $3,125 each are being awarded. The scholarships allow students to spend more time on academic pursuits, and less time employed outside the University. Scholarship recipients must: 1) be U.S. citizens, 2) enroll full time within the College of Engineering, 3) demonstrate financial need as defined by the U.S. Department of Education rules for Federal Financial aid, and 4) show academic potential or ability. Recruitment is done through the USU Office of High School/College Relations, the Multicultural Student Center, and the College of Engineering. In addition to traditional recruiting methods, the college recruits through its annual Engineering State program, a four day event held each spring in which approximately 250 high school juniors from throughout the State of Utah are introduced to the opportunities available in the various fields of engineering. In addition to scholarship opportunities, the program also provides CSEMS scholars with: 1) a formal program through which they can receive academic assistance and advising, 2) a mechanism to promote interaction with upper-division students and faculty on a regular basis, 3) research opportunities with faculty mentors, and 4) early access to co-op/internship opportunities and industry mentors. The CSEMS program is directed by faculty members from the College of Engineering and staff from High School/College Relations, the Multicultural Student Center, and USU Career Services.",
