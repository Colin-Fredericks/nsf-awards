 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in superconductors on the nanometer scale has made strong headway in recent years, evidenced by the observation of scores of new physical phenomena and the publication of several intriguing theoretical predictions. The latter include negative Josephson coupling that results in pi-junctions, and therefore, half-flux quantum and novel vortex states, in conventional s-wave superconductors, a metallic state of Cooper pairs, and the Berry's phase in mesoscopic systems. This individual investigator award supports a project that will seek out these predicted physical phenomena, through innovations in sample fabrication and measurement techniques. At the same time the project will pursue its educational goals, including undergraduate and graduate student training as well as public outreach with an emphasis on attracting more women and minorities to science.  The discovery of new physical phenomena and the development of novel techniques in sample fabrication will have a broad impact on nanoscale technologies.\r\n\r\nIn order to maintain the impressive growth in the semiconductor industries such as seen in the computer, telecommunication, and e-commerce sectors, alternatives to the traditional technology need to be developed.  It is recognized that new technologies operating at the nanoscale will become increasingly important.  Within this context, research in superconductors on the nanometer scale has made strong headways, evidenced by the observation of scores of new physical phenomena and the publication of several intriguing theoretical predictions.  This individual investigator award supports a project that will seek out the novel physical phenomena predicted by theory.  At the same time the project will pursue the educational goals of student training and public outreach with an emphasis on attracting more women and minorities to science and engineering.  The discovery of new physical phenomena and novel techniques in sample fabrication will have a broader impact on nanoscale technologies.\r\n",
