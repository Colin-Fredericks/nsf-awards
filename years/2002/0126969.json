 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\nFaculty in the Colleges of Science and Education at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) have been working collaboratively for three years to address problems of student achievement and retention in first semester courses in Chemistry, Biology, and Physics. Through this work they have recognized the need to improve the design of course, curriculum, and alignment of course components. This project is now entering a phase where further development is likely to have benefits for a number of universities in the US. We are engaged in (1) conceptualizing a \"Curriculum Design Model\" (CDM) to serve as a framework for the development of instructional modules; (2) applying this CDM to the development and trial of 5 prototype instructional modules in chemistry, biology, and physics; (3) evaluating the CDM in terms of student achievement in these 5 modules, improved student motivation, and stronger student interest in science; (4) institutionalizing a process of faculty professional development; and (5) designing, running, and evaluating undergraduate peer leader training. \r\nThere are three main design features of the CDM for introductory science courses, summarized as:\r\n1. \"Less is more:\" Faculty should cover the most important topics in greater depth, emphasize relationships between core concepts, and design instructional activities to give learners practice in representing their understanding of core concepts. \r\n2. \"Scaffolding learning:\" Novice learners cannot be expected to direct their attention to core concepts in a discipline, rather, they require extensive guidance from faculty to deepen their thinking and understanding. Curriculum should be designed to provide a \"scaffold\" on which to promote this kind of learning.\r\n3. \"Peer learning:\" The learning environment should allow and encourage students to engage in mutual discussion in order to construct and deepen their own conceptual understanding. \r\n\r\nThe modules and this instructional practice are being field tested with Florida Atlantic University and Palm Beach Community College students. Based on the evaluation of these field tests, the Curriculum Design Model is being refined, and further development of the prototype instructional modules undertaken. Mechanisms for extensive collaborations have been established with community colleges in the area through the Region V Area Center for Educational Enhancement, which is a local office of the Florida Department of Education. \r\n",
