 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0221825\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study focus is to consider the range of dissolved organic matter (DOM) release processes exhibited by marine phytoplankton species, to describe how these processes regulate and couple to the cycling of fixed carbon and nitrogen species in the surface ocean, and to model, based upon both controlled laboratory and field experiments, the interactions of these chemical species between phytoplankton trophic structure, community succession and senescence as mediated by viral lysis, micro and macrozooplankton grazing and bacterial heterotrophy. A series of hypotheses, involving the production and consumption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (DON) compounds, will be tested on each of a series of manipulable culture experiments and a program of seasonal cruises in both estuarine Chesapeake Bay and coastal upwelling dominated Monterey Bay as contrasting physical systems. Modeling objectives include a mechanistically informed simulation of field and culture experiments capable of descriptive and predictive insight as to DOC and DON composition, molecular weight and bio-availability as a function of trophic structure and complexity. Associated educational activities will be centered around highlighting the current research efforts of this multidisciplinary investigation in the context of public education programs coordinated by the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences Mini-School program. This existing course development program has intensive participatory and outreach components and proposes to expand the opportunities of the pubic to learn about how contemporary scientific issues such as biocomplexity in marine environmental systems are being approached by research scientists.\r\n\r\n",
