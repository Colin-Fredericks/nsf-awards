 "awd_abstract_narration": "The class of microbes known as the macronuclear ciliates are instrumental in telomere research because its members have macronuclei that contain hundreds of thousands of linear gene-sized \"mini-chromosomes\" that have telomeres at both their ends. Electron microscopy of macronuclear chromatin has shown that these chromosomes are organized into rosette structures in which the telomere ends are anchored in a central core structure while the DNA of the macronuclear chromosomes form large loops. The X-ray crystal structures of two different macronuclear telomere complexes from Oxytricha nova show that its two-subunit telomere end binding protein (OnTEBP) can form two distinct macromolecular assemblies with telomeric single-stranded DNA. One is a protective a:b:ssDNA end-capping complex involving both the a and b subunits of the protein and the other is a dimeric (a:ssDNA)2 complex that can link telomeres together. These structures have led to a model of how the two OnTEBP complexes can mediate the condensation and decondensation of macronuclear chromatin through the formation of telomere anchored rosette structures. This project examines the role of the (a:ssDNA)2 dimer in the formation of higher-order telomere complexes. The experiments will use a multi-disciplinary approach to measure the kinetics and thermodynamics of DNA binding to OnTEBP complexes, elucidate the structural basis for the DNA dependent dimerization of the OnTEBP a subunit, and determine the role of (a:ssDNA)2 dimers in the formation of the a:b:ssDNA end capping complex. The results will increase our understanding of the structure and dynamics of macromolecular complexes at telomeres.\r\nTelomeres are the protein-DNA complexes that protect the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes from recombination and degradation. Telomeres are required for proper cell growth and viability. This research project focuses on the protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions found at telomeres and the manner in which larger complexes formed via telomere-telomere interactions are assembled. The results will provide insights into how the genetic integrity of chromosomes is maintained in cells.\r\n\r\n",
