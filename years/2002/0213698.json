 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual merit. Numbers of nonindigenous species--species introduced from elsewhere - are\r\nincreasing rapidly worldwide. They are a major cause of biodiversity loss and environmental\r\nchange, and are estimated to cost the US $137 billion/yr. The 2001 National Invasive Species\r\nManagement Plan (www.invasivespecies.gov) highlighted the urgent need for more rigorous and\r\ncomprehensive risk analysis frameworks for nonindigenous species so that prevention and\r\ncontrol strategies can be targeted appropriately. The central public policy consideration is how\r\nmuch of society's resources should be expended in response to nonindigenous species, and how,\r\nfor example, should it be allocated between prevention and control? These considerations,\r\nthough, include a nexus of interacting ecological and economic factors that require\r\ninterdisciplinary effort. Species invasions are caused by economic activities, and in turn affect\r\neconomic activities. This ecological and economic linkage and feedback means that the\r\nassessment of risk interacts with the management of risk, which contradicts the common notion\r\nthat risk assessment and risk management are independent. Social welfare and risk assessment\r\nare both determined jointly by ecological and economic processes.\r\nIn response to the need for interdisciplinary risk analysis, this project brings together\r\nexperts from invasion biology, mathematical modeling, and economics. The main goal is to\r\ndevelop and apply a bio-economic modeling framework for nonindigenous species that\r\nintegrates risk assessment and risk management, includes uncertainty distributions, and\r\noptimizes prevention and control strategies in a landscape context. The overall bio-economic\r\nmodel uses Stochastic Dynamic Programming, which allows the investigators to incorporate\r\necological-economic feedbacks in such a way to optimize combinations of prevention and\r\ncontrol strategies to maximize social welfare. This framework will be extended to the landscape\r\nscale with Neural Network models.\r\nThe applications will focus on freshwater nonindigenous species in the Great Lakes\r\nregion. A preliminary application to zebra mussels suggested, for example, that society should\r\nbe spending about $240,000/yr to keep zebra mussels from invading each lake with a power\r\nplant (to prevent fouling of pipes). This is in sharp contrast to the $825,000 that the Fish &\r\nWildlife Service spent in FY2001 for prevention and control efforts for all aquatic nuisance\r\nspecies for all lakes. Our analyses will be directly relevant to policymakers and natural resource\r\nmanagers.\r\nBroader impacts. The investigators will partner with the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago to\r\neducate schoolchildren and the public about the general problem of nonindigenous species, about\r\nwhat individuals can do to reduce the problem, and about the role that science plays in public\r\npolicy decisions. By partnering with an educational software firm, they will convert research\r\nmodels into user-friendly formats for use by schoolchildren, the public, policymakers, resource\r\nmanagers, and stakeholders. In partnership with the Great Lakes Commission, research methods,\r\nresults, and user-friendly products will be disseminated in workshops to policymakers, managers,\r\nand stakeholders. Finally, they will develop international collaborations and a reciprocal\r\nexchange of information and techniques with top researchers in Australia, where NIS research is\r\nadvanced relative to North America.",
