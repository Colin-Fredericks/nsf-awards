 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Greater Washington Educational Telecommunications Association (WETA) in partnership with BBC2 and the Open University, is producing ten half-hour television programs that explore the reality of scientific discovery.  In each episode, five scientists who have been abandoned on a deserted island solve science-based challenges using only their collective expertise, wits, the island's resources and a few basic tools.  In one episode, for instance, the scientists will need to:  1) calculate their location with the exact latitude and longitude, 2) create insect repellant, and 3) design and build a homemade radio.  The programs capture both the disappointments of experiments that go wrong as well as the joy and excitement of success.\r\n\r\nThe television series will be supported by \"Rough Science Adventures,\" field experiences where members of the public solve challenges similar to those facing the scientists in the television program, and by a Rough Science website.  Outreach partners include the New York Hall of Science, the National Society of Black Engineers, and the International Educational Technology Association.\r\n\r\n",
