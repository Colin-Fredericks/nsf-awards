 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most thrust fault traces are arcuate in nature and are comprised of a series of\r\nsalients and recesses suggesting that thrust faults are, in general, non-planar.  Such three-\r\ndimensional complexities in the thrust surface geometry may be an important factor\r\ncontrolling the thrust fault kinematics. Consider the analogy of glacial ice flowing over\r\nan irregular substrate.  The major resistance to movement is not due to the friction\r\nbetween the two materials (which is greatly reduced by pressure-melt water that coats the\r\nsurface) but due to the distortion of the ice as it flows past surface irregularities. Thrust\r\nsheets may behave in a similar manner.  Fault rocks are considerably weaker than the\r\nhost rock and, therefore, the continued deformation of such rocks may not be the factor in\r\nlarge-scale thrust sheet emplacement.  The PI suggests that three-dimension irregularities in\r\nthrust surface geometry play a major role in thrust sheet kinematics.  If this is the case,\r\none should expect that the strain patterns observed along strike of a given thrust fault will\r\nreflect the thrust fault geometry.  Preliminary studies have shown that both c-axes\r\npatterns and relict grain shapes vary along the strike of the fault most likely due to the\r\nfault geometry effects. Initial data suggest that deformation is nearly plane strain\r\nwithin a prominent salient; but along the margins of the salient there is a stronger\r\ncomponent of flattening strains. However, further examination of the strains in this\r\nregion are needed to truly resolve this pattern.  Three-dimensional finite strain geometries\r\nhave been determined in this region by measuring relict quartz grain shapes and\r\nexamining quartz c-axes fabrics.  Moreover, it may also be useful to measure final stage\r\nincremental strains by determining three-dimensional recrystallized quartz grain shapes\r\nand three-dimensional quartz overgrowth geometries.  It is only through examining\r\nincremental strain histories that the PI can fully understand the kinematics of thrust faults.\r\nNevertheless, current mechanical models do not take into account the existence of\r\nnon-plane strains and therefore only predict realistic fold-thrust belt behavior to a first-\r\norder.  In order to make more realistic models for the evolution of fold-and-thrust belts\r\nwe must start to incorporate the non-plane strain elements of geometrically complex\r\nthrust faults.\t",
