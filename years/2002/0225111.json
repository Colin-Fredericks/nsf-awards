 "awd_abstract_narration": "A National Science Foundation grant has been awarded to San Diego State University Field Station Programs (FSP), under the direction of Ms. Sedra Shapiro, Drs. Claudia Luke and Kathy Williams to develop a wireless web-based community to integrate research, education and technology. Funding will be used to create a wireless telecommunications network and install an array of sensing devices at the Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve (SMER) sixty miles north of San Diego. Our mission is to support research, education, and university teaching through the collecting, sharing and understanding of environmental data. The Field Station reserves serve as foci for interdisciplinary work and relationship building among scientists, students, regional managers, community groups, and decision-makers.  SMER will serve as a model system for environmental observation that collects and shares data from various scientific disciplines using novel data collection methods. With improved understanding, scientists and FSP staff will be able to better inform policy makers, natural resource managers, and the general public on how to address these, and other critical questions. New technologies allow us a whole new way of conducting environmental science with wireless sensor technology linked into a high-speed Internet backbone providing scientists with a new resource to monitor, probe, explore, and understand our ecoregion. Completely new things can be measured; completely new insights are inevitable. Development of a wireless communication network and automated sensor arrays within a remote field station will feed into major collaborations with other NSF-funded environmental data acquisition and distribution projects, such as ROADNet  (Real-time Observatories, Applications, and Data management Network), under the direction of Scripps Institute of Oceanography's (SIO) PI, John Orcutt; and HPWREN (High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network), under the direction of the San Diego SuperComputer Center's PI, Hans-Werner Braun and SIO's Frank Vernon. Existing partnerships and collaborations along with the SDSU FSP personnel ensure success of this novel project. \r\n\r\nCurrently, a fledgling network of Internet-accessible telecommunication facilities at SMER has attracted widespread interest from environmental and technology researchers, educators, and natural resource managers. Data collected by the FSP is non-proprietary and will be made freely accessible through the Internet. While the current system generated interest and collaborations, and provided basic biotic and abiotic information, new funds will be used to meet rising demands for a reserve-wide network. To achieve project goals, instrumentation to expand the SMER wireless network region or \"communications bubble \" allowing researchers to collect and share real-time data from novel sensor technologies on 65% of the 1760 ha SMER reserve. Additionally we will deploy a series of sensor arrays that collect hydrographic and meteorological data at strategic locations within the reserve. Collecting and sharing these data sets through real-time wireless streaming of data is important in that these types of data are frequently used by a wide community of researchers, can be important for education and outreach, and are significant environmental factors for real-time monitoring of water and air in our national quest for improved security and homeland defense. \r\nThis project will benefit researchers, educators, students, and habitat managers, who may integrate their data with non-proprietary real-time and archived ecological data from SMER or elsewhere. This activity bridges the gap between environmental and technological research by establishing an extensive in situ sensor and telecommunication network. SMER will be a model site and living laboratory for ecological observation with emerging technologies benefiting environmental research being proto-typed at SMER. A novel aspect of this project, in addition to new data collection capabilities, is the broad interest by collaborators in assessing potential uses of wireless technology by the scientific community as a whole. The broader impact of this project will increase access to ecological data and support novel learning strategies for expanding educational uses. With an increasingly diverse undergraduate student population nation-wide, we must aggressively meet the challenge of increasing diversity of the Science, Math, Engineering, and Technology (SMET) workforce by improving preparation of ALL students. SDSU graduates one of the most diverse student bodies in higher education. These data sets will also be used in K-12 and community education.\r\n",
