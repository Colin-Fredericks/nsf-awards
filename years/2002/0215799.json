This international conference features talks by some of the most successful women in computing, technical presentations on topics of current interest, as well as panels, workshops, and technology innovation forums for an in-depth look at new issues in computing.  This grant provides travel and registration funding for approximately seventy-five people in computing and related fields who otherwise would not be able to attend.  The grants are awarded to advanced undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of GHC is to encourage women to pursue and stay in the field of computer science by providing support for young women before they leave the pipeline.  By providing opportunities for them to attend GHC, they are exposed to women who are creating, improving, and studying advanced computer related technologies and sciences.  GHC is an unusual conference that focuses strongly on women in computing and is an excellent venue for worthwhile interactions to develop between those established in the field and others early in their careers.  This grant is expected to directly affect the careers of the attendees and to help to reverse the current trend showing declining numbers of women in computing.\r\n",
