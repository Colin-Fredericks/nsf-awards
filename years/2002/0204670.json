 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adequate numerical treatment of nonlinear phenomena\r\ngoverned by partial differential equations with several disparate\r\nscales is a formidable computational challenge.  Modern algorithms\r\nshould be able to resolve fine scales for certain physical\r\nquantities without overresolving others, thereby optimizing the\r\ncomputational effort and making realistic 3d simulations\r\nfeasible.  Epitaxial and crystal growth in materials science, and\r\nviscous incompressible fluids are typical yet quite distinct\r\nexamples addressed in this proposal.  The goal of this project is\r\nto design, test, and analyze reliable and efficient adaptive\r\nfinite element methods for such problems, with space-time error\r\ncontrol and based on refinement/coarsening mesh modification.\r\nThis project blends quite delicate analytical and computational\r\nissues, and applies them to free boundary problems, constrained\r\nproblems, geometric PDE and the Navier-Stokes equations of\r\nincompressible fluids.\r\n     Scientific computing has joined theory and experiment to\r\nform together the three central aspects of scientific inquiry.\r\nThe current strengths in computational mathematics draw on the\r\nwidespread acceptance of computational modeling as a complement\r\nto, and even a replacement for, physical tests in a broad number\r\nof fields.  In this vein, the investigator develops reliable and\r\nefficient computational tools that may be useful in several areas\r\nof strategic importance such as nanotechnology, materials\r\nscience, and high-performance computing.  This project is a\r\ncollaborative endeavor, involving a number of scientists in the\r\nUS and abroad, as well as several students and postdocs.  A\r\nsubstantial effort is devoted to education and human resource\r\ndevelopment.\r\n",
