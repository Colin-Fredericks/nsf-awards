 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is developing an expanded set of features and functionality of a mathematical visualization program, 3D-Filmstrip. Project tasks include writing appropriate documentation, not only for the software itself but more importantly for the mathematical objects it is used to visualize; improving the scriptability of the program, both to enhance its ability to communicate with other running programs (e.g., web-servers, database programs, etc.) and also to facilitate the automation of its use as a curriculum supplement; producing additional format interchange software, so that objects created using 3D-Filmstrip can be further processed and viewed in other programs (e.g., Mathematica, Maple, VRML) and vice versa; and improving the cross-platform features of the program, in particular making more of its features available over the Web. Several pilot integrations of the program into the mathematical sciences curriculum are taking place at various educational levels. This work is also informing the writing of two sets of undergraduate level \"Lecture Notes\" tightly coupled to 3D-Filmstrip, one on the theory of curves and surfaces, and the second on lattice models.",
