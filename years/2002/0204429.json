 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cluster computing systems are becoming increasingly popular for\r\nproviding cost-effective and affordable computing environments for a\r\nrange of applications (such as databases, data mining, visualization,\r\ncollaborative computing, and high performance computing).  These\r\napplications require four fundamental communication services from the\r\nunderlying communication subsystem: point-to-point communication,\r\ncollective communication, synchronization, and Quality of Service\r\n(QoS).  Modern Network Interface Cards (NICs) for clusters incorporate\r\none or more programmable processors, DMA channels, and large amount of\r\nmemory. The NICs are becoming faster, smarter, and intelligent and are\r\nbeing designated as Active Network Interfaces.  Research is proposed\r\nalong the following directions to take advantage of such active\r\nnetwork interfaces for implementing and delivering scalable\r\ncommunication services for next generation clusters: 1) Using\r\nmulti-CPU NICs and their architectural features to provide fast\r\npoint-to-point communication, 2) Designing NIC-level support for\r\nhigh-performance and scalable collective communication and\r\nsynchronization, 3) Taking advantage of programmable NIC-level\r\nfeatures to provide QoS support, and 4) Experimentally evaluating the\r\nbenefits of the new/enhanced communication services for a wide range\r\nof applications using message passing programming model.  Through\r\nextensive theoretical, experimental, and simulation studies, NIC-based\r\nsolutions are planned to be designed, developed, implemented, and\r\nevaluated for clusters with Myrinet and Gigabit Ethernet\r\ninterconnects.\r\n\r\n",
