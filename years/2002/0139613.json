Specific goals of the investigations of this system are to provide quantitative information on the nature of the bonding at the vanadia-support interface.  The methods by which the identity of the support influences the strengths and redox properties of V-O support bonds will be studied.  Reactivity of the catalytic surface will be characterized through a study of kinetic parameters for elementary surface reactions involved in the selective oxidation of alcohols.  The model catalytic systems studied will consist of vapor deposited vanadia films supported on the surfaces of metal oxide single crystals.  Surface sensitive spectroscopic techniques including high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), among others will be used to characterize the catalytic surface and the chemical species on the surface.  Supported metal oxides are used industrially for a variety of chemical processes including selective oxidations and the catalytic reduction of NOx, and this study may lead to improved methods for the production of catalytic materials.\r\n",
