 "awd_abstract_narration": "MODULAR TOWERS AND THE IGP OVER THE RATIONALS: Often researchers use\r\nalgebraic relations in two variables x and y over a field to describe\r\nsignificant data. Some examples are sets of values x having an (x,y)\r\nwith entries in the field that satisfy the relation. One of these is the\r\nDavenport's problem of determining equivalence classes of polynomials\r\naccording to their value sets over finite fields. Describing complex\r\nmultiplication fields, generated by those x with (x,y) a special\r\nelliptic curve torsion point, is a variant. A relation with a data\r\nvariable x produces a permutation group G: The Galois group. The\r\ninvestigator treats these as cases of the Inverse Galois\r\nProblem (IGP). One goal is to decide, from certain lists\r\nof relations, if some have the rational numbers as definition field.\r\nSerious group theory helped solve Davenport's 1965 problem and Schur's\r\nexceptional polynomial problem (1919; see below). Further, modular\r\ncurves reveal complex multiplication to be a version of Schur's\r\nproblem. Having command of all finite simple groups has many\r\napplications. One is to list those groups attached to exceptional\r\npolynomials. Knowing many characters of Chevalley groups showed Thompson\r\nand Voelklein where to find series of solutions to the IGP. Yet, it will\r\nrequire more than massive group theory to solve the whole IGP. The\r\ninvestigator uses Modular Towers, a modular curve generalization, to\r\nfinesse unknowable group classifications. He and his students let a\r\nknown group G, and a prime p dividing the order of G, seed the base level\r\nof a Modular Tower. Higher tower levels code relations with mysterious\r\ngroups covering G related to p. Coherent maps between the tower levels\r\nreplace details on these intricate covering groups. Work of Y. Ihara and\r\nJ.P. Serre inspire showing that Modular Towers has many properties of\r\ntheir special, modular curve, case. For example, high tower levels for a\r\nG with no Z/p quotient should have no rational points. For certain groups G, \r\nand the prime p=2, this extends Serre's program on spin structures. The \r\ninvestigator applies new spin-like structures to all cases when p is 2 and \r\nto all primes p. \r\n\r\nPRACTICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND IGP OVER FINITE FIELDS: Modern cryptosystems\r\naim to secure electronic transfers of data. Exceptional functions act as\r\npermutations on infinitely many finite fields. A special case of the\r\nInverse Galois Problem over finite fields asks how to construct\r\nexceptional functions. These scrambling functions look simple. Users can\r\neasily apply them (up to 1993, all came from the 19th century). Still,\r\nfinding them has been difficult. Fried (UCI), Guralnick (USC) and Saxl\r\n(Cambridge) nearly classify them. This solves old problems (Dickson 1896\r\nand Carlitz 1965). They also produce unexpected new examples. Their best\r\ndiscovery is that exceptional polyomial Galois groups (excluding now\r\nwell-understood cases) have the affine geometric property. This is\r\nuseful for it gives the degrees of exceptional polynomials. Yet, it is\r\nalso a difficult challenge: There can be no final description of all\r\naffine groups. The investigator with A. Mezard approaches affine groups\r\nby generalizing to all algebraic relations over finite fields\r\nGrothendieck's famous results for tame relations. Applications for\r\nexceptional functions alone include ways to manipulate data for\r\nencryption and to assure integrity. This will mean faster, more\r\nefficient and accurate file back-ups; more stable software; and more\r\nsecure data transfers.\r\n\r\n",
