 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Year of Algebra 2002- 2003 at the University of Florida \r\nis highlighted by the celebration of the 70th birthday of John\r\nG. Thompson.  The general theme of the Year of Algebra is provided \r\nby the wider context of Thompson's monumental contributions: the \r\nbeauty and power of group theory, and how it applies to problems of\r\narithmetic via the basic principle of Galois. The Year of Algebra \r\nfeatures a conference in Galois Theory (Nov. 3--9, 2002), a conference\r\nin Group Theory (March 9--16, 2003) and a workshop on Computational\r\nAspects of Algebraic Curves, and Cryptography (March 9--15, 2003).\r\nThe Galois conference centers around the Inverse Problem of Galois\r\nTheory, one of the major open problems of mathematics. The conference\r\non Finite Group Theory has speakers involved in the completion/\r\nrevision of the Classification, as well as speakers in Representation\r\nTheory, and applications of Finite Groups to Finite Geometries and\r\nother areas. The workshop deals with interactions between modern \r\ncomputational tools/questions and the theory of algebraic curves,\r\nemphasizing the application to public key cryptography. It has a \r\nstrong instructional component (mini-courses).\r\n\r\nGroup Theory is the abstract study of symmetry patterns (of any\r\nobject), and Galois Theory provides tools for applying Group Theory\r\nto algebra and arithmetic. Recent applications to data security\r\n(public key cryptography) are the topic of the workshop. Galois \r\nTheory and Group Theory have further applications to physics, \r\nchemistry and coding theory. The Year of Algebra provides an\r\nopportunity for young mathematicians, women and minorities to \r\nlearn the latest advances.  It was John G. Thompson who shaped \r\nfinite group theory like no-one else, leading the way towards a \r\nmajor milestone of 20th century mathematics, the classification\r\nof finite simple groups.  After the classification, it was again\r\nJ. Thompson who led the way in exploring its implications for\r\nGalois Theory.  For these contributions, Thompson has recently\r\nbeen awarded the National Medal of Science. He also won the Fields\r\nMedal, the highest honor in mathematics. For the Year of Algebra,\r\nUniversity of Florida Graduate Research Professor John G. Thompson\r\nacts as an advisor. His powerful ideas continue to inspire the young.\r\nWe want to use this opportunity in a special effort to integrate\r\nresearch and education during the Year of Algebra. While the two\r\nconferences emphasize latest advances in research, the workshop \r\nhas a strong instructional component.",
