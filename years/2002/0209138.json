 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses an important set of questions arising\r\nin optimization of industrial systems for network design,\r\ndata classification, facility location, and scheduling.\r\nA fundamental problem arising in all these areas is called\r\nset covering.  Set covering problems range from easy to very\r\ndifficult and it is the more difficult ones that form the focus\r\nof this research.  The problems studied are approached through\r\nrigorous and mathematical methods.\r\n\r\nThis research studies several approaches to the design of\r\nalgorithms for set covering problems arising in the areas of\r\nnetwork design, facility location and data classification, mostly\r\nbased on mathematical programming techniques.  The focus\r\nis on the study of complexity and approximability of set covering\r\nand its extensions in network design and classification, including the\r\ndesign of general algorithmic techniques and the analysis of\r\nmathematical programming formulations and relaxations.  A special\r\nemphasis is made on set covering problems defined on directed\r\ngraphs, which is an area where very few results are available in\r\nthe literature.\r\n",
