 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for the development of computational tools for\r\nsimulating very large-scale problems involving granular flow.\r\nRather than use a continuum model of a granular material (which\r\ninvolves a large number of assumptions and approximations about the\r\nway they behave), rather we look at the computational challenges in\r\ndiscrete element models.\r\nThese are challenging large-scale problems with thousands to millions\r\nof grains that have to be simulated.\r\nDirect interactions are usually between touching grains.\r\nHowever, one grain can not only affect the others that it touches, but\r\nthose will affect their neighbors, and so on.\r\nFurther, the network of interactions is dynamic.\r\nIndeed, the overall pattern of interactions can become very\r\ndifferent depending on the circumstances: if a sand table is shaken,\r\nthen most of the sand grains will be independent; when the grains\r\nsettle, each grain will be touching many others.\r\nIn order to efficiently organize the computational tasks, we need to\r\nuse techniques from graph or network theory.\r\nThese tools include graph partitioning techniques, graph coloring\r\ntechniques, and new techniques for handling the collisions of grains.\r\nSince the problems are very large scale, currently available\r\ntechniques often have to be adapted from dealing with small-scale\r\nproblems to deal with large-scale problems.\r\nFurthermore, since the network of interactions is dynamic, these\r\ntechniques have to be adapted to use information about the previous\r\nnetwork in order to efficiently obtain the corresponding information\r\nabout the new network.\r\nIn this project, we will be developing these tools and drawing\r\ntechniques from graph theory, continuous optimization, complementarity\r\ntheory, and computational geometry.\r\n\r\nGranular materials are materials made of small, relatively hard\r\nobjects that collide off each other.\r\nSand, breakfast cereals, talcum powder, and a box of marbles are all\r\nexamples of granular materials.\r\nUnderstanding these materials and simulating their behavior directly\r\nis difficult because the position and velocity of each of the\r\n``grains'' in the material needs to be tracked and updated as they\r\nmove and collide.\r\nIn order to do this well, we need high-performance computers, and we\r\nneed to use them well.\r\nThe crucial problem is to understand the nature of the interactions\r\nbetween the grains, and to develop automatic tools that can determine\r\nhow to divide the computational tasks so that they can be tackled\r\nefficiently on high-performance and parallel computers.",
