Unfortunately, many middle school and high school \r\nteachers in Tennessee do not know enough about engineering or the engineering \r\neducation process to prepare their students adequately for the rigors of engineering \r\ndegree programs.  Together with the University of Tennessee (UT) College of Education, \r\nthe UT freshman engineering engage program is proposing to develop and test novel \r\nmethods of educating secondary science teachers about these topics, and to thereby \r\nincrease the quantity and quality of students entering engineering degree programs. \r\n \r\nA pilot program will bring preservice science teachers from the UT College of Education will spend ten hours each week learning firsthand about engineering education by working in engages Physical Homework class.  Participants will also take a Special Topics course in Education in which they will be encouraged to apply the knowledge that they gain from their science education experiences in engage to the secondary science classroom.  At the end of the year, faculty members from both Education and Engineering will evaluate the pilot program to determine whether or not it would be an effective way to increase the engineering content in the existing preservice science curriculum. \r\n \r\nThis program leverages facilities and expertise from two different colleges to work on the \r\nproblem of science teacher preparation.  This problem is one of actual preparation as the \r\nrole of the College of Education and from the College of Engineering, a customer of \r\nscience preparation.  This program puts the best resources of teaching pedagogy and \r\nunderstanding applied science together to improve and educational resource. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
