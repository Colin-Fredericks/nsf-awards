 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wide band gap GaN-based semiconductors are attracting increasing attention due to their importance in modern electronics. The applications of GaN necessitate the controlled modification of its fundamental electronic properties, in addition to the availability of high quality material.  \r\n\r\nThe spectral response of the GaN-based photovoltaic detectors is generally limited by the large  absorption coefficient at high energies  and the small minority  carrier diffusion length. Recent design changes,  to overcome these limitations, include the use of p-i-n instead of p-n junction [1-4], substitution of GaN by AlxGa1-xN [1-3] or semitransparent recessed windows [2], and a back-illuminated  detector configuration [3]. However, a tuning of  fundamental  (Al)GaN properties, to boost the performance of  III-Nitride devices, was never directly considered. \r\n\r\nThe innovation in this proposal is to significantly enhance a photovoltaic detector performance by tailoring the minority carrier diffusion length in (Al)GaN. The diffusion length is a crucial parameter for the detector quantum efficiency and photoresponse. \r\n\r\nThe underlying concept is defined by the PI.s recent findings [5-8] that electron injection into p-(Al)GaN from the application of an external voltage in a solid state device--p-n junction or  Schottky  barrier-increases  the  critical  minority  carrier  diffusion  length  and  lifetime. Consistent changes were observed in other material properties, including luminescence and spectral photoresponse, and were attributed to charging of deep metastable Mg-acceptor-related centers [6].  \r\n\r\nThe practical significance of this research is a long-term (days), revolutionary (up to an order of magnitude!) performance  enhancement for (Al)GaN-based photovoltaic detectors, achieved through short time (at most 1500 sec) electron injection. This is because the increased diffusion  length  improves  minority  carrier  collection  and  eliminates  the  \"dead space\",  where carriers recombine before they are collected.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed project is of high  risk,  since  it  must  be  determined  whether  the  novel electron injection-induced effects in p-(Al)GaN  [5-8] are universal in nature and represent a fundamental property of the p-type material, or if instead they depend on the material's quality, growth, and processing  conditions.  If, indeed, the effects  are universal, a high pay off  will  be manifested in a development of this novel and  simple approach to revolutionize photovoltaic detector  performance  by manipulating  the  material.s  transport  properties,  which  will  likely  be used in combination with design and technology improvements. \r\n\r\nSuccess  in  this  SGER  application  will  lead  to  the  implementation  of  this  approach  in commercial detectors, and will advance the frontiers of this technology for use in other bipolar devices  for  which  the  diffusion  length  is  critical  (transistors,  thyristors)  [6].  It  is  planned  to submit a GOALI proposal (with Corning) based on success of this project. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this research will be a dipper understanding of electron transport in GaN  and related compounds, the integration of  research with education, and partnership with industry.  \r\n",
