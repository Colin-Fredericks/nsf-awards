 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on problems in q-series and partitions.  \r\nThere are five separate parts of this work.  The first part \r\nconsiders research tied to applications of the construction \r\nof representations of Lie algebras.  Next the investigator \r\nlooks at new q-series methods related to special problems in \r\nnumber theory.  The third part discusses applications of the \r\nOmega software package (http://www.uni-linz.ac.at/research/\r\ncombinat/risc/software/Omega/) which is being developed by \r\nthe investigator in collaboration with colleagues at Linz. \r\nThe focus in this latter section is on mutli-dimensional \r\npartitions.  The fourth section is devoted to the study of \r\nBailey chains and a consideration ofhow recent discoveries of \r\nthe investigator may lead to new applications of this concept. \r\nThe proposal concludes with consideration of three major unsolved\r\nproblems in the theory of partitions: (1) the Friedman-Joichi-\r\nStanton conjecture, (2) the Borwein conjecture and (3) the \r\nOkada conjecture.  Each of these three conjectures has been \r\naround for some time.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this proposal put succinctly might be: Building \r\nbridges from partitions and q-series (two intrinsically deep and \r\ncharming but sometimes rather introverted topics) to several \r\nbranches of mathematics and science. The first two sections are \r\ndevoted to relating this work to representation theory and number \r\ntheory, two branches of mathematics; in each instance, it is clear \r\nthat this interaction will not only enrich the object fields, but \r\nalso will provide new insights for partitions and q-series.  The \r\nwork on the Omega package has great potential.  Here the \r\ninvestigator and his collaborators have found numerous instances \r\nwhere research discoveries have gone from being unthinkable to \r\neasily reached.  The possible applications to multi-dimensional \r\npartitions should lead to insights in combinatorics and, \r\nhopefully, the combinatorial aspects of physics. The work on \r\nBailey chains in the past has had profound impact on statistical \r\nmechanics in physics.  The more this method is advanced, the more \r\nwe may expect these mutually beneficial applications to continue.  \r\nThe final section on three unsolved problems appears, at first, \r\nto be a purely internal study.  However, as has often happend \r\nin the past, whenever new methods are discovered to solve really \r\nhard problems, there is almost always a spillover into vital \r\napplications. \r\n",
