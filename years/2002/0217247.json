 "awd_abstract_narration": "POWER SHIFT:  A Proposal to Augment the Performance of Girls in SMET Studies\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the mission to educate children and families, encourage\r\ncreativity, and challenge all learners in new and innovative ways, the Maine Discovery\r\nMuseum plans out-of-school-time programs that will increase competence in science and\r\nmathematics and promote technological fluency for middle school students. With the\r\npassage of a landmark initiative by the 119th Maine State Legislature that equips all 7th\r\nand 8th grade students with laptop computers, MDM plans programs that will expand the\r\nuse of laptop computers beyond the school day, encourage parent involvement, and\r\nconvey fresh ways of learning and teaching math and science. With a history of\r\nproviding exhibits and educational programs that are based on recognized learning\r\ntheories and that accommodate a wide-range of learning styles, we have an excellent\r\nopportunity to implement project-based activities that encourage creative problem\r\nsolving, social interaction, and group communication. We believe these program\r\ningredients, along with staff development workshops that focus on gender equity issues,\r\nwill foster improved achievement and greater participation by females in SMET\r\nprofessions.",
