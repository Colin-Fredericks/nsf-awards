 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two years of support are being requested if at all possible. The reason for this is \r\nbecause it is necessary to complete several key steps before submission as a regular \r\nproposal.  The first summer is to prepare papers for presentation and/or appearance in \r\nconferences and/or journals.  During the ensuing academic year, the intellectual content \r\nof this potentially controversial material will be circulated for comment, both publicly in \r\ntalks and privately among colleagues.  Based on the feedback received, the ideas put forth \r\nwill be modified and corrected. Only then does it make sense to use the following \r\nsummer to involve an undergraduate student in implementing the salient features of the \r\nproposed work for both a greater depth of understanding and demonstration purposes.  \r\n  By this point in time, that would mean there should be preliminary results \r\nappearing in print, with supporting documentation on the web explaining this material.  \r\nIn addition, more capable assistive computing technology will be available by then (to \r\nhelp me overcome my hand disability), so that I might be able to more actively \r\nparticipate in the implementation details of that work.  When all of this is readily in place, \r\nthen it will be possible to submit a competitive regular proposal.",
