 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this Career award to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign to study light-gated synthetic ion channels to control transmembrane currents.  With this award, Professor Mary Gin will synthesize cyclodextrin-based channel scaffolds after regiospecific modifications.  Modified cyclodextrins with a trapped pH sensitive dye will be embedded in homogenous lipid vesicles of approximately 25nm diameter.  Ion transport activities of these lipid vesicles will be determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity changes in the dye.  The planned studies are expected to result in the development of sensors; time released drugs and improved water purification systems.  The educational component of the award is to assist students in Elementary Organic Chemistry courses, and to provide graduate and undergraduate students with hand-on experience in organic synthesis and modification of bioderived materials.  \r\n\r\nLight-activated synthetic ion channels will be prepared from regiospecific-modified cyclodextrins and embedded in homogenous lipid vesicles with uniform diameter.  Changes in fluorescence intensity of a pH sensitive dye trapped in these modified cyclodextrins will be utilized to measure ion transport activities of these synthetic ion channels.  Sensors, time released drugs and improved water purification systems would be some of the potential applications coming out of these studies.  In addition, this Career award will increase assistance to students in Elementary Organic Chemistry courses, and will provide them with research opportunities in organic synthesis and chemical modifications of bioderived materials.",
