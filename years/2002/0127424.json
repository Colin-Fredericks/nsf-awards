 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)\r\nComputer simulation is an ideal tool for understanding the complex effects of a variety of physical and geological processes that interact to influence landform evolution over extended periods of time (centuries, thousands of years, millions of years). Yet simulation models and the visualization of their results usually require specialized software that is not easily accessible to undergraduate education. This proof-of-concept\r\nproject is developing a web-based interactive landform simulation model that can be accessed anytime and anywhere via a standard web browser to improve undergraduate students' learning experience of landform evolution. This web-based interactive model is employing a cellular automata algorithm and is implemented using Java technology, which is designed to run on different computer hardware and operating systems. Students are able to interact with the model by selecting and manipulating different parameters (such as precipitation intensity, degree of surface runoff, rock erodibility, tectonic movement, etc.) through a Graphical User Interface and observe how different combinations of processes (parameters) influence the landform evolution. This project integrates the latest technology into undergraduate education to improve both teaching and learning. Because of its global potential in web based dissemination, it has the ability to reach a wide and diverse audience, including underrepresented populations in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology, non-traditional students, and students with learning disabilities. In addition, it enables the investigators themselves to refine their own skills in the new and promising area of 3D\r\nvisualization on the web, which is beneficial to their own teaching and research.",
