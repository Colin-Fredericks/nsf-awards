 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collaborative research and education relationship among Purdue University, University of Minnesota, and Xerox Corporation is being formed to engage in the high risk and high payoff task of developing new theoretical perspectives for sensing and control for the 39 billion on-demand printing industry.  The charge of the industry-university research team is to develop fundamental understanding of the sensing and control issues for digital color xerography and to develop practical and theoretically sound control systems that expand the operation envelop of printing systems while producing consistent, high quality prints in a predictable manner.  Our approach will 1) use existing models of human visual perception in control analysis and synthesis, 2) exploit process elements to maximize sensing and actuation opportunities, 3) use the principle of coordination to achieve the final performance objectives, and 4) exploit the transformation between spatial and temporal system representations.  The methodology and control-centric system approach developed by this endeavor will significantly improve the image quality of digital color xerography.  This technology will help propel the industry to a new era and maintain the competitive edge of the U.S. short-run and office printing industry.  The control strategies and design methodologies will be applicable to other printing and imaging systems, such as inkjet, image scanners and microscopy.",
