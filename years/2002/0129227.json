Gordon\r\n\r\nThe Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas \r\nat Austin will host the 2002 Spring Topology and Dynamics \r\nConference. Now in its 36th year, this is the largest annual \r\ntopology conference in the US. It has a broad scope that \r\nencompasses set-theoretic and general topology, continuum\r\ntheory and dynamical systems, geometric group theory and \r\ngeometric topology. It thus provides a unique forum for \r\nresearchers in a wide range of disciplines within topology. \r\nThere will be eight invited plenary one-hour lectures of a semi-expository nature, given by leading researchers in the \r\nareas covered. There will also be twenty invited half-hour \r\nlectures, together with 15-minute contributed talks, held in\r\nfour parallel sessions. The invited speakers have been \r\nselected with the help of an advisory committee of experts \r\nin the various subfields.\r\n\r\nTopology is one of the major subdisciplines of mathematics, \r\nand, at just over a hundred years old, the youngest. It \r\noriginated with Henri Poincare around 1900, who introduced \r\nit as a means of describing the qualitative behavior of \r\ncertain physical systems (for example, our solar system),\r\nwhose complexity renders a precise quantitative analysis \r\ntoo difficult.  The wide range covered by the subject today \r\nis well represented by the Conference. General topology deals \r\nwith the abstract properties of topological spaces; set-theoretic\r\ntopology impinges upon the logical foundations of mathematics. \r\nThe study of dynamical systems is close to Poincare's original motivation, and deals with the behavior of various iterative \r\nprocesses. These often give rise to complex objects, continua,\r\nwhich are studied in their own right. Geometric topology \r\ndeals with manifolds, objects which are locally like \r\nn-dimensional Euclidean space, but whose global structure \r\nmight be quite complicated. For instance, there is a lot \r\nof current activity in 3-dimensional topology, whose goal is\r\nessentially to describe all theoretically possible \r\n3-dimensional universes. Rich connections have recently \r\nbeen discovered between this subject and quantum physics, \r\nwhile on the other hand topological techniques from the \r\ntheory of knots in 3-dimensional space have recently \r\nbeen applied to the study of DNA. Finally, geometric \r\ngroup theory, a relatively new subject, studies groups, \r\nwhich are algebraic objects, from a topological point of view; \r\nthis is leading to deep connections between topology and \r\nalgebra. The interaction at the Conference between workers \r\nin all these different branches of topology is expected to \r\nbe very fruitful.\r\n",
