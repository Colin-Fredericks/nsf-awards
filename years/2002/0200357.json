 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research component of this proposal involves two overall\r\ntopics, which the P.I. has been investigating in the past few\r\nyears. The first is the study of random objects such as random\r\ngraphs, random matrices and random walks. This study is one of the\r\ncentral topics in modern combinatorics with vital connections\r\nseveral fast developing areas such as theoretical computer science\r\nand statistical physics. The P.I. and his colleagues consider\r\nseveral open questions about various models of random graphs, \r\nwith the main focus on random regular graphs. They also attack \r\nseveral problems on random walks on graphs and the spectra of \r\nrandom matrices. Some of these questions have high potential in \r\npractice and are very exciting from the computer science point of \r\nview. For instance, one of the key questions of the proposal is \r\nto find a fast algorithm to generate a random graph. The second \r\ntopic of the proposal  is additive theory. Here the P.I. considers\r\nquestions about the length of the longest arithmetic progression \r\nin various sum sets. For instance, a typical question is the \r\nfollowing: Given m integers from 1 to n, what is the length of the \r\nlongest arithmetic progression obtained by the partial sums of \r\nthese integers. He also studies a fundamental problem about thin \r\nbasis, which went back to a problem posed by Sidon more than sixty \r\nyears ago. Here is a sample question: What is the smallest density \r\nof a set P of primes so that every natural number can be \r\nrepresented as a sum of at most 100 elements of P ?\r\n\r\nRandom objects such as random graphs and random walks have been\r\nwidely used to model real-life processes for a long time (think of\r\nthe movement of a particle, for instance).  The newest and perhaps \r\nmost exciting example is the Internet graph, which has been \r\nmodelled as a random graph where the number of connections to each \r\nnode (site) satisfies certain laws. Therefore, the study of random \r\nobjects is not only theoretically challenging but also has high \r\npotential in practical applications. A large part of the P.I.'s \r\nwork is to develop a better understanding of random graphs to \r\nanswer very fundamental questions such as \"how does the graph \r\nexpand ?\" or \"how does the graph change if more edges\r\n(connections) are added ?\" or \"how to simulate a random graph by\r\ncomputers\". Despite their simplicity, these questions have been\r\nopen for many years and their answers might require the development\r\nof entirely new ideas and methods. The second part of the P.I.'s\r\nwork deals with classical questions in number theory, motivated by\r\nresults and questions of great mathematicians such as Waring,\r\nErdos, Freiman and Sidon. The work in this part would lead to a\r\nbetter understanding of the additive properties of natural\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n",
