With respect to traditional systems, \"by-wire\" systems require complex control and diagnostic strategies to guarantee proper vehicle behavior and to prevent system malfunctions.  A significant roadblock for safety-critical by-wire systems is the realization of a robust fault-diagnostic strategy that can be accomplished quickly and with limited or no additional hardware.  \r\n\r\nThis project addresses these issues in three stages: 1) through the use of physically based system models to understand interactions and dependencies among subsystems in a complex system; 2) with the design of residual generator units that can locally diagnose faults in components, sensors and actuators; and 3) using a hierarchical structure that links components, systems, and subsystems through the use of fault propagation digraphs. The fault propagation digraph contains a hierarchical representation of available knowledge about the characteristics of fault propagation within the system. Each level in the hierarchy contains one or more structures that together represent a view of the system under a particular granularity. The granularity of view increases with levels. Thus as one traverses down the levels of the model, the resolution of view increases. If a high resolution of diagnosis is not required, failure analysis may be confined to the upper levels of the hierarchy, thereby preventing a slowdown of the diagnosis due to excessive detail. \r\n",
