 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to promote student understanding of tandem chromatography-spectrometry as a problem-solving technique that takes advantage of methodology common to all sciences, to discourage student compartmentalization of chemical ideas, to facilitate student understanding of structure-property relationships, to increase student access to modern instrumentation, to improve faculty collaboration, and to effect evolution in the chemistry curriculum to include more problem-based laboratory activities. These objectives are being accomplished by implementing the same instrumental technique in multiple courses throughout the strata of the chemistry curriculum. Thus, all chemistry majors and most biology majors are using the LC/MS in courses over multiple years covering several of the sub-disciplines of chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe Department is using the liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometer to adapt and implement exemplary laboratory experiences originally developed at Duquesne University. Adaptation of other laboratory experiments and projects from the educational literature are also being implemented. These adapted experiments and projects are being implemented into at least seven project-based laboratory courses, including Organic Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, General Chemistry, Biochemistry, and undergraduate research in both Chemistry and Biology. The enhanced project-based laboratories are aiding students make connections across the sub-disciplinary boundaries of chemistry.\r\n\r\nOnce this project is fully implemented, nearly 200 Millikin University undergraduate students will feel its impact each year.\r\n\r\n",
