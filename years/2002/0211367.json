The underlying motivation for the project is to gain\r\na better understanding of how spatial effects can threaten or\r\nmaintain biodiversity or affect interactions between important\r\ntypes of organisms such as crops, pests, and biological control\r\nagents.  The project is focused primarily on edge-mediated\r\neffects in habitat fragments and on the effects of nonrandom\r\ndispersal.  The main goal is to gain insight into the ways that\r\nedge-mediated effects and dispersal behavior influence the\r\npersistence or extinction of species.  Understanding edge-mediated\r\neffects is important because one of the most significant ways in\r\nwhich humans alter natural environments is by fragmenting\r\nhabitats and thus creating edges.  The investigators study many\r\nspatial effects, including edge-mediated effects, via\r\nreaction-diffusion models.  However, reaction-diffusion models\r\nassume random dispersal, and the dispersal patterns of some\r\norganisms are affected by behavioral responses to the presence of\r\nprey, predators, or conspecifics.  Reaction-diffusion equations\r\ncannot capture those effects, so the investigators model them\r\nwith more general forms of quasilinear parabolic partial\r\ndifferential equations.  The investigators use methods and\r\nresults from the theory of partial differential equations,\r\ndynamical systems, and nonlinear functional analysis to develop\r\nthe mathematical framework needed to analyze the models.\r\n     The investigators study mathematical models for the ways\r\nthat plant and animal populations are affected by the size and\r\nspatial structure of the environment they inhabit and by the way\r\nthey move or spread through the environment.  The goal of the\r\nproject is to gain a better theoretical understanding of how\r\nspatial effects influence the persistence or extinction of\r\npopulations.  The underlying motivation is to provide insights\r\ninto the impact of spatial effects on biodiversity and on\r\neconomically important organisms such as crops and pests.  The\r\npotential practical benefits of the project are improvements in\r\ndecision making in areas such as land management, conservation,\r\nand urban planning.  Much of the project is focused on the\r\neffects of habitat edges, because one of the main effects of\r\nhuman activity on the environment is to divide it into fragments\r\nand create edges, for example by building roads.  Different\r\norganisms respond to edges in different ways; for example, a new\r\nroad may isolate a population of one species of animals that\r\nrefuse to cross it but may add to the mortality of another\r\nspecies of animals that do attempt to cross.  When population\r\ninteractions such as predation by one species upon another are\r\ncombined with spatial effects, the results can be complex and\r\nsometimes counterintuitive.  To understand them the investigators\r\nderive mathematical equations that incorporate spatial effects\r\nand population interactions and analyze those equations to\r\ndetermine when they predict persistence of populations versus\r\nwhen they predict extinction.  To conduct the analysis the\r\ninvestigators use and develop various mathematical methods.\r\n",
