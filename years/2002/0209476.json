 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Charles P. Casey at the University of Wisconsin to develop an understanding of industrially-important metallocene polymerization catalysis and to pursue new synthetic paths to enediyne complexes that may facilitate the preparation of enediyne anticancer drugs.   Metallocene catalysts have revolutionized the polymer industry and now account for the production of over 2 billion poinds of polyethylene a year.  This research will look at a key step in the polymer chain-lengthening process by exploring the detailed structural dependence of alkene insertion into metallocene alkyls.  A new synthetic reaction involving alkynyl carbene complexes, which juxtapose a metal-carbon double bond with a carbon-carbon triple bond, will be used to generate regioselective dimerization of the organic portion to yield enediyne complexes through a coupling of the terminal alkyne carbons.  The initial focus will be on manganese compounds, which are more economical and more amenable to release of the metal ion.  Since reactions of the alkynylcarbene complexes suggest a carbene-like reactivity at the remote alkynyl carbon, experiments will be undertaken to determine whether such complexes can react as if they were dicarbenes.\r\n\r\nThe details of how catalysts add carbon groups in important industrial polymerization processes will be determined.  A novel class of reagents that offers new routes to the preparation of an important class of anticancer drugs will be developed.",
