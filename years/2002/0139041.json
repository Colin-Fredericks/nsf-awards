 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site in Economics at the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University.  The program's main short-term objective is to provide undergraduate students the opportunity to participate actively in policy research; the program is also intended to achieve the longer-term objective of attracting qualified, interested students to quality Ph.D. programs in economics, public policy, and other social sciences.  This award will provide internships for 10 students each of the next three summers.  Students will intern with an economics faculty member working in one of the five policy research centers or programs at the institution.  Interns will receive formal and systematic training in a weekly seminar that will provide basic research skills and that will culminate in a presentation and a paper related to the research experience.  \r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
