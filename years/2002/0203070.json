Consider the tensor powers of a Hermitian holomorphic \r\nline bundle, over a compact complex manifold. If the curvature form of the line bundle \r\nis strictly positive, then the first non--zero eigenvalue, of the Laplacian, acting on \r\nsections of the $k$th power, is bounded below uniformly in $k$. The proposal is to prove \r\nthat the first non--zero eigenvalue is uniformly bounded below when the curvature is \r\nsemipositive everywhere and positive for at least one point. The problem can be reformulated\r\nin terms of CR geometry. Microlocal analysis will be applied to the reformulated problem.\r\nThe problem of quantum unique ergodicity concerns concentration of eigenfunctions on \r\nmanifolds with ergodic geodesic flow. We propose to construct examples where sequences of \r\neigenfunctions concentrate along isolated closed geodesics or on one parameter families of \r\nclosed geodesics. The first step is to find quasimodes (approximate eigenfunctions). \r\nNext one must show that these quasimodes correspond to individual eigenfunctions rather \r\nthan sums of several eigenfunctions. The hyperbolic space has essential spectrum which is \r\na proper subset of the positive real line. There do exist eigenfunctions, defined on the \r\ncomplements of compact sets, whose eigenvalue lies below the start of the essential spectrum.\r\nThe behavior of these eigenfunctions will be studied near the ideal boundary at infinity.\r\nThe goal is to understand the nodal set by means of a perturbation expansion. It appears \r\nthat the case of surfaces is much more tractable than the higher dimensional cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo develop our understanding of the quantum phenomena, mathematicians are often inspired by \r\nthe analogy with classical mechanics. The passage from the classical to the quantum level \r\nis called the semiclassical limit. If the classical motion is chaotic, one expects the \r\nprobability distribution of the quantum particle to be dispersed. Exceptions to this pattern, \r\nwhere the particle concentrates, are of particular interest. Similarly, if an energy \r\nestimate holds under strict positivity conditions of a classical curvature form, one \r\nnaturally investigates the borderline case where the curvature form is non--negative.\r\nOne hopes that regularity properties will persevere in the more general situation.\r\nThis type of question is interesting because non--negative objects often occur as the limits\r\nof positive objects. The nodal set of a quantum particle is the stationary set for the \r\nassociated wave motion. Its distribution and shape are of fundamental interest, \r\nbut poorly understood, especially in dimensions larger than two.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
