 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wolbachia  pipientis is one of the most widespread endosymbiotic microorganisms known. First characterized in mosquitoes of  the Culex pipiens complex, it has since been found in greater than 20% of insect species and about 25% of  Drosophila melanogaster used in genetic research. Wolbachia has specialized in the manipulation of host reproduction. In Drosophila,  Wolbachia  primarily  causes  cytoplasmic  incompatability  (CI),  a  form  of reproductive isolation. The expression of CI renders infected males unable to father offspring when mated to uninfected females. While infected males mate normally, transfer sperm and the sperm fertilize the egg, the egg fails to complete karyogamy and dies. Reciprocal crosses between uninfected males and infected females are viable, but since Wolbachia are transmitted vertically through the female, all resulting progeny  are  infected. The research project will attempt to understand the genetic basis of Wolbachia distribution in Drosophila melanogaster testes and the resulting effects on CI. Deficiency mapping will identify loci with large effects on Wolbachia distribution and  density  within  D. melanogaster  testes. Deficiency  stocks  will  be  screened  for  the presence of Wolbachia. Those  strains  with  dissimilar patterns of Wolbachia distribution will be studied further for their ability (or inability) to cause CI as well as the for the host genetic basis of differential bacterial  distribution. Following identification of important candidate loci through deficiency mapping, alleles with different levels of penetrance will be studied for their impact on bacterial distribution and CI. \r\nThe identification of genes and biochemical pathways involved in determining Wolbachia distribution patterns will advance the  understanding  of  how Wolbachia manipulate host reproduction in Drosophila and spermatogenesis in general. It may  also provide clues as to what pathways are manipulated when Wolbachia  infect more distantly related insects, particularly insect pests that cause human diseases (for example, malarial diseases transmitted by mosquitoes. Such knowledge will also aid in the design of effective pest management  programs  utilizing Wolbachia.\r\n",
