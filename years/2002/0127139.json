 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nTwo introductory courses-- Introduction to Environmental Resources Engineering and Science and Introduction to Design-are being revitalized to better prepare students to solve the difficult interdisciplinary problems of the 21st century. These courses are being redesigned to provide integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to solving environmental problems, including: (1) interdisciplinary presentation of environmental and human systems via hands-on team projects, field and lab experiences, (2) clear presentation of course requirements and careers available to environmental scientists and resource engineers, and 3) development of computational, technical communication and teamwork skills through projects, field and lab experiments. These courses are going to give students the knowledge, skills and attitudes they need to be successful in their majors. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's studio teaching and Just-In-Time Teaching (JiTT) approaches are being adapted.\r\n\r\nProject approach consists of modifying existing curricula to incorporate the Studio Teaching \r\nand Just-In-Time Teaching (JiTT) approaches, and PROMISE Project materials. WebCT software and the new ERE Design Studio are being used to integrate technology into the curriculum. The project addresses NSF themes of diversity and integration of technology in the curriculum. The two PIs are women in a field where women are underrepresented; the PROMISE curriculum is more inclusive of underrepresented groups in SMET areas. Both JiTT and Studio Teaching require the integration of technology in the classroom.\r\n\r\nProject dissemination plan consist of making WebCT course modules containing engineering curricula available through course web pages, making presentations at national meetings, conducting on- and off-campus faculty development workshops, and journal publications.\r\n",
