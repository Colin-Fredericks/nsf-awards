The second part consists of studying\r\nscattering theory in asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds.  Establishing upper, and possibly lower, bounds for the counting function of resonance in these spaces, and also giving a dynamical definition of the scattering matrix in terms of the radiation fields. The latter part is also expected\r\nto be possible in the asymptotically Euclidean case. The third part consists of studying problems of recovering information about an asymptotically hyperbolic, or asymptotically Euclidean, manifold, and its Riemannian structure, from the scattering matrix. It is expected\r\nthat the dynamical definition of the scattering matrix will also play an important role in this part.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project concerns the investigation of how waves propagate in a medium, and reciprocally,  what type of information about a medium can be extracted from a certain knowledge on the propagation of waves in it. For example, how a certain perturbation of a known medium, like an\r\nobstacle in space, affects the propagation of waves, and, vice-versa, determine properties of the obstacle from information obtained from waves reflected by it. It also concerns the study of the wave equation on spaces that are geometrically different from the usual Euclidean\r\nspace, e.g., spaces that resemble the hyperbolic space at infinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
