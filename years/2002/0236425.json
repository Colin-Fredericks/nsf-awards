 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU) is submitting a proposal for HBCU Doctoral Capacity Building Grant with a unified research focus on Sensor Science and Technology (SST) in response to the NSF Dear Colleague Letter of June 17, 2002. AAMU initiated the Ph.D. program in physics in 1986. AAMU is one of the first HBCUs to start the Ph.D. program. The proposed projects have a unified focus on Sensor Science and Technology. This fully supports the mission of the university and\r\nmeets the national standards of research in the area of sensors. Industrial partners and scientists from federal laboratories have endorsed this proposal. To ensure that each critical area based on AAMU strength and the national need is represented, three subproject areas are carefully chosen: Smart Optical Sensors, Fiber Optic Sensors, and Infrared (IR) Sensors.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the novel materials and their adaptation in the state-of-the-art sensors is our major scientific goal of the proposal. This will increase the overall capacity and infrastructure of the department and will help in attracting quality faculty, undergraduate and graduate students. \r\n\r\nA one-week summer workshop and a short course for faculty and UG students from HBCU's and other institutions will be organized every year on sensor science and technology. Eight to ten faculty and students will be invited from local and other universities and colleges. This in turn will motivate and better prepare UG students towards entering graduate schools in the areas of science and engineering. The short course will be later recommended for a graduate course with 3 credit/semester.\r\n\r\nAlabama A&M University is strategically located in the city of Huntsville amongst major industrial companies, NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center, US Army Missile and Aviation Command, and US Army Strategic Missile and Defense Command. Several of these have a focus on sensor technology. This NSF grant will help in (a) improving the infrastructure of the department of physics at AAMU and (b) expanding the scientific research being conducted as a result of the previous CREST-Center for Nonlinear Optics and Optical Materials (1988-1998). The proposed grant will strengthen the position of AAMU as a doctoral degree awarding institution among HBCUs and other institutions. The grant will also help in attracting quality faculty and students. The existing external departmental advisory committee will review the impact of this grant on the infrastructure of the department. The committee will report the findings to the PD/PI and to the department chair.\r\n\r\nThe AAMU administration is committed to support the proposal by contributing 31% cost-sharing and a reduction of indirect cost to 25% from a normal 35.5%. The PI/PD and investigators of the proposed grant have many years of scientific and management experience, strong scientific track record and are well recognized in the field of sensor materials and devices.\r\n",
