Feighn\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is in the area of geometric group theory. \r\nA motivating question is: Given a graph of groups G with some \r\nkind of restriction on the vertex and edge groups, what can be \r\nsaid about G?  For example, is G a non-trivial free product?; \r\ndoes G split over the integers?; what is the JSJ-decomposition \r\nof G? A focus will be on finite graphs of finitely generated \r\nfree groups. As an indication of progress along these lines, \r\nwith his graduate student Guo-An Diao, the principal investigator \r\nhas found an algorithm for determining whether a finite graph of finitely generated free groups is a non-trivial free product.\r\n\r\nTopological spaces are often analyzed by cutting them open \r\nand then considering the resulting simpler pieces. An easy \r\nexample of this is that if a circle is cut then an arc remains. Analogously, groups are often studied by cutting them open along subgroups. Since groups may be represented as symmetries of \r\nspaces, splittings of groups and splittings of spaces are \r\ntwo manifestations of the same construction. For example, \r\nthe splitting of the circle above gives a description of \r\nthe integers.  One of the most exciting developments in\r\ngroup theory over the past 20 years is the description by \r\nRips-Sela of all splittings of groups over subgroups such \r\nas the integers. Dunwoody-Sageev and Fujiwara-Papasoglu \r\nhave extended the types of splittings that can be described. \r\nThe principal investigator will explore the extent to which \r\nthese descriptions can be made algorithmically.\r\n",
