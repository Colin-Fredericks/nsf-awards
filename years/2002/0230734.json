These are: \r\n\tIdentifying key software that can be used with current coursework that will \r\nfacilitate understanding of fundamental physical phenomena. \r\n\tTraining  faculty  in  the  use  of  that  software  so  that  all  faculty  have  a  baseline competence with current engineering tools in their discipline. \r\n\t Developing a set of canonical examples for each discipline that are easy-to-use, \r\nerror-free, appropriate for visualizing the desired physical principle, have some \r\nability to be modified parametrically for use in design studies, and also have some \r\ndegree of hierarchical parentage so that they can be used for  ABET  evaluation \r\npurposes. \r\n                Developing a database, accessible over the  Internet, for use in our distance \r\neducation program that enables students in both our main campus and branch \r\ncampus environments  to complete examples and share results with both \r\nprofessors and fellow students. \r\n\r\nImplementation  of  such  a  curriculum  change would  enable  the  university  to  mimic  the most sophisticated design/build processes present in industry today at minimal cost, the university equivalent of  the .paperless airplane.. Further, it is the environment that our students will be practicing in as sophisticated software becomes ubiquitous in the next ten years. \r\n",
