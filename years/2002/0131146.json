 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York in Stony Brook will acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the development of synthetic processes based on organometallic catalysts and the development of synthetic methods for natural products and their congeners (Ojima); b) synthesis of biologically active natural products and designed molecular probes (Parker); c) synthesis of analogues of Coenzyme A and development of computer-designed receptors and sensors for biological molecules (Drueckhammer); d) investigations on the role of disintegrins in mammalian fertilization and on understanding enzyme motion (Sampson); e) the structure and reactivity of all-carbon molecules (Goroff); and f) the preparation of designed supramolecular structures (Fowler).  \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry, biological sensor development, and materials chemistry.\r\n",
