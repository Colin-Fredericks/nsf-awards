 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe cytochrome P450 monooxygenase superfamily of heme-containing enzymes contains a wide\r\nrange of monooxygenase activities that make them critically important to virtually all\r\nlife forms. In recent years, they have been shown to be important in human growth and\r\ndevelopment because they are involved in steroid biosynthesis and also in many\r\npharmacological areas because they are critical for the activation and/or detoxification\r\nof drugs in human and vertebrate models. In a rapidly and ever-expanding area, they have\r\nbeen shown to be important in insect and plant growth and development because of their\r\ninvolvement in biosynthetic pathways for insect and plant hormones and in agricultural\r\nareas because they mediate the metabolism of herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and\r\nenvironmental pollutants.\r\n\r\nRealizing the growing importance of this area of plant and insect P450 research, the\r\norganizing committee for the International Symposium Series on P450 Biodiversity branched\r\nfrom the more classical area of vertebrate P450 research represented in the Symposium\r\nSeries on Microsomes and Drug Oxidations to create an independent and focused series\r\ndevoted to microorganisms, plants and insects. For the Sixth International Symposium on\r\nP450 Biodiversity: Functional Biochemistry & Molecular Biology of P450 Cytochromes in\r\nMicroorganisms, Plants and Insects, the organizers have endeavored to continue the\r\nexamples set in the five previous meetings in this series by providing platforms for the\r\npresentation of approaches for expression analysis of model P450s as well as functional\r\nanalysis of the numerous P450s existing in these non-vertebrate systems. The goal is to\r\nprovide a forum for discussing leading research in the field through a single lecture\r\nseries of 48 presentations interspersed with scheduled poster presentations and ample time\r\nfor informal discussions. With this goal in mind, funds are requested to help support\r\ntravel expenses for competitively identified advanced predoctoral and postdoctoral\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nThe International Advisory Board and Scientific Organizing Committee for this Series\r\ncontains representatives from seven different countries including eleven from the United\r\nStates. The meeting will be held August 20-25, 2002 at the Conference Center on the UCLA\r\ncampus and hosted by Armand J. Fulco, Professor of Biochemistry at the University of\r\nCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA). Dr. Fulco's research has focused on characterization of\r\nbacterial cytochrome P450s through a variety of world-wide collaborations. It is expected\r\nthat attendance at this meeting will be approximately 200 with participation from the\r\nUnited States, Europe and the Pacific Rim in approximately equal proportions.",
