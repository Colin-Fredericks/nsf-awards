 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project is to design and develop appropriate mathematical models and algorithms for optimizing the crosscut operation in a wood processing (lumber processing) rough mill. The goal is to incorporate these algorithms into an integrated software system for automatic control of the process. The software system consists of a main engine that contains the mathematical models and algorithms for finding an optimal cutting pattern for each piece of incoming uncut lumber, along with all necessary mechanisms to interface with (and to coordinate the operation of) various components of the manufacturing line. These components include automatic scanners, automatic crosscut saws, and all associated conveyor belts and positioning devices. At the present time in most rough mills the task of identifying a good cutting pattern for each piece of lumber is done by visual inspection. \r\n\r\nThe commercial benefits of this software system wil be on the efficiency of the crosscut operation, by increasing both its speed and its yield. This could lead to substantial reductions in the manufacturing cost as well as significant savings in the overall consumption of wood, which is a scarce national resource.\r\n",
