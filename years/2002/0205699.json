 "awd_abstract_narration": "0205699\r\nWets\r\n\r\nThis research proposal is centered around approximation issues in \r\nstochastic programming, in particular as they arise in two quite \r\nchallenging problems: equilibria problems in a stochastic environment and \r\nrecourse problems involving partial differential equations.  The \r\n\"stochastic\" equilibrium problem adds a new level of difficulty; rather \r\nthan just optimizing one must find a mechanism to determine a price \r\nsystem under which the optimization takes place. Such equilibria have \r\nbeen derived by relying on fixed point theorems.  Thirdly, because it is \r\nonly possible to solve discretized versions of stochastic optimization \r\nproblems, it is of paramount importance to investigate thoroughly \r\napproximation issues. Not only the question of approximating the \r\nstochastic process that describes the uncertainty but also how to improve \r\nthe construction of this process from the available data and to analyze the \r\neffect this will have on the solution of the stochastic program.\r\n\r\nThe field of stochastic programming provides mathematical tools for \r\nsolving and analyzing models for decision making under uncertainty. This \r\nproject will be concerned with two significant and difficult applications \r\nand with approximation issues:  \r\n-- A problem in groundwater remediation which was selected because it \r\nrequires both theoretical and computational developments. It is a \r\nstochastic optimization problem where the state of the system is obtained \r\nby solving a partial differential equation whose coefficients are rapidly \r\noscillating (heterogeneous media) and stochastic (uncertainty about the \r\nmedia composition). The possibility of deriving a homogenized version of \r\nthis problem will also be investigated.  \r\n-- Walras equilibrium problem in an uncertain environment. This problem \r\nis selected because it adds a dimension to stochastic optimization in that \r\none must also find price systems (setting up an \"equilibrium\") under \r\nwhich this stochastic optimization must take place.   \r\n-- Approximation issues in stochastic programming. The question of \r\nhaving a reliable estimate for the parameters of a dynamic stochastic \r\nprogramming problem is raised. It is expected that a more comprehensive, \r\napproach which makes use of all the information available, rather than just \r\nthe collected data will result in more reliable solutions for stochastic \r\nprogramming problems.\r\n",
