 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system is needed to further ongoing funded projects on dynamics and transport in unsteady flows, sedimentation processes, and complex interfaces. The aim of these studies is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of mixing, fate, transport, and sedimentation. This is of importance not only from the viewpoint of basic research but also to develop predictive tools (for example, for environmental processes) for practical applications.\r\n\r\nThe PIV system is capable of tracking both phases (particles or passive tracers and fluid) in real time by the use of non-intrusive optical methods to generate 2D or 3D mappings. Data analysis and quantification of the processes can be easily performed using MATLAB software linked to the instrumentation software. This feature makes the interface use friendly for undergraduate students. Furthermore, the PIV system will also be able to track the motion of particles in externally driven fluids as function of the driving frequencies. With this unique feature it will be possible to investigate chaotic advection of particles in real time.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation will provide a unique opportunity to advance the ongoing research of multiphase flow at both the experimental and theoretical levels. In addition, as Xavier University, an historically black university, prides itself of being the number one producer in the nation of excellent African-American graduates in physics and physical sciences, more students will be directly involved in research in a very important area and will have the opportunity of using state-of-the art equipment, that will better prepare them for graduate school and research careers.\r\n\r\nThis equipment will also have a direct educational impact as it will be used in connection\r\nwith laboratory classes and research results will be used in curricula materials in upper level courses. Furthermore, in the future this system can also expand the horizon of the research embraced by faculty in areas of technological relevance for multiphase flows. Other researchers and collaborators in the New Orleans area will benefit from this system as well.\r\n",
