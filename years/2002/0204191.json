In the first, the PI proposes to\r\nstudy regularity of harmonic maps into the completion of Teichmueller\r\nspace.  The two main applications are on symplectic Lefschetz pencils\r\nand on superrigidity of lattices in the mapping class group.  In the\r\nsecond project the PI proposes a proof of higher dimensional partial\r\nanalogues of the conjectures of Atiyah and Bott on Yang-Mills\r\nequations over Riemann surfaces.  These are nontrivial\r\ngeneralizations to higher dimensions of the PI's previous work on the\r\nconnection between Yang-Mills and the theory of holomorphic vector\r\nbundles.  Finally in the third project the PI proposes some questions\r\nabout harmonic maps from three-dimensional manifolds to trees which\r\ngeneralize the well-known theory of harmonic maps from surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for the first project is to use harmonic maps in order\r\nto understand analytically the results of Kaimanovich-Masur and\r\nFarb-Masur on the superrigidity of lattices of rank at least 2 in the\r\nmapping class group.  In the process the PI realized that the methods\r\nshould also shed light in the rank one case.  The second project\r\nshows that there are still very close connections between the\r\nanalysis of the Yang-Mills equations and algebraic geometry.  These\r\nconnections have been exploited in great detail by several people in\r\nthe case of Riemann surfaces but very little is known in higher\r\ndimensions.  The PI's work sheds some light in this direction.\r\n",
