Barron\r\n\r\nAbstract: \r\n\r\nThe study of nonlinear essential supremum functionals is the focus\r\nof this project. In variational problems with such functionals the\r\nnatural questions of interest are existence of an absolute (or\r\nlocal) minimizer, i.e., a function which minimizes the functional\r\non every subdomain, necessary conditions for the minimizer leading\r\nto very nonlinear differential equations, and regularity of the\r\nminimizer. In contrast to the classical calculus of variations,\r\neven under very strong assumptions, regularity beyond continuous\r\ndifferentiability is not expected, but even this much smoothness\r\nis unknown. Virtually every question posed in classical\r\nvariational analysis can be posed for supremum functionals--\r\nconstraints, relaxation, homogenization, duality--and this can be\r\ndone for both scalar and vector valued problems where the results\r\nare more difficult. This subject has placed a new focus on\r\nviscosity solutions for fully nonlinear equations, and a new\r\nemphasis on an old area of convex analysis, quasiconvexity. The\r\nmotivation for the study of such problems comes from consideration\r\nof physical problems in which the use of the typical energy norm\r\nis not adequate, that is, one must design for the worst case.\r\nSupremum norm functionals lack strong differentiability and the\r\nsubsequent difficulties associated with this lack must be dealt\r\nwith using all forms of nonlinear analysis.\r\n\r\nThe use of variational analysis in engineering, physics, medicine,\r\neconomics, and other fields is well established. Extreme value\r\nengineering is an area in which one seeks to consider the worst\r\ncase in order to properly design or build some mechanism. In this\r\nproject these two disciplines are merged to apply variational\r\nanalysis in order to accomodate a worst case analysis. In certain\r\nareas, such as medicine, or structural engineering, it is clear\r\nthat the worst case analysis is the only realistic design. For\r\nexample, an oncological treatment cannot seek to minimize the\r\naverage tumor load, but must minimize the maximum tumor load. A\r\nbridge should not be designed to minimize average stresses but\r\nmaximum pointwise stresses. Many control mechanisms implemented\r\nonly when a maximum indicator is triggered. These are all problems\r\nwhich are applications of the project considered and in which many\r\nnew techniques must be developed. The basic and fundamental\r\nresults of this area of variational analysis, including existence\r\nand the determination of criteria sufficient to determine the\r\noptimal function, will be studied. The analysis leads to the study\r\nof nonlinear partial differential equations and systems of such\r\nequations.\r\n",
