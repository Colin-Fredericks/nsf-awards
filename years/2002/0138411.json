Farouki\r\n\r\nThough motivated by practical engineering considerations, \r\nsurface intersection problems have deep roots in diverse \r\nareas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, topology, \r\nanalysis, and numerical methods.  The proposed project will \r\nbring the diverse expertise and renewed commitment of an inter-disciplinary team of mathematicians, computer\r\nscientists, and engineers to bear on this critical problem. \r\nSince successful solutions will require radically new \r\napproaches and paradigms, rather than incremental advances, \r\nspecial emphasis will be placed on re-visiting the problem \r\nfrom first principles, seeking new insights through \r\nsynergistic dialog among participants with diverse areas of\r\nexpertise, and use of exploratory software implementations \r\nas research tools. A central theme of the proposed research \r\nis the ab initio incorporation of topological information \r\ninto the formulation and verification of intersection algorithms. Although failure to guarantee topological consistency is \r\nthe main deficiency of existing algorithms, this remains a \r\npoorly explored domain. Our initial line of enquiry will\r\nfocus on using the homotopy or \"embedding\" method to track \r\ntopological changes in implicitly-defined algebraic curves, \r\nas they evolve from \"simple\" initial configurations into a \r\nprescribed intersection locus.\r\n\r\nThe accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of modern \r\ncomputer-aided design (CAD) systems has been severely \r\ncompromised by the persistent lack of rigorous algorithms \r\nfor topologically-consistent representations of surface \r\nintersections and trimmed surfaces. The solution to this\r\nfundamental problem can have tremendous economic impact, \r\nin terms of eliminating the laborious \"geometry preparation \r\nand repair\" task that currently precedes the use of CAD \r\ndata in analysis, manufacturing, and inspection applications, \r\nand in resolving data-exchange incompatibilities among \r\ndifferent CAD systems. The ensuing productivity benefits, \r\nmanifested in accelerated design cycles and greater reliance \r\non \"virtual prototyping\" for design verification, are crucial \r\nto the maintenance of technological leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
