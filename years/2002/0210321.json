 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a class of methods known as 'templated self-assembly' that control the growth and self-assembly of nanostructures on surfaces. This will enable formation of monodisperse nanoscale features in precise positions on a substrate. This work will be an enabling technology in the design of new devices that utilize the properties of quantum dots and other nanoscale objects, in which the control of the sizes and spatial positions of the features is paramount in optimizing performance. The objective is to use lithography to modulate substrate surfaces with features of periodicity of order 100 nm, to form templates for the growth and self-assembly of nanostructures. In this process, lithography is not used to form the nanostructures themselves, but instead is used to form a template that will 'seed' the formation of nanostructures in particular locations. The nanostructures will be considerably smaller in size than the period of the template. The goal of the project is to develop the templated self-assembly of arrays of nanoscale semiconductor and metal islands controlled by epitaxial strain, surface chemistry or topography. The island formation will be achieved using both the deposition from the vapor phase and by the spontaneous agglomeration of metastable coninuous sold films. This work will be carried out by an interdisciplinary team of researchers from MIT in collaboration with IBM and Sandia National Laboratories working with a group of students and a postdoctoral researcher. The outreach involves a communication effort designed to inform the general public about nanotechnology through development of a web site and other scientific communication avenues, including the involvement of undergraduate students as well as other activities such as school visits.\r\n%%%\r\nThe research will be focussed on the templated self-assembly of arrays of nanoscale semiconductor and metal islands controlled by epitaxial strain, surface chemistry or topography. The resulting well-ordered nanoscale island arrays will have technological relevance in devices that include optically active structures involving plasmon wires, and patterned magnetic recording media. A range of other applications will also benefit from the methods developed in this proposal; for instance optical devices based on arrays of semiconductor quantum dots. The educational goals of this work are to contribute to the public understanding of nanotechnology and to the training of skilled researchers.\r\n***\r\n",
