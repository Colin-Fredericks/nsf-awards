With \r\nthe wide availability of powerful computational resources and \r\never better acquisition technologies such as 3D laser \r\nscanning and volumetric MRI or CAT imaging the geometries \r\nused in applications are becoming increasingly complex. One \r\naspect of this complexity is topology, i.e., the presence\r\nof holes and tunnels and of a network of one and \r\nzero-dimensional surface features such as creases and spikes.  \r\nTypical examples of topologically complex shapes are a \r\nperforated plate or the system of blood vessels of the body. \r\nTraditional representations of geometry are at worst weak \r\nand at best cumbersome and inefficient in representing\r\nsuch complex topologies.  Modeling of macro- and microscopic \r\nbiological structures is becoming increasingly important \r\nfor medical research, training, and treatment support. Such \r\nstructures often have extremely complex shape and topology \r\n(e.g., the blood vessel or the nervous system, facial\r\nmuscles, a folded protein molecule). The representations \r\nand algorithms we develop will result in new efficient ways \r\nof manipulating and processing computer representations of \r\nsuch structures. \r\n\r\nIn this project a team with expertise in numerical analysis, \r\ngeometric modeling, discrete algorithms and computer graphics \r\nis studying ways to bring fundamental mathematical tools \r\nand highly efficient algorithms to bear on the challenge \r\nof creating efficient and accurate computational \r\nrepresentations and algorithms for surfaces of complex\r\ntopology.  In particular we are investigating theory and \r\npractical algorithms for (I) removal of topological noise \r\nin existing models as well as in raw data used for surface \r\nreconstruction; (II) topology discovery in volumetric \r\ndata sets; (III) construction of multiresolution \r\nrepresentations of geometry which can meaningfully\r\nabstract fine level topology at coarser resolutions to \r\nenable powerful multiscale techniques for rendering, \r\nmodification and simulation. Particular attention is paid \r\nto exploring measures of topological scale which are \r\ncrucial to most of the algorithms being developed.  The \r\nalgorithms to be developed by the team will have immediate \r\napplications in two areas:  Computer-Aided Design and \r\nMedical Visualization.  In CAD, examples of potential \r\napplications include topology cleanup, simplification \r\nfor integration of scanned 3D data with manually \r\nconstructed models and use of multiscale representations \r\nfor interactive conceptual design representations.\r\n",
