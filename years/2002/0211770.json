Compound eyes are organized following a blueprint that is evolutionarily conserved throughout insects and even most crustaceans (shrimp, crabs etc.).  Surprisingly, the twisted-wing insect (Strepsiptera), does not follow this blueprint but instead has an eye that represents an intermediate form between an image forming lens eye, such as found in vertebrates, and the typical insect eye.  In this highly specialized, parasitic group of insects, several large lenses each capture a small image or \"chunk\" of the visual environment.  These lens-based building blocks together form a small eye that samples a wide visual field.  This project focuses on the functional organization of this unique eye.  This intermediate organization escapes some of the classical limitations of both the compound eye and the single lens eye.  A deeper understanding of the strepsipteran eye type could contribute to the growing field of biomimicry, where it could lead to new technologies for small sensors that sample wide visual fields.   \r\n\r\nMuch of this project will be devoted to investigating the neural substrate that integrates the partial images supplied by individual lenses.  In Strepsiptera the visual information from neighboring eyelets has to be integrated into one large coherent image.  Understanding the design that performs such integration may reveal novel neural mechanisms in vision research.  Because this eye is so different from that of all other insects, we will also investigate specific aspects of its development and use a comparative approach to investigate its evolutionary origin.  \r\n\r\nThere are two major aspects in which this project will have a broader impact on our society: (1) it will reveal the organization, development and evolution of unique neural and optical structures which are interesting as adaptations to a specific life style, and may have the potential to become the basis for future technologies, and (2) it will provide considerable educational benefits, both in terms of training students and in terms of educating the greater public.  Several undergraduate students will be involved at any given time throughout the project.  These students will have the opportunity to become members of an active research laboratory where they will be exposed to many different techniques andcross-disciplinary training.  Also, various forms of outreach and  public education, ranging from a web-page in lay language to the design of a museum exhibit will be pursued.  Interest of the public already has been expressed after initial publication on those eyes in Science, which lead to articles in National Geographic, Time Magazine, New York Times, Scientific American, Discovery, and others.\r\n\r\n",
