This is the first major gathering of Native scientists, scholars, and elders with Western scientists and scholars that is to be planned, organized, and carried out within Native, rather than Western, worldview.  Extensive dissemination through a film, books, a museum exhibition, and curriculum materials is an integral part of this project. These means of dissemination will allow the workshop's objectives to be widely communicated. The objectives of the workshop are to make a statement about science from a Native cultural perspective and to show the dominant culture another way of looking at the world that can help solve some serious problems we all face. The workshop and dissemination materials are being planned by teams of Native scholars and scientists from many nations, in collaboration with selected non-Native scholars and scientists. \r\n",
