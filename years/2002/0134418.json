The creation of novel structures at length scales smaller than those available from traditional top-down fabrication methods requires a detailed atomistic understanding of the physics and chemistry governing multicomponent processes.  This understanding must be linked also to macroscopic scale process operating conditions.  Potential application areas that can benefit from such a paradigm include atomistic scale control of bulk dopant and defect distribution in silicon microelectronics, defect control in other electronic materials such as SiC, SiGe, and GaAs, and controlled deposition of multilayered structures for advanced optoelectronic materials.  A close coupling of the analytical framework against available experimental results will be included in the research program.  A primary goal of the educational component of the project will be to introduce electronic materials processing into the curriculum choices for chemical engineering majors, particularly at the University of Pennsylvania, to increase the number of those graduates who move into this important industry.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
