Prey interception flights are highly accurate, with capture success rates as high as 97%.  Using a combination of techniques, including multi-neuronal recordings with nanofabricated electrode arrays and high speed video analysis of wing movements, this project is aimed at understanding the neural guidance system used to direct this rapid, precise, visually-guided behavior.  Because prey pursuit is directed by a small number of easily accessible neurons, the dragonfly experimental preparation is ideally suited for answering a fundamental question in neurobiology:  does the correlation of firing patterns among neurons communicate more information than could be communicated by the neurons individually? An understanding of prey interception by dragonflies, from neurons to behavior, could lead to the development of effective biomimetic guidance mechanisms. In addition, this project will give undergraduate students a cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary, research experience, providing a vehicle for recruiting talented, enthusiastic students from both biology and engineering into the field of neuroscience. \r\n",
