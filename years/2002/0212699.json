 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research in this project will focus on the preparation and study of azoles, primarily pyrazoles and isoxazoles, and pyranones.  For the syntheses, some emphasis is placed on multiple anion-type syntheses coupled with standard preparative methodology as exemplified by Claisen-type reactions, aldol-type reactions and alkylations.  Starting materials will consist of readily available ketones, hydrazones and carboxylic acid hydrazides.  Each of the projects will be organized into smaller component investigations thereby allowing each undergraduate participant to be involved in at least two investigations.\r\n\r\nWith this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr. Charles F. Beam and Dr. Jason S. Overby of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the College/University of Charleston.  The principal investigators will focus their work on the preparation of heterocycles that have interesting biological activity, that have interesting ligand properties and  compounds that are viable ligands for the construction of new metallocene derivatives.  The students working in the project will have the opportunity to gain from the experience of both an organic and an inorganic chemist.",
