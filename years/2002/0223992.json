 "awd_abstract_narration": "0223992  Edwards  This MUSES project will build an interdisciplinary team to comprehensively address drinking water infrastructure corrosion, which is a multi-billion dollar world-wide problem plaguing water suppliers and home owners.  Corrosion is devastating due to the economic burden of replacing plumbing, potential adverse health effects of corrosion by-products, and unwanted and fear-producing aesthetic problems including discolored water and off tastes and odors.  The interdisciplinary team will synthesize a better understanding of corrosion through discussions of: chemical and biological causes of corrosion in pipes; economic models that assess costs of infrastructure damage and replacement; sensory properties of metals and sensory evaluation methods; health, consumer, and regulatory issues related to drinking water.  The participating research professionals and students represent six disciplines (Civil and Environmental Engineering, Economics, Food and Sensory Science, Public Health, Regulatory Affairs, Water Treatment and Supply), three countries, six different national agencies and associations, and three universities.  Participation of these diverse groups will produce the scientific and engineering insights necessary for improving safe water in a manner that is tempered by societal and regulatory needs.\r\nThe project's impacts will be broader than just its technical discoveries.  The participants are committed to scientific and public dissemination of their knowledge.  Two white papers will be submitted for publication in scientific journals.  The public will be directly served by involving a citizen's group in discussions, preparing public interest out-reach materials for a consumer-based website, and other non-technical articles will appear in Op-Flow (a widely read water industry publication for utility workers).\r\n",
