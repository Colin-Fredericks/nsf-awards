Such issues must be\r\naddressed if research universities are going to maximize their potential and bring research,\r\nscholarship, and creative activity to the forefront of the undergraduate education they offer, as\r\nenvisioned in the Boyer Commission report, \"Educating Undergraduates in the Research\r\nUniversity.\" Underlying the conference focus is the broader goal for research universities: (1) to\r\ndefine and articulate a vision of undergraduate education that builds upon and is synergistic\r\nwith their research mission, and (2) to develop reasonable expectations for implementing this\r\nvision so that it impacts significant numbers of students.\r\nUnderstanding the role of undergraduate research and mechanisms for realizing broader\r\nparticipation is a first step toward this goal. In their efforts to infuse research into the\r\nundergraduate education, those in leadership roles in research universities confront the\r\nsame panoply of issues and challenges that surround their larger efforts at reinvention. Thus\r\nthe conference focus on undergraduate research provides a concrete and manageable way to\r\naddress these issues.",
