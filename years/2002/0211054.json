 "awd_abstract_narration": "0211054\r\nBallard and Tucker\r\nGeneric distinctions and major subdivisions within many angiosperm families \r\ncommonly hinge on characteristics of floral symmetry or architecture, and \r\nmorphology of the reproductive structures themselves.  This is true in the \r\nviolet family (Violaceae), a moderate-sized family of angiosperms with a \r\nbroad range of growth forms from large tropical forest canopy trees to \r\nfingernail-sized Andean puna rosettes.  Predominately insect-pollinated, \r\nthe family nevertheless boasts a wide range of floral and fruit \r\nmorphologies on par with that in whole orders of other angiosperms.  An \r\napparently simple trend from actinomorphy to extreme zygomorphy, coupled \r\nwith increasing elaboration of staminal nectaries in floral spurs, has \r\nfigured heavily in generic concepts as well as in assignments to tribes and \r\nsubtribes.  Recent studies of generic relationships based on sequences of \r\nthe trnL-F and rbcL chloroplast regions, however, reject the simplistic \r\ntrend in floral symmetry and nectary development, as well as the current \r\ntraditional classification based on this trend, revealing instead several \r\nindependent origins of bilaterally symmetrical floral types with spurs from \r\ndifferent radially symmetrical spurless lineages.  Furthermore, pantropical \r\nHybanthus, the third largest genus in the family, splinters into 7 separate \r\ngroups distributed across the family, suggesting that its distinctive \r\n\"landing platform\" flower is a recurrent evolutionary syndrome.  The second \r\nlargest pantropical genus, Rinorea, is also substantially heterogeneous and \r\nnon-monophyletic.  The proposed research program will integrate \r\ncomprehensive floral developmental investigations to clarify floral \r\nevolution; systematic studies of macro- and micromorphological characters, \r\nchromosome numbers, xylem anatomy and pollen morphology to reevaluate \r\ncircumscriptions and distinctions of genera and diagnosable segregates; and \r\ninferences of generic relationships from chloroplast trnL-F spacer and rbcL \r\ngene regions to provide a robust molecular phylogenetic foundation on which \r\nto test relationships and develop a predictive classification.  Complete \r\ngeneric circumscriptions using the new and pre-existing traits, and a new \r\nintrafamilial classification, will then be developed using examinations of \r\nkey herbarium collections at the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, \r\nMissouri; Royal Botanic Garden at Kew, England; and the National Museum of \r\nNatural History in Paris, France.\r\n\tField work in Latin America by the investigator and his students and herbarium and laboratory training for graduate students add to the broader impacts of the work, as does collaboration with a leading plant morphologist, Dr. Shirley Tucker at UC-Santa Barbara.\r\n",
