 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mining sequential patterns and structured patterns (e.g., trees, lattices, \r\nand graphs) are important data mining tasks, with broad applications, such \r\nas the analysis of customer purchase sequences and Web page structures, \r\nunderstanding of disease treatments, scientific experiments, transportation \r\nand production processes, detection of anomaly and unusual patterns, \r\ndiscovery of bio-molecule sequences and structures, and so on.\r\n\r\nThis project is to perform a systematic investigation of the principles, \r\nalgorithms, and applications of scalable sequential and structured pattern \r\nmining, which covers the following issues: (1) development of highly scalable \r\nmining algorithms, including mining max-patterns, closed patterns and top-k \r\npatterns; (2) investigation of highly flexible mining methodologies, \r\nincluding mining of multi-dimensional multi-level sequential and structured \r\npatterns and constraint-based mining; (3) extension of the scope to cover \r\nsequential or structured pattern-based clustering; and (4) application of \r\nmulti-dimensional, multi-level sequential or structured pattern mining for \r\nintrusion detection, Web mining, and other important applications.  This \r\nwill lead to a set of efficient, scalable, and flexible sequential and \r\nstructured pattern mining methods for scientific and industrial applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
