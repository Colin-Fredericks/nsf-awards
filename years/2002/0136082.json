 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will investigate problems \r\ninvolving the representation theory of reductive algebraic \r\ngroups. The structures related to reductive groups include \r\nLie algebras, Chevalley groups, Weyl groups and centralizer \r\nalgebras. The methods and constructions involved in the study will be \r\nalgebraic as well as geometric. The underlying theme will be \r\nto establish connections between the cohomology and representations \r\nof the objects in order to prove new and interesting results \r\nabout these structures. Establishing such relationships also \r\nlends itself to providing concrete calculations. \r\n\r\nThe algebraic objects known as \"groups,\" \"rings\" and \"Lie algebras\" \r\narise in many different physical applications in biology, \r\nchemistry and physics. These algebraic objects \r\nin general have complex internal structures and symmetries. \r\nExtracting information about these structures can provide \r\nvital information which can be used in a range of applications\r\nsuch as those mentioned above.  This project is in the area\r\nof representation theory, which is now a central area of \r\nmathematics because it provides a systematic method for studying \r\ncomplicated algebraic structures. Roughly speaking, representations \r\ncan be thought of as ``snapshots'' of some algebraic object from\r\ndifferent viewing angles. These snapshots are provided via \r\nexplicitly described matrices. By putting together \r\nthe information from the representations, many questions \r\nsurrounding these complicated algebraic systems can be answered.",
