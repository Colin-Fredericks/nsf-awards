 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis project will study the gendered nature of learning science in the elementary grades.\r\nStandards-based science instruction largely consists of students engaging in first-hand\r\ninvestigation of scientific phenomena. This is in contrast to traditional science \r\ninstruction that relies heavily on textbooks. The justification for investigation-based \r\ninstructional design has typically been that the authority for scientific belief ought to\r\nreside in the actions of children rather than the authority of text. However, this \r\nunfortunate dichotomy between investigation and text undermines the potential uses \r\nof both.\r\n\r\nGirls are typically strong readers- an attribute that ought to make them strong in science.\r\nAfter all, at some point they must be able to read scientific text to excel in science classes.\r\nUnfortunately, research on text preferences shows that although girls are strong readers, \r\nthey prefer to read fiction rather than nonfiction. The primary objective of the project is \r\nto learn how science-related text embedded in inquiry science instruction can be used to \r\nengage girls.\r\n\r\nThe first year of this three year study willbe spent in four third grade\r\nclassrooms to observe how science-related texts are used. This will include documentation of text experiences created by teachers and created by girls in encounters with text supplemental to regular \r\ninstruction (e.g., library visits, classroom-reading centers, books from home). This will be\r\nsupplemented by classroom observations and interviews with girls, teachers, librarians \r\nand parents to collect additional data on the use of and interest in science books.\r\n\r\nThe second year of the project will consist of design experiments in the classrooms\r\nduring which the teachers and researchers work together to analyze classroom activities \r\nand design instruction in cycles that allow research and teaching practice to influence \r\none another. Data from the first year will be used to better understand how girls may \r\nengage with science text and design instruction to maximize girls interest in science\r\nand learning from science inquiry instruction that includes the use of text.\r\n\r\nThe research questions are as follows:\r\n1. What role does text play in girls classroom science experiences?\r\n2. How do teachers view the role of text in girls' learning of science?\r\n3. What texts are present in girls' homes and how are they used?\r\n4. What science texts do girls prefer when exposed to a large range of text genres and\r\nuses?\r\n5. How do girls uses of text enable and/or constrain their engagement and development\r\nof scientific ideas?\r\n\r\nThe final year will be spent analyzing results of the design experiment and conducting \r\ncross-year analyses, preparing research papers for submission to science and literacy\r\neducation journals, and developing a web-based curriculum unit for use in teacher\r\neducation programs, including our own NSF-sponsored science teacher education reform \r\neffort.",
