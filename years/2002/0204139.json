 "awd_abstract_narration": "Safety analysis is essential for high-assurance software systems. \r\nSafety analysis identifies the hazards, derives the software safety\r\nrequirements to eliminate or control these hazards, and ensures that the design\r\nand implementation incorporate those safeguards.  A product line is a\r\nset of products that share a common set of features and a related market or\r\nmission.Currently, high-assurance product lines are being built without the\r\ntools or conceptual framework necessary to perform effective safety analyses. \r\nThis research addresses the question of how safety analysis can\r\nbecome a reusable asset of a product line by developing a framework and asuite of techniques for the safety analysis of critical product lines. Anticipated benefits of the research include extending safety analyses toproduct lines, providing a framework for reuse of safety analyses within a product line, deriving formally specified limits on reuse of product-line safety analysis, and enabling safer product-line systems at lower cost and reduced schedules.  The results will be empirically evaluated by application in\r\nindustrial case studies.  This project will expand the opportunities available to\r\nstudent researchers to participate in development of safety-analysis\r\ntechniques for product lines.\r\n",
