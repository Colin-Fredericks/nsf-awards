 "awd_abstract_narration": "Psychology - Cognitive (73)\r\nA shared Eye-Tracking Laboratory (ELT) has been established at the University of Richmond to advance undergraduate coursework and research. This laboratory is modeled after a similar one at the University of Chicago, but has been adapted for primary use by undergraduate students. Although eye tracking is being increasingly used for research in psychology, engineering, human factors, and education, students at primarily undergraduate institutions rarely gain experience with this advanced technology. The goal of the proposed ELT is to give students a greater understanding of advanced research methodologies in psychology, greater preparation for advanced study in a variety of related fields, and a deeper understanding of mind, brain, and eye. \r\n\r\nThe ELT enhances the curriculum of advanced research methods courses in social psychology, cognitive psychology, cognitive science, adult development, and behavioral neuroscience. This lab is being used to demonstrate prior findings, and to conduct experiments that extend earlier work. In addition, students in these advanced methods courses are learning how to collect and analyze eye-tracking data in order to investigate their own research questions. Students who have been trained in eye tracking also have the opportunity to use the ELT for independent research projects under the direction of the principal investigator or co-principal investigators. Typically, 35 psychology majors conduct independent research at the University of Richmond Psychology Department each year.\r\n\r\n",
