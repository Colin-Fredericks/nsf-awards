 "awd_abstract_narration": "Milwaukee Public Museum will provide underrepresented, economically-disadvantaged, minority, urban girls in grades 6 to 8 an opportunity to participate in hands-on science learning activities and mentoring by scientists in botany, geology, zoology and biodiversity studies.  The participants will have the opportunity to learn directly from the scientists, join them at field studies, conduct mini-research under their guidance and find out what inspired their career choices.  In addition to the expertise of the scientists, \"Science Explorations\" program will utilize the exhibits, collections, live animals, scientific laboratories and computer/distance learning laboratory during a series of 12-week after school sessions in the fall and spring semesters.  A total of 141 girls will receive 96 hours of instruction over three years.  \"Science Explorations\" activities will promote learning of biological and geological forces that have formed the present natural environment with a focus on the local area where the participants reside.  Parental involvement in the \"Families and Friends\" event and a complimentary museum and Clue Crew membership will sustain, support and encourage future visits to the museum.  Participants' change in science knowledge and attitudes, performance in science subjects, career planning and support system to pursue interest in science will be monitored as part of the project evaluation.  The evaluation design could serve as a model for studying informal science learning in a museum setting.",
