 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is to develop a dynamical\r\ntheory of how neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) generate a\r\ntuned response to multiple (rather than single) features of a\r\nvisual stimulus, and how these responses are spatially integrated\r\nacross the cortex to generate more global information about a\r\nvisual scene.  A primary focus of the work is to extend current\r\nnetwork models of orientation tuning to incorporate the fact that\r\nV1 cells are also selective for spatial frequency.  This is\r\nmotivated by the considerable physiological and psychophysical\r\nevidence suggesting that cortical circuits carry out a localized\r\ntwo-dimensional Fourier decomposition of a stimulus rather than\r\nsimply performing local edge detection.  Optical imaging of the\r\nsurface of cortex has revealed an intricate relationship between\r\nthe distribution of orientation and spatial frequency preferences\r\nacross cortex.  How correlations between these two feature\r\npreference maps is manifested by the local and long-range\r\ncircuitry of V1, and the consequences for the large-scale\r\ndynamics of V1 is also investigated.\r\n     The primary visual cortex (V1) located at the back of the\r\nbrain is the first cortical area to process visual information\r\nreceived from the eyes.  One of the classical results regarding\r\nthe function of neurons (brain cells) in V1 is that they analyze\r\nvery local features of a visual image, that is, they carry out\r\nimage decomposition. (For example, V1 cells are sensitive to the\r\norientation of an edge representing the boundary between a light\r\nand dark region of the image.  This discovery by Hubel and Wiesel\r\nled to the Nobel prize in medicine).  A very important question\r\nthat follows from this is how our coherent perception of the\r\nworld is reconstructed.  Until recently, it was thought that the\r\nlocal information from cells in V1 was passed through higher\r\norder processing stages in the brain where cognition occurs.\r\nHowever, it is becoming clear that long-range circuitry within V1\r\ncould itself contribute to the process of reconstruction.  The\r\nbasic aim of the proposal is to investigate this process by\r\ndeveloping a large-scale mathematical model of primary visual\r\ncortex that incorporates the latest anatomical data regarding its\r\ninternal circuitry.  Understanding how early stages in the visual\r\nbrain encode images has important applications to information\r\ntechnology (such as the development of artificial vision systems)\r\nand biotechnology (such as the development of an artificial\r\nprosthesis for the visually impaired).  In the latter case it\r\nmight be possible one day to artificially stimulate primary\r\nvisual cortex to induce a visual sensation, rather like a\r\ncontrolled visual hallucination.\r\n\r\n",
