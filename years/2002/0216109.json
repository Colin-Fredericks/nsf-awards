 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) facility for the improvement of research and student learning at Wayne State University (WSU) will be established through this grant. The major instrument to be purchased, Dimension 3100 SPM with Nanoscope IV control station, will be shared among researchers from five departments spanning two colleges.  This investment addresses a critical need for surface characterization in many projects funded by the National Science Foundation at WSU and provides an advanced tool for materials study in our undergraduate and graduate curricula. \r\n\r\nNanoscale science and engineering has emerged as a principal research thrust at WSU as evidenced by well-funded efforts in 1) nanoparticles, nanostructures, and devices for optical and magnetic applications, 2) protein, tissue, and biomaterial coating and engineering, and 3) encapsulation using biological or biologically inspired materials.  In each of these domains, the SPM technique is an indispensable tool for elucidating and comprehending structure at the nanometer scale.  The establishment of a centralized SPM laboratory with an additional SPM instrument with new, state-of-the-art features should allow us to build on our current strengths in interfacial and nanostructured materials research, increase individual research productivities, and foster collaborative research.\r\n\r\nA laboratory dedicated to SPM research will be established in the WSU College of Engineering to house the Dimension 3100 SPM and the current Nanoscope IIIa SPM.  This laboratory will be made accessible to all principal investigators and other users. The computers will be networked so that the SPM image files can be easily accessed.  This updated SPM facility will complement other existing material characterization instrumentation such as NMR, mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, optical microscopy and spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.  A microscopist at the postdoctoral level will be hired in order to oversee the installation, maintenance, and training of researchers\r\n\r\nThe estimated number of researchers and students impacted by this proposal annually consists of 11 senior users, 5 postdoctoral associates, 20 graduate students, and over 100 undergraduate students.  The impacted external research funding amounts to approximately $1,000,000 annually.\r\n",
