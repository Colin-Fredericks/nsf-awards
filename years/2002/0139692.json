 "awd_abstract_narration": "0139692\t\r\nHillery\r\nQuantum information is a new field that studies the representation and \r\nprocessing of information by quantum mechanical systems.  Present computers, \r\nwhich are classical devices, represent information by bits, which can be \r\neither 0 or 1.  A quantum computer represents information by qubits, which  \r\nhave the potential to be 0 and 1 simultaneously.  This leads to profound \r\ndifferences in what can be done with classical and quantum information.  In \r\nthis project we will study programmable quantum information processing logic \r\ncircuits.  Most of the quantum circuits that have been proposed so far \r\nperform a single task.  It is essential to go beyond this and to be able to \r\ndesign circuits with two inputs, one the data to be acted upon and the \r\nsecond, the program, that encodes the operation be performed.  Both the data \r\nand the program are quantum states.  These circuits can be either \r\ndeterministic, succeeding in performing the desired operation all of the \r\ntime, or probabilistic, performing the operation only some of the time.  \r\nProbabilistic circuits can perform a much larger class of operations than can \r\ndeterministic ones.  We want to study how one can design circuits to perform \r\nspecific sets of operations, how these operations are to best be encoded into \r\nquantum states, and how to optimize the probability of successfully \r\nperforming the desired operation in a probabilistic processor.\r\n",
