 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a rapid, heat sink mounting technology that produces a metallic bond between the heat sink and the microelectronic device. The metallic bond is far superior to current mounting technologies in its thermal conduction and its mechanical strength. The proposed technology for mounting heat sinks onto substrates and chips is a reactive joining process that uses reactive multilayer foils as local heat sources for melting solders or brazes. The foils are a new class of nano-engineered materials, in which self- propagating exothermic reactions can be ignited at room temperature with a spark. By inserting a multilayer foil between two solder (or braze) layers and two components, heat generated by the reaction in the foil melts the solder and consequently bonds the components. This new method of soldering eliminates the need for a furnace and, with very localized heating, avoids thermal damage to the microelectronic device. The resulting metallic joints are stronger and far more thermally conductive than common, commercial mounting technologies (greases, pads and epoxies). The reactive bonding process is also far more rapid than most of these technologies, offering substantial savings in processing time and convenience. Phase I research will (1) demonstrate the feasibility of this mounting process, (2) characterize the thermal and mechanical properties of the resulting interfaces, and (3) develop a model that predicts thermal exposure of devices during the reactive mounting process.\r\n\r\nSuccessful development of this reactive mounting technology will advance the thermal management of microelectronic devices, and it will help accelerate future improvements in the performance of these devices. The world wide market for thermal management solutions is about $3.7 billion, with most of this market being outsourced. The trends in the computer industry are towards smaller devices with higher power dissipation, increasing the need for superior thermal management.",
