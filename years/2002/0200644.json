One of objectives\r\nis to develop techniques for studying free boundary problems\r\narising in the models of compressible fluid dynamics, in\r\nparticular to study existence, uniqueness and stability of\r\nmultidimensional transonic shocks for Euler equations for\r\nsteady and self-similar potential flows. Euler equations can\r\nbe written as a single second order, nonlinear elliptic-hyperbolic\r\nequation of mixed type for the velocity potential, if the flow\r\nis steady or self-similar. Transonic shocks are discontinuities\r\nin the gradient of the solution such that the type of equation\r\nchanges from hyperbolic to elliptic across the shock surface.\r\nTransonic shocks arise in many situations of physical importance\r\n(steady supersonic flows around an obstacle, shock reflection for\r\nself-similar flows). (2) Monge-Kantorovich mass transfer problem.\r\nThe questions to study include geometric and measure-theoretic\r\nproperties of solutions, and applications to partial differential\r\nequations.\r\n\r\nFree boundary problems arise naturally in many models in physics,\r\nfluid dynamics, economics. Free boundaries correspond to sharp\r\nchanges in the variables describing the problem. Significant\r\nprogress has been made during last several decades in the study\r\nof free boundary problems. However in the case of nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations many important questions are yet to be studied.\r\nThis is the first theme of the project. Better understanding of\r\nproperties of free boundaries, such as stability, makes possible to\r\nunderstand complex phenomena in models and applications. We plan to\r\nstudy transonic shocks in a flow of compressible fluid or gas.\r\nAnother area of the project is optimal transportation problem.\r\nRecently many fundamental properties and important applications of\r\nthis problem within and beyond mathematics were discovered, in\r\nparticular its connections to nonlinear partial differential\r\nequations, and applications in models for front formation in the\r\natmosphere, kinetic  theory, fluid flow, elastic crystals, granular\r\nmaterials, and microeconomic decision problems. We plan to work\r\non theory and applications of optimal transportation problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
