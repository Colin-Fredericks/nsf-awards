 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops time-domain solvers for wave propagation problems\r\nin two and three dimensions, with fundamentally improved properties,\r\nnamely, significantly  reduced sampling requirements and, at the same time,\r\nsignificantly higher accuracy. Such solvers would allow modeling of linear and, eventually, nonlinear\r\nwave propagation in domains that are thousands of characteristic wavelengths\r\nin size, with interfaces and variable coefficients.\r\nThis approach would also provide improved bases for solving\r\nnonlinear advection-diffusion problems.  The solvers are built upon two\r\nnew techniques, namely, optimal quadratures to represent bandlimited functions, and a numerical generalization of separation of variables to accelerate applying higher-dimensional operators.  Each\r\ntechnique contains the potential to significantly advance computational\r\nscience across a wide range of applications.  Together they provide a\r\nnew paradigm that efficiently organizes the information contained in\r\noperators governing physical phenomena.  This project develops these techniques\r\nfurther, and develops multiresolution representations for operators and\r\nfunctions, based on the optimal quadratures.\r\n\r\nAny computational modeling of natural phenomena requires discretization\r\nof the underlying mathematical equations. This project addresses questions of\r\noptimality and efficiency of such discretizations, and of organization\r\no information for two important modeling areas, wave propagation and\r\ngeophysical fluid dynamics.  This research aims to generate a much wider use of\r\nefficient techniques for representing information in scientific modeling, and to\r\nincrease the speed and accuracy of simulations by up to two orders of magnitude,\r\nwith foreseeable benefits to such areas as seismology, remote sensing,\r\nacoustics, optics, geophysical fluid dynamics, and quantum chemistry. It would\r\nreduce the computational cost of obtaining high accuracy, which is necessary to\r\ndescribe phenomena that are highly sensitive to changes in physical\r\nparameters, and that often cause technological bottlenecks.\r\nThis Collaborative Research is led by the Department of Applied\r\nMathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and includes the Department of\r\nMeteorology at the University of Maryland at College Park.  It will fund\r\none research associate, two visiting scientists from UMD and Ohio\r\nUniversity, and one graduate student in a diverse research group that includes a\r\nresearch associate, two postdoctoral researchers, a graduate student, and four\r\nundergraduate students.\r\n\r\n",
