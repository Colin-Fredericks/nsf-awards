 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Douglas Soltis of University of Florida and Mr.\r\nMichael Zanis of Washington State University to investigate the genes governing flower\r\ndevelopment in \"primitive\" flowering plants. Much is known about the genetics of\r\nflower development in the higher flowering plants, Arabidopsis (thale cress) and\r\nAntirrhinum (snapdragon). In contrast, little is known about the genetics of flower\r\ndevelopment in primitive flowering plants. Dr. Soltis and Mr. Zanis are focusing on\r\nisolating and characterizing MADS-box genes, a family of development regulatory genes,\r\nfrom two primitive flowering plants, Nuphar (a member of the waterlily family) and\r\nIllicium (a member of the star anise family). They have developed a method for\r\nextracting RNA from Nuphar and Illicium flowers, and are using degenerate polymerase\r\nchain raction (PCR) to amplify and obtain DNA sequences of MADS-box genes. The\r\nrelationships of the MADS-box genes isolated from Nuphar and Illicium are compared to\r\nMADS-box genes isolated from other flowering plants. Lastly, using RT-PCR Dr. Soltis\r\nand Mr. Zanis are characterizing the floral tissues in which the MADS-box genes are\r\nexpressed.\r\nUnderstanding the genes involved in flower development in primitive flowering\r\nplants, such as Nuphar and Illicium, is critical because of the insights they may provide\r\ninto the early angiosperm flower. Moreover, elucidating the genetics of floral\r\ndevelopment in these key flowering plants not only will help to answer questions\r\nregarding the origin and diversification of the flower, but will also provide the\r\nopportunity to link what is known about model flowering plant systems, such as\r\nAntirrhinum and Arabidopsis, with other flowering plants, providing a more\r\ncomprehensive picture of floral development.",
