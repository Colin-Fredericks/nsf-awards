 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nPI: Nikolaos Kazantzis \r\nInstitution:  Worcester Polytechnic Institute\r\nProposal Number: 0131809\r\n\r\nThe main area of the planned research project is the development of a systematic, comprehensive and practical framework for digital monitoring, and fault detection and isolation (FDI), of chemical, biochemical, microelectronics, etc. manufacturing facilities.  In particular, the primary objectives include:\r\n(i) The study of the fundamental problem of the design of reliable robust digital model-based monitoring and FDI systems for nonlinear processes in the presence of model uncertainty and unknown disturbances.\r\n(ii) The development of the appropriate software tools for the effective digital implementation of the planned process monitoring and FDI scheme.\r\n(iii) The real-time experimental implementation of the results of the aforementioned theoretical and computational studies on a pilot-scale polymerization reactor, as well as a bioreactor.\r\n\r\nAn integral part of this project is the realization of educational goals that could complement and enrich these research activities.  Aligned with the principles and vision of an innovative educational framework being developed at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), the primary educational objectives are:\r\n(i) The formulation of open-ended projects with a concrete flavor and orientation towards process dynamic modeling, monitoring and diagnostics, that will be jointly defined by professional practitioners in industry and the PI.  These projects will be conducted on the industrial site, and occasionally, in an international setting.\r\n(ii) The utilization of recent advancements in computing and communications technology in order to provide a virtual learning environment that can (a) enhance the learning experience of current WPI students by elucidating key concepts in process modeling, dynamics, monitoring and diagnostics through animation and advanced graphics, and (b) be remotely accessed by educational institutions in socioeconomically distressed zones in the state of Massachusetts with a large minority student population.  The objective is to provide direct remote access to real, as well as a virtual process control, monitoring and diagnostics laboratory, in order to enhance scientific literacy and awareness, and to broaden current educational opportunities for those who need them most.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
