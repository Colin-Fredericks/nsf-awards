 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased computing power allows for three dimensional models to be represented as digital images, which can be manipulated quite easily. Such advanced computer imaging affects many professions, and is expected to result in fundamental changes in the way those professions organize and conduct their work. This research will study the way that Frank O. Gehry and his firm of architects uses three-dimensional computer modeling in the design of buildings and the changes that it creates in his architectural practice and in the construction companies that participate with him in his building projects. It will study both the Frank Gehry firm, Gehry Partners, as well as key contractors, consultants and subcontractors involved in the construction of several of his most innovative building designs. The objective is to understand how innovation in work practices, technology use and organizational structures accompany the use of advanced three-dimensional computer imaging in both the Gehry Partners' firm as well as the contractors, consultants and subcontractors associated with his projects. The objective is to determine whether or not his innovative designs serve as a path creating event for his firm and companies working on his projects. \r\n\r\nPath creating events are building projects that require a firm to break from the standard routines established in its industry and develop new approaches to doing its work. An hypothesis to be explored in this research is that the designs by Gehry Partners require innovation in work practices, technology use, and organization structures by those associated with his building projects. Another hypothesis is that the path-creating behaviors developed for work on his projects is carried over by the construction firms into other subsequent projects that they work on, including those designed by other architects. This is a different approach to the study of innovation, since most prior studies have either followed the invention and development of a particular technology over time, or have followed how a given technology is adopted by a population of firms. Here, innovation is conceptualized as a cascading wake that is initiated by path creating designs and is carried over in multiple forms to other aspects of an industry (in this case the construction industry). The benefit is a better understanding of how innovation takes place across firms and the network of innovation that is spawned by the adoption of advanced computer technologies in a profession such as architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
