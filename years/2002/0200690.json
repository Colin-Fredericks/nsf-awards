Johnson and Gilles Pisier, PIs\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators will investigate problems in the \r\ntheories of Banach spaces and operator spaces. The problems \r\nto be considered fall into several subcategories; namely,\r\naffine approximation of Lipschitz functions, non linear\r\ninfinite dimensional and finite dimensional geometry, finite \r\ndimensional subspaces of Lebesgue spaces, measures on infinite \r\ndimensional spaces,  similarity theory, tensor products of \r\noperator spaces, bounded and completely bounded approximation \r\nproperties, and amenability of spaces of operators. There will \r\nbe coordination of the proposed project with the existing \r\nWorkshop in Linear Analysis and Probability Theory at Texas A&M \r\nUniversity.  This Workshop encourages interactions among \r\nresearchers and apprentices in different mathematical \r\nfields by bringing together graduate  students, young \r\ninvestigators, and junior and senior postdoctoral  participants \r\nin several areas of analysis.  \r\n\r\nBanach space theory, the study of notions of \"distance\" which \r\nare not necessarily Euclidean on both finite and infinite \r\ndimensional vector spaces, forms the basis for both Euclidean \r\nand non-Euclidean geometry and the analytic geometry of infinite \r\ndimensional function spaces, including the space of continuous \r\nnumerical functions on an interval as well as more complicated \r\nclasses of functions.  From the beginning, the ideas at the \r\nroot of Quantum Mechanics have had a major impact on mathematics, \r\nstimulating the study of operators and their spectrum instead of \r\nnumerical functions. These ideas have led recently to the new \r\nfield of \"Quantized Functional Analysis\" or \"Operator Space \r\nTheory\" and this development has led to the solution of several \r\nmajor problems as well as opened new avenues of research. \r\nAnalogously, the non linear geometry of Banach spaces \r\nalso is a rather recent development which is beginning to have \r\nconsiderable impact in geometrical analysis in both the finite \r\nand infinite dimensional settings. \r\n\r\n",
