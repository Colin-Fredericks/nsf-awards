 "awd_abstract_narration": "9877118\r\nChen\r\nMIT\r\nStudy of Natural Ventilation in Buildings by Large Eddy Simulation\r\n\r\nU.S. buildings use about onethird of the total energy used in the nation, and\r\nthe Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAQ systems in the buildings\r\nuse a major part of it. The use of HVAC systems does not necessarily create a\r\nmore comfortable and healthy indoor environment. On the other hand, natural\r\nventilation generally improves indoor air quality, provides the occupants a\r\nhigh comfort level, and saves the energy used by the HVAC systems. The U.S. has\r\na great potential to use natural ventilation. In many regions in the U.S., no\r\nair-conditioning system is needed during the summer with proper natural\r\nventilation. This will save the first costs of the airconditioning systems.\r\n\r\nThe overall objectives of the proposed research are to develop a reliable\r\nmethod to study natural ventilation in buildings, and to study the impact of\r\nthe thermal and geometrical conditions in buildings on natural ventilation. \r\nThe empirical data and equations available in literature are not suitable for\r\naccurate estimation of natural ventilation. The study of natural ventilation\r\nrequires either experimental measurements or computer simulations. The\r\nexperimental approach needs a wind tunnel to study the airflow around buildings\r\nand a full-scale environmental chamber to study the airflow in buildings.\r\nAlthough the approach can generate reliable data, it is expensive and time\r\nconsuming. The computational approach includes Direct Numerical Simulation\r\n(DNS), Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation modeling and Large Eddy\r\nSimulation (LES). DNS requires a computer not available at present. RANS is not\r\naccurate enough and cannot predict single-side natural ventilation. Only LES\r\nseems most appropriate for natural ventilation study.\r\n\r\nThe investigation will develop a reliable Sub-Grid-Scale model for LES. The new\r\nSGS model will be validated by the experimental data from the literature and an\r\nenvironmental chamber. Then the validated LES model will be used to study the\r\nimpact of thermal and geometrical conditions of a building on natural\r\nventilation. The thermal conditions to be studied are:  forced convection (no\r\nthermal buoyancy); natural convection (no wind); and mixed convection (the\r\nmomentum force due to the wind is comparable to the buoyant force due to the\r\nheat gain in the building and the solar radiation on the outside of the\r\nbuilding).  The geometrical conditions to be studied are cross natural\r\nventilation (an indoor space with openings in two or more walls) and\r\nsingle-side natural ventilation (an indoor space with only one opening)\r\n\r\nThe LES program will calculate instantaneous and averaged distributions of air\r\npressure, air velocity, air temperature, and contaminant concentrations, such\r\nas CO 2, in and around the building. The study is to understand how momentum\r\nand buoyancy forces can change the airflow pattern and pressure distribution\r\naround the building and how natural ventilation is interacted with the building\r\nopening location. The results are useful to determine the ventilation rate as a\r\nfunction of the flow Reynolds and Grashof numbers. Measurements in a wind\r\ntunnel at a Taiwanese university and in the environmental chamber will be\r\nconducted to further validate the computed results.\r\n\r\nA Chinese university will conduct on site measurements in an actual apartment\r\nbuilding in Beijing. The LES model will be used to simulate the situations\r\nmeasured on site. The LES results are useful to analyze the impact of wind\r\nvelocity and direction on natural ventilation, the impact of thermal buoyancy\r\non natural ventilation, and the feasibility to design single-side ventilation\r\n\r\nLES should be a next-generation tool to study natural ventilation in buildings.\r\nThe results of this project will provide detailed and accurate information to\r\nanalyze indoor air quality and thermal comfort in buildings with natural\r\nventilation. The results present a scientific basis to architects and HVAC\r\nengineers to design healthy and comfortable buildings and to save energy used\r\nby the HVAC systems. This will increase occupants' productivity and efficiency.\r\n",
