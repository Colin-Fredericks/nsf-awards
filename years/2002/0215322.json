 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at developing a micro optical switch array that implements the principle of electro-wetting-on-dielectric, a liquid micro-actuation mechanism based on the electrical control of surface tension on dielectric surfaces, for use in optical telecommunications and optical computing. While MOEMS devices move solid micro-mirrors, liquid actuation is attractive because of the compactness of the device and absence of the stiction problem inherent in solid-solid surface contact. Currently, a couple of companies use liquids for their optical devices. Compared with their liquid-based optical MEMS under development, which use thermal energy to move liquid, electrical control of surface tension (i.e., electro-wetting) is especially promising because of its unprecedented energy efficiency (estimated ~10 W during switching with < 30 V) and reliability. Unlike other electro-wetting principles the proposed electro-wetting-on-dielectric driving promises high speed and long-term reliability, which are critical for commercial success. \r\n\r\nThe electro-wetting-on-dielectric micro optical switch arrays will find use within any system requiring optical signal routing such as optical computers, optical instrumentation, distributed sensors, and medical monitoring.",
