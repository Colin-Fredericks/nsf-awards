We will focus on two key run-time issues for performance: dynamic resource management and scaling.  Dynamic resource management allows:  (i) resources to be {de-} allocated to service requests on-the-fly, (ii) resources to be acquired via negotiation, and (iii) resources to be shared across inter-service domains.  Resource management will be based on a performance estimation technique that learns service execution time as function of dependent inputs and resources allocated.  We will produce a set of next generation tools and libraries that can be leveraged by community services running in single-site clusters and in multi-site Grids.  The toolset will be evaluated by applying it to several high-end network services in the area of visualization, astronomy, and bioinformatics.\r\n",
