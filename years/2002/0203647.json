For 2), he  has \r\nstudied the class of compact Kaehler manifolds with nonpositive bisectional curvature. \r\nUnder some additional non-degenerateness assumption, he was able to obtain a structural \r\nresult for such manifolds, which can be viewed as the dual version of classical \r\nHoward-Smyth-Wu splitting theorem. He would like to study the general case, as well as \r\nsome other related  questions regarding this type of manifolds. For topic 3), he proposes \r\nto study two metric rigidity questions about  the complex hyper!\r\nbolic space, in dimension two or higher. One is a non-equivariant metric rigidity \r\nquestion for quarter-pinched metrics, the other is for some special type of CAT(0) \r\nsingular metrics.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research lies in the field of differential geometry, which is a branch \r\nof mathematics aimed at understanding the interplay between the global structure and\r\nthe curvature (which measures the bending) of a given space. The major models of spaces \r\nin this study are Riemannian manifolds and Kaehler manifolds. This field is of importance\r\nnot only to many branches of mathematics, but also to other sciences and engineering such \r\nas physics. A well known example is the use of Riemannian geometry in Einstein's theory of\r\n the general relativity. Another example is that the modern control theory uses almost \r\nexclusively tools developed in differential geometry. Within the field of differential \r\ngeometry, the study of nonpositively curved spaces and the rigidity phenomenon often \r\nassociated with such spaces has been on the center stage since early 70's, after the \r\ndiscovery of Mostow and Margulis. It has drawn much attention in 80's and 90's from the \r\nmathematical world. The proposer and others are trying to investigate these topics for \r\nKaehler manifolds, which are  Riemannian manifolds with a special type of structure. \r\nThe recent development in string theory suggests that the universe is the ten dimensional \r\nproduct space of the usual (four dimensional) space time and a compact six dimensional\r\ncross section which should be a special kind of Kaehler manifold (the so-called Calabi-Yau \r\nspaces). Besides reasons and existing/potential application outside mathematics, Kaehler \r\ngeometry has become more of more important within many fields of pure and \r\napplied mathematics.   \r\n",
