 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNA-binding proteins are critically important to many regulatory processes in the cell. The\r\nlargest family of RNA-binding proteins carries one of more RNA recognition motif domains\r\n(RRMs). RRM-containing proteins occur in all living organisms, and play a role in most\r\nprocesses involving RNA, including splicing, RNA export, translation, and mRNA decay. U1A\r\nis a spliceosomal protein that carries two RRMs. Its N-terminal RRM mediates tight and specific\r\nbinding to its RNA hairpin target (U1hpII)in U1 small nuclear RNA. U1A is one of the most\r\nextensively studied RNA-binding proteins and has been used as a paradigm for specific and tight\r\nRNA recognition by RRM-type proteins.  However,  to date the knowledge of the mechanism of\r\nRNA-binding by U1A and other RNA-binding proteins has been largely limited to a static\r\nimage, in which the dynamics underlying the interactions are poorly understood. This project is\r\naimed at obtaining detailed kinetic insight into the U1A/U1hpII interaction using powerful state-\r\nof-the-art BIACORE technology to observe, in real time, the assembly and dissociation of the\r\nRNA/protein complex.  Analysis of the kinetics of the U1A/U1hpII interaction will help elucidate\r\nthe sequence of events that occurs during binding. More importantly, it will also provide general\r\ninsights into the dynamics of RNA/protein interactions, an area that has thus far remained largely\r\nunexplored. Knowledge of the kinetics of RNA/protein interactions is highly relevant, since\r\nbiological systems are dynamic; the rates of binding and release can affect the sequential\r\nassembly of RNA/protein complexes and the function and intracellular localization of RNA-\r\nbinding proteins, as well as their ability to compete for binding sites on RNA.",
