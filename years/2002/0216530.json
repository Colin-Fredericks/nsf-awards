 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing a detailed knowledge of advanced solid state, biological, bioengineering, and environmental materials formation and behavior will facilitate a broad array of advanced technologies. Wide ranging advances can be engineered based on an enhanced understanding of natural and artificial materials and related processes. An essential component of advancing this understanding is in situ and ex situ observation down to the nanoscale, without significantly affecting the mechanisms and materials observed. The combination of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; 2nm resolution), with environmental control (up to 10 torr), temperature control (-186 oC to 1,000 oC), orientational imaging (e.g., phase and grain boundary characterization), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (elemental analysis and mapping) provide such an opportunity. The objective of this proposal is to acquire an environmental FESEM. This E-FESEM system will be used to advance our mechanistic understanding of a wide range of multidisciplinary materials and reaction processes through nanoscale observation and elemental/biochemical and structural analysis. In particular, the E-FESEM will be utilized to support projects in the following research areas: (i) solid-state materials and processes (e.g., nanomaterials formation, nanolithography, chemical vapor deposition, and materials corrosion), (ii) biological materials and processes (e.g., cytoskeletal organization, fertilization, and photosynthesis), (iii) biomaterials and processes (e.g., tissue interface engineering, photosynthetic and photo-detection systems), and (iv) environmental materials and processes (e.g., atmospheric aerosols, mineral weathering and carbonation, including CO2 sequestration, and astrobiological systems).\r\n\r\nASU is very well placed to provide full research, research training and educational access to this nanoscale laboratory. The instrument will be operated as a user facility within the Center for High Resolution Electron Microscopy, with access being provided to all qualified users. The proposed system will be fully integrated with the Goldwater Materials Visualization Facility (GMVF). The GMVF (http://gmsl.eas.asu.edu/gmvf) will house 20 copies of the associated image, elemental and structural analysis software, enabling broad access to this advanced research tool, both in the GMVF and via the internet and vBNS networks. This broad, off-instrument, software access will allow the microscope to be dedicated to full-time image and data acquisition. Simultaneously, up to 20 researchers/students will be able to perform image, elemental and structural data analysis. This capability will allow the diverse multidisciplinary research group using the system to integrate their research into the classroom, including on-line system observation. Students will be empowered to do hands-on, cutting-edge research image and data analysis in the classroom/laboratory setting (e.g., in graduate laboratory courses, which already heavily use the GMVF and the integrated capabilities of the Goldwater Materials Science Laboratories). \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of the controlled-temperature E-FESEM will substantially advance the multidisciplinary research and educational goals of a broad range of departments, centers, and programs at ASU. These units include the Departments of Bioengineering, Biology, Chemical & Materials Engineering, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Geological Sciences, Plant Biology, and Physics & Astronomy, as well as the Center for Solid State Science (CSSS) and the Astrobiology Program. This breadth of interest, together with the broad system access provided by the Visualization Facility, will bring the excitement of a wide range of multidisciplinary cutting edge research to university, and even pre-university, classrooms via the internet and high bandwidth vBNS networks.\r\n",
