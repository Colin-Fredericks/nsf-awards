Dickens Illinois Institute of Technology End-to-End Performance Modeling of Applications Executing in the Internet2 Domain\r\n\r\n\tThe objective of this research project is to advance the state-of-the-art in modeling and simulation to the point that the Internet2 network infrastructure and protocols, the high-performance applications that are and will be developed within this environment, and the interactions between these individual components can be studied, Analyzed, and predicted.  This project will provide significant support to both systems engineers, and application developers and users.  From a systems point of view, it will provide and environment in which new and existing networking hardware and software can be tested and studied as a function of expected (and observed) application types and loads on the system.  From the point of view of an application, this research will support its performance and scalability analysis as a function of its execution environment.\r\n\r\n",
