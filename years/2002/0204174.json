In this sense, modeling viscoelastic fluid behavior provides a fundamental explanation of the structure of polymer products such as fibers and films. Advances in the  finite element computational methodologies for simulating the fiber and film process is a recent development in polymer industries.\r\nThe goal of this work is to introduce mathematical optimization techniques into the nu-merical simulation of viscoelastic fluid, in order to determine optimal process conditions for polymer products. Two research projects are involved in the proposal: film casting and a vorticity minimization problem. The overall strategy will be to integrate recently developed viscoelastic models and optimization techniques in order to meet objectives through various control mechanisms such as shape control and boundary control. As an equation solver for the film casting problem, the commercial software package Poly ow, which simulates film and fiber processing in various settings, will be used. For the other problem, a finite element code\r\ncurrently under development will be used. In solving the optimization problems, recent results\r\nfrom current research will be extended to the more general and high dimensional viscoelastic\r\nregime.",
