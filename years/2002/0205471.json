 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional computer architecture has been based on and dominated by the\r\ncapacity poor systems we were forced to build 20 and 50 years ago.  For\r\nover three decades, the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) has formed the\r\nbasic architectural abstraction for scalability.  As wonderful as the ISA\r\nabstraction has been, its range of utility is coming to an end.  Our\r\nsystems have grown orders of magnitude in size and speed, and many of the\r\nsimplifying assumptions which underly the ISA are limiting forward\r\nscalability rather than enabling them.  This effort explores a\r\nreformulation of our basic assumptions and machine abstractions to\r\naccommodate the large capacity computing systems we can now build.  Whereas\r\nthe sequence of primitive instructions was the core fixed point in ISA\r\nmodel, this effort proposes stream-connected graphs as the model fixed\r\npoint for these Decentralized Streaming Architectures (DSA).  This way\r\ncommunication is abstracted directly in the architecture facilitating\r\nparallelism and optimization for physical locality.  DSA will give us a\r\nsingle, unifying system model for future computing systems which scales\r\nfrom modest, single-chip, single-processor systems, to multiprocessor ICs,\r\nto a wide range of heterogeneous System-on-a-Chip designs, to large-scale,\r\nheterogeneous, multi-component systems that evolve over decade long\r\nlifecycles.\r\n",
