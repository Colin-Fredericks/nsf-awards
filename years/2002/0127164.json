 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nFuture teachers are expected to understand how past and current research fits together into a structure of knowledge, at the same time as they learn how to model scientific inquiry. This project bridges science research and teaching practice with Video and Image Data Access (VIDA), a collection of digital science images for prospective K-6 teachers. The VIDA database of annotated science research images builds upon knowledge from CIELO, a database for art history courses at California State University, to create a science image project that is partnering with BioSci Education Network (BEN). Project objectives are to (1) identify content areas where images can best support learning by prospective K-6 teachers, (2) build a database of digital images from research that can be shared and analyzed in an inquiry approach, (3) catalogue the images into a meaningful hierarchy with text annotations to make them searchable, (4) assist prospective K-6 teachers to achieve subject matter information competence in science, (5) provide a prototype database that can be adapted by other institutions to link prospective teachers with the science research community through the use of images from modern research. The VIDA images serve as a starting point to develop questioning strategies about systems, scale, constancy, and change. VIDA gives prospective teachers a role in contributing annotated images using a controlled science vocabulary by providing a clearly defined database structure and a cataloging manual written for K-6 teachers. VIDA helps K-6 teachers understand how a database can be used for inquiry, while making it possible to share the excitement of current research and complement hands-on inquiry through the use of images.\r\n",
