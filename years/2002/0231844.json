 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides staff support for the AMPATH project. This project in advanced networking infrastructure and an international exchange point for research and education is based in Miami, Florida at Florida International University (FIU).  The project will connect at least 10 countries' National or Regional Research and Education Networks (NRENS), and will provide advanced networking connectivity to US e-Science applications and major instrumentation interests in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The future work plan objectives proposed will assist information sharing between the region and US scientific researchers and educators, using Internet based computational grids and major research instrumentation.\r\n \r\nThe specific work plan includes objectives to: \r\n(1) Enable and support strategic US-led projects in South and Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean \r\n(2) Connect the NRENs in the AMPATH Service Area to the global R&E networking community  \r\n(3) Develop an outreach and dissemination program through conferences, workshops and other channels to increase awareness of AMPATH and its benefit to the global R&E networking community \r\n(4) Develop a technology plan that will enable the AMPATH network to support e-Science and experimental networks \r\n\r\nThe proposal uses \"The August, 2001 AMPATH Workshop Report\" prepared by a committee of US researchers, as the foundation of its funding request.  To launch the AMPATH project, Global Crossing donated 10 DS3 (45 Mbps) circuits for three-year periods, staggered depending on the connection date of each NREN.  Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies and Juniper Networks donated carrier-class network equipment; and Terremark Worldwide, Inc. donated collocation space in the NAP Of The Americas.  Since June 2001, the AMPATH project has connected three National Research and Education Networks in South America: REUNA of Chile, RNP of Brazil, and RETINA of Argentina; the Academic Network of Sao Paolo, ANSP5, which is a State-funded network; the University of Puerto Rico; the Arecibo observatory; and the Gemini-South telescope.  The NRENs of Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Peru and Venezuela remain to be connected to the project.  The final DS3 is to connect the R&E network of the US Virgin Islands, primarily targeted to the distributed campuses of the University of the Virgin Islands.  \r\n\r\nUntil funding is received this work is done on a best-effort basis by the PI and Co-PI, the Chief Network Engineer and the International Coordinator for the AMPATH project.  NSF will establish a significant piece of international infrastructure by funding this project and connecting NRENS for the region.\r\n",
