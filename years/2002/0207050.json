 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smirnova\r\n0207050\r\n     The investigator and her colleague aim to develop\r\ntheoretically a novel method, the DSM-dynamical system method,\r\nfor solving a wide variety of linear and nonlinear ill-posed\r\nproblems, to implement algorithms based on this method, and to\r\ndemonstrate the advantages of this method in efficiency and\r\naccuracy.  The DSM method is used as a general approach to the\r\nconstruction of regularizing algorithms for solving ill-posed\r\nproblems, i.e. a stopping rule is developed: a rule for choosing\r\nthat moment of time at which the value of the solution to the\r\nbasic evolution equation stably approximates the solution to the\r\noriginal ill-posed equation in the case when the data are given\r\nwith some error.  Applications of different versions of the DSM\r\nare considered to classical ill-posed problems of computational\r\nmathematics, such as stable differentiation of noisy data, stable\r\ninversion of ill-conditioned matrices, and to nonlinear inverse\r\nproblems arising in geophysics, quantum physics, medicine, remote\r\nsensing in technology, and other applied areas.  The DSM with\r\nsimultaneous updates of the inverse derivative operator without\r\nactual inverting of this operator is developed for solving\r\nnonlinear ill-posed problems.  The DSM is used as a general method\r\nfor constructing convergent iterative processes for solving\r\nill-posed operator equations.  Namely, convergent discretization\r\nschemes for solving the basic evolution equation of the DSM\r\nprovide convergent iterative methods for solving the original\r\nequation.  The DSM is developed for unbounded operators, which do\r\nnot have continuous inverse operators, and also for a nonlinear\r\noperators whose derivative is a Fredholm operator with nontrivial\r\nnull-space.\r\n     The area of ill-posed (unstable) problems is extremely\r\ndifficult, because solutions to ill-posed problems are very\r\nsensitive to small variation in input data.  For that reason\r\nill-posed problems cannot be solved by classical methods: the\r\ncorresponding numerical procedures for them turn out to be\r\ndivergent.  However, ill-posed problems are frequently encountered\r\nin many branches of natural sciences and engineering:\r\nastrophysics, geophysics, spectroscopy, plasma diagnostics,\r\ncomputerized tomography, antenna design, optimal design of\r\ntechnical systems and engineering constructions, optimal\r\nplanning, optimal control over various processes, and many other\r\nfields.  Mathematical statements of these problems are given in\r\nthe form of operator equations of the first kind, problems of\r\nfunctional minimization, problems of determining values of\r\nunbounded operators, variational inequalities, and so on.  The\r\nproject develops computational methods that provide more accurate\r\nsolutions to a wide range of ill-posed problems.  The investigator\r\nalso uses the results in the graduate courses on ill-posed and\r\ninverse problems she teaches at Georgia State University.\r\nFinally, because ill-posed problems are of basic importance in\r\napplications, the results are of wide use in engineering and\r\napplied sciences.\r\n",
