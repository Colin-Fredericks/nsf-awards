Two new courses and several revised courses include material from Adaptive Reasoning Theory, Genetic Algorithms, Human Behavior Representation, and Simulation Meta-modeling. The objectives of this CRCD project include:  1. Incorporating current state-of-the-art Machine Learning research results into the undergraduate and first year graduate curriculum to enhance students' critical thinking, intellectual growth and communication skills, 2. Offering a unique curriculum, by traditional undergraduate standards, where the PIs integrate their current research results into the curriculum. This curriculum is timely and dynamic, reflecting the PIs' and the machine learning community's research interest changes with time, 3. Offering the opportunity to a multi-disciplinary group of students (spanning the spectrum of electrical, computer, industrial, civil, mechanical, and computer science students) to benefit from research and its transfer into curricula, 4. Assessing and evaluating the educational impact of the project through a sequence of carefully chosen evaluation instruments developed by an educational consultant, and 5. Disseminating the curriculum development efforts to a number of affiliate Universities. \r\n\r\n",
