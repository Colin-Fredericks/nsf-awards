 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Focused Research Group project includes investigators\r\nfrom three different universities: Luca Dieci at Georgia\r\nInstitute of Technology, Michal Jolly at Indiana University, and\r\nErik Van Vleck at the University of Kansas.  The project\r\nconsiders the approximation of Lyapunov exponents and other\r\nspectral information for dynamical systems.  The main goal is to\r\nstudy and implement numerical techniques to approximate Lyapunov\r\nexponents of continuous dynamical systems, as defined by a system\r\nof time dependent differential equations.  The investigators are\r\nimplementing and comparing so-called continuous and discrete QR\r\nand SVD approaches.  They distinguish between linear and nonlinear\r\nproblems, the chief difference being that in the linear case no\r\napproximation of solution trajectory is attempted.  The\r\ninvestigators study Lyapunov exponents for systems of large\r\ndimension, such as spatially discretized time dependent PDEs.  In\r\nparticular, they consider PDEs for which an inertial manifold is\r\nknown to exist, and study the relative merits of techniques that\r\ncompute the exponents after a prior inertial manifold reduction\r\nversus those that work with the full (spatially discretized) PDE.\r\nMethods that use the Jacobian and Jacobian-free methods are\r\ncompared.  The investigators also develop general purpose\r\nalgorithms and software for approximation of Lyapunov exponents\r\nand aim to include the algorithms within standard software for\r\ndifferential equations.\r\n     In many areas of science and engineering, physical and\r\nbiological systems are modeled with differential equations.  In a\r\nnutshell, a differential equation is a rule specifying how a\r\ngiven initial state of the system evolves into future states.  In\r\npractice, we are given the differential equation and the initial\r\nstate, and need to find the solution (i.e., the evolution of the\r\ninitial condition).  Realistic models depend on parameters and\r\nthe solution of the differential equation will of course depend\r\non the values of the parameters as well.  The ultimate goal of\r\nthis project is to provide scientists with quantitive means of\r\nassessing the dependency of solutions with respect to variations\r\nof the initial state or the parameters in the problem.  Lyapunov\r\nexponents, and other related \"spectral quantities,\" do exactly\r\nthis.  A chief effort of the investigators is the development of\r\nalgorithms and computational software for approximation of\r\nLyapunov exponents and other spectra.",
