 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to acquire the equipment needed to complete an interdisciplinary structural dynamics test facility. The requested equipment consists of a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer, a shake table control system, a spectrum analyzer, and various vibration transducers. This equipment will be used in conjunction with existing major laboratory equipment which consists of large capacity horizontal and vertical shake tables, a vibration isolation table, multiple holographic test systems, and a tension/compression testing machine. This facility will provide long-term research and training capabilities to ISU and the state of Idaho by providing a sophisticated structural dynamics laboratory that will support many areas of research. The research will have wide application to engineering disciplines ranging from aerospace, civil, mechanical, environmental, and electrical. Existing research projects that will use this equipment consist of the development of noise control techniques, development of optical based small displacement measurement techniques, material integrity testing, vibration control of building structures and components, building structure response due to earthquakes and/or explosives, and static and dynamic soil testing. Other related and unrelated areas of research will be generated, as the research facility becomes better known by researchers throughout the state. Researchers from the Idaho National Engineering and\r\nEnvironmental Laboratory (INEEL), local and state industry, the Measurement and Control Engineering Research Center (MCERC), as well as researchers from multiple colleges at ISU will use and benefit from this equipment.  Furthermore, the laboratory will be used for K-12 student tours and undergraduate and graduate research. This facility will also significantly enhance the experimental testing background and training that our students currently receive in our two graduate programs in Measurement and Control Engineering and Engineering Structures and Mechanics.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
