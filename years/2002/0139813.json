 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two main approches to motivic (co-)homology appearing in\r\nrecent years. First, one tries to construct it as cohomology groups\r\nof certain complexes with terms being given by explicit\r\ngenerators and relations generalizing Milnor's K-groups. Second, one\r\ncan construct cohomology of a scheme as cohomology of a complex\r\ndefined in terms of algebraic cycles thus generalizing the classical\r\ndefintion of Chow groups. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\r\nDr. Jianqiang Zhao's research will continue his work\r\non understanding both approaches by using\r\npolylogarithms and their generalizations. \r\nPolylogarithms have been around for centuries in one form or\r\nanother, but only recently has their whole theory become available. \r\nThey have deep connections with both number theory and modern \r\nmathematical physics. This project should shed light on these connections. \r\n\r\nThis research is in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, \r\na subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number\r\ntheory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures \r\nthat could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, \r\nnamely polynomials. Number theory\r\nis the study of numbers that can be expressed in\r\nterms of whole numbers, 1, 2, 3... In the second half\r\nof last century these two seemingly far apart subjects have produced \r\ntremendous impact on each other. The field of arithmetic algebraic \r\ngeometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics.\r\n\r\n",
