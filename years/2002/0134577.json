 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a wide range of scholarly and educational \r\nprojects related to the principal investigator's research interests \r\nin Number Theory. With regards to his own research, the investigator \r\nplans to study, among other topics, partitions and modular forms, \r\nGaussian hypergeometric series, character sums, varieties over \r\nfinite fields, polynomial-exponential equations, and thedivisors of \r\nmodular forms.  In addition to his own research, the investigator \r\nwill develop a number of new outreach and educational programs at \r\nthe high school and undergraduate levels, and will become involved in \r\ntraining programs at more advanced levels.  Specifically, the \r\ninvestigator will direct workshops for high school students and high \r\nschool teachers, will support programs for talented undergraduate \r\nstudents, and will provide enhanced opportunities for \r\ngraduate students and postdoctoral fellows.\r\n\r\nNumber Theory is a very old branch of mathematics which has \r\nits roots in the study of the whole numbers.  In modern times it \r\nhas become an important tool in many applied endeavors.  For example, \r\nsystems which enable secure transmission of data over the internet \r\nare based on Number Theory, as are error correcting codes for \r\nreliable data transmission.  The Faculty Early Career Development \r\n(CAREER) Program supports the early development of academic faculty \r\nboth as educators and as researchers.  The program emphasizes the \r\ndevelopment of full, balanced academic careers.  This award will \r\nallow the investigator to further develop his ongoing program of \r\nresearch in Number Theory.  It will also support the investigator's \r\nbroadly based educational and outreach efforts at the high school, \r\nundergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.\r\n\t",
