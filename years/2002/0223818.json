Greenberg, University of Maryland College Park and Indian collaborator Ashok K. Mishra, Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Tharamani will explore the fundamental issues of mathematical physics that lie at the heart of quantum mechanics.  In recent years, physicists have begun to study and apply \"new\" forms of statistics that are beyond the conventional fermi and bose statistics.  The collaborators will study the new statistics with particular regard to their applicability to some basic postulates in physics that, due to technological advances, can now be tested to high precision through experiment.       \r\n\r\nScope:  This collaboration is likely to bring about interesting advances in mathematical physics.  It will also initiate a new partnership between the University of Maryland and the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a premier center for research in theoretical physics.  India has a tradition of excellence in this field that includes S.N. Bose's contributions to particle statistics (Bose-Einstein statistics).  At best, this collaboration will enable each scientist to bring a distinct cultural perspective to their research on the statistics of elementary particles.  This project is supported by the Indian Department of Science & Technology (DST)under the NSF/DST joint program.",
