 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds for a Small Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal to support a rapid-response study to isolate and evaluate the sedimentologic and geomorphic impact of Hurricane Michelle on the coastal systems of Andros Island, Bahamas using ultra-high resolution remote sensing data calibrated by field observations. Pre-storm ultra-high resolution remote sensing data are available to the PI and serve as a baseline for comparison. Differences between the pre-storm data and the post-storm data acquired through this funding will serve as focal points for a week of field work that will characterize the geomorphic and sedimentologic attributes of the changes. By integrating the map patterns of change and their sedimentologic characteristics, we will develop models for the impact of major storms on the stability of coastal systems, including but not limited to the shoreline. These changes will also be compared with historical changes (~60 year) recently documented by the PI.\r\n\r\nResults of this study will have implications for the stability of shorelines and entire coastal systems landward of the shoreline, the parameters that control the evolution of these systems, and the interpretation of the geologic record of tidal flats. The need for rapid acquisition of the ultra-high resolution remote sensing data and the field validation to assess the hurricane's impact make this proposal appropriate for an SGER.\r\n",
