 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThroughout the Pacific Northwest there currently exist numerous organizations providing\r\nvaluable but uncoordinated activities and support services related to motivating and supporting\r\ngirls interest in SMET careers. Twenty such organizations in Washington State alone.\r\nThe activities of these groups are not coordinated and in fact, some groups appear to be in\r\ncompetition for access to girls and to resources, particularly for resources from the corporate\r\ncommunity. This funding source, in the face of recent layoffs, is less inclined to support such\r\nprograms. Under these circumstances it becomes increasingly important to coordinate existing\r\nand evolving activities to effectively utilize resources.\r\nThis project includes three primary activities:\r\n\r\nDissemination and Outreach: In partnership with the Northwest Girls Coalition,\r\ndocument and promote coordination and collaboration among girl serving SMET\r\nprograms in Washington and Oregon and establish an on-going communication system\r\nlinking these organizations.\r\n\r\nCreation of a Program Evaluation Rubric: In collaboration with the Northwest\r\nRegional Educational Lab create a program rubric reflecting best practice models and\r\nprogram assessment tool based on the rubric.\r\n\r\nMini-Grants: With the support of Washington and Oregon MESA, we will offer mini-\r\ngrants to a minimum of twenty-two girl-serving STEM focused programs to support\r\ncollaboration, assessment activities and projects related to addressing gaps and overlaps in\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe project is under the guidance of a Champions Board made up of individuals such as Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Washington, current presidents of the state Math and Science teacher associations, and representatives from both the Washington and Oregon state education departments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
