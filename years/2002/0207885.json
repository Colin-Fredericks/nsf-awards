 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Copper Mountain Conference Series, begun in 1983, is held in early April at Copper Mountain, Colorado; the subject of these meetings alternates yearly between Multigrid Methods and Iterative Methods.  The Series is an important forum for the exchange of ideas in these two closely related fields.  The meetings are planned for five days, with sessions consisting of individual talks of approximately a half hour each.   By tradition, these conferences will have an egalitarian style with no invited talks and student presentations put on equal footing with all others. One of the main goals is to enhance the participation in this meeting by students, women, and minority mathematicians.  This is accomplished through a student paper competition, and a special fund to augment travel support for women and minority mathematicians.\r\n\r\nSeveral topics of emphasis have been selected for this Series: the coming conferences will emphasize advanced architectures (reflecting a heightened interest due to multiprocessor computing), algebraic methods (spurred by the recent advent of very large discrete problems arising from unstructured grids), eigenvalue problems (where recent trends include robust parallel implementations of classical methods),  and preconditioning (where great improvements have come from domain decomposition or parallel approximate inverses). One important feature of the multigrid conference series is the use of tutorials. The series has featured half-day tutorials on basic multigrid, algebraic multigrid, multigrid for parallel computers, and cache-aware multigrid.  Other important features of the conference proceedings include preliminary proceedings, given out upon registration, and special issues of major journals (SIAM SISC, ETNA, etc.) devoted to the conferences.",
