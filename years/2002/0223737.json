Organized by the ACM SIGSOFT, the Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE-10), will be held in Charleston, South Carolina, November 20-22, 2002. Its organizing committee for 2002 developed a plan to help increase the participation of faculty from institutions with a large minority and/or female student enrollment. Faculty actively involved with the education of women and minorities will be invited to attend FSE-10 tutorials and conference. Institutions that include Historically Black Colleges, current and former women's colleges, and other colleges with large minority enrollments will be targeted. As part of the tutorial series, tutorials will be provided for the selected faculty that contribute in teaching and stimulating interests in software engineering. The effort is expected to transitively develop the student's interest.\r\n",
