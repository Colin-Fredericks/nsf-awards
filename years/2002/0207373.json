 "awd_abstract_narration": "Descriptive Complexity measures the richness of a language or sentence\r\nneeded to describe a given property. The languages are variants of\r\nfirst-order logic and their targets are finite, ordered structures.  There\r\nis a profound relationship between the traditional computational complexity\r\nof a problem and the descriptive complexity of the problem; indeed, all\r\nmajor complexity classes have been shown to have natural descriptive\r\ncharacterizations.  This means that complexity can be understood entirely\r\nfrom a logical point of view.  As a consequence, important new\r\nunderstandings about complexity have arisen from the descriptive point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe current research involves three major topics: (a) The theory of dynamic\r\ncomplexity, which is especially appropriate for database complexity, is\r\nbeing studied.  Complete problems for dynamic complexity classes are being\r\ndeveloped and the complexity of important dynamic problems such as graph\r\nreachability are being investigated; (b) Promising new methods for proving\r\nlower bounds techniques on the descriptive complexity of problems have been\r\ndeveloped and are now being extended; and finally, (c) A Descriptive\r\nProgramming environment is being developed in which the computational\r\ncomplexity of checking whether an input satisfies the properties being\r\ndescribed can be read from the face of the description.\r\n\r\n",
