 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-insert libraries of genomic DNA are a valuable resource for comparative studies in\r\ndevelopment evolution and genetics for addressing such fundamental questions in biology as\r\nhow genomes have evolved and how evolution of genomes has resulted in evolution of body\r\nplans. The goal of the proposed research is to construct 11 BAC libraries representative of the\r\nbreadth of the Metazoa. The focus is on animals that occupy phylogenetic positions key to an\r\nunderstanding of animal evolution. Preference is given to organisms with demonstrated potential\r\nas developmental model organisms. Therefore, 2 deuterostomes have been chosen: lamprey,\r\nbasal in the craniates and pivotal for understanding the pattern of gene and chromosomal\r\nduplications during vertebrate evolution, and the cephalochordate amphioxus, the closest living\r\ninvertebrate relative of the vertebrates. On the basis of molecular phylogenetics, the protostomes\r\nhave recently been divided into two groups, the Ecdysozoa and the Lophotrochozoa. However,\r\nbranching patterns of the phyla within each of these groups are poorly resolved. Because\r\nrepresentatives of the Ecdysozoa, Drosophila and Caenorhabditis have been well-studied, we\r\nhave not chosen any Ecdysozoan. For the Lophotrochozoa, which have, in general, received little\r\nattention in regard to genes, development and evolution, seven organisms have been chosen.\r\nThese include 2 annelids, one of which, the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii, is relatively basal\r\nwithin the annelids and the other of which, the leech Helobdella robusta, is more highly derived.\r\nPlatynereis is rapidly becoming a lophotrochozoan model developmental organism, and while\r\nthe leech is quite derived, it has been the object of developmental genetic studies for some years.\r\nTwo molluscs are included-- one bivalve, (Spisula solidissima) and one gastropod (Ilyanassa\r\nobsoleta). The other Lophotrochozoans include 1 nemertean (Cerebratulus lacteus), 1 sipunculid\r\n(Temiste langiformis), and 1 acoel flatworm (Neochildea fusca). The phylogenetic position of\r\nthe acoels is controversial. On the basis of morphology, they were considered basal Bilateria.\r\nHowever, most, but not all, molecular phylogenetic analyses place acoels within the protostomes.\r\nTo address bilaterian origins, we have chosen a ctenophore (Mnemiopsis leidyi). Finally, to\r\naddress the origin of the metazoa, a sponge, Callyspongia diffusa, a representative of the most\r\nbasal Metazoa, was selected. BAC libraries will be constructed and distributed by P. de Jong\r\n(Children's Hospital Research Institute, Oakland), who has a long track-record in construction of\r\nBAC libraries, including making the BAC library for the human genome project. For organisms\r\nfor which interest is high to sequence the entire genome, 15X coverage is proposed. For others,\r\n10X coverage is proposed.",
