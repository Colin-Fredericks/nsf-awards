 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) A new optics initiative at Calvin College is providing students with marketable technical\r\ntraining in the optical sciences and introduces an optics concentration and an optical-\r\ntechnology minor into the physics curriculum. The programs target students in physics\r\nand engineering, as well as pre-service teachers preparing to teach science in high school.\r\nCurricular changes include the reconfiguration of several physics courses and the\r\nintroduction of an intermediate-level course entitled Phys 246: Waves, Optics, and\r\nOptical Technology. Based on a mentor/apprentice pedagogical model, this course will\r\nmake use of a fully integrated lab-plus-lecture format, an approach with which Calvin's\r\nscience-education specialists have already had great success in courses for pre-service\r\nelementary school teachers. The new pedagogical method will also influence the way in\r\nwhich students are mentored in a new upper-level lab course, Phys 383-384: Advanced\r\nOptics Laboratory. The project involves adaptations of labs for both the intermediate\r\nand the advanced courses, so that the optics initiative can effectively address its two-fold\r\ngoal of cultivating technological knowledge and skill and providing a fresh model of\r\nteaching by hands-on inquiry.\r\nThe labs are adapted from labs used at other institutions and from the\r\nresearch projects of the PI and Co-PI. The curriculum for Phys 246 is taken largely from\r\na course at the University of Maryland taught by Dr. Wendell T. Hill, who is\r\nproviding advice on a continuing basis. Certain individual labs (at both intermediate and\r\nadvanced levels) are based on existing experiments and input from faculty at Caltech,\r\nHarvard, Harvey Mudd College, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\r\nStill others are a natural outgrowth of the PI's research on laser-cooled and trapped\r\natoms and plasma diagnostics and the Co-PI's research on diode-laser applications and\r\nspectroscopy.\r\n",
