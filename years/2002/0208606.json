 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conditional branches are expensive.  Branches require a significant\r\npercentage of the execution cycles since they occur frequently and can\r\ncause pipeline stalls.  In addition, branches result in forks in the\r\ncontrol flow, which can prevent other code-improving transformations\r\nfrom being applied.  We plan to develop path profile-based techniques\r\nfor replacing the execution of a set of two or more branches with a\r\nsingle branch on a conventional scalar processor.  We propose to\r\nimprove performance by merging the conditions of two or more branches\r\ninto a single condition.  Previous approaches have accomplished\r\nsuch merging of conditions that have either only involved a single\r\nvariable or have required special hardware to merge multiple\r\nconditions together.  Techniques will be developed to produce a merged\r\ncondition involving multiple variables that can be used to bypass the\r\ncode testing the original set of conditions on a conventional processor.\r\nMerging conditions may be very good fit for run-time optimization\r\nsystems, which optimize frequently executed paths during the execution\r\nof a program.\r\n",
