 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to construct an integrated accessible microscopical\r\nworkstation that will allow students with disabilities to independently perform common\r\nbiological laboratory techniques, thereby enabling individuals to actively participate in\r\nscientific experimentation and the opportunity to pursue a career in the SMET fields.\r\nThis multi-purpose workstation is to be used primarily by persons with mobility\r\nimpairments. All aspects of the integrated workstation will be operated from a central\r\ncomputer interface, which will be used to automatically control and monitor external\r\nperipheral devices so that biological experiments can be performed. Using a computer\r\nas the user interface and central control of the accessible laboratory workstation is\r\nideal, because the personal computer can accommodate various disabilities using\r\ndifferent pointing devices and accessibility software utilities. Total keystroke control of\r\nthe integrated workstation will be emphasized.\r\nThe intent of this proposal is to develop an accessible laboratory workstation that will\r\nallow students and investigators with mobility impairments to perform the majority of\r\nmicroscopical and histological laboratory procedures, most notably in the biological\r\nsciences, with minimal assistance and setup. The integrated microscopy workstation\r\nwill use software to control all features of operation, including an automated\r\nmicroscope, motorized stage, bulk slide autoloader, and digital video camera. The\r\nworkstation will allow a student with a disability to independently load up to fifty\r\nindividual slides, focus, change objectives, filter wheels, illuminator and condensor, and\r\nposition the microscopy specimen translationally in X and Y directions and rotationally\r\nusing theta control - all controlled through a computer that will also capture images of\r\nthe histological tissues to be managed and analyzed for anatomical studies. Thus, the\r\nonly assistance the student with a disability requires is for someone to load the slides.\r\nAll other phases of microscopy and image analysis can be performed without further\r\nassistance.\r\nThe accessible microscopy workstation will be evaluated both in a classroom setting\r\nthat performs typical undergraduate and post-graduate biological experimentation and\r\nin research laboratory setting that performs sophisticated laboratory procedures. Ten\r\nhigh school and college students with a range of mobility impairments will be assessed\r\nin the first year by their ability to use a computer and their specific ergonomics relating\r\nto the construction of the accessible workstation. In the second year the students will\r\nbe tested on their ability to use the workstation to accomplish a variety of laboratory\r\nprocedures. Educators will also be queried as to their capability of incorporating the\r\nworkstation into the classroom environment.\r\nUniversity and local high school educators and Special Education specialists and\r\nstatewide organizations, like the Council of Volunteers/Organizations for Hoosiers with\r\nDisabilities (COVOH) and Assisting Technology through Awareness in Indiana\r\n(ATTAIN), which advocate the use of assistive technologies for persons with disabilities,\r\nwill be utilized to disseminate findings and promote the use of the integrated microscopy\r\nworkstation.",
