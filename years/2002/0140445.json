 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the theory of algebraic cobordism, \r\nrecently constructed by the investigor and F. Morel, as well \r\nas generalized cohomology theories for algebraic varieties \r\nand schemes, the relation of rational equivalence in the \r\nMorel-Voevodsky  algebraic-homotopy category, and a refinement \r\nof Asakura's arithmetic Hodge cohomology. The investigator \r\nattempts to construct a theory of higher algebraic cobordism, \r\nalong the lines of Bloch's higher Chow groups, examines the \r\ncategory of cobordism motives, and tries to give a theory of \r\nalgebraic higher elliptic genera. In addition, the investigator \r\nexamines the generalization of the motivic cohomology to K-theory\r\nspectral sequence to other cohomology theories on algebraic \r\nvarieties, and considers the relationship of this spectral \r\nsequence to the slice spectral sequence of Voevodsky, using the \r\nnotion of rational equivalence in the algebraic homotopy category. \r\nFinally the investigator defines a variation of Asakura's \r\narithmetic Hodge cohomology and uses this to construct an infinite\r\nsequence of cohomology theories which conjecturely give a better \r\nand better approximation to motivic cohomology.\r\n\r\nThe investigator's research involves a mixture of algebraic \r\ngeometry and algebraic topology. Algebraic geometry is the study \r\nof solutions of equations using both algebra and geometry. For \r\nexample, one can study a circle by examining its equation, or by \r\nlooking at its geometric properties. Algebraic topology studies \r\nspaces by attaching algebraic invariants to them, invariants which \r\ncan often be computed explicitly.   The investigator takes methods \r\nand constructions in algebraic topology, and then modifies and \r\nrefines them so that they can be used to define algebraic versions \r\nof the topological invariants. These new algebraic invariants are \r\nthen applicable for studying subtle properties of solutions of \r\nequations.\r\n",
