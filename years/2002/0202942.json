 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisville Area Science and Mathematics Alliance for Recruitment and Teacher Education Reform (LA-SMARTER) brings together the University of Louisville (U of L), Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) and 10 school districts of the Ohio Valley Educational Cooperative (OVEC). Its goal is to ensure that the Louisville area has an adequate number of qualified and certified middle and high school teachers of mathematics and science over the next decade. To meet this general goal, LA-SMARTER is building a model teacher education program in mathematics and science education with an accessible alternative certification option; Preparing at least 50 certified middle and high school mathematics and science teachers in the greater Louisville area in the next three years; and Building a support system in four schools for prospective and new teachers that extends beyond preparation and induction experiences. In support of these objectives, LA-SMARTER is (a) enriching mathematics and science courses in the teacher education program; (b) establishing an accessible alternative certification program for non-traditional students; (c) implementing an aggressive recruitment plan; and (d) creating a support system for new teachers that ensures retention in teaching beyond five years. \r\nThe Alliance is using teams of mathematicians, scientists, mathematics and science educators, and exemplary middle and high school teachers to develop four mathematics and science courses that help prospective teachers develop a deep understanding of the content that they will teach. It has established and is supporting professional development teams (PDTs) in two middle schools and two high schools. These teams are comprised of a mathematics or science educator, all teachers in the mathematics or science departments, and a group of three or more student teachers in mathematics and science. Mathematicians and scientists will work with PDTs as needed. The Alliance employs a full-time faculty member in the College of Arts and Sciences to recruit and advise students and coordinate courses. This faculty member is recruiting into both traditional and alternative certification programs, focusing on students majoring in biology, chemistry, geology, mathematics, and physics and students who have withdrawn from the College of Engineering. Also LA-SMARTER has established a team of staff members from partner schools and the University to develop and distribute print materials explaining the certification programs in mathematics and science, and to actively recruit persons in mathematics and science teaching. This project is also recruiting and creating a pool of emergency-certified teachers that subsequently complete a one- or two-year alternative certification program in middle or high school mathematics or science. \r\n",
