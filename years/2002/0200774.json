 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI intends to undertake a combinatorial study of structures\r\narising from affine algebras with applications to mathematical\r\nphysics, representation theory and q-series.\r\nThe primary combinatorial objects are crystal graphs which are\r\ncolored directed graphs. They provide a combinatorial\r\ndescription of the deep theory of crystal bases of modules over\r\nquantized universal enveloping algebras developed by Kashiwara\r\nand Lusztig: As the quantum parameter q tends to zero,\r\nthese bases are described precisely by the crystal graphs encoding\r\nnearly all the essential algebraic data. Despite their importance,\r\nlittle is known about the combinatorial structure of crystals\r\ncorresponding to finite-dimensional modules of affine algebras.\r\nThe PI proposes a method to undertake such a combinatorial study.\r\nThese studies will have applications to q-series, branching\r\nfunctions and fusion coefficients in conformal field theory and\r\nstatistical mechanics, and the theory of symmetric functions.\r\n\r\nThis is a project in combinatorial representation theory with \r\napplications to mathematical (theoretical) physics.  Representation\r\nTheory is the area of mathematics most intimately involved with\r\nstudying the nature of symmetries, of any sort, whereever they occur.\r\nCombinatorial representation theory refers to a methodology that\r\nuses explicitly computable formulas.  About a decade ago it was\r\nrealized that certain models in the area of physics known as\r\nstatistical mechanics have symmetries that are not yet completely\r\nunderstood.  This project carries out a\r\ncombinatorial study of the structure of those classes of symmetries\r\nthat can be represented by \"colored directed graphs.\"\r\nRemarkably, the structures that occur have applications in\r\nmany diverse areas of mathematics and physics,\r\nsuch as statistical mechanical models, representation theory,\r\nthe theory of symmetric functions and combinatorics. For example,\r\nthey lead to formulas which encode the\r\nparticle structure of the underlying physical model.",
