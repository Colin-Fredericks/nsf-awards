Most of our students in this associate degree program enter the workforce upon graduation and become involved in environmental testing and chemical analyses in a laboratory setting. Our goal is to better prepare students to meet these challenges by adapting and implementing computer-aided laboratory experiments into our curriculum. These experiments allow students to integrate and reinforce chemical concepts learned in the classroom with real-life experiences. Kinetics is a difficult concept for students to grasp and often requires exploring the topic through various modalities. We are using our UV/VIS to do kinetics experiments in which the students visually track changes in chemical reactions in real time. \r\n",
