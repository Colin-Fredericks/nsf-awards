Ernst\r\n\r\nEnsuring software correctness, modifying software, and many other software\r\nengineering tasks are greatly eased by the presence of specifications that\r\ndocument program behavior.  Unfortunately, specifications are usually\r\nabsent, leading to problems with program understanding and maintenance.\r\nThis research extends work in automatically generating (inferring) partial\r\nprogram specifications from program executions.  The research goals are to\r\ndetect conditional invariants (implications) that are true only sometimes,\r\nto scale the technology, to enable online processing, to investigate new\r\ninference strategies, to improve usability, to evaluate via experiments and\r\ncase studies, to integrate the techniques and tools into education, and to\r\ntransfer technology to industry.  The research has three broad impacts: (1)\r\nit explains, advances, and evaluates the theory and practice of automatic\r\ngeneration of program specifications; (2) it enables easier, more\r\neffective, and broader use of specifications, by automating generation of\r\npartial specifications and by extending their scope to likely (as opposed\r\nto guaranteed) properties; and (3) it applies specifications to specific\r\nprogram tasks via new techniques and tools for program modification,\r\ntesting, reuse, and documentation.  Evaluation includes theoretical\r\nevaluations of the accuracy of the underlying techniques, case studies of\r\nsubstantial software projects, and controlled experiments to determine the\r\nefficacy of the resulting tools.\r\n",
