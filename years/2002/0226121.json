 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research studies the interaction between dynamical\r\nsystems and geometry.  Work of Furstenberg, Mostow and Margulis\r\nshows that understanding certain dynamical systems is an\r\nimportant tool in the study geometric properties of symmetric and\r\nlocally symmetric spaces. .  One important property of symmetric\r\nspaces is that they have non-positive curvature.  The\r\ninvestigator plans to extend this work in several inter-related\r\ndirections.  The study of symmetric spaces will be generalized to\r\ninclude more general spaces of non-positive curvature as well as\r\nmore general maps between symmetric spaces.  This raises the\r\npossibility of purely dynamical applications. The group of\r\ndiffeomorphisms of a compact manifold acts on the space of\r\nsquare-integrable Riemannian metrics, which is naturally an\r\ninfinite-dimensional space of non-positive curvature.  The\r\ninvestigator will attempt to exploit these relationships to prove\r\nlong-standing conjectures of Zimmer.\r\n\r\nDynamical systems is an important and relatively young field of\r\nmathematics that investigates the evolution of physical or\r\nmathematical systems over time (e.g. fluid flow).  New ideas from\r\ndynamical systems theory such as chaos and fractals have had a\r\nprofound impact on our perception of the world.  One of the\r\ndeepest and most influential mathematical applications of\r\ndynamical systems has been the study of geometric properties of\r\nspaces with \"many symmetries\".  The proposed research will extend\r\nour understanding of this deep connection between geometry and\r\ndynamics.",
