The project creates innovative educational programs that link teaching and research and promote interactions among undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty members. \r\n\r\nAt the undergraduate level, the project will increase the number of mathematics majors, improve retention, and provide students with a deeper and more relevant educational experience. This will be accomplished by the introduction of new courses and seminars for beginning students, more focused advising, and much expanded efforts to foster undergraduate research.\r\n\r\nThe postdoctoral fellows supported by the VIGRE project will receive increased guidance as they continue to develop their teaching and research skills.  They will interact more extensively with undergraduate and graduate students, both through one-on-one mentoring and through seminars that they themselves will organize. \r\n\r\nThe VIGRE program will have a major impact on Georgia Tech's doctoral program in mathematics. Graduate trainees will be provided with full non-teaching support during their first year and during summers and portions of their later years. This will enable them to complete their degrees in a more timely fashion, and will also provide them with the added freedom needed to broaden their education by taking advantage of the many other strong programs at Georgia Tech. New seminars will smooth the transition from coursework to dissertation research.  Increased contact with undergraduate mathematics majors and the school's postdoctoral fellows will further diversify their training.  The VIGRE program will draw together the talents and energy of faculty members, postdoctoral fellows, undergraduates, and graduate students to create an integrated community of scholars dedicated to discovery and learning. \r\n",
