 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two main research directions in this project.\r\nThe first one is the continuation of the work on a \r\ngeneral theory of boundary values, in the sense of \r\nanalytic functionals or hyperfunctions. In its present \r\nstate this theory has clarified several points in the\r\nstudy of boundary values of functions, in particular\r\nviz the intrinsic character of the definitions. Points\r\nwhich they have clarified in the global setting need\r\nfurther study in the local version. A theory in the \r\nnon real analytic setting is still to be done. The \r\nsecond direction is at the confluent of pluri-potential\r\ntheory and complex geometry. A still remote goal is\r\nthe possible extension of Poletsky's theory of disks\r\nto the case of almost complex manifolds, whose role\r\nin Mathematics is rapidly growing. It also leads\r\nto the study of approximate solutions to the d-bar\r\noperator.\r\n\r\nThe primary field of this proposal is Several\r\nComplex Variables. This field is rich due to its\r\nconnections to many fields in Mathematics.\r\nThere is in particular a remarkable interplay between\r\nSeveral Complex Variables and the theory of\r\nPartial Differential Equations, which itself is\r\nthe most basic tool in the study of many processes\r\nin Physics and Engineering. The first direction discussed\r\nabove fits in that setting. In applications \r\nquantitative studies have often to be replaced \r\nby qualitative studies, either because  the\r\nquantitative study is too difficult or because the\r\nqualitative study is in fact more illuminating. This\r\nis where the field of Topology is essential.\r\nSeveral important connections exist between Several\r\nComplex Variables and Topology.  The second direction\r\ndiscussed above fits in that setting. Deformation theory\r\nis a major theme, in which the study of almost complex\r\nstructures has already played a crucial role.\r\n",
