 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Other (59)\r\nA common criticism of the teaching of undergraduate engineering statistics is that it is too academic in focus, excessively theoretical, and divorced from real problems that appear in industry. The purpose of this project is to teach statistics using activity-based learning. A one-semester lecture-based engineering statistics course is being re-engineered through the adaptation of an activity-based engineering statistics course currently offered at the Pennsylvania State University. The proposed course is being structured to include laboratories and workshops intermingled with activity-based lectures. The laboratory sessions are intended to provide the student with an opportunity to become proficient in designing experiments, collecting data, and analyzing problems using PC-based statistical software. Workshops are designed to involve short lecture segments mixed with team-based problem-solving activities and software tutorials. The development of the laboratory and workshop activities includes materials based upon the research and consulting activities of the investigators. Different engineering laboratories are being utilized for these activities. Working through a diverse set of engineering problems, the student are expected gain the confidence to apply statistical techniques to new and different situations and realize the role of statistics in engineering design.\r\n\r\nQuantitative and qualitative tools are being employed to assess and evaluate this project and its components at different times throughout the two-year project duration. Dissemination plan involves conference presentations, journal articles, course workbooks, and a project web site.\r\n",
