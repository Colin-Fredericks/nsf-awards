 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The objective of this project is to produce a collection of easy-to-administer, ready-to-use, classroom- and student-tested materials in electrostatics (electrically-charged objects, static electric fields, and electric potential) that can be used as classroom materials, web assignments, or homework assignments. In addition, pre/post- assessment tools in the same area are being developed. These focused materials will employ TIPERs (Tasks Inspired by Physics Education Research) that are easily incorporated partially or as a whole into existing courses and teaching styles. This second stage follows a similar project in magnetism and may be followed by incremental development in stages concentrating on areas such as thermodynamics, waves, and optics. This project is a collaboration between two-year college and university physics faculty from institutions that have diverse, representative student populations. This project team is experienced in educational research as well as developing and implementing new approaches to, and assessment of, learning. These materials are being classroom tested at several institutions and will be made available widely in both print and electronic versions. This project facilitates the incorporation and application of the results of physics education research into classrooms and thus improve the learning of physics by students at post-secondary education institutions.",
