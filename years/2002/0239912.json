 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grid technologies and middleware are in the process of transforming the way science will be conducted around the globe.  There are currently over 100 national and international grid projects involving many different disciplines, organizations, collaborators, facilities and instruments in literally dozens of countries.   Despite the extensive and on-going development of grids, tools, applications, and middleware, the long term viability  and persistence of these technologies is uncertain.  And, if these technologies and middleware can not be made persistent, it will not only threaten the future of science and research, but may severely impact the education community as well.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is sponsored by the Large Scale Networking Coordinating Group (LSN CG) of the Interagency Working Group in Information Technology Research and Development (IWG/IT R&D).  The IWG, which functions under the White House National Science and Technology Council, coordinates Federal multiagency IT R&D efforts.  The LSN CG agencies are AHRQ, DARPA, DOE ST, DOE NNSA, NASA, NIH, NIST, NSA, NOAA NSF, and ODDR&E.  The workshop is being planned and coordinated by the MAGIC Team of the LSN that includes representation from the IWG agencies,  the university and commercial communities, including international participants\r\n\r\nThe workshop's objectives are to develop a vision for middleware and Grid to enable science applications and cooperation (5 to 10 years out) and to identify needed Federal networking research to implement that vision.  The workshop is intended to obtain inputs from the university, commercial, and Federal research communities on needed research to enable middleware and Grids, resource and tool development, and the need for persistent infrastructure to support researchers using middleware and Grids and to carry out research on middleware and Grids.  The workshop results will be used to develop a Blueprint for Future Science Middleware and Grid Research and Infrastructure that can be used by the LSN Federal agencies in development of their research plans and programs.  The document will also be used to inform decision makers and researchers of the research needed in middleware and grids and the need for a persistent infrastructure to support their use.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the workshop will be focused on producing a document \"Blueprint for Future Science Middleware and Grid Research and Infrastructure,\" which will address the service and software infrastructure required for long-term, persistent, large scale Grid and Middleware-based technologies to meet the needs of education, research and science.\r\n\r\n",
