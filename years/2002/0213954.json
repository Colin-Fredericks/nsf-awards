 "awd_abstract_narration": "While it is well known that women have received lower wages than men throughout history, there is no agreement about how to interpret this fact.  Economists who believe that markets work generally assume that the difference in wages is a measure of the difference in productivity between men and women.  Historians are often more skeptical of markets, and many assume that these wage differences indicate that women were underpaid.  Unfortunately, little work has been done to test which of these hypotheses is closest to the truth.  This project tests which interpretation is correct by comparing wages to measures of productivity derived from an estimated production function.  Using farm accounts from English archives, this project creates a data set containing measures of outputs and inputs from a number of farms in early nineteenth-century England and uses this data set to estimate a production function, and thus the marginal productivity of male and female workers.  Once the relative productivity of female workers has been determined, comparison with their relative wages will show whether women were paid appropriate market wages or were underpaid. \r\n      The results of this study have implications for how we understand labor markets.  At issue is the question of whether wages are determined by social custom or by productivity.  It is clear that women were paid lower wages than men throughout most of history, but why they were paid lower wages is still an open question that this project will attempt to answer.  This project will leave other questions unanswered.  The production function can determine women's productivity relative to men's, but it cannot determine the reasons why women's productivity differed from men's.  This project tests for wage discrimination, which occurs if wages do not match the workers' productivity, but it does not test for discrimination in general.  Discrimination comes in many forms, including limited access to some occupations, and may exist even if women were not underpaid in farm labor.  \r\n",
