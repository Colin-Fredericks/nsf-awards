This will be the 16th of these national meetings.  NCBPS seeks to increase the diversity of the United State community of researchers and educators in physics and related fields by providing student participants with the motivation and practical skills to further their education and assimilation into the scientific and technical professions.  The NCBPS is annually attended by approximately 250 students, and is supported by a combination of gifts from foundations, national laboratories, industry, federal grants, and support from the host institution.  This award will provide direct support for the attendance of approximately 50 students.  Also meeting concurrently at A & M is the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP).  This format has proven to be highly effective and allows for joint meetings of the two groups, as well as separate meetings appropriate to the objectives of each group.\r\n\r\nThis award provides partial support for the National Conference of Black Physics Students (NCBPS), which will be held at Alabama A & M University on March 13-17.
