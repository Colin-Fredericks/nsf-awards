 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis application seeks support for a basic research symposium designed to stimulate a thorough discussion of areas of controversy in the field of vestibular physiology and related movement control.  Over the course of 2 and 1/2 days, there will be six workshops concerning active research areas.  We will bring together scientists interested in psychophysics, systems level neuroscience, and cellular and molecular mechanisms to facilitate discussions that incorporate a broad perspective.  This format will provide basic information to the field at large, help resolve issues by direct confrontation of scientists with disparate views and inform younger investigators about the important issues in the field that they are entering.  Indeed, the principal objective of this grant is to generate funds so that junior investigators and women and minority participants who are making exciting contributions to the field but who have limited travel funds may attend the meeting. An airing of the issues raised in this symposium will ultimately guide the clinical application of our knowledge in persons with balance and orientation problems, as well as a variety of motion-induced visual disorders.\r\n\r\n",
