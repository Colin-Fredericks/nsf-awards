 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the  annual meetings of the West Coast Bacterial Physiologists (WCBP) is to \r\nfoster communication  among  established investigators, postdoctoral fellows and  graduate \r\nstudents working in the broad area of microbial physiology.  Started in the 1940.s by C. B. van \r\nNiel for his associates on the West Coast, participants now come from Canada, the Midwest and \r\nthe East Coast of the USA. This is one of the few conferences in North America that have \r\nretained  a focus on microbial physiology, with a primary, but not exclusive, emphasis on the \r\nphysiology of prokaryotic microorganisms. The conference  especially  provides a forum for \r\ngraduate  students  and  postdoctoral  fellows  to  present  and  discuss  the  results  of  their  research \r\nprojects  utilizing  experimental  systems  ranging  from  model  organisms  to  those  of  specific \r\nrelevance to pathogenic and environmental microbiology. The conference has been held \r\ncontinuously since 1963 over a weekend in the middle of December at the Asilomar Conference \r\nCenter in Pacific Grove, California. \r\n \r\nThe annual meeting is announced in August and September by direct mailings and by posting on \r\nthe WCBP web site (http://wcbacterialphysiologists.ucdavis.edu). The meeting is organized with \r\nfour formal sessions (Friday evening, Saturday morning and evening, and Sunday morning) and \r\nfour unstructured informal sessions (Friday afternoon and late evening, and Saturday afternoon \r\nand late evening).  Each of the four formal sessions is initiated with a 45 min overview lecture. \r\nThe overview lectures  are endowed by the Genentech Corporation and  identified as the John \r\nIngraham  Lectures in  Microbial Physiology. The John  Ingraham  Lecturers may  be principle \r\ninvestigators, postdoctoral fellows or graduate students. They are selected by the conference co-\r\ndirectors on the basis of scientific merit and current high profile research topic of relevance to \r\nmicrobial physiologists. The overview lectures are followed by offered papers of 15 or 20 min \r\nduration. Typically, 7-9 and 5-7 offered papers are scheduled  for the  morning and evening \r\nsessions,  respectively,  depending  on  the  number  of  abstracts  submitted.  No  graduate  student \r\nsubmitting  an  abstract  has  been  denied  a  chance  to  present  her/his  data  and  conclusions.  A \r\nregistration fee covers lodging, food, meeting room expenses and support for the informal \r\nsessions. A differential between the registration fees for  graduate students and all other \r\nparticipants has traditionally been preserved. NSF funding will be applied to maintain at least a  \r\n20% lower registration fee for graduate students and go toward support of poster sessions, if the \r\nparticipants desire such sessions.",
