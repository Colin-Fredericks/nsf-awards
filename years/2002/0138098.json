Peters\r\n\r\nThe investigators will define new representations for \r\nintersecting spline surfaces within computer-aided design \r\n(CAD) geometric objects.  They will also create algorithms \r\nto compute error bounds for approximated intersections \r\nrepresenting topological boundaries.  Many modeling\r\ntechniques for geometric design depend upon reliable \r\nintersection algorithms.  Intersection algorithms will be \r\ndesigned to deliver spline-based CAD geometric models that \r\ncan be robustly used within a variety of engineering \r\ncalculations. These intersection representations and error \r\nbounds will significantly improve robustness between engineering \r\ndesign and computational applications for stress analysis, \r\nfluid dynamics and electromagnetics.  No single intersection representation or method will be appropriate for all \r\nintersection problems, similar to the mature view\r\ntaken in computational linear algebra relative to matrix \r\ninversion.  There, a matrix is first analyzed as to whether \r\nit is singular, ill-conditioned (as in the case of a Hilbert \r\nmatrix), positive-definite, etc.  For these approximated \r\nspline intersections, new guaranteed error bounds will be \r\ndeveloped, as well as corresponding new criteria for\r\nsemantic consistency of the intersection boundaries formed \r\nwithin spline-based geometric models.\r\n\r\nFor example, the significant improvements to approximated \r\nspline models from this project will provide clear benefits \r\nto science, industry, and defense.  The delivery of the \r\nBoeing 777 airplane has been hailed in the popular press \r\nas the first production of a 'paperless' airplane, meaning \r\nthat computerized models supplanted the traditional paper\r\ndrawings of the engineering design room.  While an impressive\r\nmilestone, the next ambitious step is to eliminate many of \r\nthe physical prototypes used for destructive testing\r\nand engineering analyses prior to releasing an airplane.  \r\nThese tests on physical prototypes are expensive.  An \r\nappealing, cost-effective alternative is to reliably \r\nsimulate the complex behavior of turbulence, stress and \r\nstrain on computerized geometric models of these aircraft.  \r\nProgress towards that goal has been delayed by inaccuracies \r\nintroduced in the geometric input to these simulations, \r\nspecifically along intersection boundaries, and improvement \r\nof such intersections is the primary focus of this project.  \r\nThis project will ensure relevance to these contemporary \r\naeronautical design problems by the participation of\r\nBoeing scientists and engineers.\r\n",
