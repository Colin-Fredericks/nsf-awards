 "awd_abstract_narration": "The automated interaction of computers with humans and the biosphere in which they reside represents an increasingly important attribute of computing in the information age. Identification is a critical component of this interaction whether the application be projection of human identity at a distance over the internet, criminal justice and forensics, or medical diagnostics and therapy delivery. Defined across this application spectrum, automated biometric identification systems measure a physiological, behavioral, or biological \"signature\" from the human body or environment, process and recognize\r\nclassifiable signal components, and then renders an identification decision based upon the parameters of a given application. Effectively addressing the breadth of needed biometric identification system research from the life sciences to the computing sciences represents a significant challenge to industry and government. Cohesive university faculty groups are particularly well suited to address innovations at this intersection of disciplines. The Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) organizes the activities of faculty groups at four universities spanning the physical, health, and computer sciences and\r\nengineering, to effectively address the cross-cutting research needed to address automated advance biometric identification technology and systems. CITeR will serve an enabling role in the technical and economic development of this area through research of new enabling technologies, the integrative training of scientists and engineers across its breadth, and the facilitation of the transfer of this technology to the private and government sectors. \r\n",
