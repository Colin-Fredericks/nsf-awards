 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nElectrochemiluminescence (ECL), combining elements of electrochemistry and photochemistry, involves the production of light near an electrode surface by species that can undergo highly energetic electron transfer reactions. ECL is a powerful technique that can be used to study a variety of analytes (e.g., organic, inorganic, biochemical). It is unfortunate that it is usually thought of as a tool only of the research and clinical laboratory since using analytical techniques that have \"real-world\" applications (e.g., in the clinical analysis of biomolecules) can greatly enhance teaching at the undergraduate level. We are adapting experiments from the research and educational literature and are developing new experiments, all of which use ECL techniques that can be carried out using an ECL analyzer. These experiments are being implemented in laboratory courses across our general chemistry and analytical curriculum, including courses for non-science majors and courses enrolling pre-service teachers. For example, in Fundamentals of Chemistry and in Chemistry for the Citizen students study claims about the purity of bottled water by determining the amount of copper in commercial water samples. Therefore, this state of the art instrument makes it possible for students to actually carry out environmental and water testing analyses. In Quantitative Analysis ECL allows the incorporation of quality assurance/quality control and regulatory issues into the undergraduate curriculum. Our goal is to have students gain experience with ECL techniques, and develop an appreciation for the applicability of these techniques to a wide range of problems. These improvements also reflect modern analytical science and emphasize the development of sound analytical technique while exposing students to the types of problems dealt with by professionals in the real world. A secondary goal is to modernize the undergraduate curriculum and to produce graduates who are competent in the use of modern instrumentation. The ECL analyzer also is being used in undergraduate research projects. Evaluation of the project will occur in a number of ways, including pre-and post-exposure assessment in the affected courses, and compilation of data from exit interviews with our senior majors. Procedures for the new experiments will be made available on the internet, and tested experiments will also be published in appropriate journals.\r\n",
