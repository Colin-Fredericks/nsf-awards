 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anna Scaglione\r\nCornell University\r\n\r\nAs the size,the cost and the power consumption of communication devices and integrated circuits de-\r\ncreases designing a system of autonomous sensors,that can monitor the environment and are capable\r\nof transporting and processing the information in any point of the controlled area,becomes a concrete\r\ngoal.While the fabrication technology is mature to make intelligent sensors with wireless communication\r\ninterfaces which are small and inexpensive,the main challenge in the design of these networks is at the\r\nsystem level.  The scenario analyzed in [4 ]is radically di .erent from large networks such as the\r\ntelephone network that have highly hierarchical architectures:in [4 ]all the nodes have identical function-\r\nalities,equal transmission bandwidth and are uniformly distributed over a circular region of .xed radius.\r\n\r\nHowever,[4 ]is neglecting one fundamental aspect of the problem:the nodes samples will be increas-\r\ningly dependent as the density of the nodes increases [7 ].This observation was used in [8 ]where it was\r\nproven that distributed codes,that compress separately the correlated samples in each node,can reduce\r\nthe amount of bits per node per square meter to an O (N .1 ),i.e.much faster than the transport capacity.\r\nThe limitation of the approach in [8 ]is the high complexity required to have signi .cant compression gain\r\nwithout sharing one single bit of data among the nodes Fortunately,there is no need to impose such\r\nconstraint.After all,the trademark of multi-hop networks is that power e .cient transmission is achieved\r\nwhen the data travel through several intermediate close-by nodes before reaching their .nal destination.\r\nIf neighboring nodes were jointly compressing the data before forwarding them remotely,they could save\r\nmany bits per sample while transmitting with the same or even greater precision.A good engineering\r\ndesign is compelled to exploit this fortunate coincidence by combining routing and and classical (not dis-\r\ntributed)source coding.This is the truly novel aspect of our project and,to the best of our knowledge,\r\nthis connection has not been studied before.",
