 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative proposal offers a multiyear build-up  designed to increase the number of graduates for Federal employment at Mississippi State and Jackson State Universities.  At MSU we will extend information assurance (IA) course offerings outside the current Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering student base to other departments and students across campus.  We will initiate this scholarship program during the first year at MSU and extend it to JSU, located approximately 120 miles from the MSU main campus, in the second year.   We will offer a joint security course of study electronically between the two institutions during the second year of the program. The program coordinator at JSU will participate in the MSU scholarship selection process during year 1. During the succeeding years, those students enrolled in the security course from JSU will also be entitled to scholarship consideration.",
