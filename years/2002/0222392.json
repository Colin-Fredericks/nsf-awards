 "awd_abstract_narration": "A National Workshop on Future Sensing Systems\r\nSummary and Objectives\r\nRecent technological advancements in material science, micro fabrication of MEMS, and\r\nbioengineered systems, have made the dream of inexpensive, powerful, ubiquitous sensing a\r\nreadily achievable reality. With ubiquitous sensing comes extreme amounts of data, when the end\r\nuser actually wants information (decisions and answers). Integration of distributed computing\r\nand extremely dispersed networking with new sensor technologies and wireless communications\r\ninnovations, has the potential to overcome barriers of time, scale, materials and environment.\r\nSensor informatics has not been seen as fundamental to the sensor community to date, although\r\nall experts polled for this document agreed it is central to real-time usability.\r\nWe propose a National Workshop on future Sensing Systems - a vehicle to start researchers on\r\nthe road to integrating the possibilities being developed by the many interests working in the\r\ncommon space. The workshop will focus on exposing future abilities of various disciplines\r\nworking on new sensor science to other researchers possibly doing similar or complimentary\r\nwork in their local space. Integration of industrial research and application development will\r\nprovide that pull and an avenue to large-scale, inexpensive production. An example is the current\r\navailability of rugged, highly accurate, MEMS accelerometers due to their application as\r\nautomotive air-bag triggers. It is hoped, for instance, that the medical researchers will become\r\naware of advanced imaging technologies developed by DARPA to image non-metallic structural\r\npieces, and can become an improvement on existing bio-imaging techniques. We hope to push\r\nthe community to (1) move from merely providing data to providing information and answers; (2)\r\nbuild road maps for long-term research; (3) build broad partnerships; and (4) address educational\r\nneeds.\r\nThese opportunities and problems are common to many agencies of Government, as well as\r\nindustry and academia, and is to be sponsored by Sensors Technology, NSF Division of Civil and\r\nMechanical Systems, with co-sponsorship from Dynamic Systems and Control (CMS), DARPA,\r\nNIH, DOE, NIST, NASA, AFOSR, ONR, ARO, ARL, and NRL. We are expecting over 100\r\nattendees, with 70 of them university researchers for whom all expenses will be covered by this\r\nproposal. The hard deliverable to NSF will be a workshop report which will serve as the leading\r\nedge for future of sensor-oriented research at the Civil and Mechanical Systems Division, NSF.\r\nThe report will be written by the co-PIs (Glaser and Pister) with extensive guidance and input\r\nfrom the steering committee and participants. The report will be presented to NSF by 15 January,\r\n2003.",
