The science questions are:  (1) How does the scale-dependent flood response of urban drainage basins depend on the space-time structure of rainfall for warm season systems of thunderstorms?  (2) How does flood response vary with land-surface properties including impervious cover and structure of the urban drainage network?  And (3) What is the relative role of changing channel/floodplain morphology due to urbanization, as compared with geologic controls of channel floodplain morphology, in determining the attenuation of flood waves?  Questions 1 and 2 will be examined through hydrologic and hydrometeorological analyses of flood events in 24 drainage basins smaller than 200 km2 for 25-30 flood events during the period 1996-2003.  Diagnostic analyses of rainfall and discharge observations for the flood events will be used in conjunction with model analyses to address questions 1 and 2.  Hydrologic model analyses will be based on a distributed hydrologic model, the Network Model.  Hydraulic analyses of  flood wave propagation will be carried out for a subset of the 24 basins and will include 4 stream reaches, each with upstream-downstream pairs of stream gaging stations.  The 2-d depth-averaged hydraulic model, TELEMAC, will be used for assessing hydraulic controls of flood response in urbanizing stream channels.  The key observations used in this study are:  (1) high-resolution (1 km, 5 minutes) radar rainfall estimates, (2) high-resolution (0.6 m contour interval) topographic data sets, (3) high-resolution (0.6 m grid, 0.15 m vertical resolution) topographic data sets derived from airborne radar, (4) high-resolution (1 m) representations of impervious cover, and (5) field-surveyed channel cross sections, longitudinal profiles and pebble counts.  \r\n",
