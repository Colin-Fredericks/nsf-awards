The BBSI will be a joint program of the University of Pittsburgh (lead institution), the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and Duquesne University, and will also include faculty from Carnegie Mellon University. A major strength of this academic community is the breadth and depth of experience with biological models and simulations, from molecular to multicellular, and from analytical approaches to massively parallel computing. \r\n \r\nThe objectives are to: (i) provide students with a unique training and research \r\nexperience through a series of cross-disciplinary lectures, computational laboratory sessions, and independent research opportunities not available in traditional undergraduate programs;  specifically, to present an integrated view of molecular-to-cellular analytical approaches and fundamental physicochemical, statistical mechanical, and kinetic principles needed for predictive theoretical and computational research; (ii) broaden the student's view of post-genomic computational and mathematical research areas in molecular, cellular, and systems biology, and (iii) motivate students to pursue careers in the field(s). \r\n \r\nApplicants will be accepted, from basic life or physical sciences, computer science, mathematics or engineering, and three first year graduate students.  A ten-week program will encompass six weeks of lecture and computer lab coursework, three weeks of mentored research activity, and 1 week of student presentations.  In addition, a weekly seminar series will cover a wide variety of related topics with presentations from local or invited outside experts, as well as discussions of scientific ethics and career opportunities. Student-organized journal clubs, and involvement of senior or graduate students in teaching activities will ensure efficient communication and contribute to professional growth. \r\n",
