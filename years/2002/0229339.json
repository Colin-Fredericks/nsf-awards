It is important in complexity theory and has myriad applications\r\nin fields such as robotics, optical character recognition, database systems, computer\r\narchitecture, circuit design, and verification, to name but a few.\r\nThe traditional view of much of the mechanical theorem proving community has been that\r\ninteresting applications of automated deduction require first-order rather than propositional\r\nlogic. That view has begun to change in light of recent successes with propositional logic.\r\nPropositional logic is of course intractiable (unless NP = P). One approach to this problem\r\nwith knowledge representaion and database systems is knowledge compilation  preprocessing\r\nthe underlying propositional theory. The idea is to do as much computation as possible in an\r\noffline phase. Then queries in the online phase can be handled quickly. Horn clauses, ordered\r\nbinary decision diagrams, sets of prime implicates/implicants, and decomposable negation\r\nnormal form (DNNF) have all been proposed as targets of such compilation.\r\nPath dissolution is an inference mechanism that works naturally with formulas in NNF. It\r\nis strongly complete in the sense that any sequence of link activations will eventually terminate,\r\nproducing a linkless formula called the full dissolvent. The paths that remain are models of the\r\noriginal formula. Full dissolvents have been used effectively for computing the prime implicants\r\nand implicates of a formula.\r\nDecomposable negation normal form was first introduced in 1998 and is currently being\r\nstudied for application to knowledge representation and database systems. A formula in DNNF\r\nis a full dissolvent, and it appears that many of the advantages of DNNF exist with full dissolvents.\r\nIt also appears that a full dissolvent of a formula can be obtained more effciently than\r\na DNNF representation of the formula. The main thrust of this project will be to examine the\r\nrelationship of DNNF and full dissolvents.",
