 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The Department of Physics & Astronomy has added a laboratory component to its Modern Physics course and moved some experiments from the Experimental Physics Laboratory course to the\r\nModern Physics course. A capstone research project has also been added for senior physics majors.\r\nAs part of these course modifications, the department is adding high-energy\r\nelectron diffraction (RHEED) equipment to be used by undergraduate students in a wide variety of\r\nexperiments. Experiments adapt and draw from undergraduate labs on diffraction and on research techniques using RHEED to make measurements on materials.\r\nStudents who work with the electron diffraction equipment \r\ndemonstrate for themselves the wave-like behavior of electrons and also gain valuable hands-on\r\nexperience using particles as a probe of the structure of matter. Other more advanced topics that are \r\ncovered include the concepts of diffraction and reciprocal space, surface symmetry and order,\r\nand structural differences between amorphous and crystalline solids.\r\nThe diffraction equipment complement the real space imaging capabilities of two\r\nscanning probe microscopes already owned by the department. Together the electron diffraction\r\nand scanning probe microscopy experiments make a powerful combination that enable \r\nstudents to gain a deeper understanding of important fundamental physical ideas like diffraction,\r\ntunneling, and the wave-like nature of matter. Laboratory manuals and supporting materials\r\ndeveloped under this project are shared at regional meetings of the AAPT in addition to being\r\nposted on web sites. Results stemming from undergraduate research is published\r\nseparately in appropriate peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.",
