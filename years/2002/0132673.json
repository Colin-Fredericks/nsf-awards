Allen, P.I.\r\n\r\nABSTRACT:\r\n\r\nThis project will implement an integrated program of empirical\r\nsoftware-engineering research and an exemplar of education in\r\nempirical methods for undergraduate and graduate students in\r\nsoftware engineering. This will be achieved through research\r\nfocused on assessing the quality of open-source software for\r\nhigh-performance computing, and through development of relevant\r\ncourses and teaching modules.\r\n\r\nHigh-performance computing is the platform of choice in many fields\r\nof science and engineering that are critical to modern society.\r\nOff-the-shelf software packages in this category include tools to\r\nimplement mathematical models, and middleware to manage parallel\r\nand distributed computation. The open-source approach of software\r\ndevelopment is becoming increasingly attractive in this field.\r\n\r\nResearch activities of this program will employ empirical analysis\r\nmethods to find ways to assess the quality of open-source software\r\nfor high-performance computing, enabling scientific and engineering\r\nusers to make better informed choices. Case studies of selected\r\nsoftware products will validate the practicality and usefulness of\r\nobtaining such quality assessments.\r\n\r\nSoftware-engineering education in America is largely lacking\r\ninstruction in empirical analysis methods. A spectrum of teaching\r\nmaterials targeted toward this need will be developed.  Research\r\nresults and instructional materials will be disseminated through\r\npublications and the NSF-sponsored Center for Empirically Based\r\nSoftware Engineering (CeBASE).\r\n\r\n",
