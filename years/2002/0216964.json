 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n0216964  Taylor \r\n\r\nPollen tubes deliver sperm to the ovules via a process known as tip growth. Large amounts of plasma membrane and cell wall precursors, synthesized in the Golgi, are transported to the tip where they undergo the polymerization and cross-linking reactions characteristic of tip growth. This proposal describes a pollen-specific protein, CBP25/22, that was isolated by a functional interaction with calmodulin (CaM), the major Ca 2+-sensing protein in cells.  CBP25/22 is located on the exterior face of an abundant class of pollen organelles and has oxalate oxidase (OxO) activity, a reaction that generates peroxide (H2O2).  Based on these unique biochemical properties, we propose that the CBP25/22 OxO-generated H2O2 mediates cross-linking of wall proteins and polymers in growing pollen tubes.  Moreover, given the pivotal role of tip Ca2+ gradients in pollen tube growth, we propose that the Ca 2+-sensitive binding of CaM to CBP25/22 confines expression of the OxO activity to the growing tip. The focus of this research is to demonstrate that the unique biochemical properties of CBP25/22 identified in vitro, are expressed within the growing pollen tube. The proposed experimental plan will use immunological, biochemical and protein-protein interaction techniques to localize the CBP25/22 and CaM proteins and the enzymatic product (H2O2 ) in situ . Specifically we will demonstrate a Ca 2+ -sensitive association of CBP25/22 and CaM in vivo and show that OxO-generated H2O2 co-localizes with the CBP25/22 protein in vivo. \r\n\r\nThis research may provide a novel way to control pollination, thus alleviating the current concern about gene flow via pollen from transgenic crops.  In addition it may have a broader impact on basic growth mechanisms; neurons and fungal hypha also exhibit tip growth.  Significantly, CBP25/22 shares its unique CaM-binding characteristics with neuromodulin, a protein that functions in vesicle transport and fusion in the tip of extending neurons.  This similarity suggests that there may be a common mechanism underlying tip growth in diverse organisms. \r\n \r\n",
