 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Algebra Problem: US Mathematics Education has an increasingly difficult in Algebra\r\nProblems to solve. The standard indicators of student achievements international comparisons, NAEP\r\nand other national measures, as well as state test results all point in the direction of lower achievement\r\nas grade levels increase. Well-known TIMSS analyses of US curricula point in the direction of repetition\r\nof elementary skill building and superficiality of topic coverage as important contributors to the problem,\r\ncombined with tell-and-drill pedagogy that puts students in overly passive position as learners. And, of\r\ncourse, high failure rates in first year algebra courses contribute to alienation on the part of students and\r\nlow morale among teachers. Responses involve a wide variety, but largely ineffective tactics involving\r\nmiddle and early high school curricula: pre-algebra courses of various kinds, screening and diagnostic\r\ntests, district and state mandates that all students take Algebra I, lengthened courses, modifying the\r\ndefinition of if algebra,  creating different versions of if algebra, end-of-course exams, among others.\r\nEach adjustment produces small improvements, although, since the tactics tend to be ad hoc and\r\nimplemented independently, improvements do not accumulate or multiply. NCTM recommendations for\r\nintegrating the development of algebraic reasoning across K-12 are implemented only in a few of the\r\nstandards-based curricula, and these mainly at the middle school level.\r\nResearch Towards Solutions: Several research teams studying the development of algebraic\r\nreasoning in the early (K-5) grades, who are represented in this proposal, have formed an informal\r\nresearch collaborative, renewing a prior collaboration funded by the US DoE OERI in the early/mid\r\n1990. These researchers share broad hypotheses regarding the large positive potential of building\r\nalgebraic reasoning in the context of elementary mathematics, the need to exploit untapped student\r\nlearning capacities among younger students, the powerful role of generalization and formalization in\r\ndeepening students experience and understanding of elementary mathematics especially arithmetic\r\nand the potential for using changes in the curricular relationships between algebra and elementary\r\nmathematics as a catalyst and vehicle for faculty development of elementary teachers. These researchers\r\nare engaged in several complementary lines of work focusing on different aspects of the challenges\r\nstudent learning, classroom practice, curriculum development, professional development, capacity\r\nbuilding, and so on.\r\nProposed Combination of Travel, Conferences and Monograph: The collaborating researchers\r\nhave all been invited to present papers to an important conference to be held December 8-15, 2001, in\r\nMelbourne, Australia on The Future of the Teaching and Learning of Algebra which is being sponsored\r\nby the International Commission on Mathematics Instruction. Professor Kaput has been designated to\r\nCo-Chair the Early Algebra Group at the conference. We request funds to exploit, in 3 ways, this unique\r\nopportunity to bring an intensely international perspective to bear upon our active research program: (1)\r\nTo support travel to the international conference. (2) To hold two meetings in the US, one prior to and\r\none following the Melbourne conference, involving a slightly larger group of mathematics educators\r\nworking in this area. (3) To write and publish a monograph expressing our findings in order to inform\r\npolicy makers, curriculum developers and assessment builders of the latest developments in this rapidly\r\nchanging field. Hence we also request a small amount of funding for editorial work to pull together and\r\npublicize the monograph, which in turn will point to additional web resources illustrating relevant\r\nresearch.\r\n",
