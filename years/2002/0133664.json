 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing scientific community working to provide solid\r\ntheoretical and algorithmic foundations for the study of communication\r\nnetworks.  This project furthers this goal through a combination of\r\nresearch and education.  In particular, it addresses theoretical and\r\nalgorithmic issues that arise in a central area of networking: the\r\nefficient utilization of communication bandwidth.  The research\r\ncomponent of this project addresses several different approaches for\r\nthe succinct representation of information in communication networks.\r\nThis includes the investigation of (a) the efficient use of\r\ncommunication bits to provide accountability in the Internet (which is\r\na means of combating cyber-terrorism), (b) new approaches to\r\ncompression that arise in new communication technologies, and (c)\r\nminimizing the amount of control information required to make\r\ncommunication robust with respect to network faults.  The integrated\r\neducational objectives of this project include both graduate student\r\ncollaboration and curriculum development.  The former consists of\r\nstudent involvement with the research component of the project, as\r\nwell as organization of summer schools and workshops.  The later\r\nincludes the incorporation of networking topics into a graduate level\r\nalgorithms course, as well as the development of a new advanced\r\ngraduate course addressing the algorithmic and theoretical challenges\r\nand achievements in the area of networking.\r\n\r\nFor the research question of providing accountability in the Internet,\r\nthis project studies the IP Traceback problem: given a stream of\r\npackets arriving at a node of the Internet, determine the source of\r\nthose packets.  This is an important tool for dealing with denial of\r\nservice attacks, since accountability discourages such attacks and\r\nprovides an automated mechanism for halting attacks in progress.  This\r\nproject studies probabilistic packet marking schemes for this problem,\r\nwith the goal of determining the optimal tradeoffs between the number\r\nof marking bits used per packet, the number of packets required to\r\nreconstruct the source information, and the number of simultaneous\r\nsources of attack that can be dealt with.  A number of new\r\ntechnologies also present us with entirely new approaches to\r\ncompression.  The resulting compression problems are fundamental, but\r\nsince the motivating technologies have a short history, these problems\r\nhave not been considered previously.  In this project, we consider\r\ncompression problems that arise from three such technologies:\r\nasymmetric communication channels, networks that are able to multicast\r\ninformation efficiently, and the compression of the World Wide Web.\r\nFinally, we also consider reducing bandwidth utilization by minimizing\r\nthe amount of control information required to make communication\r\nrobust against faults.",
