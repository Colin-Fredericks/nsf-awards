 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hawaii EPSCoR Planning grant continues to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the current R&D system in Hawaii and design an NSF Research Infrastructure Improvement project to materially strengthen the competitiveness of the State's academic institutions in research areas of national and local importance.    The two major universities, the University of Hawaii-Manoa and the University of Hawaii-Hilo, have established a team that is taking a system-wide approach to the EPSCoR planning effort.  The process also encompasses Hawaii's system of Community Colleges to increase entry into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics career tracks.\r\n\r\nThe planning process is designed to: (1) assist the state in better aligning University of Hawaii system priorities with NSF EPSCoR goals; (2) use applicable best practices from other states; (3) better coordinate all Federal EPSCoR programs to maximize their impact in Hawaii; (4) select research focus areas that are of high importance to Hawaii and where a strong collaborative relationship can be developed between the Manoa and Hilo campuses; and (5) advise on the best strategies to build nationally-recognized programs in the selected research focus areas.  These goals will result in a coordinated state-wide effort to improve academic R&D capabilities in targeted disciplines, enhance training and education for students in science and engineering, and increase efforts to promote transfer of technology from the state's universities to Hawaii's private and public sectors.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
