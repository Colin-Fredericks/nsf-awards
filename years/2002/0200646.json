The work described in this proposal lies at the \r\nintersection of three fields:  higher order elliptic partial\r\ndifferential equations, fully nonlinear equations, and \r\ndifferential geometry.  The equations we study are geometric\r\nin origin, and given by elementary symmetric polynomials \r\nof the eigenvalues of the Weyl-Schouten tensor, specifically\r\nunder conformal deformations of the metric.  There is a\r\nstrong structural analogy between this problem and the more\r\nclassical problem of prescribing the curvature(s) of a \r\nsurface in three-dimensional space.  To analyze our equations\r\nwe use techniques from the field of fully nonlinear and \r\nhigher order elliptic equations.  The geometric consequences\r\nare most interesting in low dimensions: for example, we\r\nhave developed a technique for constructing large families \r\nof conformal manifolds which admit metrics with positive\r\nRicci curvature,\r\n\r\nThe interaction of geometry and analysis dates back\r\nto at least the eighteenth century, and yet continues to be\r\nan important and highly active field of mathematical research.\r\nThe classical subject of geometry grew out of our desire to\r\nunderstand certain properties of the physical world, and\r\ndifferential geometry was developed to understand the \r\ngeometry of curved spaces--for example, the curvature\r\nof the surface of the earth, or the curvature of space \r\nby matter predicted by general relativity. \r\nIn the same way that Descartes realized that plane\r\ngeometry can be studied using algebra, so differential\r\ngeometry can be studied using techniques from analysis,\r\nespecially differential equations.  This research in this\r\nproposal involves several such problems from Riemmanian\r\nand conformal geometry, whose analysis requires techniques\r\nfrom various fields within mathematical analysis.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
