 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for an REU Site in Sociology at Texas A&M University.  The three-year program has four components involving: (1) classroom and laboratory training in research methods; (2) participation in a research project under the supervision of a faculty member, (3) participation in research-oriented field trips and professional-development seminars; and (4) formal presentation of a research paper at a student session at a professional conference.  Students will participate in an eight-week summer program and continue their research and mentoring experiences the following year at their home institutions.  Ten students each year will be recruited from universities in Texas that do not have doctoral programs in sociology and that have large enrollments of students from population groups that are underrepresented in graduate programs in sociology.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.",
