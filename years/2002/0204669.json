The \r\nimportance of a fractional Brownian motion in stochastic models \r\nhas been exhibited in a wide variety of applications, such as, \r\nhydrology, economics and telecommunications.  One goal of the \r\nresearch is to develop further a stochastic calculus for a fractional \r\nBrownian motion similar to the way that the stochastic calculus for \r\nBrownian motion was developed to provide the tools for solving \r\nproblems of stochastic systems with a fractional Brownian motion.  \r\nSome tools of stochastic calculus that are planned for development \r\nare necessary for solving the problems of identification, filtering \r\nand control of a stochastic system with a fractional Brownian \r\nmotion.  The fractional Brownian motions for study include \r\nprocesses with values in both finite and infinite dimensional \r\nspaces.  The study includes the existence and the uniqueness of \r\nsolutions of stochastic differential equations and stochastic partial \r\ndifferential equations with a fractional Brownian motion and \r\nmartingales that are formed from a fractional Brownian motion.  \r\nAnother family of stochastic models that are planned for study is \r\nhidden Markov models.  An investigation of adaptive control for \r\nsystems described by both fractional Brownian motions and hidden \r\nMarkov models is planned.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on a stochastic calculus for a fractional \r\nBrownian motion.  A fractional Brownian motion is a stochastic \r\nprocess that has been important in modeling physical systems such \r\nas those arising in hydrology, economics and telecommunications.  \r\nStochastic calculus provides the basic tool for solving problems of \r\nstochastic models that contain a fractional Brownian motion.  \r\nFractional Brownian motions have a self similarity property and \r\nmany have a long range dependence property that often occur in \r\nphysical phenomena.  It is planned to study the control of partially \r\nknown systems that contain fractional Brownian motion and \r\nhidden Markov models.  Such control problems naturally arise in \r\napplications.\r\n",
