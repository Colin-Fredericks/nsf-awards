 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the State University of New York at Stoney Brook.  Nancy Goroff is the site's Program Director and Robert Kerber is the Co-Program Director. Ten faculty will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  The students will have a wide choice of research to choose; in addition to research in the basic areas of chemistry there are several interdisciplinary areas available, which include chemical physics, chemical biology, pharmacology, and materials.  Students will give oral presentations of their research at the end of the summer and will be invited back to present their research at a poster session later in the academic year.  Student surveys at the end of the program along with interviews of both the student and research mentors will be the basis of assessing the program.",
