 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0221833\r\n\r\nMuch has been learned in recent years about the  biogeochemical cycling of trace elements and isotopic tracers, but progress has been  limited by the lack of any large-scale coordinated research effort in this area since the  GEOSECS program.  With NSF funding through this project, researchers at the Lamont-Dougherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University will convene a workshop to lay the foundation for a  coordinated international study of the biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and  isotopes used as \"tracers \" in oceanography.  Such a study would be disciplinary in the  sense that its primary objective would be to improve understanding of the marine  biogeochemical cycles of a suite of chemical tracers.   However, it would at the same time  interdisciplinary, in that it seeks to understand the complex couplings between the  biogeochemical cycles of trace elements and the biological and physical processes that  influence those cycles. The long-range objectives are  highly interdisciplinary, in that the improved understanding of these tracers will be of  immediate and substantial benefit to applications in biological, physical, and geological oceanography.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study has been termed GEOSECS-II to reflect the fact that many of  its objectives follow directly from those of the original GEOSECS program.  Furthermore, the proposed study will be conducted in the spirit of the original GEOSECS program with the appreciation that a global perspective is required to understand completely the cycling of chemical tracers within the ocean.\r\n\r\n",
