 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Timothy R. McDermott, William P. Inskeep, and Gill G. Geesey of Montana State University to establish a Microbial Observatory to study and discover novel chemolithotrophic microorganisms in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). As a general physiological group, chemolithotrophs are tremendously underrepresented, particularly given the predominance of inorganic energy sources in our biosphere. These microbes acquire energy for growth from the oxidation of inorganic chemicals such as ferrous iron, hydrogen sulfide, elemental sulfur, arsenite, or hydrogen gas. Because geothermal springs typically contain abundant levels of all or most of these chemical species, YNP represents an ideal location to conduct this search. The research will utilize novel cultivation and molecular techniques to describe, characterize, and isolate the microbial populations present along geochemical and temperature gradients. This detailed description of the microbial populations will be accompanied by a complete analysis of the aqueous and solid phase geochemistry, providing a comprehensive approach that will link molecular description with an understanding of the ecological relevance of identified populations.\r\n\r\nThis observatory occupies a key link in the study of the thermophilic microorganisms in Yellowstone, and it will work closely with other observatories in YNP to maximize research synergy and discovery. In addition to contributing to the general development of microbial ecology principles, this research will foster the cross-disciplinary training of graduate students. Further, the information derived from this work will contribute to the continued development of databases that document and describe microbial diversity occurring in YNP's geothermal features, which in turn will facilitate extensive education-outreach opportunities of direct value to the education mission of YNP. All cultures and DNA obtained from this project will be stored in the Montana State University Thermal Biology Institute thermophile culture collection, providing biological materials for future screening.  \r\n",
