 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project analyzes the impact of the stock market on the innovative capabilities of high-technology companies that have been central to the \"new economy.\"  Through in-depth comparative analyses of the accumulation of innovative capabilities at various major optical networking companies, the impacts of the changing roles of the stock market as well as the impact of volatility in stock prices will be evaluated.\r\n\r\n\tIn the speculative boom of the late '90s, many highly touted start-ups with little revenue were able to do IPOs with only a small portion of their stock being issued to the public while raising unprecedented amounts of cash that could fund future growth.   A high stock price became important in the competitive bidding among these companies for high-technology acquisitions, and hence played an important role in determining which companies would exercise strategic control over new technologies that they did not develop in-house.  Then, to develop and utilize the acquired technologies, the acquirer had to integrate the capabilities of the acquired companies with its own capabilities.  This meant using a stock-based compensation for recruiting and retaining key personnel, mostly in non-executive positions, who might otherwise have gone to work for competitors.  In established companies, stock option packages were used to keep personnel from leaving to join start ups.  Corporate stock thus came to play an important ole in the accumulation of innovative capabilities by both new ventures and going concerns.\r\n\r\n\tThis project analyzes the impact of the use of corporate stock as an acquisition and compensation currency on the accumulation of innovative capabilities by major optical networking firms.  How did such use of stock, entailing as it did pressure on corporate executives to maintain high stock prices, affect the strategic decisions of these executives to invest in innovative capabilities?  Did the existence of start-ups and high stock valuations bias top managers toward acquiring innovative capabilities externally when their companies may have accumulated these capabilities more effectively through internal development of the technologies?  Did the use of stock options as a key component of compensation packages for large numbers of managerial and technical personnel motivate these employees to engage in organizational learning for the companies that employed them?  Or did it encourage highly individualistic behavior, with concern for mobility within the labor market?\r\n\r\n\tHas the use of corporate stock as an acquisition and compensation currency in the boom made these companies more vulnerable than otherwise to the slump?  Has the role of stock changed in the downturn?  This project promises to provide useful answers to guide corporate growth strategies in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
