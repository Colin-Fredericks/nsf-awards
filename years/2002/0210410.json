 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carnegie Mellon University is developing an intensive faculty development and capacity building program in the critical area of Information Assurance (IA). \r\n\r\nThe goals of the program are: \r\nHelp build new capacity or expand existing capacity to offer IA courses and programs at institutions not currently designated as Centers of Academic Excellence by\r\n -Enabling participating faculty members from non-CAE institutions to develop/expand their knowledge and expertise in the area of Information Assurance\r\n- Providing the opportunity for participants to develop the curriculum and course materials to return to their home institutions and teach an introductory, upper-level, undergraduate course in Information Assurance\r\n- Enabling participants to integrate security topic and issues into courses already offered.\r\nExpand the number of PhD-level researchers in the IA area by\r\n- Enabling participants to identify links between their current areas of research and IA\r\n- Provide expert guidance and mentoring to help participants begin research projects in IA that are related to their areas of expertise and active research.\r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon is a partner with three institutions serving underrepresented minorities, and the first cohort to go through the program is comprised eight faculty members from Howard University, Morgan State University (both HBCUs), and the University of Texas at El Paso (an HSI). This program results in the creation or expansion of IA programs at these three institutions, and thereby significantly increase the national capacity for research and education in IA. It also enables partnering institutions to increase participation of underrepresented minorities in this critical area.",
