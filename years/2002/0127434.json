 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Mechanical (56) A proof-of-concept is being undertaken for the development of web-based laboratory modules for statics and mechanics of materials, two foundational courses for Mechanical, Civil, and Biological Engineering students. Two modules are being developed. The first module is a very preliminary experiment using the pressure in a soda can as a demonstration of thin-walled pressure vessel theory. The second module and principal activity of the project focus on the torsion of both engineered and biological materials. This module features web-based instructions which combines audio, text and video of the sample preparation process and the process of conducting the actual experiments. Furthermore, this module also provides data from real tests, which includes data from biological materials that the students download and analyze as part of their laboratory reports. One goal of the project is to develop a web-based laboratory that serves a variety of educational needs. As a consequence, this second module is being developed in consultation with colleagues from several schools including two-year community college. Once developed, the module will be implemented and evaluated at Cornell and at the other schools. The approach to web-based laboratories, which combines web-based instructions with real data, serves as a model across many engineering disciplines. It is also a step towards making web-based instruction more active by requiring substantial analysis by the student in addition to providing visualization and explanation of the processes. The project will have immediate impact on the large number of students who are taking the statics and mechanics of materials classes at Cornell and at other institutions. If successful, the project will lead to a full deployment proposal and to exploration of the commercialization of the laboratory materials. If commercialized, the laboratory materials could impact a larger number of engineering and technology students, since statics and mechanics of materials are taught at many institutions other than the ones involved in the project. \r\n\r\nKey Words: Web-based laboratory modules, Web-based instructions for statics, Web-based instructions for mechanics of materials \r\n\r\n",
