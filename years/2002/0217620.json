 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n There is considerable literature in the area of human judgment and\r\ndecision making demonstrating systematic use of simplifying heuristics and\r\nthe biases that can arise from them. For example, \"framing effects\" are\r\ncommon in which people react to the manner in which information is labelled\r\nby assigning more favorable evaluations to, say, a medical treatment that\r\nis described as having a \"75% success rate\" as opposed to a \"25% failure\r\nrate\". However, research by the Principal Investigator and others has\r\nuncovered considerable variation in the extent to which different\r\nindividuals display such biases. Most recently, this research, which has\r\nbeen done almost exclusively with adults, has linked these individual\r\ndifferences to stable personality traits and decision styles. This\r\nnaturally brings up the dual questions of when such biases develop and\r\nwhether they can be linked to distinctive childhood dispositions. The\r\npresent series of studies is proposed to address these questions.\r\n A major resource for these studies is an available population of 5-6\r\nyear-olds whose social and emotional development and cognitive capacity\r\nhave been tracked since they were toddlers. Thus, we have the capability of\r\nrelating children's decision making behavior to measures such as shyness,\r\nimpulsivity, and intelligence. In an initial study we showed that these\r\ntraits are related to risk-taking in a gambling-type game. We are in the\r\nprocess of developing a battery of tasks/games which are \"child-friendly\"\r\nyet capture the essence of the decision processes observed in adults. An\r\ninnovation of the new studies is that the parent as well as the child will\r\ncomplete the tasks so that we can correlate the two sets of responses to\r\nlearn more about the development of decision biases.          \r\n\r\n",
