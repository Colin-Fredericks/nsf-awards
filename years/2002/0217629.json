 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP)\r\n\r\nIf America is to prosper in the new millennium, we must build a domestic science,\r\nmathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) workforce that uses the talent of all\r\nsegments of our population. America's prosperity is fueled by the nation's technical\r\nenterprise. As evidenced by the tragic episode of September 11, our country must build\r\non the diversity within this country so that an increasingly large share of the work force\r\nwill consist of women and underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nMany national programs have been identified to enhance the quantity and quality of\r\nunderrepresented minorities in science and engineering. This proposal describes a\r\nprogram designed to improve the quantity and quality of underrepresented scientists and\r\nengineers graduating each year with a bachelor's degree. The partners in the proposed\r\nalliance are all from the state of Tennessee. The existing knowledge base relative to\r\nminority participation in science and engineering will be the foundation of our efforts.\r\nThe goal is to build on this foundation and to expand the available options to enrich\r\nprograms at partner institutions and beyond.\r\n\r\nTennessee State University, LeMoyne-Owen College, Middle Tennessee State\r\nUniversity, University of Memphis, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and Vanderbilt\r\nUniversity will partner to form the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority\r\nParticipation (TLSAMP). The ultimate success of this collaboration rests in the fact that\r\nif there is any student's need, there is an institution within the alliance with the\r\ncharacteristics, experience, and/or resources to meet the needs of the student. The\r\nalliance can draw on the strengths and experiences of each of the individual members.\r\nThe goal of the TLSAMP is to increase the number of the underrepresented SMET\r\nstudents by at least 75% at the end of the five-year period. The objectives to support the\r\ngoal of the alliance are: 1) to recruit underrepresented students to pursue science or\r\nengineering as a career, 2) to improve the quality of the learning environment for\r\nunderrepresented science and engineering students at all schools, and 3) to ensure that a\r\nlarger number of undergraduate students are prepared to enter graduate programs.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance will emphasize collaborative learning approaches, mentoring activities via\r\nfaculty, staff, and upper level students, and hands-on research and internship experiences.\r\nUsing this approach, three project areas have been chosen as critical focal points for\r\nachieving the qualitative and quantitative goals of the project. These project areas utilize\r\nstrategies with demonstrable effectiveness in the retention of underrepresented students in\r\nscience and engineering. All project areas will involve faculty, staff, or students during\r\nthe design phase as well as the continuous quality improvement phase.\r\n\r\nIn this project, assessment will be built into each project area as a result of the\r\nformulation of specific, measurable quantitative and qualitative objectives. These\r\nobjectives will be reviewed and revised on an ongoing basis. An Advisory Committee\r\ncomposed of the Vice Presidents and Deans from the six schools will oversee all aspects\r\nof the grant project.\r\n",
