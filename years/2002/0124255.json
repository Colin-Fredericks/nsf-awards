 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of highly reactive catalysts for synthetically useful reactions such as the Heck, Suzuki and Buchwald-Hartwig couplings. To this end, water-soluble alkylphosphines will be synthesized and used in conjunction with aqueous-phase palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions.  These reactions efficiently provide structures of interest in areas ranging from pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals to electronic materials and commodity chemicals.\r\n\r\nWith this new NSF/EPA Technology for a Sustainable Environment (TSE) award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Sciences are supporting the research efforts of Dr. Kevin H. Shaughnessy of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.  Professor Shaughnessy will focus his research on developing methodology for the use of a new class of sterically demanding, water-soluble alkylphosphines in palladium-catalyzed C-C and C-heteroatom bond forming reactions using environmentally benign aqueous solvent. Adoption of this methodology by industry could result in the decrease of hazardous waste generation, decrease in energy consumption and decrease in the use of volatile organic solvents.  The undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students working on this project will gain a fundamental education in organic and organometallic chemistry and approaches to developing environmentally benign chemical reactions.",
