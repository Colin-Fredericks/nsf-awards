 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies IIA and IIB superconformal field theories on \r\na Calabi-Yau variety in an attempt to give a rigorous mathematical \r\ndefinition of the vertex algebra of the theories. This algebra is \r\nexpected to be a deformation of the cohomology of the chiral de Rham \r\ncomplex constructed by Malikov, Schechtman and Vaintrob. The second \r\naim of the project is to extend the definition of IIA and IIB models \r\nto some singular varieties. The most pressing question is to connect \r\ntwo existing definitions of elliptic genus of singular varieties, \r\nwhich is a generalization of cohomological McKay correspondence. The\r\nthird part of the project focuses on problems from number theory that\r\narise in connection with the concept of elliptic genus and are related\r\nto products of Eisenstein series.\r\n\r\nString theory in its various flavors is a leading candidate for the\r\n``theory of everything'' in mathematical physics. Its development \r\nhas led to rapid growth in several areas of mathematics, in particular\r\nalgebraic geometry, which concerns itself with spaces of solutions of \r\npolynomial equations. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of rigorous \r\nunderstanding of some of the underlying rich mathematical structures,\r\nwhich the project aims to rectify. Such mathematical understanding is\r\nimportant, because it may be a necessity for future development of \r\nstring theory which in turn may yield a more coherent picture of the\r\nbasic processes and forces of our universe. A separate part of the \r\nproject deals with certain number-theoretical questions inspired \r\nby string theory. These are related to long-standing mathematical\r\nproblems in the theory of elliptic curves. The theory of elliptic\r\ncurves is a crucial part of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and \r\nhas practical applications to cryptography.  \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Algebra, Number Theory, and \r\nCombinatoric Program and the Topology and Geometric Analysis Program.",
