 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding  the  causes  and  manifestations  of  biological  variability  over  long  time  scales \r\nremains a critical and elusive goal for ecosystem ecology.  In the Northeast Pacific, long-term variation in \r\natmosphere-ocean  coupling  appears  to  have  organized  biological  production  into  a  series  of  distinct \r\ninterdecadal  regimes  during  the  last  century.  For  instance,  up  to  three-fold  changes  in  salmon  fishery catches in the Alaska Current were coindicent with shifts between interdecadal climate regimes. Despite this enormous temporal variability in fish population dynamics, we have only a weak understanding of the long-term climatic drivers that control biological productivity in this vast and important ecosystem. A \r\nkey hypothesis proposes that the main drivers of biological change in the Northeast Pacific involve the \r\ninteractive  effects  of  pan-Pacific,  bi-decadal  and penta-decadal climate  oscillations.  Historical records of biological productivity prior to the 20th century have not been established for the Alaskan Current domain \r\nof the Northeast Pacific; their absence represents a major impediment towards understanding the temporal \r\norganization of biological productivity in this ecosystem.  Here, the investigators propose to quantify the fundamental modes  and magnitude  of  interdecadal  variability  in  sockeye  salmon  populations  of  the  Alaska  Current during the last 500 years, to improve our understanding of the critical sources of temporal organization in the Northeast Pacific. \r\n  \r\nThese scientists will  use  paleoecology  to  characterize  the  long-term  patterns  of  biological  variability  in the Alaskan  Current  domain  of  the  Northeast  Pacific.  Specifically,  they  will  infer  historical  changes  in populations  of  sockeye  salmon  (Oncorhynchus  nerka)  by  tracking  variation  of  a  natural  geochemical tracer (15N) that accumulates in the sediments of spawning lakes in proportion to salmon density. High resolution dating of sedimentary sequences will be accomplished through detailed radio-isotope analyses of  sediments  and  by  identifying  volcanic  ash  layers  with  known  ages.  Existing 35-to-100  year  long historical records of salmon population dynamics, climatic conditions, and lake production will enable them to  calibrate  sedimentary  chronologies  of  geochemical  and  biological markers.  They will  also  use  carbon stable  isotopes  and  fossil  algal  pigments  from  sediments  to  quantify  the  impact  of  salmon-derived nutrients on lake productivity. They will use spectral analysis and temporal domain time-series models to quantify  the  frequency,  duration,  and  magnitude  of  historical  shifts  in  fish  production,  and  how  these relate  to  independent  proxies  of  paleoclimatic  conditions.  They  will  then  apply  the  time-series  models developed  from  sedimentary  and  other  existing  paleoclimate  records  to  forecast  future  changes  in  the biological productivity of the Northeast Pacific for the next century. \r\n \r\nThis synthesis of new and existing data will provide a high-resolution, concrete description of the \r\nlong-term variability in the biological productivity of the Alaska Current domain of the Northeast Pacific. \r\nThey  will  test  the  hypothesis  that  the  biological  productivity  within  this  oceanic  domain  has  been \r\nsynchronized  by  inter-decadal  climate  regimes  associated  with  bidecadal  and  pentadecadal  climate \r\noscillations.  These  data  will  provide  the  information  needed  to  investigate  the  spatial  and  temporal \r\ncoupling of biological productivity to climate oscillations throughout the Northeast Pacific. In particular, \r\nour work will provide the data needed to test the hypothesis that biological productivity in the Alaska and \r\nCalifornia  current  domains  of  the  Northeast  Pacific  respond  synchronously,  but  out  of  phase,  to \r\ninterdecadal  climatic  forcing.  The  synthesis  of  historical-  and  paleo-indicators  of  oceanic  conditions, \r\nclimatic conditions, and biological productivity will place the recent century of ecosystem dynamics in a \r\nsubstantially longer temporal context than is currently available. This knowledge will provide a scientific \r\nbasis for adapting management to the time scales relevant to the coastal marine, freshwater and riparian \r\necosystems of the Northeast Pacific. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
