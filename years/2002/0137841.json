 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis grant will fund the participation of about ten United States scientists at a Conference on Computational Linear Algebra with Applications to be held in the Czech Republic in August 2002. The theme of the conference is of basic importance in many areas of science and engineering. In particular, the topics of the conference address problems encountered in industrial and manufacturing modeling, chemical processing, material sciences, and simulation of fluid flows. The meeting is modeled after a very successful U.S.-Czech Workshop on Iterative Methods and Parallel Computing at the same location in June 1997. As at the last meeting, attendance is expected from many scientists from several Eastern and Central European countries who rarely have a chance to travel to the United States. Participation in this conference will allow U.S. scientists to present their research to this audience, and to learn first-hand about recent developments in Eastern Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union. It is expected that the meeting will foster new collaborative projects. Priority will be given to funding the attendance of advanced graduate students and young scientists.\r\n\r\n",
