 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project awards 24 four-year scholarships to incoming full-time freshman in the Class of 2007 who demonstrate financial need, show academic promise, and declare intent to major in one of the eligible disciplines when entering the College.\r\n\r\nA Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) Committee was established to work with Admissions and Financial Aid staff during the recruitment and application period. The Committee helped recruit candidates locally with a special emphasis upon increasing diversity in these majors. The Committee monitors student performance throughout the program to ensure academic success and continued eligibility.\r\n\r\nStudents are assigned an advisor in their chosen disciplines who closely monitors their performance. Other support services available to students include tutoring, mentoring, and internship opportunities. Scholars receive a rigorous education in the major field of study as well as a strong grounding in the liberal arts. \r\n",
