 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant sterols represent a complex array of chemical compounds that are\r\nessential for many facets of plant growth and development, and are of\r\nconsiderable importance for their nutritional contributions to animals and\r\nman. Hence, it is not surprising that the biochemistry and molecular\r\nbiology of the sterol biosynthetic pathway has been intensively studied.\r\nNonetheless, very little is actually known about the regulation of this\r\nbiochemical pathway in plants. One goal of our long-term research in sterol\r\nmetabolism has been focussed on the regulation of squalene synthase, a key\r\nenzyme in sterol biosynthetic enzyme. Our recent results suggest that\r\nsqualene synthase gene expression and enzyme activity are localized to\r\nshoot meristems. In attempting to reconcile these results with those\r\nalready reported in the literature, the most logical interpretation is that\r\nsterol biosynthesis itself is localized to this tissue. This interpretation\r\nimplies that regulation of sterol biosynthesis occurs in the shoot\r\nmeristem, a tissue that has not been evaluated as such before, and that a\r\nsterol transport system for the movement of sterol from the apical meristem\r\nthroughout the plant must exist. Experiments to test these predictions are\r\nproposed and include: 1, an evaluation if sterol biosynthesis localized to\r\nthe shoot meristem is regulated; 2, the development of a test for long\r\ndistance transport of sterol within plants; and 3, a determination if NPC1,\r\na highly conserved protein involved in cholesterol uptake and intracellular\r\ntrafficking, plays a similar role in plants as in animals. The proposed\r\nwork, which will involve undergraduate and graduate students and a\r\npostdoctoral associate, should provide important insights into how this\r\npathway might be engineered for enhanced value using emerging technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
