 "awd_abstract_narration": "Li\r\n0211614\r\n     The goal of this project is to develop mathematical theory\r\nregarding biodiversity in the context of resource competition.\r\nRecent numerical work suggests that competition for multiple\r\nresources can generate periodic oscillations or even chaotic\r\noscillations, and a large number of species can coexist on very\r\nfew limiting resources.  However, both mathematicians and\r\necologists still lack analytic understanding of mechanisms that\r\ngenerate diversity in ecological communities.  The investigator\r\nstudies several resource competition models, including standard\r\ncompetition models with multiple resources and competition models\r\nwithin food webs; he gives rigorous analysis for the models and\r\nprovides insight into diversity of competing species.  Theory of\r\ndifferential equations and theory of dynamical systems are used\r\nto determine the long-term behavior of solutions of the models in\r\nthe form of attracting steady states, limiting cycles or strange\r\nattractors.  Important issues are what causes competing species to\r\ncoexist, and locating parameter ranges in which coexistence\r\noccurs.\r\n     The question of the maintenance of species diversity in\r\nnatural systems has intrigued mathematicians and ecologists for a\r\nvery long time.  This work provides a general understanding of\r\nfactors affecting abundance and biodiversity.  The results have\r\nimportant implications for determining the patterns of species\r\ncomposition in aquatic and terrestrial systems, and for managing\r\nnatural resources such as forests and lakes.\r\n",
