 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a group at Michigan State University for a program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics based on the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider and on the ATLAS experiment at the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, Geneva. \r\n\r\nThe MSU group formed the nucleus of the D0 experiment and one of the members of the group, H. Weerts, is currently a co-spokesman for the experiment. The group has major responsibilities to the Run II upgrades at each of the three levels of the trigger. They are actively engaged in a number of physics analyses, including top quark and QCD physics as well as searches for new phenomena. The group's work on ATLAS includes design and construction of the Level 2 trigger system as well as integrating it with the data acquisition system.\r\n\r\nMembers of the MSU group are introducing technical and intellectual expertise into the classroom for both physics and non-science majors and one of their members, B. Pope, is an active member of QuarkNet, the multi-institutional effort to involve high school teachers and their students in particle physics research.\r\n",
