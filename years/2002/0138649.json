 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary type specimen holds a special status in scientific research, as it is the name-bearer specimen on which the recognition of the species is based.  The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature states that institutions holding primary type specimens should take all necessary steps for their safe preservation, make them accessible for study and publish lists of the type specimens in their collections.  The Entomology Department of the Academy of Natural Sciences has holdings of over 11,000 primary type specimens of insects and related invertebrates.  The current housing of the primary type specimens is sub-standard, with antiquated metal cabinets with degraded felt gaskets that do little to prevent intrusions by pests and do not ameliorate greatly the fluctuations in room temperature and humidity.  Some drawers in the cabinets show significant gaps that also can allow pests to enter.  The type specimens of many groups of insects are stored with multiple species per storage tray, subjecting each specimen to unnecessary handling and causing problems in re-associating loose parts with the appropriate specimen.  Some of the collections have been exchanged with other institutions in the past, and the lack of available lists of type specimen holdings of the Entomology Department at the Academy of Natural Sciences has caused unnecessary confusion for researchers and hindered their scientific research.  This project will re-house the type specimens in state of the art cabinetry, and expand to safer storage of just one species per storage unit.  This project will also develop a primary type computer database that will be used in the re-curation process, to help in collection management, and most importantly, to be available to users worldwide, through searchable Internet access.  The entire two-year project will cost $124,020.  The Academy of Natural Sciences and the Bradley Bequest (administered through Cornell University) will provide $31,588 (35%); the remainder is funded through the National Science Foundation.\r\n\tAccurate species identification is essential in scientific research, for example, as a tool for understanding global biological diversity, to confirm the identify of an invasive or beneficial species, or to help characterize a threatened species.  Primary type specimens serve as the foundation of accurate identifications and act in an important role in stabilizing the naming system of species that is used worldwide by scientists, government agencies, conservationists, educators, and students.  The type specimens not only must be preserved for use now and for future generations, but the information available with the specimens must be available for use worldwide.  This project not only preserves the specimens, but the information on the specimen holdings will be available through the internet to users worldwide when they need to use it.  This re-housing, cataloging, and internet accessibility for the primary type specimens in this project are all necessary first steps toward subsequent digital imaging of the specimens and internet image access in future years.\r\n",
