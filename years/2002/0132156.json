 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Mark Young and David Mogk (Montana State University-Bozeman) in collaboration with Drs. Kenneth Stedman (Portland State University) and Frank Roberto (DOE-INEEL Idaho Falls) to identify and characterize novel viruses from high temperature acidic environments present in Yellowstone National Park.  The goals of this grant are to discover and analyze previously unknown viruses from very hot (>178F) and acidic (pH < 4) environments, conditions approaching boiling battery acid, and to monitor the virus populations in these environments over time. Preliminary data indicates that the viruses in these environments are unique and quite unlike viruses found in more \"normal\" environments.  A combination of biochemical and molecular tools will be used to cultivate these viruses in the laboratory and to monitor their presence in Yellowstone's hot springs. In addition, detailed chemical analysis of these environments in which these viruses live will be performed.  All cultures and DNA obtained from this project will be stored in the Montana State University Thermal Biology Institute thermophile culture collection, providing biological materials for future screening\r\n\r\nThis research has broad implications. The detailed analysis of viruses has often led the way to fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of the biochemistry of life (such as the discovery of DNA as the genetic material).  The research supported by this grant to characterize viruses from extreme environments is likely to lead to new and fundamental understanding of biological adaptations required for life at high temperatures.  Presently, we only have a rudimentary understanding of how organisms survive in extreme environments and how they have adapted to their unique chemical environments. The discovery and analysis of viruses from high temperature environments is an important step in the understanding how these unusual microbial communities operate.  In addition, these studies will provide additional insights into how life adapts to changes in all environments. This research will also determine if viruses can act as sensitive biosensors of chemical and biological change. Finally, these studies will not only impact our understanding of life on earth but may also provide new insights in how to look for extraterrestrial life.  \r\n",
