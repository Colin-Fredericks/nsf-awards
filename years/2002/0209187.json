This function \r\ncarries out the static aspects associated with the execution \r\nof Java classfiles as it is defined by a concrete implementation \r\nof the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The implementation \r\nbeing targeted is called the Sandia Secure Processor (SSP). To \r\ndate, a prototype of the SSP has been developed in VHDL which \r\nsynthesized to < 40K gates and is capable of operating near 75MHz.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to compose the classloader and the SSP to produce a \r\nJava-centric computational component capable of being used in \r\nembedded system development. Intended application areas for this \r\ntechnology encompass high to ultra-high consequence embedded systems.\r\n\r\nA primary application domain for which this technology is targeted \r\nhas imposed the following constraints on the system:\r\n\r\n\t1.There must be the option of building the processor \r\n\t  using rad-hard technology.\r\n\r\n\t2.An open source for the system must be available allowing \r\n\t  detailed design analysis and testing of all aspects of \r\n\t  the system (possibly down to the gate level).\r\n\r\n\t3.Certification evidence should be provided by formal \r\n\t  mathematical proofs of correctness to the extent possible, \r\n\t  and strongly convincing evidence must be provided in all \r\n\t  other cases where mathematical proofs have not been achieved.\r\n\r\n\t4.A security policy must be strictly enforced ensuring that \r\n\t  any program is either rejected as incorrect by compile-time \r\n\t  or run-time checks, or its behavior must be understandable by \r\n\t  reasoning based entirely on the language semantics, independent \r\n\t  of the implementation. In particular, no security violation must \r\n\t  be permitted to succeed regardless whether it is the result \r\n\t  of an inadvertent error, or a malevolent well thought out attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrectness-preserving program transformation is the method that is being \r\nemployed to implement a high-assurance classloader function. In this approach, \r\nthe functionality of the classloader is realized via a lengthy sequence of \r\nsmall \"intellectually manageable\" rewrite steps. Here, a rewrite step is \r\nconsidered to be intellectually manageable if its correctness can be formally \r\nverified in practice. In order to achieve this goal, novel transformation \r\ntechniques are being explored and developed.\r\n\r\nThis project will significantly impact the computer science community \r\nby (1) advancing knowledge in the area of program transformation, \r\n(2) demonstrating to industry that formal methods (in this case program \r\ntransformation) can be effectively applied to real-world problems, and \r\n(3) providing a computational infrastructure (i.e., the SSP) that is \r\nsuitable for embedded high-consequence system development.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
