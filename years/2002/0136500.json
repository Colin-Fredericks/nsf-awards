 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0136500\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen is very susceptible to changes in environmental conditions.  Understanding the present and past response of the marine  nitrogen cycle to natural and anthropogenic changes is important for our ability to predict  the potential impact of future environmental changes on primary production in the oceans, and consequently their effect on global and regional marine ecosystems.  One of the most  powerful tools for deciphering past fluctuations in the marine nitrogen cycle is the 15N isotopic composition  (d15N) of  organic matter preserved in marine sediments.  In various settings, this tracer may provide  information about variability in ocean productivity and the degree of nutrient utilization, or  about the relative importance of nitrogen fixation or denitrification.  However, to accurately  interpret the paleoceanographic record, a critical question that must be answered is to  estimate the extent of nitrogen isotope fractionation during diagenesis.  \r\n\r\nIn this study, researchers at the University of Southern California will measure the d15 N of ammonia in pore waters of sediments from  several near-anoxic basins in the California Borderland and the Gulf of California.   Analyses of the solid phase abundance and d15N of bulk organic nitrogen and THAA  (total hydrolyzable  amino acids)will also be made.  Because irrigation effects are absent  from the study sites, it will be possible to construct mass balances for 15N and 14N lost  during diagenesis of solid phases by fitting diffusion-advection-reaction models to pore  water data.  The combination of these model calculations with information on sediment  accumulation rate and solid phase nitrogen data will establish the degree of isotope  fractionation, and will also be useful for evaluating whether bacterial uptake of isotopically  light nitrogen plays a significant role in the sedimentary nitrogen budget.  To evaluate the  potential for fractionation at more oxic sites, incubation experiments will be run using  mixtures of sediment and fresh plankton decomposing under both oxic and anoxic  conditions.  \r\n\r\n",
