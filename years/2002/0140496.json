 "awd_abstract_narration": "MEMS designers would like more functionality on a chip, akin to the VLSI technology comprising of hundreds of thousands of components on a chip, but they are currently handicapped with the limited design tools for Bio-MEMS design. A structured design methodology for Bio-MEMS can address many of the challenges currently facing Bio-MEMS design. The objective of this research is to develop analysis and design tools for device, reduced-order, and circuit modeling of Bio-MEMS for structured design of Bio-MEMS.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of device modeling are to develop mathematical models to include all significant microscopic effects in Bio-MEMS, develop fast and efficient scattered point and mixed-regime techniques for mixed-domain analysis of bio-fluidic devices. The objective of reduced-order modeling is to represent the device by a low-order model that can capture the functional behavior. Low-order models based on a weighted snap shot approach will be developed to capture multiple time scales encountered in Bio-MEMS. By identifying several Bio-fluidic components, that could form the basic building blocks for complex Bio-MEMS on a chip, and developing reduced-order models for these building blocks, circuit models will be developed to design large-scale biointegrated circuits on a chip.\r\n",
