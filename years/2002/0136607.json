 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues organize the third\r\nConference on Foundations of Computational Mathematics at the\r\nInstitute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), University\r\nof Minnesota on 5-14 August 2002.  Deepening the understanding of\r\nthe mathematical processes that underlie fast computation and\r\ncomputer simulation is the principal goal of the meeting.  The\r\nmathematical content covers fields of research at the interface\r\nof engineering, computer science, and pure mathematics, but\r\nfocused on computation.  The program includes 18 3-day workshops\r\nand 18 plenary speakers.  The plenary talks and workshops span\r\nsubjects of vital interest to the nation's infrastructure,\r\neconomy, and defense.  The project supports participation by\r\npostdocs, graduate students, junior participants, women and\r\nminorities as well as plenary and semi-plenary speakers and\r\nworkshop organizers.\r\n     Large-scale computation and the implementation of\r\nmathematical models for complex physical and societal phenomena\r\nare of fundamental importance to the nation's economy.\r\nComputation is also the backbone of the sciences supporting the\r\nnation's defense.  Large-scale computation is the engine of\r\nnumerical models for complex physical phenomena occurring at many\r\nscales.  Fast computation and processing of the ever-increasing\r\ndata sets obtained from various sensors is critical to the new\r\nmilitary.  The purpose of this major meeting, held only every\r\nthree years, is to further the understanding of the deep\r\nrelationships between mathematical theory: analysis, topology,\r\ngeometry and algebra, and computational processes as they are\r\nevolving in tandem with the modern computer.  The topics to be\r\naddressed include large scale computation and high performance\r\ncomputing as occurs in atmospheric and groundwater modeling,\r\ncomputer aided design and animation, data, image and signal\r\nprocessing, modeling network traffic, quantum computing, learning\r\ntheory, optimization and control.  Sustaining the nation's\r\nadvantage in these vital areas relies on understanding the\r\nfoundations of computational science.  The meeting involves\r\n350-500 researchers in 18 workshops over a 10-day period, with\r\nspecial plenary sessions attended by everyone.  A large contingent\r\nof graduate students and other young scientists are\r\nparticipating, and the program is designed to promote intensive\r\ninteraction among the participants.  Several panels are devoted to\r\nidentifying the most promising directions for future research.\r\nPublished proceedings, web-based materials, and the conference\r\nsessions themselves serve as launching pads for focus and special\r\ninterest groups for future interactions in a range of subjects at\r\nthe interface of mathematics and computation.\r\n\r\n",
