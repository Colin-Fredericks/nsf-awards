 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim is to provide a better mathematical framework and\r\nalternative design methodologies for coarse quantization of signals in\r\na highly oversampled setting.  The central themes is \"sigma-delta\r\nquantization\" in analog-to-digital conversion of audio signals and its\r\ncounterpart \"error-diffusion\" in digital halftoning of images.  In both\r\ncases, a given target analog signal is represented by a judiciously\r\nchosen one-bit (or few-bit) sequence which approximates the signal in a\r\nsuitable low-pass subspace.  A wide range of different schemes exist for\r\nthis purpose, each corresponding to a different implementation and\r\napproximation order.  As our primary mathematical objective, we expect\r\nto better understand the law of error decay of the existing schemes as\r\nwell as to improve on these by new designs.  On the algorithmic side, we\r\naim to extend this analysis to settings with computational and other\r\nimplementational constraints.\r\n\r\nThe fact that digital signals and data sets can be processed, stored\r\nand retrieved with great precision and speed places high demands of\r\naccuracy on the conversion process from and to the analog world.\r\nHowever, the devices used in the translation process (such as in the\r\ncase of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion circuits in\r\naudio applications, and printers in image reproduction) are of\r\nnecessity analog devices, which have physical limitations that, at\r\nfirst sight, conflict with those accuracy demands.  To cope with this\r\nproblem, engineers have empirically developed special signal processing\r\ntechniques leading to alternative signal and number representations\r\nthat are quite different from standard decimal or binary\r\nrepresentations.  Typical techniques take advantage of the highly\r\naccurate performance of the analog devices in sampling very densely in\r\ntime or space to compensate for the lack of amplitude precision of\r\nthose devices.  Interestingly, while these empirical schemes have proved\r\nefficient and have been used in consumer products for a long time, the\r\ncorresponding framework of signal processing has little mathematical\r\nsupport.  We aim to study these schemes in more detail, with the\r\ngoals of improving the mathematical theory as well as proposing\r\nvariants that outperform those used presently, and to identify a wider\r\nrange of applications.",
