The project involves: 1) A literature review of the current use of simulation-based education and training.  2) A survey of the major simulation-based training systems now available in military, commercial, colleges and universities. 3) Interviews with educators and experts who are implementing simulation-based training systems to determine the number of users, cost of development, assessments of effectiveness, new technologies under active development, recommendations for future research. 3) A preliminary report reflecting the state-of-.the-art in simulation-based education and training systems, expectations for future systems, and detailed recommendations for future research. 4) A draft research plan for understanding how to use simulation-based learning systems, building demonstrations, and evaluating the effectiveness of existing and experimental systems. 5) A focused workshop to review and discuss the draft research plans, with the goal of reaching consensus on research priorities.  Workshop participants will include individuals who are experts in learning science and information technologies. The Workshop projected date in Washington, DC, is January or February 2003.  6) A final report reflecting the state of the art in simulation based learning, expectations for future systems, and detailed recommendations for future research.  The final report will be published twelve months following receipt of funding. This project is relevant to EIA's new initiative in Technology-Enhanced Learning.\r\n",
