Using experience\r\ngained in a previous Best Practice Report (Janice Cuny and William Aspray,\r\n\"Recruitment and Retention of Women Graduate Students in Computer Science\r\nand Engineering\", Computing Research Association, Washington, DC 2001) on\r\nrecruiting and retaining women in computer science and engineering (CS&E)\r\ngraduate school, the project will study U.S. CS&E graduate programs in\r\norder to identify and quantify links between the program's recruitment and\r\nretention practices and their outcomes.\r\n\r\nResults expected from the study include a description and assessment of the\r\nexisting recruitment and retention practices in 50 CS&E departments with\r\ndoctoral programs; a measure of the impact recruitment practices have on\r\nthe female proportion of new students enrolled; a measure of the impact\r\nretention practices have on the female proportion of students retained\r\nthrough the doctorate; a set of materials that departments can use to make\r\nself-assessments; an evaluation of the effectiveness and comprehensiveness\r\nof the practices recommended in the Best Practices Report; and findings\r\nthat can be generalized on the link between recruitment and retention\r\npractices and their outcomes with respect to female graduate students.\r\n\r\n",
