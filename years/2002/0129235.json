Kathleen T. Cerqua-Richardson, Alfons Schulte, and Thierry Cardinal at CREOL and Bordeaux respectively will lead the collaborative program.  The goal is to fabricate and characterize chalcogenide and oxysulfide glasses and their related waveguides for integrated optic applications.  Chalcogenide glasses have shown potential for use in linear and nonlinear optics.  They exhibit high optical nonlinearities, are photosensitive in the visible region and transparent in the telecommunication spectral region.  They suffer from limited long-term stability.  The research will address several current limitations associated with non-oxide chalcogenide glasses and extend knowledge in new oxysulfide glass systems.  The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in processing and optical fabrication of bulk chalcogenide materials, Raman spectroscopy using near infrared techniques for fiber and films.  This is complemented by French expertise in the synthesis and characterization of bulk oxysulfide materials and ab initio calculations.\r\n \r\nThis award represents the US side of joint proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators and graduate student.  CNRS will support the visits of the French researchers and graduate students to the United States. \r\n",
