The dynamics of soil organic matter and soil fauna at the Horseshoe Bend\r\n(HSB) agroecosystem site in Georgia have been studied in replicated experimental\r\nplots since 1978. Analyses indicate that the experimental treatments (no-tillage and\r\nconventional-tillage regimes) are continuing to diverge. It is essential to continue the\r\nexperiments for an additional six years, to enable prediction of what the long-term\r\nconsequences of our manipulations will be. Consequently, a continuation of ongoing\r\nLTREB research on soil processes in no-till and conventional till plots at HSB is proposed, with\r\nsome significant changes. The new research focuses on two related areas:\r\n1) long-term measurements of the gradually-increasing base of soil organic matter from\r\nC3-pathway plants, in crop rotations that have been in effect since 1997.\r\n2) following the production, accumulation, fate and ecological effects of the Bt proteins\r\nfrom the summer planting of Bt (and non-Bt) cotton in subplots within our main plots.\r\nThe relationship between these focal areas is simple. The variation in the size of soil\r\naggregates may influence the sequestration of Bt toxins, and their breakdown products,\r\nwithin soils. It has already been shown that no-tillage management systems at HSB\r\ngenerate an increasing representation of soil macroaggregates in comparison to the\r\nmarkedly reduced macroaggregates in our conventional tillage plots. Therefore, it is\r\nhypothesized that no-tillage systems will sequester more Bt-related products than will\r\nconventional-tillage plots.\r\nSeveral short-term studies (see references in Project Description) have failed to detect\r\ndeleterious changes in non-target soil fauna as a result of Bt in crop residues. There\r\nare three possible explanations for this: a) that no deleterious effects exist, b) that short-\r\nterm experiments do not adequately predict the long-term consequences of repeated\r\nexposure to Bt residues, and c) that effects are contingent upon properties of the soil\r\nsuch as aggregate size. It would seem prudent to be able to distinguish among these\r\npossibilities and the long-term plantings at HSB will allow that to occur.",
