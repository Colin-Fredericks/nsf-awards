He proposes to establish a collaborative training program in undergraduate social science research on the impact of environmental degradation, economic growth, and social change within two cities, Shanghai and Xiaman, in coastal China.  The CWU will cooperate with Shanghai Jiaotong University and Xiaman University to design a program to mentor U.S. students through the complete process of planning a research agenda and performing primary research in the environmental and social sciences at an international field site.  The eight week program will include a pre-field experience at CWU, a field experience in Shanghai and Xiaman and a post field wrap-up at CWU comprised of closely-mentored group interaction on the organization, interpretation, and analysis of primary data, preparation of the final report, and presentation of their findings at professional venues.  This research and training program will provide an excellent opportunity for U.S. undergraduate students to perform social science research in an international setting, and allow them have a in-depth understanding of the complex relationship between environmental degradation, economic growth and societal changes in  coastal China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
