Hislop, University of Kentucky\r\nDMS-0202656\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThis proposal concerns continuing investigations of the principal\r\ninvestigator into the spectral and transport properties of random media.\r\nThe basic question is: How do random perturbations of a background\r\nmedium, for example, a perfect crystal, influence the propagation\r\nof quantum and classical waves in the medium?\r\nThe proposed work concentrates on properties of the integrated density of\r\nstates and models related to the quantum Hall effect.\r\nSeveral other models and related technical problems are discussed.\r\nThe main aspects of the proposal include:\r\n1) Continuity and Regularity of the Integrated Density of States;\r\n2) Spectral and Transport Problems in the Quantum Hall Effect;\r\n3) the Aizenman-Molchanov Method for Localization, Energy-Level Statistics,\r\nand Random Magnetic Fields.\r\nThe overall goal of this work is to describe the effect of\r\ndisorder on the measurable properties of the system,\r\nsuch as the density of states, the conductivity,\r\nand the edge currents. The proposer also discusses\r\nlocalization for some previously untreated systems\r\nlike random magnetic fields and nonlocal potentials.\r\nThe proposed methods will contribute to the\r\nunderstanding of wave propagation in random media.\r\n\r\nOur understanding of many basic electronic properties of solids is\r\nbased on the simple one-electron model of an electron propagating\r\nin a periodic array of atoms. This simple idea explains many fundamental\r\nphenomena such as metals, insulators, and semiconductors. One of the\r\nlimitations of this model is that it predicts infinite conductivity. In\r\n1958, P. W. Anderson proposed disorder as a mechanism for limiting the\r\nballistic behavior of an electron in a periodic array of atoms. He argued\r\nthat the electron wave function should be localized in space\r\ndue to multiple and incoherent scattering from the randomly distributed\r\nimpurities, with probability one. Disorder-induced localization of states\r\nfor many models has now been proved. Some of the work in this proposal\r\ninvolves applying these ideas to the study of systems with interesting\r\ngeometries, such as a strip or a torus, that exhibit the quantum Hall\r\neffect. The principal investigator is interested in the nature of \r\nthe quantum Hall edge-currents, and the nature of the \r\nelectron states for regions with two-edges, such as a strip. One of the tools for studying these systems is the density of states that provides a measure of the number of electronic\r\nstates per unit volume. The continuity of the density of states measure\r\nprovides a measure of the effectiveness of the disorder in breaking degeneracy of the ordered system. Very little is known about this function. The principal investigator is also interested in exploring the effect on electron propagation of randomness in the magnetic field, and the influence of randomness on certain systems with nonlocal interactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
