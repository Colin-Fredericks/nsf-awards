Burns\r\n\r\nThe Evolution of Sexual Dimorphism in Plumage: A Phylogenetic Perspective\r\n\r\n\tThis study uses an evolutionary tree of a group of birds to investigate the evolution of differences between males and females in plumage.  Evolutionary trees of a variety of organisms are providing a new perspective to classical ideas about the evolution of plumage coloration.  For example, male ornaments can be lost frequently, and females often evolve elaborate traits.  In this study, DNA sequences of three genes will be used to reconstruct an evolutionary tree for species of tanagers and finches.  The resulting evolutionary tree will be used to examine patterns of evolution of sexual differences in plumage.  Transformations between different types of plumage will be tabulated and the frequency of changes in male plumage will be compared to the frequency of changes in female plumage.  In addition to providing information on the evolution of male and female plumage differences, the data resulting from this project will also address questions in a variety of areas including the biogeography of Central and South America, the prevalence of ultraviolet coloration in birds, the evolution of feeding characteristics, and evolutionary tree constructing methods.  \r\n\tBeyond scientific impacts of this proposal, this project will also provide training and educational opportunities for several students, at both the undergraduate and graduate level.  SDSU is a diverse campus, with no racial group making up a majority of the students.  It is expected that the students that work on this project will reflect the diversity seen on campus.  Results will be disseminated broadly within scientific journals, the popular media, and bird-watching literature.  Both the molecular sequence data and the plumage data will be made accessible online.  The teaching efforts of the principal investigator will also be enhanced by the results of this project by providing specific examples that can be included in lectures and inquiry-based activities.\r\n",
