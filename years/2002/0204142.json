 "awd_abstract_narration": "Culler and Shalen are continuing to investigate consequences of their\r\nwork on the character variety of a knot group. This involves studying\r\nthe relationship between the boundary slopes of a knot and the\r\ntopological properties of essential surfaces that realize the\r\nslopes. It also includes their ongoing project with Dunfield and Jaco\r\nabout smallish knots in non-Haken manifolds, which is part of a\r\nprogram to prove the Poincare Conjecture. A joint project by Agol,\r\nCuller and Shalen, concerning the construction of covering spaces of a\r\ntriangulated 3-manifold by an inductive process, is also relevant to\r\nthis program. Agol is also continuing his work on geometric finiteness\r\nof geometrically defined subgroups of knot groups, volume estimates\r\nfor non-fibered Haken manifolds and hyperbolic orbifolds, and the\r\ncomplexity of algorithms in 3-manifold theory.\r\n\r\nA fundamental problem in many areas of mathematics is to classify all\r\nexamples of a certain type of mathematical object.  The objects of\r\nstudy in this proposal are 3-manifolds, which are mathematical models\r\nof 3-dimensional spaces.  Since our universe is a 3-dimensional space,\r\nthe classification of 3-manifolds is directly related to our\r\nunderstanding of nature itself.  The classification problem for\r\n3-manifolds is far from solved, but the work of many mathematicians\r\nover the last 25 years has at least produced a conjectural\r\nanswer. Remarkably, the conjectures, if true, will provide a\r\nunification of the most classical, rigid kind of geometry---both the\r\nEuclidean version first studied by the ancient Greeks and the\r\nnon-Euclidean kind that constituted an exciting discovery in the 19th\r\ncentury---and topology, a subject devoted to studying much more\r\nflexible geometric structures, which until recently had developed\r\nquite independently of the more classical theories.  The work\r\nsupported by this grant forms part of the effort to verify the\r\nconjectured geometric classification of 3-manifolds.\r\n",
