 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is devoted to the theory of quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) organic conductors (TMTSF)2X and (TMTTF)2X, where TMTSF is tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, TMTTF is tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene, and X represents a monovalent inorganic anion, such as PF6 and ClO4.  These materials demonstrate an antonishingly rich variety of physical properties and states: metallic, insulating, superconductive, charge-and spin-density-wave states, antiferromagnetism, spin-Peierls states, and the state of Mott-Hubbard paramagnetic insulator.  They exhibit a multitude of magnetic oscillations as a function of the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic field.  A strong magnetic field induces the cascade of phase transitions between the magnetic-field-induced spin-density waves (FISDW), which exhibit the quantum Hall effect.\r\n\r\nTheoretical research will be conducted on the following topics: fractional quantum Hall numbers of the subgap electron states; electron states in superconducting junctions; bound electron states at the superconducting and FISDW vortices and impurities; collective modes in the triplet superconducting state; and, coesistence of metallic Fermi surface and charge gap.  There will be close collaboration with experiments and an emphasis on real materials.\r\n%%%\r\nTheoretical research will be conducted on a novel class of organic conducting materials which display a rich variety of properties.  These materials are of great fundamental interest due these properties arising in organic materials and of great practical interest due to many potential applications.\r\n***\r\n",
