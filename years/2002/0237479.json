 "awd_abstract_narration": "0237479  Burd  The proposal addresses the role that nano-scale colloids play in the transport of trace metals and pollutants in natural environmental and  engineered systems.\r\nThe combination of experimental studies encompassing microscopic methods (AFM and EM), synchrotron-based methods (SAXS, XAS), and multi-scale modeling will aid in elucidating the significance of particulate material in aquatic systems.\r\nThis project is collaborative and multi-disciplinary, combining expertise from chemistry, biology, and modeling to investigate the role of fibrils and macromolecules in inorganic colloid aggregation.  Results of this work should help in the understanding the self-cleansing capacity of fresh, estuarine and marine waters through transport and sedimentation.  Of special interest is the understanding of the similarities and differences between freshwater and seawater.\r\nThis proposal was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Initiative, NSF 01-157, category NIRT. \r\n",
