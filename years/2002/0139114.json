 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site that will host a total of seven students during eleven weeks of summer research. The REU program is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers. Students will be working with researchers at the University of Maine's Darling Marine Center, located in Walpole, ME.  Students will also participate in a series of seminars and workshops exploring issues related to hypothesis formation and testing, statistics, experimental design, scientific writing and data presentation, and career options. The program recruits juniors and senior undergraduate students nationwide.  These students are able to pursue research in a broad range of marine science and environmental science. They will also be encouraged to attend a regional or national meeting to present their results. The program will advance students' awareness concerning important environmental issues. Students selected for participation in this program gain a significant appreciation for the scientific process and often pursue a career in a scientific field.",
