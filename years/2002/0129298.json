 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs request LTREB support to continue experimental studies in the Chihuahuan Desert\r\nnear Portal, Arizona. The 20-ha study site contains 24 fenced plots, each 0.25 ha in\r\narea. They have maintained the removal of some or all species of rodents and/or ants from\r\n10 plots continuously since 1977 and from an additional 4 plots since 1988. Standardized\r\ncensuses of rodents, ants, and plants provide invaluable data on responses of individuals,\r\npopulations, and communities both to experimental perturbations and to background temporal\r\nand spatial variation in the environment.\r\n\r\nResults to date demonstrate: 1) complex interannual and seasonal dynamics of rodent, ant,\r\nand plant populations; 2) direct effects of seed predation by rodents, birds, and ants on\r\nwinter annual plants; 3) direct effects of competition by kangaroo rats on population\r\ndensities and species diversity of other seed-eating rodent species; 4) indirect effects\r\nof kangaroo rats on vegetation, other rodents, birds, and lizards; 5) reorganization of\r\nthe entire ecosystem, including large increases in woody vegetation and extinctions,\r\ncolonizations, or shifts in abundance of many animal species, apparently caused by a\r\nchange in climate since the late 1970's; 6) regulation of emergent properties, such as\r\nspecies diversity, biomass, and energy use of rodents and plants, within narrow bounds\r\ndespite large shifts in species composition in response to environmental change. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research for the next five years includes: 1) continuation of experimental\r\nmanipulations and standardized censuses of rodents, ants, and plants; 2) focus on spatial\r\npatterns and processes over a wide range of scales; 3) investigation of the experimental\r\nmanipulations and functional groups of organisms on ecosystem processes; 4) examination of\r\nthe dynamics of the ant community; and 5) assessment of the interacting influences of\r\nclimate, livestock grazing, and fire on the transition between desert shrubland and arid\r\ngrassland.",
