 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to learn more about the relationships between spellings and sounds in English and to use this information as a basis for studying the processes that are involved in spelling and reading.  Most previous studies of English reading and spelling have concentrated on short, simple words, those that contain a single syllable.  This research will go beyond past work by studying words that are longer and more complex.  Such words are frequently encountered by children and adults, and it is important to understand how they are dealt with.  Computer methods will examine the links between spellings and sounds in a comprehensive database of English words.  The research is based on the hypothesis that, even when it is not possible to predict exactly how a given sound will be spelled or how a given letter will be pronounced, there are a number of factors that can help narrow the range of alternatives.  For example, consideration of a unit's position in the word and the identity of the surrounding units can help decrease the degree of uncertainty.  The research will study these factors in both the adult vocabulary and the words that are seen by children of various ages.  The results of this phase of the research are expected to show that the English writing system, although complex, is more systematic than commonly believed.  A series of behavioral studies will examine children's and adults' use of the statistical patterns.  In addition, analysis of data from an extensive study of adults' reading of a very large number of words is expected to find that adults and even children are sensitive to the statistical patterns in the input.  However, the research is further guided by the hypothesis that learners pick up some types of patterns in the system more easily than others.  For example, patterns involving letters that are not adjacent to one another may be difficult for children to learn.  The results should thus help to show which aspects of the English writing system are especially difficult to master and why.  The findings should shed light on the nature of the English writing system and the way in which it is learned and used.  They should have implications for theories of literacy and literacy development and for the understanding and prevention of reading difficulties.",
