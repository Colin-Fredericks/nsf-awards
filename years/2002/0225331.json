The Center's mission is to serve as a center of excellence in IT enabled design and realization of discrete manufactured products by envisioning where information is the lifeblood of an enterprise and collaboration is the hallmark that seamlessly integrates design, development, testing, manufacturing and servicing of products around the world.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Center, a fusion of expertise and resources from the already successful Center for e-Product Design & Realization at the University of Pittsburgh and the Center for Manufacturing Productivity at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is a joint effort to achieve synergy in the development of the enabling technologies to support the new project development paradigm.  The proposed I/UCRC would leverage the existing talent faculty from complementary engineering disciplines, infrastructure and experience of each university.\r\n",
