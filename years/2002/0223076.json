The goal of the HBCU-UP Program is to strengthen the Nation's workforce by enhancing the quality of undergraduate Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology\r\n(SMET) programs at HBCUs. Support from the Foundation will enable the QEM Network to:\r\n(1) Conduct four proposal development workshops (two per year), prior to the HBCU-UP Program's annual deadline, for faculty at eligible institutions to improve the quality of multi-year and planning grant proposals submitted to the Foundation's HBCU-UP Program;\r\n(2) Conduct a follow-up workshop for institutions submitting proposals in the annual competition, whether or not their proposals were successful, to discuss next steps;\r\n(3) Conduct a workshop for new grantees focused on performance indicators, data collection, assessment, and annual reporting requirements as well as assist grantee institutions in developing an internal capacity for monitoring, assessing, and assisting in both the internal and external evaluation of their respective projects;\r\n(4) Provide on-site technical assistance to multi-year HBCU-UP award recipients linked to critical needs identified during implementation of their respective HBCU-UP Projects;\r\n(5) Create and maintain at QEM's Website links to potential sources of federal and non-federal support to assist grantee institutions in sustaining and institutionalizing the successful elements of their HBCU-UP projects as HBCU-UP funding ends as well as a listserv for HBCU-UP Project Directors.\r\n",
