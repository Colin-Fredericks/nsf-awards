 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deregulation of the electric power system has been plagued by missteps and finger pointing. It has been impossible to clearly and systematically delineate the issues so that meaningful policy decisions can be made. Missing from most discussions is the interplay between the economic, technical, social and environmental factors that influence the production, transmission and consumption of electric energy. This work will study these interactions and develop computer models suitable for use by both policy makers and researchers. The main effort will be focused on the development of simulation models, which extend beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.  For example, we will model consumer behavior, which affects efficiency and hence electricity demand, which in turn affects the prices on generation and the operation of the transmission grid. Such models will enable us to simulate short-term behavior such as electricity prices and congestion in the near term.  The models will also be used to look at long-term behavior such as investment in new generation and transmission. These models will be tested with data from the Western power grid as the Benchmark Test System. The project will conclude with the preparation of several instructional modules using interactive simulation of the benchmark system. The modules will be designed for integration into syllabi for senior/graduate level courses in sociology, economics, environmental science and engineering, the home departments for the research team. The modular approach will engage students from multiple disciplines in discussions and interactive simulations.  \r\n \r\n\r\n",
