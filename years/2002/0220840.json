 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project supports 33 talented, academically qualified, students with financial need, many from traditionally under-represented groups, during their beginning, core coursework in the targeted disciplines (Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics). The program offers scholarships for students and provide an extensive set of academic support services and educational opportunities, including tutoring and inviting speakers. \r\n\r\nPrimary Objectives\r\n1. To allow such students who major in Computer Science, Engineering, or Mathematics to complete the first half of their undergraduate education in four semesters by reducing the need for outside employment during the school year.\r\n2. To increase the number of such students who choose to attend the university as freshmen.\r\n3. To increase the proportion of such students who go on to complete their degrees in a timely fashion.\r\nMethods\r\n1. $3000 scholarships annually for two years.\r\n2. Visits to local high schools to recruit prospective scholarship recipients.\r\n3. Peer mentoring, faculty advising, and extramural speakers.\r\n4. Tutoring and other academic services.\r\nImpact\r\nThese scholarships benefit students both financially and academically. The scholarships are equivalent to about 75% of annual in-state tuition at the university. Students on scholarship are able to work at least 12 fewer hours per week, giving them more time to devote to their studies. Students funded by this program are required to earn 58 credit hours, compared with the current average of about 48 credit hours. By the end of the scholarship period, the successful student is better able to find employment at higher wages and to find work that reinforces their recently acquired academic skills. The program benefits the university by making it more attractive to the pool of talented low income students in the surrounding community. It meshes well with the current Pre-College Academy, which attracts about 100 students annually for training in the Natural Sciences, by providing funds for these students to continue their education at the university. The presence of students in this scholarship program enhances the academic climate at the university. \r\n",
