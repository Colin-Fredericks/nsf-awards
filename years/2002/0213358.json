 "awd_abstract_narration": "Outcrossing sexual reproduction has intrigued evolutionary biologists for decades, for the individual that can produce offspring by self-fertilization or asexually has an immediate advantage over outcrossers. Mixed mating systems (with both self-fertilization and outcrossing) provide an excellent way to identify the selective advantage of both modes of reproduction. One form of mixed mating, androdioecy (males + hermaphrodites), is particularly interesting because theoretical treatments suggest such a mixture should be evolutionarily unstable. A recently discovered crustacean (Eulimnadia texana) exhibits a persistent form of androdioecy. In a previous grant, we implemented an integrative approach to the study of androdioecy, using genetic, cellular, physiological, behavioral, and ecological studies to quantify the parameters of a model in two populations. Although these projects proved quite fruitful, many questions remain. The current proposal will address those questions with two integrated projects. (a) Laboratory tests that combine behavioral and genetic studies will be used to further explore two of the model's parameters. (b) Field Collections, that estimate relative male to hermaphrodite survival, inbreeding depression and male mating success to estimate three of the four parameters of a model in natural habitats. Two sets of field data will be collected (data from naturally-filled ponds and from artificially-filled) at the Jornada LTER site in New Mexico.  Data collected from both the field and laboratory studies will be used to estimate the four model parameters, which will in turn be used to test the ability of the model to predict the proportions of sex types found in each pond. The results of these tests will provide a thoroughly integrative understanding of the maintenance of outcrossing in this system, which will further our understanding of mating system evolution in general. Broader Impacts: Both PIs have strong commitments to student training and are on projects designed to bring inquiry-based science experiences to high school and undergraduate students in the Akron area. The proposed research will mentor graduate and undergraduate students who will gain training in modern genetic techniques, and be enriched by field experiences. \r\n\r\n",
