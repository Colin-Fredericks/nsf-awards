The project will focus on the use of electric fields to influence bubble formation as well as boiling in terrestrial and microgravity conditions.  While both the German and US investigators have experience in optical measurement techniques, they now intend to collaborate in the new area of electrohydrodynamic control of bubble formation and motion.  The new technique may has potential for achieving better control over bubble formation and for increasing the amount of heat that can be transferred from a surface.  An understanding of the mechanisms of bubble break-up under the influence of electric fields holds the promise of being able to control bubble size in two-phase flow systems and could have great benefits to the proper design of phase-change and two-phase flow systems.  The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international travel and research.\r\n\r\n",
