In previous work by the PIs a technique\r\nfor estimating Calderon-Zygmund operators on spaces with\r\nnon-doubling measures was developed, and a novel \r\nmethod of Bellman functions was introduced for problems\r\nin Harmonic Analysis. These techniques will be applied to \r\nsolve several open problems in harmonic analysis and \r\noperator theory and to investigate new directions,\r\nwhich previously were deemed untractable because of the \r\nlack of technical tools. Special attention will be paid \r\nto uncovering new relations between Operator Theory, \r\nHarmonic Analysis and Stochastic Control.  Among\r\nthe main directions of the proposed research are:\r\n- Spectral theory for perturbations of normal operators \r\nand related problems in Harmonic Analysis: two weight \r\nestimates for Hilbert Transform and embedding theorems for \r\nthe co-invariant subspaces.\r\n- Non-homogeneous T(b) theorems and their applications to \r\ngeneralizations of analytic capacity (electric intensity \r\ncapacity); the role of curvature in higher dimensions.\r\n- Bellman function method in stochastic optimal control\r\nand in harmonic analysis; functions with matrix arguments\r\nand their applications to non-commutative problems.\r\n\r\nHarmonic analysis investigates complex processes by \r\nrepresenting them as a sum of elementary ones (sinusoidal \r\nwaves, wavelets) with well understood behavior.  A central\r\npart of modern harmonic analysis deals with \"singular\r\noperators\" of one type or another.  Such operators are \r\npervasive in the scientific landscape: they turn up in \r\nmathematical physics, probability, engineering, image \r\nprocessing, etc.  A new way to treat multivariate signals\r\nwill be discussed. The main difficulty here is that the \r\nmathematical objects arising in such problems are \r\nnon-commutative: the product depends on the order of terms,\r\nand that complicates things immensely. A new method based\r\non Bellman functions, which originating in the stochastic \r\noptimal control, will be exploited in harmonic analysis. \r\nOne important direction of research is the spectral theory \r\nfor the perturbation of normal operators: results in this \r\ndirection would have important consequences in mathematical \r\nphysics.  Another direction deals with non-commutative \r\nharmonic analysis, i.e. with treating multivariate\r\nsignals.   \r\n",
