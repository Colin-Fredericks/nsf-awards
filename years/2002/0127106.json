 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nResearch is an essential part of the Knox College biology curriculum, with inquiry-based exercises the norm. Developmental biology represents the junction of many different disciplines: anatomy and physiology (plant and animal), molecular biology, evolution and ethics. It is a dynamic, active area of research. This project establishes a research based advanced laboratory course in developmental biology at Knox, by adopting the curriculum and laboratory modules developed for undergraduates at Duke University and Macalester College (DUE 9950879). The end result is an active, student-driven learning experience. Students investigate major questions in developmental biology, including determination of cell fate, embryo patterning, gene regulation and the processes of forming specialized organs and tissues using classical embryology along with molecular techniques. The course is divided into two sections, classical embryology and developmental genetics, each with several different units. Students examine vertebrate (chick, Xenopus), invertebrate (sea urchin, Drosophila) and plant (Arabidopsis) model systems using techniques including micromanipulation, microinjection, in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, analysis of transgenic organisms, and fate mapping. Students design and perform experiments. The research grade microscopes and video imaging systems give students the power to collect, store, and retrieve data with ease, allowing them to easily compare different stages of development, as well as the effects of perturbations. By allowing the students the opportunity to master sophisticated techniques, we advance the level of research in the course. These skills, as well as the research grade microscopes, provide students an excellent starting point for independent undergraduate research.",
