 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to our nation's capacity for increasing the number of\r\npeople with disabilities employed in the science, technology, engineering, and\r\nmathematics (STEM) work force by demonstrating the effectiveness of an innovative\r\ncombination of person centered career planning activities, ongoing mentoring, and hands\r\non experiences in the sciences. This combination of activities is designed to 1.) increase\r\nrecognition of the interests and needs of students with disabilities in the STEM career\r\nareas, 2.) create a more supportive academic and professional climate for persons with\r\ndisabilities, 3.) promote accessibility and appropriateness of instructional materials and\r\neducational technologies at multiple levels (high school, community college, and\r\nuniversity), and 4.) increase the availability of academic enrichment experiences such as\r\nmentoring and hands-on experiences in the STEM areas.\r\n\r\nTo meet these broad goals, the SIU SY-STEM project will:\r\n*Identify students' preferences and interests for specific STEM-related career\r\nareas.\r\n*Increase receptivity of educators (secondary and post-secondary math and science\r\neducators) and of guidance counselors for including of students with disabilities\r\nin STEM-related curriculum experiences.\r\n*Impact adaptations, accommodations, and instructional strategies used by\r\neducators in STEM classes and labs at multiple levels.\r\n*Foster academic and professional development in STEM related career areas by\r\nincreased access to career exploration experiences and mentoring.\r\n\r\nA fundamental premise of this project is that the best way to impact employment of\r\npersons with disabilities in the sciences is by simultaneously increasing the numbers of\r\npeople in the pipeline leading to these careers and enhancing the capacity of secondary\r\nand post-secondary training institutions to successfully include students with disabilities.\r\nTwenty-five teams of students, parents, educators, and guidance counselors from 25 high\r\nschools in southern Illinois will participate in intensive one-day workshops on person\r\ncentered career planning.  From these 25 student teams, six students will be selected to\r\nparticipate in an intensive, on-campus Summer Institute at Southern Illinois University.\r\nThis Institute will expose students to a variety of careers in the sciences and engage them\r\nin a series of rotations in various lab sciences.  University students with disabilities will be\r\nrecruited to work in close affiliation with a graduate student mentor and faculty mentors\r\nto provide ongoing support for the workshop and Institute participants.\r\n\r\nThe SIU SY-STEM project will impact involvement of persons with disabilities in\r\nSTEM areas of study at multiple levels, including the personal and professional\r\ndevelopment of high school and college students with disabilities, and changes in the\r\neducational resources, willingness, and capacity to support these students in high school,\r\ncommunity college, and university programs.  Although this project is designed as a\r\nregional demonstration involving high schools, consortia of community colleges, and\r\nSouthern Illinois University, it is the intention of the applicant to sustain this initiative by\r\nbuilding broader, more comprehensive regional/national networks and alliances.  To that\r\nend, the project includes a comprehensive evaluation component and widespread\r\ndissemination plan.",
