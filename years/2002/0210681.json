The lofty goals set by U.S. Government for the creation of bio-based economy present significant challenges to Industry, Academia and Agriculture. This proposal seeks to replace/substitute existing petroleum derived polypropylene/TPO (thermoplastic olefin) based nanocomposites from compatibilized clay reinforced cellulosic bio-plastic through a novel approach for automotive applications.  A new bio-based product derived through nano-science approach from renewable resources; having recycling capability and triggered biodegradability (i.e. stable in their intended lifetime and would biodegrade after disposal under compost conditions) with commercial viability and environmental acceptability is termed as sustainable green nanocomposites under this high-risk exploratory research (NER) proposal.  The main objective of this proposal is to replace such petro-derived nonbiodegradable polymers with renewable resource-based biodegradable polymers.  Compatibilization between the nanoclay and bioplastic is the key to achieving success.  A new maleated compatibilizer is targeted to effectively bind both the clay and cellulosic bio-plastic in the compatibilized green nanocomposites.\r\n\r\nExpected Results Our research has proved the \"proof of concept\" on promising potentiality of cellulosic bio-plastic in designing green nanocomposites for high impact and high strength applications.  From our preliminary data we find encouraging results where the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) decreased by ~ 50% and water absorption decreased by ~ 14% on reinforcement of cellulosic plastic with 5 wt.% as received commercial clay.  However with the presence of compatibilizer we expect to get much improved properties of our targeted nanocomposites.  The synergy to be gained by maleated compatibilizer, bio-plastic development and novel processing will result in making sustainable eco-friendly green nanocomposites of industrial attractions. This intended research program through University-Industry interactions is expected to create a consciousness among young graduate/undergraduate students in adding knowledge of materials and process engineering of new green nanocomposites and to create the growing importance of unique nano-technology to generate eco-friendly affordable green materials for 21st century automotive industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected Results Our research has proved the \"proof of concept\" on promising potentiality of cellulosic bio-plastic in designing green nanocomposites for high impact and high strength applications.
