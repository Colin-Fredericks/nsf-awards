 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on the existing framework at St. Louis Community College that supports recruitment and retention, we are developing an integrated program, Pathways to Success in STEM, to increase recruitment and retention of students seeking STEM degrees at the College. Through piloting the program at the SLCC Florissant Valley and Meramec campuses, we are focusing our efforts on both increasing the number of students entering STEM programs as well as increasing the number of students completing STEM degrees.\r\nOur efforts are also expanded to recruit traditionally underrepresented students in STEM areas by reaching to school districts with 50% or more minority student populations. The project activities include: (1) Windows to STEM Opportunities program--designed to bring high school students and parents to the college campus to meet faculty and to be introduced to STEM laboratories and to career opportunities, (2) Gateway to Math and Science program-designed for under prepared students to gain skills and knowledge in math, reading, writing, and science needed to enter college-level STEM programs, (3) Advising/Career Counseling Workshops--given to STEM faculty, support staff in academic advising, counseling, and the ACCESS office (whose personnel work with students with disabilities), (4) Models of Success seminars--developed to bring STEM professionals to the campus to meet with STEM students in small groups to share experiences in pursuing STEM education and careers, and (5) Expanded Articulation Agreement-- to ensure seamless transitions for students from their two-year STEM programs to four year institutions. Our overarching goal is to develop an innovative, sustainable structure for on-going recruitment and retention efforts across all disciplines within the STEM division in the College. \r\n",
