This project acquires the equipment and develops the materials necessary to engage undergraduate students in a novel genome project adapting and implementing materials from James Madison University. A DNA sequencer and sequence analysis software are being used to initiate the Lynx Genome Project as a unit in the Molecular Biology Laboratory course. Students are sequencing cDNA clones from lynx species (the Rhodes College mascot) and using the resulting data in evolutionary and functional prediction analyses. Results are expected to lead to insights in efforts to conserve these threatened species. High school students and teachers, a significant number of whom are members of groups underrepresented in the sciences, are participating through a Summer Scholars Program.\r\n",
