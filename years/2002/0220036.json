This will be accomplished by condensing all the hardware components of the sensor system, which includes optical interferometer, and microprocessor modules into a single miniaturized unit.    The micro fabrication methodologies will be employed for development of the Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), which will include wave-guides, and micro mechanical optical switches and rotating micro mirrors.    This system will drive a series of distributed optical fiber sensors designed for sensing of structural perturbations within a large sensing range.  Conversion of the bulky system into the miniaturized MEMS device will allow for mass production of MEMS-sensor modules for integration within structures as needed.  The sensory system will provide monitoring capabilities for excessive strains, cracks, delaminations, deflections, uneven load distributions, thermal shocks, impact loads, and corrosion. The outcomes of this research will have a tremendous impact on safety, maintenance, and efficient operation of the public works infrastructure systems that include myriads of facilities such as buildings, bridges, dams, tunnels, seaports, highways, pipelines, railroads, and power generation stations.  This research will provide new educational opportunities for civil engineering students, as they will learn to develop and work with modern tools to solve problems of great importance for the nation's public works infrastructure. Students involved in this project will benefit greatly by exposure to different research areas of engineering, particularly sensor technology, MEMS, structural testing, and industrial packaging of micro devices.\r\n",
