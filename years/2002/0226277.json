 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Services project is developing a web-based, searchable and browsable database tool to capture information about the goals, ongoing activities, deliverables, schedules, development stages and discipline areas covered by NSDL projects. It is cooperatively populated by the NSDL community and organized by its shared vision. To implement the Collaboration Finder the project is working with the NSDL Community Services Standing Committee to facilitate its use by the existing collections, services, and targeted research track projects. Close coordination with the Core Integration team is being maintained so as to inform the development of this key component of NSDL. Evaluation of the benefits of this service includes outcome measures such as frequency and type of usage of the Collaboration Finder by different groups of NSDL participants and constituents, the number and type of new activities generated through use of the Collaboration Finder, and the effectiveness and efficiencies in developing successful collaborations among current and prospective NSDL projects.",
