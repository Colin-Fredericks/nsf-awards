 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twin Cities Public Television is producing the second and third seasons of Dragonfly TV, the science television series targeted at children ages 9 - 12.  The series presents children showing their own scientific investigations and sharing the excitement that comes from making their own discoveries.  Adult scientists are interspersed among the several groups of children who present research.  They present their own research, their discoveries and their love of science.  These adult reports are laced with home movies and snapshots of the adults when they were kids, linking childhood experiences to successful careers in science.   Outreach for Dragonfly TV consists of a Dragonfly insert in the magazine Explorations, an interactive website where children can share their science investigations and programs at selected Boys and Girls Clubs of America and 4H Clubs.  Teacher's Guides will be developed by Miami University of Ohio and distributed through the journals of the National Science Teachers Association.\r\n\r\n",
