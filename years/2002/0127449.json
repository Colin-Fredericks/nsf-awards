 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economics (82)\r\nEconomics students enrolled in large lecture-based introductory courses rarely have the\r\nopportunity to interact with course content. Because of this they do not gain a deep\r\nunderstanding of the material or the ability to analyze and interpret complex economic\r\nevents. Classroom experiments have been shown to be useful in aiding student\r\nunderstanding of the material. In the past these exercises have been impractical in large\r\ncourses. This project is developing wireless classroom technology to allow students in\r\nlarge classes to participate in classroom experiments during the class meeting times. We\r\nhave assembled a cross-disciplinary group that is creating a learning system that is making it \r\npossible to realize the benefits of classroom experiments in large classes. Our vision is of a\r\nportable system composed of standard electronic handheld devices (such as PDAs) that\r\ncommunicate with a laptop computer that will organize economics simulations such as\r\nmarkets, public goods environments and economic games. While other researchers are\r\ncurrently working on internet-based experiments, such systems do not translate to large\r\nclasses unless students complete the exercise asynchronously. The instructor has only\r\nvery limited ability to revise the game in response to student questions or suggestions.\r\nEvaluation is a critical component of this project. We have designed a controlled\r\nexperiment to collect data on performance in a large lecture course. We are evaluating\r\nto what extent this wireless system can improve student outcomes and reduce costs.",
