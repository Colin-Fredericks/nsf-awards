 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nIntroductory Biology laboratories work best when students actively engage in genuine\r\nscientific inquiry. We are following the precedent set by Project Kaleidoscope (PKAL) and transforming the CLU's Introductory Biology lab course to one that emphasizes the major processes of science: the formation and testing of hypotheses, observation, interpretation, experimentation, analysis, and communication (both oral and written). We are purchasing four functional groups of equipment to develop a new course, Introduction to Biological Experimentation (IBE). IBE offers lab exercises that support an inquiry-based approach. Emphasis on investigative biology at the introductory level better prepares our science students for upper division courses and research experiences, and enhances their prospects for success in graduate programs, the health professions, and jobs in research, clinical, and business settings. Students enrolled in CLU's Science Educators program (conducted with CLU's School of Education) are receiving better training in the methods of science as a result of our new IBE course. This project is contributing to the important national goal of training more capable K-12 science educators. The equipment of this project is also expanding the types of experiments that young minority students enrolled in our science Upward Bound summer program (High School minority students) can conduct. We are evaluating the new labs and disseminating successful experiments through print and electronic media.",
