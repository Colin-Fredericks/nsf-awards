 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor R. Daniel Little, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is studying the reaction chemistry of trimethylenemethane diradicals and 1,3-diyl radical cations. Using diazenes as diradical precursors, Professor Little is exploring the factors responsible for selective formation of 8-membered ring carbocyclic compounds or their 6-membered ring isomers, as well as oxygen- and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic analogs. Symmetrical and unsymmetrical 1,3-diyl radical cations are the subjects of studies relating to the assembly of 7- and 8-membered ring compounds as well as mechanistic analyses of cation radical equilibration and recoil accompanying loss of nitrogen from diazenes.\r\n\r\nMany organic compounds which display interesting chemical or biological activity contain 7- or 8-membered rings of atoms. The development of efficient techniques for the synthesis of such cyclic compounds remains of great interest, particularly in light of the generally greater stability of smaller-ring (5- and 6-membered) compounds.  Professor R. Daniel Little, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is developing new reactions allowing the selective synthesis of 7- and 8-membered ring compounds and studying the factors responsible for the selectivity of these reactions.",
