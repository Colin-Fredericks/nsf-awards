 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Undergraduate Research Experience in Phylogenetic Approaches to\r\nBiological Problems will allow undergraduates to participate for ten weeks\r\nduring each of the summers of 2002-04.  Research projects will span diverse\r\nareas of biology from phycology, molecular evolution, behavioral ecology and\r\nmicrobial diversity but will all have a common phylogenetic perspective.\r\nTen highly qualified undergraduates will be selected for each summer's\r\nprogram from local and national institutions with attention paid to\r\nrecruiting from underrepresented groups.  The main objectives of this\r\nprogram are to 1) train students in basic methods of molecular biology and\r\nbioinformatics , 2) provide a mentored research experience using these\r\ntechniques, 3) educate students about the diversity of problems to be\r\nunderstood with such techniques, and 4) raise awareness of research career\r\nopportunities.  These objectives will be attained by a combination of\r\ntutorials in theory and techniques common to all of the projects of the\r\nprogram, mentored research by individual faculty, a seminar program\r\ndelivered by visiting specialists, and career advising by local staff and\r\nformer alumni of the program.  The program will culminate in a day-long\r\nresearch symposium presented by the participants.  The long-term goals of\r\nthe experience are increased awareness of and competitiveness for careers in\r\nresearch and/or university-level teaching.\r\n",
