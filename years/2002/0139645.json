 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding to the University of Kansas for a three-year REU Site in Biomechanical Engineering under the direction of Dr. Kenneth J. Fischer.  The project will involve 10 undergraduate students each year for a ten week summer program.  Students will work with a faculty mentor on individual research projets in biomechanical engineering.  In addition to individual research experiences, students will be involved in several group activities.  These activities will provide the student with 1) a breadth of exposure to different scientific problems and research approaches, 2) detailed information about additional educational career opportunities, 3) an environment that facilitates student-student and student-faculty interactions, and 4) an opportunity to explore research ethics in the field of biomechanical engineering.  These group activities will include a weekly seminar, a research ethics mini-series, tours of research laboratories, and social activities.  At the end of the summer program students will give an oral presentation at a research symposium, and will submit a report on their research project to their faculty mentor.  Students will also have the opportunity to attend a national scientific meeting of their choice.",
