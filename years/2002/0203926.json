In particular, \r\nthe principal investigator proposes to investigate injectivity radius estimates \r\nfor solutions to the Ricci flow. The PI proposes to study\r\nLi-Yau-Hamilton (Harnack) inequalities for both the Ricci flow and the \r\nlinearized Ricci flow. The PI also proposes to study collapsing sequences of solutions \r\nto the Ricci flow and the related compactness theory. Finally, the PI proposes to \r\nstudy estimates for the linearized Ricci flow and\r\ntheir applications. The PI will focus on dimension 3, where there are the \r\nmost tools available and the problems posed have the most topological applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ricci flow is an evolution equation which deforms geometric structures \r\non surfaces and manifolds both improving and smoothing out the structures. \r\nIt has been at the cutting edge of the recent rapid progress in geometric \r\nevolution equations and has greatly influenced the study of the mean curvature\r\nflow and many other geometric evolution equations. The work on \r\nunderstanding the singularities which develop under the flow has led to the development \r\nof new and powerful analytic and geometric tools, which have found applications in the\r\nstudy of many geometric evolution equations. Many phenomena are\r\nmodeled by geometric evolution equations, such as heat transfer, the \r\nevolution of interfaces between molten and solid metal, and the interfaces between ice \r\nand water. Geometric evolution equations are also used to smooth out images and \r\nhave applications in computer vision.\r\n",
