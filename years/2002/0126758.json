 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nThe purpose of this project is to introduce modern multinuclear Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy experiments throughout the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Experiments are drawn from pedagogical and research literature and are adapted to specific courses. They are designed to present students with a breadth of hands-on NMR experiences to illustrate the power and variety of NMR techniques. Laboratory experiments begin with an introduction to 1H NMR spectroscopy in the freshman year. The sophomore year uses a more rigorous treatment of 1H and 13C NMR and, in the junior year, students receive an introduction to the power of NMR as a method to study kinetics, nuclear spin relaxation mechanisms, and multiple pulse experiments, and they explore instrumental factors. In their senior year, students use a variety of sophisticated one and two-dimensional NMR techniques (COSY, HETCOR, DEPT, INADEQUATE) to determine the structure and properties of spectrally complex molecules. This project is designed to positively impact the science education of all chemistry and biology majors. In addition, the NMR is being used extensively by students involved in undergraduate research. Students from nearby Southern Virginia University also are making use of the instrument in several of their courses and through their participation in undergraduate research.\r\n",
