These\r\nproblems are inextricably interwoven by concept and\r\ntechnique. Operator theory provides the major unifying framework,\r\ncombined with an integration of ideas from a diverse spectrum of\r\nmathematics including classical Fourier analysis, noncommutative\r\nharmonic analysis, representation theory, operator algebras,\r\napproximation theory, and signal processing.  For example, the\r\nconstruction, implementation, and ensuing theory of single dyadic\r\northonormal wavelets in Euclidean space requires significant input\r\nfrom all of these disciplines as well as deep spectral-tile \r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThere is intrinsic mathematical importance in the aforementioned \r\nproblems,  and the solutions to be formulated have broad and \r\ncreative implications, both for mathematics and for applications \r\nin engineering and physics. The topics of this project have \r\ndirect bearing on fast acquisition and motion problems in MRI, \r\nas well as in formulating algorithms for compression and noise \r\nreduction by means of proper cochlear modelling. There are further\r\napplications in quantum computing and image processing, and the \r\ndevelopment of non-uniform sampling strategies by this project \r\nplay  a role in state of the art A/D conversion methods used in \r\nmultifunction RF systems.  These interdisciplinary applications \r\ndepending on modern mathematical analysis have educational \r\nimplications in terms of cross-fertilization of ideas and research\r\nopportunities for graduate students. \r\n \r\n",
