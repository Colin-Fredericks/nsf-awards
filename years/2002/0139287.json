 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator, together with various collaborators, studies\r\nthe cohomology of arithmetic groups as modules over an algebra of Hecke\r\noperators.   He considers conjectures connecting  (1) mod-p cohomology\r\nclasses of congruence groups which are eigenclasses for all the Hecke\r\noperators  with (2) mod-p representations of the Galois (symmetry) group\r\nof the algebraic numbers.  These conjectures amount to saying there should\r\nexist reciprocity laws (usually non-abelian) connecting the two types of\r\nobjects.  The conjectures are tested computationally, which leads to\r\nfurther refinements of them.  The principal investigator outlines an\r\napproach for proving them in some special cases.  Another set of computer\r\ncalculations probe for the existence of automorphic representations of\r\ncohomological type which are not lifted from smaller rank groups.  These\r\nare conjecturally connected with reciprocity laws of Langlands type.\r\nFinally, the investigator and a colleague develop a theory of p-adic\r\nfamilies of not necessarily p-ordinary cohomology classes for congruence\r\ngroups.  They use this to study the question whether non-lifted\r\nautomorphic representations are \"p-adically rigid\".\r\n\t\r\nAlgebraic number theory studies the properties of polynomial\r\nfunctions and equations whose coefficients are whole numbers.  Ever since\r\nDescartes invented analytic geometry in the early 1600's, the ability to\r\nsolve algebraic equations has been central to mathematics, science and\r\nengineering.  In the last 50 years a new set of applications of number\r\ntheory has opened up in the field of cryptography.  The principal\r\ninvestigator studies delicate questions involving the fine structure and\r\nproperties of solutions to certain systems of algebraic equations.\r\nAlthough one can often obtain approximate solutions using computers, there\r\nare many very subtle and difficult questions concerning the existence and\r\nform of the exact solutions. There are a number of conjectures on the\r\ntable to explain what is going on, and the principal investigator has\r\ncontributed some of them.  He and his colleagues study these conjectures\r\nby verifying them in some cases by extensive computer calculations, and by\r\nproving them in special cases.  At the core of this research is the\r\nsurprising connection with geometric objects (\"cohomology classes\") that\r\ncan be constructed in spaces of n-dimensional crystal lattices.  \r\n",
