Three directions of research will be pursued: the analysis of models \r\nin cancer chemotherapy, an analysis of models for HIV-infection and anti-\r\nviral treatment of AIDS, and the design and analysis of a general \r\nmathematical framework which combines common features of both cancer \r\nand HIV models. The investigators will use their previous experience \r\nworking on cancer chemotherapy models and apply new tools based on \r\nthe method of characteristics and high-order conditions for optimality. In \r\ncompartmental models for cancer chemotherapy the cell-cycle is \r\ncontrolled by clustering its phases into compartments and using phase \r\nspecific cytostatic killing and blocking agents. The goal is to maximize the \r\nnumber of cancer cells that the cytostatic agent in the drug kills while \r\nkeeping the toxicity to the normal tissue acceptable. In this project a \r\nsynthesis of optimal controls for these models will be constructed. \r\nFurthermore, more complex mathematical models that take into account \r\nadditional aspects such as evolving drug resistance or bone marrow \r\ndestruction will be analyzed. Due to the complexity of HIV infection, \r\nmathematical models for AIDS have only recently been developed and \r\nstill are constantly being revised and updated taking new medical data into \r\naccount. With the main attention so far given to the form of the dynamics \r\nthat best models the interactions between the virus and the human immune \r\nsystem under drug treatment, many of these models still have not been \r\nformulated as optimal control problems. The investigators will analyze a \r\nvariety of these models in the framework of optimal control and compare \r\nthe solutions aiming at a design of optimal treatment protocols.\r\n\r\nIn the project, the investigators will consider mathematical models in the \r\nchemotherapy of diseases that have a strong cell proliferation aspect such \r\na cancer or AIDS. These models will be analyzed as optimal control \r\nproblems with the drug dosage serving as control parameter with the goal \r\nof maximizing the number of cancer cells killed by the drug in the case of \r\ncancer (respectively maximizing the number of uninfected cells in the case \r\nof chemotherapy for AIDS) while minimizing the harmful side effects and \r\ncost of the chemotherapy. Although individually these problems are very \r\ndifferent in their specifics, they also have many aspects in common and \r\ncan be put into one general mathematical model that encompasses them \r\nall. Thus, while on one side there is a need to consider these problems \r\nseparately to understand the implications for the underlying disease, on the \r\nother side there are simplifications and insights to be gained by looking at \r\nthe general properties common to these models. This project will address \r\nboth directions. A biomedical interpretation of the conditions that optimal \r\ncontrols satisfy will be given in terms understandable by biomedical \r\npersonnel and the conditions will be related to the underlying biological \r\nsituation. It is expected that the outcomes of this project will be of interest \r\nto the medical community by giving some insights into the analysis of \r\nexisting chemotherapy protocols for cancer or HIV and possibly aid in the \r\ndesign of new improved protocols. These results are particularly important \r\nfor HIV treatments which so far do not cure the disease, but only provide a \r\nlong-term maintenance program.\r\n",
