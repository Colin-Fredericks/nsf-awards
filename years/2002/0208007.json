 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nAcross the interior American West,cattle ranches are being converted to subdivisions,in order to\r\naccommodate exurban population expansion.What are the biodiversity consequences of this\r\nprofound land use change?That is the core question addressed by this proposed research.\r\nConversion of rangelands to subdivisions may negatively impact native biodiversity through\r\ndirect habitat loss.It has been argued that finding ways to keep ranchers from selling their lands\r\nto developers is vital to conservation.On the other hand,most western ranches include some\r\npublic lands that cannot be sold,and even on private lands the developments usually are low\r\ndensity.Therefore,western exurban development often results in relatively little direct habitat\r\nloss.If a landscape is converted by scattered subdivisions,but simultaneously released from the\r\ncontrolling influence of livestock grazing,will this result in net gains or losses of regional\r\nbiodiversity?So far,a volatile mixture of prediction and passion has fueled this debate,but\r\nrarely has it been informed by data.\r\nThe purpose of this proposed study is to quantify components of native biodiversity in a\r\ngrassland/savanna in the Sonoita Valley of southeastern Arizona,where some cattle ranches are\r\nbeing converted into subdivisions.This study will compare flowering plant,grasshopper,\r\nbutterfly,bird,and rodent populations in landscapes that are being grazed,or subdivided,or\r\nboth,or neither.It also will quantify the demographics of three bird species known to be\r\nparticularly responsive to the effects of livestock grazing and/or landscape conversion through\r\nsubdivision.The data will be used to test a series of hypotheses and predictions about the\r\nindependent and interactive effects of exurban development and livestock grazing on 1)species\r\nrichness and evenness of native biotic communities,2)invasions of exotic species into those\r\ncommunities,3)population and community stability,and 4)avian demographics.\r\nThe centerpiece of this work will be the Appleton-Whittell Research Sanctuary,a 3200 ha\r\npreserve that has been ungrazed and otherwise undisturbed since 1968,and that has been the\r\nfocus of extensive fieldwork since the early 1970 's.Unlike many land use studies in the West,\r\nthis one will have a control,to the degree that 33 years protection have permitted patterns of\r\nnative biodiversity to express themselves in the absence of either agriculture or exurban\r\ndevelopment.\r\nResults of this study will address basic and unanswered questions about the relative impacts of\r\nlocal forces (livestock grazing)versus landscape conversion (subdivision)on biodiversity in arid,\r\nnon-forested western ecosystems,where 1)natural landscape heterogeneity is high,2)\r\ndevelopment is distant from the controlling influences of large urban centers,and 3)subdivision\r\nusually consists of scattered landscape intrusions rather than fragmentation of the grassland into\r\nisolated patches.The study will make societal contributions that are both timely and urgent,\r\ngiven present rates of development in the rural West,and the many uncertainties about its\r\necological consequences.",
