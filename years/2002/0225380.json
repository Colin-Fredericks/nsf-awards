 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an integrated research and education program that is centered on computing motion strategies in geometry-intensive applications.  A healthy synergy will be obtained by balancing efforts between both core issues and specialized applications.  The core of this research program is rooted in robot motion planning, and it is built on a broader unified mathematical framework that incorporates concepts from optimal control theory, computational geometry, statistical decision theory, and dynamic game theory.  This leads to the proposed investigation of three core algorithmic issues:  1) searching high-dimensional spaces that have algebraic and differential constraints, 2)responding to unpredictable changes and on-line information, and 3) solving sensor-based tasks and processing incomplete information.  The focus is significantly broader than traditional path planning.  The core research is guided by efforts in several applications, such as mobile robotics with active sensing, virtual prototyping-hazardous environments.  These research efforts are incorporated into an education plan that:  1)builds an interdisciplinary group of graduate students who are carefully guided through the education and research process, ii) introduces undergraduates to research, particularly through mobile robotics and graphical simulation projects, iii) takes steps towards an interdisiplinary curriculum in geometric algorithms, and iv) helps those from disadvantaged backgrounds to realize their potential and excel in their careers.",
