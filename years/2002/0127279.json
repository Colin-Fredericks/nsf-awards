 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\nWe are meeting the growing need for genomics studies in undergraduate education by creating a course entitled \"Molecular Methods in Environmental Engineering\". An integral part of our course has been to create teams of students collaborating through the use of inquiry based laboratory modules. These student are performing group projects following the \"full-cycle 16S rRNA approach\". This course has been popular among our students in Civil and Environmental Engineering program. Our curriculum materials have been designed to be incorporated into other disciplines e.g. Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering on other campuses. This material has undergone extensive testing and evaluation by our staff. We have created a laboratory manual with an accompanying CDROM for dissemination of these laboratory experiments through appropriate commercial channels. Additional support materials are also available on the World Wide Web to help faculty and their students. We are presenting present papers in peer reviewed journals like the Journal of Engineering Education. We also plan to make a presentation at the upcoming AEESP/AAEE Conference on Education and Research Needs in Environmental Engineering and Science on August 11-13, 2002 at the University of Toronto.",
