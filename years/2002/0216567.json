We have developed a relatively inexpensive, robust, sensitive magnetometer in\r\nkit form that can be purchased and distributed to schools, assembled by students, then set\r\nup and used to take research-quality data. Teachers will be trained in their operation and\r\nhow to use them in classroom activities that demonstrate \"space-weather.\" The data will be\r\ntransmitted through a Web-based database, so that students can compare their local\r\nreadings with those of students at other sites around the continent and can be used by\r\nuniversity and other researchers to study geomagnetic Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) waves.\r\nLow- to mid- latitude magnetic pulsations provide important information about the solar\r\nwind-magnetosphere interaction and the dynamic coupling of the magnetosphere and\r\nionosphere. The magnetic variations observable at low to mid latitudes include: Pc 3-4\r\npulsations (periods of 10-45 s), which are thought to have their source in the upstream\r\nbow shock and or magnetosheath; and Pi 2 bursts (damped pulsations with 40-150-s periods)\r\nwhich are associated with substorm expansion onsets. This proposal seeks funding to train\r\nMaster High School science teachers in the use of induction coil magnetometers, provide\r\nthe basic space science content needed for the understanding of magnetic pulsation data in\r\nspace physics research, and develop mentoring relationships between space physicists and\r\nlocal high school science teachers and their students. These relationships will allow the\r\nmagnetometer data to be fully utilized both scientifically as well as educationally.\r\nSpecifically we plan to develop the documentation for the magnetometer, training material\r\nfor testing the instrument, and educational material for using the instrument in the\r\nclassroom. This material will be the basis for a one-week teacher workshop at UCLA\r\nbringing together six geographically diverse science teachers that have already gone\r\nthrough a space weather workshop at NOAA Space Environment Center in order to train them\r\nas Master Teachers in the use and implementation of the magnetometer. This project\r\ndirectly impacts pre-college education by providing High Schools with real-life space\r\nphysics instrumentation and ULF data for analysis.\r\n",
