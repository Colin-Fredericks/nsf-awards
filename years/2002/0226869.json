 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his collaborators will investigate certain\r\n\"arithmetic fundamental groups,\" that is to say the Galois group of\r\na global field (finite extension of the rational numbers or the function\r\nfield of a curve over a finite field) with a specified (finite) set of\r\nbranch points.  They will study, in particular, extensions in which the\r\nfiltration of the Galois group by higher ramification groups has fixed\r\nbounded length, especially in connection with a conjecture of Fontaine and\r\nMazur.  The proposed activity includes a computational component which\r\nseeks to construct infinite fundamental groups with extremal properties.  \r\nSuch explicit constructions give a good qualitative understanding of the\r\nasymptotic behavior of discriminant with respect to the degree (number\r\nfields) and genus with respect to the number of points (curves over finite\r\nfields).  The latter has applications to the efficiency of certain codes\r\nmade from number fields and function fields.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal in number theory, the oldest branch of mathematics\r\nwhere the fundamental question is that of solving polynomial equations.\r\nKnowledge regarding solutions of polynomial equations is of fundamental\r\nimportance in cryptology and coding theory, the science of secure and\r\nefficient transmission of data.  Solutions of polynomial equations in one\r\nunkown are equipped with a kind of algebraic symmetry and the study of\r\nthese symmetries is called \"Galois theory.\"  These symmetries are encoded\r\nin a mathematical object called the Absolute Galois Group, which contains\r\nsuch a wealth of information about equations in not just one but any\r\nnumber of variables that it is sometimes known as the \"Holy Grail of\r\nNumber Theory.\"  This proposal is a theoretical and computational\r\ninvestigation of certain aspects of the Absolute Galois Group.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
