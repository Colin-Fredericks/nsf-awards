 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator continues work on the Kneser-Poulsen\r\nConjecture that was started with Professor Karoly Bezdek.  This\r\nconjecture says that if any finite collection of disks in the\r\nEuclidean plane is rearranged so that the distance between any\r\npair of centers does not increase, then the area of the union\r\ndoes not increase and the area of the interesection does not\r\ndecrease.  They have solved the conjecture in the plane, but many\r\nhigher-dimensional questions remain.  For example, there is a\r\ncandidate for a configuration that might be a counterexample for\r\nthe analogous statement in three-space, and there are some\r\ninteresting possible differences between the case for a union of\r\ndisks and the intersection of disks.  Another major topic is the\r\nstudy of linkages in the plane that are locked in the sense that\r\nthey can only move a small amount without crossing.  The theory\r\nof frameworks and tensegrities plays an important role here and\r\ncan be applied to give reasonable criteria to detect when such a\r\nlinkage is locked.  This is continuing work of the investigator,\r\nErik Demaine, and Gunter Rote, who originally solved the\r\ncarpenter's rule problem, which states that any polygonal arc can\r\nbe opened without creating any self-intersection.\r\n     The investigator works on certain basic, fundamental\r\nquestions about the geometry of discrete objects.  Just as\r\nphysics asks fundamental questions about the nature of matter,\r\nspace, and the universe, and the physical laws they must obey,\r\ngeometry asks fundamental questions about how geometric objects\r\ninteract and the implicit constraints they satisfy.  How does the\r\narea of the union of round disks change as the centers are moved\r\napart?  The investigator (with Karoly Bezdek) has shown that the\r\narea behaves (it increases or stays the same) as expected in the\r\nplane, but the situation in space is not so clear.  When is a\r\nrobot arm in the plane rigid, and when can it be opened?  The\r\ninvestigator (with Erik Demaine and Gunter Rote) has shown that\r\narms open as expected in the plane, but what about more\r\ncomplicated linkages?  What can be said about the rigidity of\r\npackings of round balls as a granular material?  The investigator\r\nis an expert in such matters, but there are delicate questions\r\nabout the rigidity in a container with a small number of disks.\r\nThe volume enclosed by a flexible surface is constant, but what\r\nabout other geometric invariants? These are concrete tangible\r\nobjects, but accessible to the appropriate geometric insight.\r\nThese questions are both relevant and potentially quite useful\r\nfor subjects as wide-ranging as cell biology, protein folding,\r\nkinematics, and granular materials.  For example, it is widely\r\nbelieved that the geometric structure of a cell has a great deal\r\nto do with its function.  So the rigidity of appropriate discrete\r\nobjects is relevant.  As has been shown over and over again in\r\nphysics and mathematics, if the questions are to the point,\r\napplications follow.\r\n\r\n",
