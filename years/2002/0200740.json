 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI studies several problems about triangulations of (lattice)\r\npolytopes which are motivated by connections to other fields of\r\nmathematics:\r\nThe reconstruction problem is concerned with the relation of a\r\npolytope and its graph, which is of interest for linear \r\noptimization. Algebraic applications are concerned with polytopes \r\nwhose vertices have all integral coordinates. The existence \r\nproblem of unimodular triangulations and its variations has \r\nimplications to computational algebra, algebraic geometry, and \r\nphysical string theory. The methods used are mainly discrete \r\ngeometric or combinatorial, with some ideas borrowed from \r\ntopology and differential geometry.\r\n\r\nConvex polytopes are fascinating objects that have intrigued not \r\nonly mathematicians since the ancient Greeks. The Platonic \r\nsolids --- the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, the \r\ndodecahedron, and the icosahedron --- are the most prominent and \r\nmost mystified examples. Since George Dantzig's simplex method, \r\nlinear optimization has been a driving force behind polytope \r\ntheory, and it certainly is one of the most successful \r\napplications of mathematics to the `real world'. In the mean time, \r\npolytope theory found many more applications within mathematics, \r\nand beyond. Besides linear and integer programming, there are \r\noptimization, CAD, visualization, and even theoretical physics,\r\njust to name a few.\r\n",
