 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation began the development of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) several years ago and it is scheduled to come online this coming year.  The NSDL is a connection or system of separate data or information sources.  Bringing these disparate sources together is a complex issue, from both the technical perspective and organization dynamics\r\n\r\nThis study will focus on the institutionalization of NSDL from both a technical and contextual perspective.  The latter includes such factors as priorities and culture of the participating organizations, how they interact with the technical considerations. A comparative case study will be used, with the internet serving as a comparison, a system that has already been institutionalized and studied.  The study will provide an evaluative framework to employ with the NSDL as it is implemented but will be applicable to large-scale IT systems, as well. \r\n",
