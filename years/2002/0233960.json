More specifically, it addresses a new class of  hybrid systems\r\nwhich can reconfigure themselves to handle different physical tasks at different times, yet operating concurrently. Very little progress has been achieved to date on such problems.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates a hybrid extension of Milner's pi-calculus to allow processes written in this language to interact with continuous environments. The extension is the phi-calculus.\r\nThe reasons for pursuing this approach are as follows. (1) The phi-calculus is believed to  subsume and properly extend most of the current versions of hybrid systems; for example, hybrid automata  hybrid  I-O automata  hybrid Petri nets,  and HybridCC; (2) The goal is to be able to model distributed logical control and interaction with continuous processes in a principled structural way. The pi-calculus, using its algebraic process-structuring primitives, has been shown to  be\r\na rich  language in which many interesting discrete concurrent phenomena can be expressed: a language for, and theory of, communicating processes which can  reconfigure themselves; a language in which distributed objects and classes can be defined; and a language and theory\r\ncapable not only of expressing interaction, but arbitrary computation, in that the lambda-calculus of Church can be translated into it; (3) This all suggests that successful hybrid versions of algebraic \r\ncalculi will have novel and elegant ways of expressing hybrid systems --possibilities for distributed control which would be awkward, if not impossible, to express in current formalisms.\r\n",
