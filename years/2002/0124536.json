Harrison, Clemson University\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the effect of small amounts of elasticity on the performance of fluids flowing through spray nozzles.  The work is motivated by a desire in the agricultural spraying industry to produce relatively monodisperse drop size distributions that can be effectively targeted to specific crop regions and can avoid dispersion over adjacent land.  This general problem is complicated by several issues, including (1) variations in nozzle design and application method, (2) variations in fluid properties, and (3) requirements for different sized drops for different applications.  The research described in this project will provide fundamental experimental results that will address all of the issues outlined above.  It is well known that adding polymer can enhance the drop properties in spraying applications.  This work will focus on well-characterized elastic liquids that will be employed in carefully designed nozzles to determine the impact of material properties and geometry on spray properties.\r\n",
