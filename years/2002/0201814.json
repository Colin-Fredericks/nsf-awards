 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fifth International Conference on Forensic Statistics will be held at Isola di San Servolo, Venice, Italy, on August 30th to September 2nd, 2002. The conference is intended to allow statisticians, forensic scientists, lawyers, and scholars from related disciplines to discuss the many and varied uses of statistics and probability in legislative, administrative and judicial proceedings. Forensic Statistics, the application of statistics and probability to legal matters, is an expanding field. The current debates surrounding the presentation of evidence based on DNA profiling, epidemiological studies on the health effects of various drugs, and racial profiling are just three examples. There is a great need for statisticians to provide guidance to forensic scientists, and lawyers and the courts. By bringing together statisticians, forensic scientists, lawyers and other scholars, this fifth international conference will further the interdisciplinary understanding of Statistics and Probability applied to legal matters. Previous conferences in this series have been held at North Carolina State University, the University of Edinburg, and the Arizona State University. This proposal provides funds to insure that U.S. participants will be able to hear and network with experts on this topic from around the world, and to provide access to the conference for selected new researchers and members of underrepresented groups",
