 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Oregon Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparation of Teachers (OCEPT) is a statewide collaborative established to improve the mathematics and science preparation of future teachers in Oregon and increase the diversity of the population of students preparing to be teachers. It has involved over 500 science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (STEM) and Education faculty and administrators, academic advisors, and K-12 teachers, from virtually all of the 34 institutions of higher education in the state, as well as numerous school districts. More than 200 courses and programs have been developed and/or significantly impacted. Reported changes include using more diverse teaching and assessment strategies, adoption of standards-based instructional techniques, and inclusion of opportunities for related teaching experiences with K-12 students. OCEPT-influenced classrooms are more interactive, incorporate greater use of technology, conceptual development and more of a focus on scientific inquiry and/or mathematics problem solving. The OCEPT II Follow-On project is conducting a comprehensive summative evaluation to provide evidence of the impact of OCEPT on faculty, preservice students, institutions, and new teachers. An \"Outcomes Research Study \" is the primary vehicle for providing evidence about new teachers and STEM faculty who taught them. Through this study, novice teachers are observed and interviewed over a 2-to-3 year time span, and OCEPT faculty who have taught these teachers are observed and interviewed. In addition, the project is utilizing instruments from the CETP Core Evaluation study and contributing to the overall CETP evaluation effort. Induction support and professional development is provided for novice teachers. In collaboration with the Oregon Council of Teachers of Mathematics and the Oregon Science Teachers Association, OCEPT II provides workshops specifically designed for new teachers and their mentors, welcomes new teachers to statewide conferences, and provides memberships in the statewide professional organizations. Dissemination activities include support for Faculty Fellows to develop and publish scholarly articles on their work through the WRITE ON! Institute.",
