 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\nDespite increased emphasis on environmental chemistry across the curriculum at Georgia Southern University, non-major students and chemistry majors are not receiving meaningful, real world analysis experience in this vital area. This project seeks to remedy this situation by providing portable field instrumentation appropriate for use by lower level and senior students alike, as well as modern technology for the analysis of regionally relevant environmental pollutants. The project adapts initiatives undertaken at Western Carolina University (NSF 9750583), Roanoke College (NSF 9850796) and Emory and Henry College (NSF 9851010). By allowing students access to these changes in the curriculum, we:\r\n1. Expose them to modern methods of environmental analysis,\r\n2. Allow for on-site testing, with all its inherent challenges, and\r\n3. Stimulate student interest through examination of local issues/problems and development of critical thinking skills as they analyze the ramifications on their own lives.\r\nStudents gain a solid understanding of environmental testing techniques, awareness of the importance of environmental stewardship, and enhanced data analysis and report preparation skills as they undertake studies on total ecosystem quality. This is accomplished through intensive field studies, coupled with advanced laboratory experiences for upper level students. Georgia Southern educates significant numbers of minority and female students, and a new core requirement in environmental science ensures inclusion of students of virtually all major degree programs. The Chemistry Department has established collaborations with area water treatment plants, wildlife rehabilitation centers, sanitary landfill operators, and agricultural extension agents, thus providing a variety of appropriate field locations for student investigations. The newly-acquired equipment reflects modern technology and thus provides students with current practical experience.",
