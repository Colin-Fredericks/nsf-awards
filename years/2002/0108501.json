 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThe cereal crops foxtail millet and pearl millet, and noxious weeds\r\nsuch as green foxtail and sandbur are all closely related members of the\r\ngrass family, and are part of a group of 310 species descended from a\r\nsingle ancestor.  These plants are all characterized by odd \"bristles\"\r\ninterspersed among their flowers; the bristles are highly modified\r\nbranches.   This project will determine the precise relationships among as\r\nmany species as possible in the \"bristle group\" using DNA sequences from\r\nthe nucleus and the chloroplast.   At the same time, the development of the\r\nseed head (inflorescence) and flowers will be studied for a precise\r\ndescription of how the species differ.   Along with this, the graduate\r\nstudent supported on the grant will determine how many species are in the\r\nfoxtail millet group, what the species look like, and will write\r\nidentification guides to them.   Because there is already information on\r\nthe species in North and South America, this part of the project will focus\r\non Asia and Africa.\r\n\tThe information gained in this project will connect directly with\r\nother information already available on foxtail millet and the panicoid\r\ngrasses.  The genes that control morphological variation in foxtail millet\r\nare under active investigation, and some of these are similar to known\r\ngenes in maize.   It should soon be possible to describe morphological\r\nvariation in the clade in terms of the genes involved.  This  will help\r\nanswer questions about how species and larger groups are formed.  The\r\nresulting study will provide a direct and explicit link between phylogeny,\r\ndevelopmental morphology, and taxonomy, and will provide a framework for\r\nwork on the evolution of development",
