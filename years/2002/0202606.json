The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-four month research fellowship by Dr. Alka Agrawal to work with Dr. Robert Menard at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve the study of the basis of the irradiated sporozoite vaccine, which remains the most effective malaria vaccine to date.  Irradiated sporozoites are able to infect liver cells, but in the liver they fail to develop into stages of the parasite that later infect red blood cells.  The PI will develop a technique for identifying genes in P. berghei, a species that infects rodents, that are essential for parasite differentiation in the host liver.  She will then test the defective mutants for their ability to serve as attenuated malaria vaccines.  The expectation is that a number of genes will be found that are essential for parasite development in the liver, as well as parasite mutants that could serve as attenuated vaccines or the starting point for new vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe Pasteur Institute is well known for its focus on infectious disease and has several investigators working on malaria.\r\n",
