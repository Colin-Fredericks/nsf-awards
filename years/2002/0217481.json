 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Collaborative Research/Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) provides funding for the development and implementation of a methodology for the analysis and optimization of a distributed sensor system in electronics assembly processes for the purpose of process fault diagnosis.  The proposed modeling tool will integrate product quality information and process characteristics in a multi-station assembly system framework using a station-indexed state space model. Then, the diagnosability of a generic distributed sensor system will be explored by expending the concept of observability in control theory. This will further lead to development of the fault diagnosis method for fault feature extraction based on the multivariate data analysis.  The understanding of the transformation of quality information, offered by the state space quality-fault model and diagnosability analysis, will guide the optimal design of a sensing system.  This project will be carried out through a close collaboration partnered by Texas A&M University, the University of Wisconsin - Madison, and Motorola Florida Research Labs (MFRL). The methodology development will be based on, and the resulting technology will be tested and implemented in, the Motorola radio assembly process.  \r\n     If successful, the results of this project will contribute to sensing and information technology in manufacturing: new concepts and criteria regarding the performance of sensor systems will be defined and effective algorithms for sensing optimization and data analysis will be developed. Curriculum developed from research accomplishments will generate long-term impacts on the education of quality engineering and production system. The resulting technology will also benefit the US electronics manufacturers who are under great pressure from their international competitors. According to a White Paper issued by the Interconnection Technology Research Institute in 1999, over 100 of 650 U.S. electronics fabricators have gone out of business in the past five years. The lack of six-sigma quality is identified as the weakest point of for US manufacturers. Industrial implementation of the resulting methodology will aid US manufacturers in remaining competitive and could generate substantial economic impacts.",
