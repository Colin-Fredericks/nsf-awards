 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hanson\r\n0207081\r\n     The principal investigator and his colleagues develop\r\ncomputational stochastic dynamic programming methods to find\r\napproximations to optimally control the expected objective value\r\nfor a wide variety of applications.  These applications include\r\nthe optimal treatment of cancer by chemotherapy drugs, the\r\noptimal financial investment portfolio and parameter estimation,\r\noptimal control of stochastic manufacturing systems, and the\r\noptimal remediation of ground water pollution.  The wide scope of\r\ntestbed applications helps to increase the robustness of their\r\nadvanced numerical methods by having to treat a variety of models\r\nand boundary conditions.  Another characteristic of many of these\r\napplications is that the most severe changes happen as jumps of\r\nthe system and many models utilize stochastic jump-diffusion\r\nprocesses.  The computation of optimal approximations in jump\r\nenvironments is a unique feature of the models, where increased\r\nrealism of the models more than compensates for the added burden\r\nof increased computational complexity over diffusions.  The\r\ninvestigator is writing an applied book with a colleague on\r\nstochastic processes and control emphasizing jump-diffusion\r\nmodels to give broader impact to their more general results.  The\r\nmathematical level is intermediate so that it is accessible and\r\nuseful to those who actually work with real applications in\r\nscience, engineering, and finance.\r\n     The principal investigator and colleagues study models of\r\nsystems in uncertain environments and seek optimal computational\r\napproximations to get the best performance from these systems.\r\nMany of the applications are national challenges.  One\r\napplication is the optimal management of cancer chemotherapy when\r\ncancer cells develop resistance to a cancer drug combination.\r\nThe impact of finding optimal cancer treatment schedules would be\r\nsignificant because cancer is a leading cause of death.  Another\r\napplication is computational solutions for optimal investor\r\nportfolio and consumption problems in a market with crashes in\r\nvalue; the benefit is a better understanding of our nation's and\r\nthe world's financial systems.  A third application is the\r\noptimal scheduling of manufacturing systems subject to uncertain\r\nfailures, repairs, and other disruptions.  Here improved\r\nefficiencies are important for the national economic well-being.\r\nA fourth application is the optimal remediation of pollution in\r\nground water, with important environmental consequences.  Students\r\nare involved in these projects, providing them with significant\r\nexperience in interdisciplinary research.  Finally, the\r\ninvestigators are writing an intermediate level applied book on\r\nthe optimal control of systems in uncertain environments with\r\nlarge changes, integrating their results over a wide variety of\r\napplications.  The aim is to bring these ideas in a more\r\naccessible form to scientists and engineers.\r\n",
