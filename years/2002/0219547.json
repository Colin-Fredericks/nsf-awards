Uboh (South Cobb High School)\r\nInstitution:  Southern Polytechnic State U.,\r\n\r\nTITLE: ITR: A Community Based Partnership for Community-Based Education (COPIRE)\r\n\r\nThis ITR- and ITWF-funded project is a partnership between Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) (a suburban technology-focused institution), Kennesaw Mountain High (KMH) School (a new school with a magnet program) and South Cobb High (SCH) School (an established school, also with a magnet program). The project is driven by an overarching goal of establishing a community-based partnership, which focuses on an integration of education, research, and training in the design and development of embedded system simulations. The motivation for the project stems from 1) the plausibility of extending embedded system research/knowledge to high school students and 2) enhancing their opportunities and chances in the field.\r\n\r\nSPSU is involved in a Georgia statewide research initiative, Yamacraw, which is focussed on embedded software development and the design of broadband (high-speed) communications systems, devices, and chips.  SPSU's partnership project is designed to dovetail with Yamacraw to take advantage of the research resources of Yamacraw and to train students early in the academic pipeline.  SPSU is:\r\n\r\n1.  Partnering with KMH and SCH to select a cohort of both non-minority and minority students - females and males - at the 11th and 12th grade levels and SPSU undergraduates to be involved in various hands-on research projects. The students are participating in the program for 7 weeks during the summer and once a week when school is in session for 3 years;\r\n2.  Cstablishing a training, mentoring, role modeling, and a management group, which involves Yamacraw graduate students and the PIs, to support the program; and\r\n3.  Continually assessing and measuring achievements along the 'pipeline' to ensure successful transfer of students across its stages.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
