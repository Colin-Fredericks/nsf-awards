The investigators are Ranga Komanduri of Oklahoma State University (OSU) and Vijay Jain of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK).  The primary focus of their research is the finishing of advanced materials by magnetic field assisted polishing.  Their collaborative work  will have a direct impact on ultra-precision machining and finishing of advanced materials.  This is an area of high current interest and will contribute to fundamental understanding of the ultra-precision machining process.  \r\n\r\nScope:  The US PI is a recognized leader in the development of magnetic float technology and has established a state-of-the-art research facility at OSU.  They have been one of the most active groups in the finishing of advanced materials in the U.S. The Indian PI, an expert in magnetic abrasive finishing processes, is also well recognized for his work in manufacturing.  Their collaboration will advance technologies in each of their complementary areas and, by taking advantage of their combined knowledge base, they intend to extend their studies to a new technology, the magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing of advanced materials.  This project will support an international experience for a US graduate student and result in stronger cooperation between OSU and the IIT,Kanpur.  This project is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Design, Manufacture, & Industrial Innovation.  \r\n",
