 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports purchase of a state-of-the-art scanning laser confocal microscopy system that includes an upright microscope with motorized stage and multiple lasers.  The instrument is equipped for use of methods requiring oil or water immersion, and has fast scanning capabilities suitable for study of motile cells undergoing rapid physiological changes.  Research projects that will employ the microscope include studies of sperm-egg interactions and the physiological and biochemical events surrounding fertilization in marine and freshwater organisms.  Other projects include studies of metabolic depression in cells connected with intracellular translocation of a molecular chaperone after environmental challenges, and  studies of photobleaching of corals in the tropics and its relationship to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet light.  In addition to its role in research, the instrument will be used by undergraduate and graduate students in formal courses and related training activities. The instrument will be located in the Fluorescence Imaging Facility at the Bodega Marine Laboratory along with other instruments used for complementary methods.  The instrument will be available for use by investigators and students from the University's main campus as well as those at  the Laboratory.",
