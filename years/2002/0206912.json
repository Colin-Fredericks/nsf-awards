 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of the proposed 5-day international conference is to highlight the major trends in several areas of nonparametric statistics. Among the areas included are: smoothing methods, functional data analysis, data mining, nonparametric model building, nonparametric inference, resampling, spatial statistics, computation statistics, high dimensional data, dependent data, and censored data. The application areas feature medical research, bioinformatics, analysis of microarray data, analysis of evolutionary data, cancer research, AIDS and HIV research. To achieve this goal the members of the organizing committee were selected with the idea of having as complete a representation of the important trends in nonparametric statistics as possible. Indeed the committee consists of some top people in the field. More information can be found in http://www.psu.edu/~npconf/. By bringing together researchers from the USA and Europe, the conference is expected to facilitate the exchange of research ideas, promote collaboration and contribute to further development of the field. New researchers have been encouraged to attend with preference being given to them-as well as members of the underrepresented groups-for support. Six issues (one volume) of the Journal of Nonparametric Statistics have been made available to host papers that will be presented in the conference with the conference organizers serving as guest editors. \r\n",
