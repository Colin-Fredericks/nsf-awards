 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project deals with fundamental studies in radical pair dynamics with applications in photobiology and polymer chemistry. Professor Forbes will develop methodology for the observation and analysis of spin polarization phenomena in single amino acids, short peptides and proteins. Using a new dye sensitization reaction, he will characterize several amino acid radical cations and neutral radicals and investigate their conformational and chemical dynamics. In the polymer area, a major issue will be to determine the degree of influence of long range macromolecular motion on the locally measured dynamic effects in the time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra. New molecular dynamic simulations of interesting micelles will be carried at the North Carolina Supercomputing Center and new photochemically active surfactants will be synthesized to learn if control can be exerted over the starting point for diffusion of the ensuing free radicals. Further work will be done on the photochemical degradation of beer using sensitizers and visible light. This work has the potential to impact the entire multi-million dollar per year beverage industry.\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Central and Eastern Europe Program in the Office of International Science and Engineering continues support for the research of Professor Malcolm D. E. Forbes of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Professor Forbes work is at the forefront of photochemical research. He is developing sophisticated magnetic resonance methods along with computer modeling to obtain valuable information on several important chemical systems.",
