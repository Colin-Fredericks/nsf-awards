This is an important workshop to address the challenges of coastal zone management.  This workshop will bring together educators, students, researchers, and coastal managers from the USA and the Asia-Pacific region to exchange examples of successful education programs on integrated coastal zone management and to develop an education toolbox that will be used to share information, resources and experience in sustaining integrated coastal management processes.  The meeting will include 15 U.S. participants (5 students and 10 experts and educators) and 15 Asian participants (4 students and 11 experts and educators).  This proposal meets an important NSF goal of human resource development, and addresses an important issue for sustaining the global coastal ocean environment.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
