He \r\nwould like use the techniques of complex and symplectic manifolds to \r\nunderstand the restriction this decomposition imposes to the topology \r\nof the original manifold. Proposer hopes to apply these techniques to \r\nattack some unsolved problems of 4-dimensional topology, such as \r\nfinding 4-dimensional fake s-cobordisms,  and to the problem of \r\nconstructing a fake S^3 x S^1. Proposer also plans to work on the \r\ntopological problems arising from complex algebraic geometry, such as \r\nproblems coming from the complex conjugation, branched covers and the \r\ncurve counting problem in real algebraic geometry.\r\n\r\nProposer plans to investigate structure of 4-dimensional manifolds by \r\ndecomposing them into pieces that are topologically easier to \r\nunderstand (4-manifolds are spaces which locally look like \r\n4-dimensional Euclidean space-time we live in). These smaller pieces \r\ncarry certain `natural complex structures' which analytical \r\ntechniques apply. By these techniques Principal investigator hopes to \r\nconstruct certain 4-manifolds believed to exists but not yet have \r\nbeen found. One of the reasons 4-manifolds are of interest is because \r\nof the physicists model of the 10-dimensional universe which consists \r\nof a 4-dimensional space-time plus 6-dimensional complex piece.\r\n\r\n",
