 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is about using the \"provable-security approach\" in the design and analysis of high-level cryptographic protocols.  The aim is to gain assurance for practical cryptographic schemes by finding the right definitions, and then using modern techniques (reductions and their concrete-security analysis) to analyze selected schemes.  \r\n\r\nSpecific problems to be investigated include: (1) Storing a user's private information on an untrusted server.  Here one wants to store user data in such a way that the user can recover it by presenting a password, but an adversary must invest an amount of interaction proportional to the guessing-complexity of the password.  (2) The authenticated-encryption scheme in SSH.  Though the method used by SSH is not, in general, correct, the situation for SSH itself is far from clear.  (3) Delegation of authority to a secondary signature key by a primary one.  A well-known approach in security practice, the problem that this solution aims to solve is without any provable-security treatment.  (4) Relating the \"prescriptive\" approach to formalizing authenticated key exchange and the simulation-based approach.  (5) Moving to an enriched model of computation, an envelope model, to investigate authenticated key exchange. (6) A systematic investigation of the \"game walking\" approach to analyzing cryptographic scenarios. Here two adversarial views are compared by writing out a sequence of pseudocode \"games\" each of which may set some Boolean flag. One bounds the difference in adversarial views by bounding the probability that the flag gets set. \r\n",
