In 3+1 dimensions, this conjecture states that the \r\ntotal mass of a spacetime with nonnegative energy density \r\neverywhere is greater than or equal to the square root of the \r\ntotal area of the event horizons of all of the black holes in the \r\nspacetime divided by 16 pi.  This conjecture can be thought of as \r\nstating that the mass contributed by a collection of black holes \r\nis at least the square root of their surface areas divided 16 pi, \r\nso that nonnegative energy density everywhere else in the \r\nuniverse forces the total mass of the spacetime to be at least \r\nthis amount.  The Penrose conjecture is best thought of as a \r\nconjecture on arbitrary three dimensional space-like slices of \r\nthe spacetime.  In the special case that the space-like slice is \r\nassumed to have zero second fundamental form, the conjecture is \r\nknown as the Riemannian Penrose conjecture.  This conjecture was \r\nfirst proved for a single black hole by Huisken and Ilmanen in \r\n1997 and then for any number of black holes by the author in \r\n1999.  The author would also like to prove the Riemannian Penrose \r\nConjecture in dimensions higher than three and is close to \r\nannouncing this result for dimensions less than eight.  \r\nDimensions eight and higher present additional geometric and \r\nanalytical challenges arising from the fact that the apparent \r\nhorizons of black holes manifest themselves as minimal \r\nhypersurfaces which can have co-dimension seven singularities.  \r\nThe positive mass theorem is also still open in these dimensions \r\nfor similar reasons, and is another very interesting related \r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe motivation for the above problems is to gain a better \r\nunderstanding of General Relativity.  While Einstein's theory of\r\nGeneral Relativity is experimentally the best known theory of \r\ngravity, their are many theoretical questions about the theory \r\nwhich are not well understood at all.  For example, given the\r\nuniverse at some initial time, do the Einstein equations have \r\nunique well-behaved solutions in the future as one would hope, or\r\ndo singularities typically occur which might radiate or consume\r\nenergy for example?  The theory also predicts the existence of\r\nblack holes, and astronomers believe that they have been able to \r\ndetect the location of many black holes including one which is \r\n3 million times the mass of the sun at the center of our galaxy.  \r\nSince doing experiments with black holes is currently not \r\nfeasible, it makes since to understand this potentially very \r\nimportant phenomenon on a theoretical level for now.  This \r\nresearch project hopes to lead to a better understanding of black\r\nholes as well as energy and mass in General Relativity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
