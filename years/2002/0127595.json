 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42)\r\nWe are developing interactive computer-based materials - unlike any that previously existed - to help students learn geology, improve their spatial visualization abilities, and engage in critical thinking. This proposal is to fully develop these innovative materials to create a lab-based curriculum, integrated with technology and focusing on the visual aspects of geology, such as visualizing geologic structures hidden beneath the Earth's surface. This project is placing these visual materials in a web-friendly framework and in the context of authentic, complex problems. We are using 3D programs to create arguably the next generation of interactive visual materials for introductory college geology courses. We are constructing QuickTime Virtual Reality (QTVR) movies that enable students to interactively rotate topographic and geologic terrains, slice into geologic blocks or reveal the internal geometry of layers, and erode the uplifted side of a fault block to see how this would be expressed on the land surface. We have piloted these movies in our introductory geology labs and upper-division geology courses, all to rave reviews. This curriculum contains integrated modules that can be used in introductory college courses and upper-level SMET courses, and by the general public. To evaluate the curriculum, students are pre-tested, selectively interviewed while training on the materials, and post-tested. Experimental methods include both experimental and quasi-experimental, and data are qualitative and quantitative. Proposed duration of the project is 36 months. Materials are being distributed via the Internet (http://reynolds.asu.edu) and via commercial publishers who already are interested.",
