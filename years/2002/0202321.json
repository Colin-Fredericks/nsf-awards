 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his collaborator work on\r\nthe topology of complex algebraic maps, with applications\r\nto algebraic cycles\r\nand to non-algebraic maps.\r\nThe study of the relations between the topology\r\nof the domain and target of a map\r\nis interesting and has broad applications\r\nin the fields of geometry and topology.\r\nThe investigator works on:\r\n1) a topological and Hodge-theoretic proof of the so-called \r\nDecomposition Theorem for algebraic maps, \r\n2) finding the topological  obstructions to the \r\nvalidity of the theorem for other maps, \r\n3) computing  intersection forms arising from maps in significant \r\ncases, and \r\n4) applications of the Decomposition\r\nTheorem to algebraic cycles.\r\nSeveral new methods are being introduced \r\nas a result of these studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term ``algebraic maps\" above is a technical term\r\nfor polynomial equations. \r\nAlgebraic geometry is the discipline devoted to their study.\r\nIt is an ancient subject rooted in the early achievements of \r\nhumanity, like the wheel, the Egyptians' elliptical flowers \r\narrangements and Archimedes' burning parabolic mirrors.\r\nCircles, ellipses and parabolas arise from the polynomial \r\nequations we study in high school. They are both beautiful\r\nand ubiquitous in nature as they describe many natural \r\nphenomena, from the motion of planets to the shape of leaves \r\nand flowers, to the behavior of microscopic particles.\r\nThe funded project is strongly inclined towards pure research\r\nand proposes to study the deeper properties\r\nof the solutions to more complicated algebraic equations.\r\nAs it has always been the case, pure and applied mathematics\r\nwill influence each other and new abstract ideas will fuel the \r\nprogress of applications.\r\n",
