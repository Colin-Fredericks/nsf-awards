Michael Auerbach, Paul Verburg, John Arnone, Eric McDonald, and Christian Fritsen at the University of Nevada Desert Research Institute (DRI), for the acquisition of three pieces of analytical equipment to be employed in current and future studies of nutrient cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  The equipment includes a flow injection ion analysis system, a dissolved organic nitrogen analyzer, and a laser diffraction particle size analyzer.  Specific goals that will be accomplished through the proposed equipment acquisition include the following: (1) enhanced analytical capabilities to benefit ongoing research; (2) pursuit of new research avenues in the field of physical and chemical characterization of dissolved organic and particulate nutrients in aquatic ecosystems; (3) integration of terrestrial, hydrologic, and air research within the university system of Nevada to address environmental research questions; and  (4) establishment of a training facility for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nFaculty from DRI are engaged in a wide array of studies focused on nutrient cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  Currently funded research includes assessment of nutrient loadings in rivers and streams, effects of management on nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, nutrient cycling in extreme environments, and interactions between climate and terrestrial ecosystems.  These studies are carried out in a variety of ecosystems including high elevation semi-arid watersheds, deserts of the southwestern U.S., tallgrass prairie, and the Antarctic.  These diverse studies share a common need to assess nutrient composition and particle size distribution of soils, particulate, and suspended nutrients in lakes and streams.  Currently available equipment at DRI does not allow for routine analyses of inorganic and organic nutrients that are needed to satisfy the increasing demand for these data.  In addition, the methods in use for particle size analysis do not provide the detailed information needed for many ongoing and new studies.\r\n\r\nGraduate student research training is an important part of the research enterprise at DRI.  Graduate students will be trained in operating the equipment as part of their curriculum.  A laboratory technician will be assigned to operate and maintain the equipment and will be responsible for training graduate students in conjunction with the principal investigators.  The new equipment will greatly enhance DRI's analytical capabilities in soils and water research by creating an infrastructure that will support a series of fundamental studies.  The requested equipment also has applicability to other areas of inquiry currently ongoing at DRI including research on dust emissions in deserts and transport of radionuclides in soils.  Further, this new equipment will allow DRI to contribute to solving critical state and national environmental problems (e.g., increasing demands for drinking water, protection of endangered fish species).\r\n",
