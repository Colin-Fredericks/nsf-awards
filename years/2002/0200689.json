 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted on a number of problems \r\nin Several Complex Variables and Cauchy-Riemann\r\nGeometry. More specifically, the better \r\nunderstanding of various rigidity phenomena in \r\ncomplex analysis and complex geometry will be sought.\r\nThe study the analytic structure of real surfaces\r\nin the complex space of dimension two, and the \r\ninvestigation of its intrinsic connections with \r\nmany well-known problems in classical mechanics\r\nwill be pursued. \r\n\r\nComplex numbers and functions of complex variables\r\nhave become, since the 19th century, indispensable\r\ntools in many areas of mathematics and in its\r\napplication to other areas of science and engineering.\r\nIndeed, the solutions of many problems in the applied\r\nsciences could ultimately depend on improvements in \r\nthese complex analytic tools and a better\r\nunderstanding of their basic properties.  For instance,\r\nin material science the standard method for treating\r\nmultidirectional stresses in a uniform way is to \r\nrepresent them as complex numbers or, in more\r\ncomplicated situations, as complex functions. It then \r\nturns out, for instance, that the direction of the \r\npropagation of cracks in materials is related to the \r\nproperties of certain equations associated\r\nwith these complex numbers or functions. Results of \r\nthe research to be carried out in this project could\r\nlead to the discovery of new properties\r\nof solutions of these equations.\r\n",
