 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis project consists of two components: (1) developing a curriculum and instructional materials that provide community college students with actual research experience as a core part of their instruction and (2) designing a recruitment strategy to attract a variety of students to programs and retain them. The research focuses on developing a treatment for a genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP is a serious disorder that causes patients to suffer severe skin damage (including serious burns and DNA damage) when exposed to minimal sunlight. The disorder is caused by mutations in genes responsible for repairing DNA damaged by UV light. When DNA cannot be repaired, mutations accumulate and cancer develops. In fact, approximately half of all XP patients are diagnosed with skin cancer by age 10. City College of San Francisco (CCSF), Bio-Link, and the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), are collaborating on this project.\r\n\r\nThe motivation to undertake this project rests on three factors. First, students learn best when they see the real-world, human connections of the content they are learning. By teaching courses in this manner, students gain an immediate practical understanding of two important concepts: (1) the importance of biotechnology in the search for treatments for diseases and (2) the essence of life as a research assistant. The second reason for undertaking this project is to increase the diversity and number of students pursuing careers in science generally and biotechnology specifically. Third, the motivation rests on the fact that this project exposes students to world-class researchers from UCSF, and the research in which they are involved is leading to advancing knowledge about genetic disorders generally and XP specifically. \r\n\r\nThe tangible deliverables of this project include: (1) a model for curriculum design that blends education and technical research experiences; (2) a set of instructional materials in cell culture and research that promote real-world applications, hands-on experiences, and problem-solving skills; (3) a model recruitment strategy based on research and tested through actual experience; and (4) research findings with respect to XP (and other related diseases) to which students have contributed.\r\n\r\nBio-Link is disseminating the Fix-a-Gene products by making them available through the online instructional materials clearinghouse; featuring the project and materials at the annual Bio-Link Summer Fellows program that brings together community college and high school biotechnology educators from across the nation; and showcasing the project in the national Bio-Link newsletter. An advisory panel composed of individuals with expertise in XP research, cell culture, and community college biotechnology education is guiding the project. In addition, an external evaluator provides formative assistance in developing the curriculum and instructional materials and recruitment strategy in addition to conducting a summative analysis.",
