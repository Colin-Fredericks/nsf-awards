 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following A.P. Calderon's program (sketched in his Helsinki ICM \r\naddress in 1978), many basic boundary value problems in physics \r\nand engineering can be attacked by starting with a representation \r\nof the solution in the form of a potential operator, and then \r\nreducing matters to analyzing the functional analytic properties\r\nof a system of pseudodifferential operators on the boundary.\r\nThe new phenomenon, occurring when non-smooth structures are\r\npresent, is that these boundary operators belong to a larger\r\nclass,  consisting of singular integral operators. The lack of\r\na symbolic  calculus in this context makes the study of such\r\noperators fundamentally harder, particularly when one has to\r\naddress such delicate issues like Fredholmness and invertibility.\r\nWhile in the intervening years these ideas have undergone a\r\ndramatic development, much remains to be done. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of the current proposal is to investigate the\r\nspecific nature of the singular integral operators arising in\r\nconnection with basic problems in mathematical physics, such as\r\nMaxwell's equations, vector Poisson problems, Hodge\r\ndecompositions, and Stokes's system of hydrodynamics, in light\r\nof recent advances in the fields of harmonic analysis and\r\npartial differential equations. For maximum applicability, it\r\nis important to consider these problems in the context of\r\ngeneral Sobolev-Besov spaces and when the underlying \r\nstructures are minimally smooth.",
