Semper\r\nExploratorium, San Francisco, CA\r\n\"The I-Guide Project: Extending Museum Experience Using Portable Devices, Wireless Networks, and Web Technology\"\r\n\r\nThis multidisciplinary Information Technology Research project, involving a collaboration between the San Francisco Exploratorium and Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, addresses several areas of computing research, including ubiquitous or pervasive computing, context-aware computing, augmentation of the real world, human-computer interaction and computer-supported cooperative work. The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding and to disseminate knowledge about how the use of a ubiquitous computing infrastructure may augment learning both during and after a visit to an interactive science center. The project focuses on three research domains: 1. The creation of a functional wireless nomadic computing infrastructure and on-line personalized delivery system to gain knowledge about how nomadic technologies can be configured to support learning in a complex setting in which there are multiple, competing constraints for a user's attention, 2. The development of an instructional design framework for creating learning, teaching and community-building resources capable of delivery on multiple devices using this system in order to explore which on-line information resources can better promote learner interests, sustain science learning, and improve science understanding and 3. Studies that explore the impact of these resources on the learner's use of the museum to determine the relationship between physical visit activities and post-visit on-line activities that can be supported by a personalized network experience. The project involves 1. The design and implementation of points of information (pi stations) and a data network for 10 museum exhibits, 2. The design and implementation of free standing kiosks for accessing Web-based content during the visit (for visitors who do not carry a wireless handheld device), 3. The design and implementation a dynamic, personalized Web-based server system for on-site (wireless) and remote (wired) access by visitors, 4. The develop of Web-based content for the exhibits as a group and for each exhibit, including a mixture of dynamically, customizable text, audio, and visual content and interactive discussion-group/bulletin board functions, 5. Research on the utility of the system with 300 individual and small groups of learners, 6. The creation of a user-triggered method for capturing user experience for extending visitor engagement, and 7. The develop of a user model and instructional design framework for ubiquitous learning and guidance systems. The project is headquartered in the multimedia Exploratorium Learning Studio which includes facilities for project staff to engage in project design and implementation as well as research studies. \r\n",
