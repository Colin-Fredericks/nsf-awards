 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Braja K. Mandal, Department of Chemistry, Illinois Institute of Technology is jointly supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program in the Division of Chemistry and the Solid State Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research to create new photonic materials based on the self-assembly of metallo-organic building blocks into organized nanoscale assemblies.  This research builds on his recent construction of fused multi-ring phthalocyanines ligands by a Diels-Alder reaction between a diene bearing solubilizing groups and a quinone dienophile containing sites for the incorporation of nitrile groups.  These phthalocyanines will contain helicene, perylene and benzoperylene groups to solubilize them in organic solvents, facilitate self-assembly and promote linear and nonlinear optical properties.  These highly conjugated molecules will be capable of modification to tune their optical, and electron and energy transfer properties.\r\n\r\nNew cyclic molecules with high aromaticity will be prepared to facilitate self-assembly into aggregates capable of electron and energy transfer that can be integrated into electronic devices.\r\n\r\n",
