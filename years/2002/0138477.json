 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Summer Undergraduate Mathematical Science Research Institute (SUMSRI) is a program conducted under the guidance of Miami University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics. We seek talented undergraduate students in the mathematical sciences who are interested in pursuing advanced degrees.  Because of the shortage of minorities and women mathematical scientists, we are especially interested in, but not limited to, African Americans and other underrepresented minorities and women.  \r\n\r\nThe main goals of SUMSRI are:  \r\n\r\n-Address the shortage of minority mathematical scientists by encouraging minority students and women to become mathematical research scientists. \r\n\r\n-Provide the students with a research environment and improve their research abilities.\r\n\r\n-Improve the students' ability to work in groups and give them a long term support group. \r\n\r\n-Provide professional role models. \r\n\r\n-Improve the students' technical writing skills. \r\n\r\n-Give the participants an opportunity to write a technical research paper and present a talk at a mathematics conference. \r\n\r\n-Inform the participants of available financial aid and opportunities for graduate school. \r\n\r\n-Make the students aware of career opportunities in the mathematical sciences.\r\n \r\n-Prepare the students for the GRE. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, SUMSRI will run from June 2 to July 19, 2002, on Miami University's campus in Oxford, Ohio. During these seven weeks, students will participate in problem seminars in mathematics, statistics, or computer science. The program will also include a technical writing seminar, a GRE preparation workshop, two short courses on algebra and real analysis, and colloquium talks given by well known mathematical scientists.\r\n\r\nThere will also be panel discussions to present information on graduate school and career opportunities in the mathematical sciences. SUMSRI will pay for the students travel, room, board, and supplies. Each student will\r\nalso be given a $2,500 stipend. Funds may also be available for travel and support to some selected national meetings. \r\n\r\nThe ideal candidate will have completed the calculus series and at least one proof-based mathematics or statistics course with distinction.  The candidate should be entering their junior or senior year after attending SUMSRI. All candidates must be returning to their home institutions as undergraduates after the SUMSRI experience.  SUMSRI is not currently funded to support international students.",
