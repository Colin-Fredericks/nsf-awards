 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over three years, Science Central is producing 624 television segments that will present current, ongoing research through local newscasts on ABC and NBC stations nationwide.  In addition to the regular research segments, ScienCentral will produce six \"sweeps\" series per year focusing on important new fields of research including:  nanotechnology, genetics/genomics, ocean science, global climate change and brain sciences.   An advisory board of scientists, teachers, science journalists and public information officers help inform the producers about individual stories and evolving fields of research, and they provide access to scientists and field research.  They also provide scientific input and check the stories for accuracy.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate production and to assure that research is covered on an international basis, ScienCentral will establish a footage consortium to exchange science news video with major Canadian and European newscasters.   They also will provide the news stories to science centers for use in their interactive exhibits and web sites.  \r\n\r\n",
