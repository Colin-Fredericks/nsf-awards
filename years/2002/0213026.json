 "awd_abstract_narration": "Population density cycles that appear synchronous, or irin-phasel, over large geographic areas\r\nare some of the most striking phenomena in population biology. In theory, such synchrony is\r\ncaused either by widespread meteorological factors, or by movement of individuals between\r\npopulations. Theory for predator-prey 'metapopulationsl' that extend over groups of patches\r\nalso links synchrony to regional persistence. The study of these phenomena in nature has been\r\nhampered by difficulty in identifying both the cause of population cycles and the roles of\r\nenvironmental factors and interpatch movement in modifying population fluctuations and\r\nsynchrony. The environmental forcing of metapopulations which is explored here is relevant to\r\nbiological control of pest species and conservation. Additionally, extreme weather events\r\ncaused by global warming have the potential to synchronize regional populations, which might\r\ncut short regional persistence. The proposed work uses mathematical techniques focused on\r\nphase dynamics to analyze synchrony and build precise links among environmental variability,\r\npopulation dynamics and extinction. Phase dynamics have been widely used in neurobiology,\r\nbut their potential in ecology is only just beginning to be realized. This project develops new\r\nanalytic tools for an ecological audience and uses a model experimental system, bacteria and\r\nprotozoa in laboratory microcosms, to bridge the gap between populations and metapopulation\r\ntheory. The work starts with a classic model and then develops more precise and biologically\r\nrealistic models, which in turn will fuel further, more precise, experimental tests.\r\nTwo-patch predator-prey systems coupled by random dispersal will provide a link with\r\nanalytical solutions, which numerical simulations and experiments can build on to consider more\r\ncomplex and realistic situations. Two patch models will be used to derive equations which relate\r\nphase, the point in a predator-prey cycle, to population dynamic processes. The dynamics of\r\nphase difference between two patches will be derived and used as a measure of synchrony,\r\nwhich can be related to regional persistence and within-patch predator-prey dynamics. Phase\r\ndynamics can also distinguish whether persistence is controlled not by deterministic equilibrium\r\ndynamics (the focus of most theoretical studies), but instead by long-lived transient dynamics\r\nwhich may dominate during ecologically relevant time scales; specifically regression of phase\r\ndifference through time will be used to calculate the duration of transient dynamics, when phase\r\ndifference becomes zero. Experimentally, the initial phase difference of predator-prey\r\noscillations in two linked patches will be manipulated by starting microcosms with different\r\npredator and prey densities in each patch. Statistics will then quantify the phase difference\r\nbetween patches and test its correlation with regional persistence time. Repeating this\r\nprocedure in microcosms with different movement rates between patches (lengths of corridors)\r\nwill test the prediction that increased movement rate between patches will reduce phase\r\ndifferences and regional persistence time. Experiments with 1-8 patches will manipulate\r\nenvironmental variability through temperature fluctuations and control whether this operates\r\nuniformly across a region or just in a single patch. Quantification of regional persistence time\r\nand phase differences between patches will then test the predictions that local variability\r\nenhances regional persistence, but regional variability and increased movement reduce regional\r\nvariability.\r\nThis project will demonstrate how and why environmental variability influences dynamics\r\nand extinction in regionally-distributed predator and prey systems. The techniques of phase\r\ndynamics will be brought to a broader ecological audience, and two graduate students will be\r\ntrained with the necessary mathematical, modeling, statistical and experimental techniques that\r\nare required to understand the links between the environment and populations. This work will\r\nprovide a paradigm on which future combined experimental and theoretical studies of population\r\nsynchrony and persistence can build.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
