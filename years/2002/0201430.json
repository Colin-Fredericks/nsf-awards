Fialkow, SUNY New Paltz\r\nDMS-0201430\r\n\r\n                            Abstract\r\n\r\n\r\nThis research concerns an approach to the multidimensional truncated power \r\nmoment problem based on an extension theory for the associated moment matrix. \r\nWhen this matrix admits an infinite, positive, finite rank moment matrix \r\nextension, this approach yields an explicit formula for a finitely atomic \r\nrepresenting measure supported on the joint spectrum of a normal tuple of \r\noperators corresponding to the extension. The aim of this research is to \r\ndetermine concrete conditions on the moment data which permit the desired \r\nextension. Much of this research concerns, specifically, the multivariable \r\ntruncated K-moment problem, where the support of a representing measure is \r\nrequired to be contained in a prescribed closed set K. For K an algebraic \r\nvariety, this research concerns a new conjecture for solving the moment problem \r\nin terms of concrete algebraic and geometric invariants closely related to the \r\nmoment data. For K semi-algebraic, this research seeks to apply the abstract \r\nsolution of the truncated K-moment problem due to Curto-Fialkow  to specific \r\nsemi-algebraic sets such as the closed unit disk. A direct application of this \r\nstudy concerns the multidimensional cubature problem in Numerical Analysis. By \r\napplying the moment matrix extension technique in the context of cubature, this \r\nresearch seeks to construct minimal cubature rules for sets such as the disk, \r\nsquare, triangle, or annulus.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of this research, the Quadrature Problem, concerns the efficient \r\nmeasurement of the size of an irregular area, or the measurement of the weight \r\nof a volume whose density is unevenly distributed. We seek to identify a small \r\nnumber of test points (or nodes) within the body in such a way that by measuring \r\nthe density just at these few points, we may closely approximate the overall \r\nsize or weight of the body. In the case of a linear body, such as a thin rod, \r\nthe quadrature problem was solved with the fewest number of test points by the  \r\nmathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), using a technique now known as \r\nGaussian Quadrature. At the present time, surprisingly few minimal-node \r\nquadrature rules are known for shapes in the plane or in 3-dimensional space, \r\neven for basic sets such as a disk or sphere. In order to study the Quadrature \r\nProblem, we actually study a more general problem, the Multidimensional \r\nTruncated Moment Problem. Many real-world systems can be described by a sequence \r\nof physical attributes called moments, such as mass, weight, momentum, etc., \r\nwhich relate to the physical space underlying the system. The truncated moment \r\nproblem asks whether a system is uniquely determined by its sequence of moments, \r\nand also whether the moments of a system can be computed by studying the system \r\nat just a finite number of nodes in the underlying space. In this research, we \r\ndevelop algorithms for recognizing when such a sequence of nodes exists, and for \r\nefficiently computing them. In this way, we may describe a system in terms of \r\njust a finite number of points in the underlying space. \r\n",
