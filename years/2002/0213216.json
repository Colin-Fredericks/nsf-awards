 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is focused in two connected directions.  First, new carbonylative carbotricyclizations and related reactions will be developed.  The method provides an efficient method for the production of fused polycyclic systems.  Second, enantioselective and regioselective hydrocarbonylation reactions will be carried out with fluorous catalysis using fluorinated solvents and with fluorous catalysis using supercritical carbon dioxide.  The prospects are high for developing methodology wherein catalyst recovery and reuse are possible, thereby leading to practical green chemistry. \r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr. Iwao Ojima of the Department of Chemistry at SUNY, Stony Brook.  Professor Ojima will focus his work on developing methodology to affect carbocyclization and carbonylation reactions.  He will also develop green chemistry in catalytic organic synthesis promoted by transition metal catalysts.  The research has broader impact for the training of students and for use in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  Collaboration between academia and industry are already in place.",
