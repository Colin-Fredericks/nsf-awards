 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ZOOM children's television series, which reaches over 5.4 million children each week, teaches viewers the scientific processes as well as delivering science and mathematics content.  The outreach materials and activities provide viewers with opportunities to explore, experiment and share their creativity.  WGBH is requesting $1,303,776 of a total budget of $3,977,936 to produce 20 new shows for the ZOOM series.  There also will be a new ZOOM campaign, the ZOOMsci Club, which will provide a unique way for kids to deepen their science and math knowledge while engaged in ZOOM's hands-on activities.  The campaign includes:  the new television programs, new print materials and outreach activities, and a new area of the ZOOM website that includes an on-line forum for kids to share results of their experimentation. \r\n\r\nZOOM has been chosen by PBS as the first children's \"local/national\" show.  This PBS initiative capitalizes on the strength of local public television stations and provides the opportunity for stations to customize ZOOM to serve the needs of their local markets.  The stations can produce and insert segments that honor local kids for their volunteer activities and feature local kids answering questions.  Stations also can localize outreach activities, producing their own local ZOOM websites and launching ZOOM Into Action campaigns to motivate kids to volunteer.  \r\n\r\n",
