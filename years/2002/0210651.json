 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Alexia Smith and Dr. Julie Hansen will investigate the impact of climate change on agricultural practices in the Near East during the Bronze and Iron Ages (3050-535 B.C.). A region-wide drying event is thought to have occurred at the end of the third millennium B.C., and this study examines its impact on food production strategies. Palaeoethnobotany, the study of human uses of plants in antiquity, is a prime tool for investigating ancient agriculture. Carbonized plant remains can be preserved on archaeological sites for thousands of years and may be systematically recovered by placing a soil sample in a large tank of water, whereby the botanical remains float to the surface for collection. The presence of crop plants, together with their associated weed assemblages, allow for the reconstruction of ancient agricultural practices. \r\n\r\nPalaeoethnobotanical remains collected from Tell Qarqur, a multi-period site on the Orontes River in NW Syria, will be analyzed to determine how crop production changed over time. Tell Qarqur lies just north of the Ghab Valley, where a number of pollen cores have been examined, making Qarqur a prime location for considering the effect of local environment upon food production. The questions asked include: 1) What crops were grown and do cropping patterns change over time? 2) What types of ecosystems were exploited for wild plants? 3) If the habitats exploited change over time, does this reflect a changing environment? Examination of the flora currently surrounding the site and collection of modern botanical samples will greatly assist in identifying the ancient remains.\r\n\r\nThis data will then be placed into a regional context and evidence for agricultural and environmental change from sites in Syria, Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan will be examined based on published palaeoethnobotanical, zooarchaeological, and palaeoenvironmental reports. Together these countries provide a promising opportunity to examine the ways people modify agriculture in relation to their environment, since steep precipitation gradients exist and food productions strategies are likely to change over relatively short distances. The questions asked include: 1) Within a given time period, do the major crops vary with increasing distance from the coast, or along a north-south axis? 2) If so, is this reflected in the faunal remains? 3) Can distinct \"food production\" zones be identified from the data, and if so, do the boundaries of these zones change with time?\r\n\r\n\tThis research is important for several reasons. First, it provides information on Bronze and Iron Age agriculture in Syria, of which little is known. Second, this study synthesizes a large body of published data from the Near East, thereby providing a firm basis for examining environmental change and shifting agricultural patterns. Finally, recent climatic data suggest that many semi-arid regions will become drier over the next few decades due to global warming. This study will yield a deeper understanding of how people have adapted their farming practices in response to past climatic shifts, knowledge that would greatly aid modern-day developers to enhance production within current low-technology or subsistence agriculture.\r\n\r\n",
