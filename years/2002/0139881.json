A ten-week summer program, involving ten students each year for three years, will provide each participant a stipend, room and board, travel allowance and tuition for the independent research course in which all are enrolled.  We seek participants who have good course work preparation in molecular biology and are interested in post-graduate study but have not had the opportunity to do research.  Participants will work individually with faculty mentors matched with the student's interests and background, and they will have access to all faculty members in the School of Biological Sciences and the Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology through seminars and lab visits.  Students will be placed in active faculty research labs that deal with such problems as gene structure and control, cell signaling, developmental genetics and pathogenic mechanisms, which are being studied in a variety of model organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants and mammals.  In weekly group meetings, students will discuss current issues in molecular biology, prepare for the GRE, and learn about graduate school.  Each participant will present an oral progress report to the group and will write an abstract and prepare a research poster for a closing symposium.\r\n",
