 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for DMS - 0132514\r\n\r\nIn the past the investigator developed techniques to study\r\nGromov hyperbolic groups. There are several applications of those\r\ntechniques in topology, geometry, algebra, analysis. In particular,\r\nhyperbolic groups were characterized by bounded cohomology, extending\r\nresults my M. Gromov. This characterization was used by A. Connes and\r\nH. Moscovici for a proof of the Novikov conjecture for hyperbolic groups.\r\nS. Gersten provided several descriptions of hyperbolicity in terms of\r\nvarious (co)homology theories, and later the investigator made\r\ncontributions in that direction. Recently, Guoliang Yu and\r\nthe investigator were able to prove the Baum-Connes conjecture\r\nfor hyperbolic groups and their subgroups. The techniques will be further\r\ndeveloped to address these and other directions. For example,\r\n(co)homological descriptions of relative hyperbolicity will be studied.\r\nAs another application, the conformal and other geometric structures\r\non hyperbolic groups will be constructed. It is the investigator's\r\nhope that this will lead, in particular, to a better understanding\r\nof open conjectures in 3-dimensional topology.\r\n\r\nIt is an important and interesting task to investigate shapes\r\nof spaces, in particular of the one in which we live. Geometry studies\r\nspaces of various shapes. Group theory studies groups, that is,\r\nsets of symmetries of spaces. Geometric group theory provides\r\nlinks between spaces and groups. Every group has an orbit (!) in some \r\nspace (!). The orbit is only a part of the space, but once something\r\nis known about the the group, geometric group theory provides information\r\nnot only about the orbit, but about the whole space as well. Tools from\r\nseveral areas of mathematics are used for that. The research part of this\r\nproposal is to develop and use those tools. Another part of the proposal\r\nis organizing and supporting the G^3 = \"Geometric group theory on the gulf\r\ncoast conference\" that would allow exchange of ideas among mathematicians\r\nof various research interests.\r\n\r\n",
