 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Jersey Math and Science Partnership (NJ-MSP) unites Rutgers, Rowan and Kean Universities with twelve school districts.   Eight of the districts were among thirty plaintiffs in New Jersey's 20-year-long Abbott vs. Burke litigation, and have recently benefited from remedies ordered by the state Supreme Court.  The twelve districts that come together within NJ-MSP are characterized as small- and medium-sized urban districts with poor, high-minority and low achieving student populations.  The partners' schools enroll over 75,000 students of whom 27% are African American and 31% are Hispanic.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of NJ-MSP are to:\r\n1.  Increase achievement and reduce achievement gaps in science and mathematics for all preK-12 students in partner school districts by (a) working to develop and implement strategic plans for each district; (b) working to develop internal leadership structures and practices to carry out the strategic plans; and (c) providing well-designed, continuing professional development.\r\n2.  Increase and sustain the number, quality and diversity of preK-12 teachers of mathematics and science in partner school districts by (a) providing potential teachers with experiences that will help them see teaching as an attractive career; (b) improving preservice teachers' content knowledge by reshaping university math and science courses; and (c) carrying out induction programs for new middle and high school teachers.\r\n3.  Document outcomes by (a) analyzing changes in student achievement and (b) documenting project activities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
