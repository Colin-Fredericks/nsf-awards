The challenge before us then is to develop a curriculum that prepares students for the engineering economy of today, while enabling them - through a strong and well integrated core of engineering knowledge -- to maintain versatility through life-long learning and continuing education.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal we will formulate a plan to (a) Give the students a strong fundamental foundation by concentrating on the essential core of scientific and engineering basics in a given discipline.(b) Enhance systems thinking by helping students to integrate their knowledge across courses and disciplines so that they are better prepared to address open-ended problems; and (c) Prepare and provide for continuing education and life-long learning. We hypothesize that an effective method of accomplishing these three tasks is to combine ideas from the NSF Coalitions with the well-established K-12 practice of Block Scheduling. Specifically, we propose to:\r\n\r\n1. Modularize and integrate the critical \"core\" of Chemical Engineering (including mass balances, thermodynamics, kinetics, separations, transport phenomena, process systems, control, laboratory, and design) into six Pillar courses.\r\n\r\n2. Re-evaluate and re-align supporting courses (mathematics, chemistry, physics, and biology) and elective courses into application-focused tracks.\r\n\r\n3. Re-align each individual course so that, in addition to the traditional macroscopic and continuum-level descriptions, we also include \"sub-continuum\" or \"fundamental unit\" analysis.\r\n\r\n",
