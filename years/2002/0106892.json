Humphreys\r\n\r\nThe investigators address North America plate dynamics by modeling \r\nthe forces applied to the\r\nplate and comparing the predicted stresses with those inferred from the style\r\nof ongoing tectonics and those observed in drill holes.  Modeling is done with\r\nthe finite element method.  Input forces applied to modeled North America\r\ninclude boundary and basal forces, and those generated internal to the plate\r\n(arising from potential energy variations such as those created by topography).\r\nThe relative magnitudes of applied forces are estimated to account for stress\r\nand deformation information.  Furthermore, because the magnitude of many of the\r\nforces applied North America are well known a priori (such as ridge push), the\r\nmagnitude of all the the applied forces will be well constrained.  Tectonic\r\nstresses deform North America at a rate inversely proportional to its strength.\r\nThe investigators model strength with a viscous rheology, which they \r\nestimate by ratioing the\r\ncalculated stress with the (reasonably well known) strain rate.\r\nThe research can be divided into several tasks: estimation of input fields,\r\ndescription of an appropriate finite element representation of North America,\r\nevaluation of model predictions against observables, and as modeling progresses\r\ntoward resolving the input fields and assessment of their uniqueness.\r\n--",
