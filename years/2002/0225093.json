 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests to continue support of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center, the Center for the Built Environment (CBE).  CBE was established at the university of California, Berkeley, in 1997 and is dedicated to the industries and professions that design and construct buildings, manufacture building components, and that operate and maintain buildings.  Its objective is to improve the performance of buildings by enhancing their indoor environmental quality, and by improving the energy efficiency with which that quality is produced.\r\n\r\nThere are great opportunities to improve the performance of buildings in the U.S. through applied research and development.  Improved building design and technologies may reduce energy consumption, improve employee health and productivity, and improve economic competitiveness and domestic security by reducing US dependence on energy imports.  CBE builds upon the accomplishments of an extensive group of faculty members that perform building science research at UCB.  This group has an impressive record of achievements, both individually and in past joint projects, and maintains extensive and state-of-the-art research tools and facilities.  Through collaboration with its industry partners, CBE's research focuses on providing tools and analysis to assist building industry firms and design professionals.\r\n",
