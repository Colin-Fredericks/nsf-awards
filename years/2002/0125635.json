These technologies are incorporated and explored in the laboratory in a three-pronged approach:\r\n1. Closed laboratory sessions utilizing a heterogeneous local area network augmented with wireless technologies.\r\n2. Undergraduate research into the application of wireless technology in manufacturing environments where wired access may not be feasible.\r\n3. Undergraduate development projects emphasizing the scarcity of resources, the need for brevity and the implications of embedded type applications.\r\n\r\nThis project utilizes exemplary material adapted from outside sources as well as adaptation and integration of materials developed from the existing laboratories.",
