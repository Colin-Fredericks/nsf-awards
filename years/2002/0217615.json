 "awd_abstract_narration": "Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Indiana\r\n\r\nThe LSAMP Indiana project is a result of collaboration among Ball State University; \r\nIndianaUniversity, Bloomington; Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis;\r\nPurdue University, Calumet; and Purdue University, West Lafayette. Each university\r\nsurveyed existing studentretention and minority programs. At many of our universities,\r\nthere are a substantial number of K-12 outreach programs designed to enhance initial \r\ninterest in Science, Math, Engineering, and Technology (SMET) disciplines, as well as\r\nnumerous programs to help freshmen transition from high school into college. In addition,\r\nthere are a substantial number of programs to support research projects by upper-division\r\nstudents in SMET disciplines. However, there are fewer (if any) programs across the \r\nparticipating universities to help first-year students identify with their SMET discipline \r\nand help them to sustain that initial identification through research and mentoring\r\nexperiences over their next two years of college. In response to this finding, the \r\ninvolve institutions formed an alliance to increase the number of minorities receiving \r\nbaccalaureate degrees in SMET disciplines by providing (1) early research enrichment \r\nexperiences; (2) sustained teaching and mentoring opportunities in gatekeeper as well \r\nas upper-level courses; (3) personalized interactions with graduate students and faculty\r\nmentors beginning in the students' freshman year; and (4) professional and personal \r\ndevelopment opportunities. These early experiences with research and teaching are \r\ndesigned to encourage students to forge and sustain an academic and a social \r\nidentification within their SMET discipline. These goals will be reached by the \r\nimplementation of the following three programs:\r\n\r\nSummer Transition and Academic Research Programs (STAR Programs) -- The STAR\r\nprograms will help LSAMP students' transition from high school to college by \r\nexposing them to research and career enrichment experiences designed to enhance \r\nthe student's initialcommitment to a SMET discipline beginning in the summer\r\nbefore their first year of college. Importantly, to sustain this initial commitment,\r\nthe STAR programs then continue to provide research and career enrichment \r\nexperiences from the students' freshman year through the summer after their \r\nsophomore year. STAR programs will provide research and career enrichment \r\nexperiences that include such activities as the following: (1) participation in a\r\nsummer bridge program with a \"hands on\" introduction to research experiences \r\ncomponent; (2) formal and informal meetings with faculty and/or graduate mentors; \r\n(3) visits to laboratories that emphasize the active involvement of students; \r\n(4) participation in a higher-level summer research experiences between their first\r\nand second years of college; and (5) participation in the annual LSAMP Indiana Research\r\nand Alliance Enrichment Conference.\r\n\r\nSupplemental Instruction (SI) -- SI programs offer participants the chance to lead \r\nand/or participate in review and study skill sessions to supplement course instruction. \r\nSome of the universities in this alliance have established SI programs for a few of the \r\nhistorically high-risk 100and 200 level \"gatekeeper\" courses, and they are particularly \r\neffective in raising participants'(especially minority participants') G.P.A. and\r\nretention rate. As an alliance, therefore, we are interested in the following: (1) beginning \r\nthe SI program in SMET courses at universities with no SI program; (2) expanding the\r\nSI program to (more) SMET courses at universities with an established SI program; and \r\n(3) adding SI to upper-level courses known to be difficult for students (i.e., 2 nd level\r\n gatekeeper courses).\r\n\r\nCoordination and Development Programs -- To forge the Alliance, all parties involved in\r\nLSAMP Indiana will be invited to conferences in order to: (1) enhance the alliance by \r\nsharingdata, program experiences (successes and failures), and ideas for improving\r\nprograms and the alliance; (2) provide conference experiences that serve academic\r\nand social identification needs; (3) build a supportive network of SMET scholars \r\n(faculty, graduate students, administrators, and students) working toward a shared\r\ngoal who can help guide the alliance; and (4) develop diversity competencies among \r\nfaculty, administrators, support staff, graduate students, and undergraduate\r\nstudents affiliated with LSAMP Indiana by developing new and innovative workshops\r\nthat are then adapted and administered on each campus.\r\n",
