 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will research technical and commercial feasibility of heterogenized homogeneous (supported) palladium N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts.     Homogeneous palladium-catalyzed reactions are powerful methods for carbon-carbon and carbon-hetero atom bond formations, such as Heck and Suzuki reactions. However, their commercial adoption in fine chemical manufacture has been burdened by the inefficiencies associated with homogeneous catalysts, primarily recovery and recycling, which could be eliminated by the development of supported catalysts.  \r\n\r\nSuccessful research and development would result in commercial products that would simplify post-reaction processing, reduced waste streams and reduction in costs via recycling.  \r\n",
