 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) at Duke University, under the direction of PI Dr. Gary Hartshorn to improve the research facilities at OTS' Palo Verde Biological Station in Costa Rica.  OTS is a nonprofit consortium of 65 universities and research institutions from the United States, Latin America, Australia, Canada and South Africa. Founded in 1963, OTS' mission is to provide leadership in education, research and the responsible use of natural resources in the tropics.  OTS has operated the Palo Verde Biological station since 1971.\r\n\r\nLocated in lowland, monsoonally dry forest of Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, OTS' Palo Verde station is in the heart of Palo Verde National Park that protects one of the largest remnants of tropical dry forest in Mesoamerica.  At Palo Verde, OTS works in cooperation with governmental and partner-organizations on scientific issues of training, conservation, environmental education, wetlands restoration and natural resources management.  Over the past decade the demand to use Palo Verde by OTS and non-OTS education groups has almost doubled, while research use continues to increase.  The facilities at Palo Verde are inadequate to meet the physical needs for student and researcher uses, such as laboratory and lecture space, offices and housing.  OTS will use NSF funds to build a new facility to house the station director and staff; construct a four?unit cabin to house up to eight researchers; construct a new boardwalk into the marsh; and purchase a new generator to provide a back-up power source.\r\n\r\nThe broad goals of this project are to:\r\n\r\nAchieve OTS' long-term strategic goal of developing the Palo Verde Biological Station as a center of excellence in tropical dry forest ecology and wetlands management. \r\n\r\nModernize the Palo Verde Biological Station to improve its education, research and conservation biology capabilities.\r\n\r\nTo stimulate and support the development and dissemination of research in tropical dry forest ecology. \r\n\r\nThe full implementation of this project will enable OTS to continue to build its education program at Palo Verde, assist scientists in achieving the region's vast research potential, and work with researchers on wetlands protection at a time when agricultural growth in the lower Tempisque river basin is having a major impact on Palo Verde National Park.\r\n\r\n",
