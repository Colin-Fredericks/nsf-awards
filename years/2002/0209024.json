 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lee, Insup\r\nCCR-0209024\r\n\r\nMany embedded systems are part of safety-critical applications, e.g.,\r\navionics systems, manufacturing, automotive controllers, and medical\r\ndevices.  The safety-critical nature of embedded applications requires a higher\r\nlevel of robustness and reliability than is called for in conventional\r\nsoftware systems development.  In the attempt to insure a higher level of\r\nconfidence in the design and implementation, current practice merely\r\nincreases the duration, frequency, scope, etc. of traditional\r\nverification practices.  The net result is substantially higher\r\ndevelopment costs and longer design cycles, leading to a design cycle\r\nwhere a verification bottleneck is impacting overall operational\r\neffectiveness, efficiency and safety.  \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to mitigate the verification bottleneck by identifying\r\nappropriate specification formalisms, and using those formalisms as a\r\nbasis to develop fully automated techniques for verifying\r\nimplementations using testing.  An important distinguishing \r\ncharacteristic of the embedded applications listed earlier is the \r\nhybrid (discrete and continuous)nature of behaviors. The continuous \r\ncomponents of embedded systems, and the large state\r\nspaces of all industrially relevant systems, make verification\r\ntechniques based on exhaustive exploration of the state space\r\nintractable.  Therefore, it is necessary to approach the verification\r\nproblem with techniques based on sampling, i.e., testing.  This requires \r\nabstracting the original system state space to\r\ncreate a condensed state space that can be explored to determine\r\nvaluable points to sample.  Methods of abstraction, methods for\r\nselecting test points, and methods for evaluating the relative merit\r\nof one set of test points vs. another are all issues addressed by this\r\nwork. The research also explores the use of traditional\r\nnotions of test coverage applied to formal specifications of hybrid\r\nsystems.  Test suites are generated using the counterexample or\r\nwitness generation techniques of model checkers as well as random path\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThe practical issues of demonstrating the working techniques, and the\r\nefficacy of these techniques when applied to realistic systems, are\r\naddressed through the implementation of tools that automate all\r\nsteps of the process: abstraction, test selection, test derivation,\r\ntest application to concrete implementations, and the evaluation of\r\ntest results.  Tools are developed on top of the existing\r\nCHARON framework for creating hybrid system models.\r\nCase-study work based on real system specifications and\r\nbenefit from interaction with practicing engineers working for Honeywell, a\r\nleader in the development of advanced avionics systems.  One issue is how\r\nto integrate the techniques into development processes that conform \r\nto the DO-178B avionics certification process.\r\nAmong the broader impacts that are anticipated from this work are (1)\r\nan increase in awareness of and actual use of formal methods by\r\npracticing developers, and (2) an acceleration of the safety-critical\r\nembedded system development process that will enable the creation of\r\nsafer, more reliable systems with shorter development cycle times.\r\n",
