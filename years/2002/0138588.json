The organizers are Dr. Shafiqul Islam, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, Dr. Charles Harvey, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Dr. C.S. Karim, Member, Physical Science, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission.  The workshop is to explore the issues of long-term sustainability of water resources and environments in the Ganges- Brahmaputtra- Meghna (GBM) Delta.  The workshop will focus on five areas: 1) Geology and Hydrogeology of the GBM Delta, 2) Biology and Ecology, 3) Water Resources, Irrigation & Environmental Aspects, 4) Arsenic Contamination in a Tropical Delta, 5) Socioeconomic Aspects of Population Dynamics and Agriculture.  The workshop goals are to explore areas of mutual interest for international collaborative research on the GBM delta, identify and prioritize key research questions within each thematic area, and disseminate information through the workshop proceedings and web based publications.\r\n\r\nScope: This project enables US and Bangladesh scientists to participate in a workshop to discuss an area of importance to both countries and to identify potential collaborative research.  Dr. Islam and Dr. Harvey are currently conducting research on arsenic contamination of well water in Bangladesh.  The other US participants include well-respected scientists with long experience in the river network in south Asia.  The Bangladesh delegation is being selected by Dr. Karim with the supervision of the Ministry of Science and Technology.  The project meets INT objectives in supporting mutually beneficial joint workshops. This project is jointly supported by the Office of International Science and Engineering, the Division of Earth Sciences, the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences, and the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems.\r\n",
