Faculty members will be hired with experience in human communication technology to incorporate cutting edge technological advancements into teaching and research activities and to develop multidisciplinary, discipline-specific and foundational modules in key areas of the curriculum. The modules will provide a foundation for the integration of new technologies. The award will also facilitate further development by a planning group consisting of faculty members at Mercy, and researchers from the University Arizona, University of Colorado-Boulder, and University of Houston-Downtown. The project supports on-site faculty training at the University of Colorado's Center for Spoken Language Research and the development of a five-year infrastructure development proposal to improve faculty and student research capability at Mercy. The award will enable Mercy College to initiate and continue critical steps towards invigorating and strengthening offerings in the computer science and information technology fields",
