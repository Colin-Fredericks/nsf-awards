 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structural reliability/redundancy has become a serious concern in the building industry after the poor performance of some buildings in recent earthquakes.  This research project carries out a systematic investigation of structural redundancy and application to design practice. Within the framework of structural dynamic and reliability analyses, the effects of major redundancy-contributing factors are systematically examined, with emphasis on structural configuration, member ductility capacity, over-strength, interaction of structural components, and torsional motions.  Recent SAC Steel Project analytical and experimental results of structural member and system behavior are used. A risk-consistent redundancy factor is then developed for calculating the design forces such that structures of different configurations and designs can meet reliability-based performance requirements. The impact of the proposed research will be a timely contribution to fundamental understanding of structural redundancy and the development of a rational basis for a performance-based redundancy design factor in codes and standards.\r\n\r\n",
