 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0204100\r\nAlan Weinstein\r\n\r\nRecently, for reasons arising from mathematical physics (string and\r\nmembrane theory) as well as from deformation theory, increased\r\nattention is being paid to nonassociative algebraic structures and,\r\nalong with them, bracket operations which do not satisfy the Jacobi\r\nidentity.  Weinstein applies his previously developed theory of\r\nCourant algebroids and Dirac structures to investigate geometric\r\nmodels for some of these nonassociative structures, generalizing\r\nPoisson structures.  A second part of the research concerns\r\nconvexity theorems for momentum mappings of hamiltonian symmetry\r\ngroups and related questions about the linearization of proper Lie\r\ngroupoids.  The search for the ``optimal'' convexity theorem in\r\nPoisson geometry is related to the problem of describing the local\r\nstructure of proper groupoids in terms of group actions.  The analysis\r\nof proper groupoids leads in turn to the problem of averaging families\r\nof submanifolds in riemannian geometry.  Previous results on this\r\nproblem are being  extended and improved, with one goal being an\r\nunderstanding of the metric geometry of infinite dimensional spaces of\r\nunparametrized submanifolds.  Finally, applications to mechanics are\r\nbe investigated: groupoids applied to discretized lagrangian systems,\r\nand generalized Poisson structures applied to nonholonomic systems.\r\n\r\nWeinstein's research concerns symmetry in geometry, with applications\r\nto physics.  Traditionally, symmetry has been described mathematically\r\nin terms of the operation of groups, and the corresponding\r\ninfinitesimal operation of Lie algebras.  Recently, for reasons\r\narising from mathematical physics (string and membrane theory) as well\r\nas from deformation theory in mathematics, increased attention is\r\nbeing paid to more general notions of symmetry, involving algebraic\r\nstructures lacking the associativity of a group operation and, along\r\nwith them, bracket operations which do not satisfy the Jacobi identity\r\nessential to the notion of Lie algebra.  The study of these (and more\r\ntraditional) symmetries also involves the use of ``groupoids,'' where\r\ndifferent groups are operating on different parts of a space with\r\nsymmetry.  Weinstein's study of these symmetries involves a\r\ncombination of algebra and differential geometry, as well as some very\r\nconcrete geometric questions, a simple form of which is ``what is the\r\naverage of two nearby unparametrized curves in space?'' This question\r\nis easy to pose and may have applications in computer\r\ngraphics, but it is surprisingly difficult to solve.  Finally, \r\nWeinstein is using groupoids in the analysis of discrete lagrangian\r\nsystems used to create numerical algorithms.\r\n",
