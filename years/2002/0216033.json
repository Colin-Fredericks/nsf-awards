 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award supports acquisition of an atomic force microscope (AFM). This instrument will upgrade the research, education and training in surface science and characterization within the biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics departments. Clark Atlanta University (CAU), a historically black college and university, has embarked on an extensive program to increase the total enrollment of science, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students, the annual STEM graduation rate, and the percentage of STEM students that continue to pursue advanced degrees. To accomplish these goals CAU needs research and instructional labs equipped with state of the art instruments, such as the AFM, for cutting edge research and research training in areas as nanoscience and technology. Several faculty members in biology, chemistry, engineering and physics plan to utilize the AFM for research and research training. Research areas of importance that will be studied with the AFM include polymers, composites, microelectronics, photonics, nanotechnology, catalysis, and molecular biology. \r\n\r\nThe acquisition of the AFM will significantly enhance the faculty and student research activities in surface science and material characterization.  The AFM has wide application for the characterization of polymers, biomaterials, thin films and coatings, ceramics and glass, inorganics, optical storage, semiconductors, electronics, metals and insulators. Its use will impact virtually all the STEM students at CAU and other Atlanta University Center institutions. It will be available to an additional 100-250 STEM students from the other Atlanta University Center schools (Morehouse, Spelman and Morris Brown Colleges). \r\n",
