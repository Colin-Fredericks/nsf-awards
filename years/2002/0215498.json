 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will operate the Shelf-Basins Interactions (SBI) Project office at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville for a five-year period beginning in 2002. The SBI Phase II project begins its field season in 2002 and the project office will be responsible for communication and coordination between the PI's and other national and international researchers. In addition, the project office will support the activities of the SBI Science Steering Committee; conduct outreach and public relation activities such as the maintenance of its web site; and coordinate meetings and workshops including two international workshops. The project office will also facilitate the transfer of data sets to the various data centers. Aside from project office activities, a logistics manager will conduct field support activities for the research cruises and ice camps. This will involve operations at Nome, Dutch Harbor, Barrow and Prudhoe as well as planning activities in Seattle, where the USCGC Healy is home ported.",
