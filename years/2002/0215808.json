 "awd_abstract_narration": "Competitively awarded support for University of Idaho (UI) research \r\nhas steadily grown from $35 million in FY'96 to $63 million in FY'01.\r\nThis increase is due, in part, to the research activities of several\r\nmultidisciplinary research institutes and groups. For example, UI's\r\nNASA Grand Challenge team provided the top-ranking concept for\r\ndetecting extraterrestrial life. This concept would be accomplished\r\nin space using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. At\r\npresent, UI simply does not have the capabilities needed to implement\r\nand test MEMS designs in their own laboratories for reliability in\r\nharsh environments. In addition, UI researchers are conducting other\r\nprojects expected to result in a miniaturized tandem mass spectrometer\r\nsystem, miniature resonators, micro pumps, autonomous vehicle guidance\r\nsystems, magnetic random access memories, and magnetic films for small \r\nmonolithic microwave integrated circuits. All of these research activities\r\nwill benefit from the added capabilities requested through the Major\r\nResearch Instrumentation Program. \r\n\r\n As a result of current progress in funded research projects, and with\r\nthe support of the university's administration, the PIs seek to acquire\r\ninstruments to fabricate, test, and evaluate the robustness of new\r\ntechnologies. This request includes a plasma enhanced chemical vapor\r\ndeposition system, an e-beam evaporator, a vibration / shock table, a\r\nthermal vacuum chamber, and a laser vibrometer. Acquisition of these\r\ninstruments will also provide more opportunities to integrate research\r\ntraining with graduate and undergraduate education. The University of\r\nIdaho is requesting approximately $290,000 from the National Science\r\nFoundation from a total project cost of over $611,000. This equipment\r\nwill add significant capabilities to their region by complementing\r\nexisting equipment at neighboring Washington State University and by\r\nproviding research equipment that is currently unavailable in the inland\r\nNorthwest. It will also provide additional opportunities for participants\r\nin Idaho's HOIST program (Helping Orient Indian Students and Teachers to\r\nScience and Technology) to get hands-on experience in engineering\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n The project will be managed by experienced PIs who will use proven\r\ninstrument management approach to ensure efficient operation and\r\nmaintenance of the equipment. A qualified engineering technician will\r\nassist them. The equipment will be housed within a single building on\r\nthe main UI campus, and this MRI award will receive full administrative\r\nsupport from the Director and staff of the UI Microelectronics Research\r\nand Communications Institute.",
