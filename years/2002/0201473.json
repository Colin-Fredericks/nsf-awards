 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heat straightening has been used to repair damaged steel structures for many\r\nyears. However, until recently practitioners use of the method was based on\r\nexperience gained through trial and error.  Recent research had provided and\r\nengineering basis for the method and established procedures for its use.\r\nThe engineering and construction community has been hesitant to utilize heat\r\nstraightening for several reasons including: past misuse of the process\r\nwhich has produced fractures during repair; concerns about the effect of\r\nheat straightening on material properties, especially ductility; and a\r\ngeneral lack of understanding of the method. Its current application is\r\nprimarily in repair of damaged bridge girders with limited application for\r\nother types of construction.  Even though a scientific basis now exists for\r\nthe method, there is a major gap in available data that has limited the\r\napplication of heat straightening. There have been no significant\r\ninvestigations into the fracture sensitivity of heat straightened members.\r\nWithout this knowledge, a performance based design approach cannot be used\r\nfor designing heat-straightening repairs.  The purpose of this proposal is\r\nto describe a research plan that will quantify the process and define the\r\nlimiting parameters for a successful repair.\r\n\r\n",
