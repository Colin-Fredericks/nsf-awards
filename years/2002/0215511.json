Dr. Talat S. Rahman, Department of Physics, Kansas State University, is organizing the US delegation.  Dr. Riazuddin, Director of the National Center for Physics at Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan is the organizer of a one-week session on condensed matter physics (CMP) at the College. Attendees include scientists, mostly recent Ph.D.'s, from a number of developing countries in the region, including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Tajikistan, and Turkey, as well as Pakistan. They also include graduate students from Pakistan.  There are two sessions of one week each:  the first week is dedicated to topics in CMP and the second week to topics in particle and plasma physics.  This award supports the participation of the US scientists in the first week's session, whose theme is \"Novel Characteristics of Nanostructured Materials.\"  Lectures will focus on magnetic, semiconductor and metallic nanostructures, and the processes of nanostructuring materials.  Special emphasis will be placed on providing insight into topics such as spintronics, quantum dots, quantum wells, nano-wires, nano-tubes, photonics, and microelectronics.  Speakers will also lead informal discussions and tutorial sessions.  The proceedings will be published.\r\n\r\nScope: International Nathiagali Summer Colleges (INSC) have been organized every year since 1976.  Scientists from the United States and Western Europe present lectures and hold discussions on a variety of subjects of current interest in physics and their contemporary applications in developing countries.  The INSC is attended by laboratory and industrial researchers, university professors, college teachers, and graduate students.  The INSC provides the US lecturers the opportunity to establish useful links with scientists from developing countries and to disseminate scientific knowledge broadly. At least one junior scientist and one graduate student will be selected as participants in the US delegation.  The broader impact of this activity will be to create a more scientifically aware society worldwide.\r\n",
