 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work is concerned with the theory of free surface flows.  Here a free\r\nsurface refers to an interface between two fluids.  The position of such a surface is not\r\nknown a priori and has to be found as part of the solution. This leads\r\nto a highly nonlinear mathematical problem, for which the PI  will\r\ndevelop new numerical and analytical approaches. \r\nThe  objective is to develop numerically and analytically  theories for\r\nthree-dimensional nonlinear free surface flows and for two-dimensional\r\ninterfacial flows. Specifically:\r\n(A) Derive efficient and accurate numerical approaches for \r\nthree-dimensional nonlinear free surface flows. \r\n(B) Use these new schemes together with analytical techniques to further\r\nthe understanding of three-dimensional free surface flows. This\r\nincludes extending linear and weakly nonlinear theories to the\r\nfully nonlinear regime and discovering the limiting configurations\r\nof these flows.\r\n(C) Check the validity of existing approximations in ship \r\nhydrodynamics and improve them.\r\n(D) Investigate the existence of new types of waves propagating\r\nat the interface between two fluids of constant densities. These waves should\r\nhave properties intermediate between  those of ``generalized solitary waves\"\r\nand those of ``classical fronts\". Therefore it is appropriate to\r\ndescribe them as ``generalized fronts\". \r\nTheir existence is strongly suggested by previous work but they\r\nhave not been calculated explicitly.\r\n(E) Calculate the generalized fronts and perform a numerical study of\r\ntheir stability.\r\n\r\nFree surface flows are common in many aspects of science and everyday life.\r\nExamples are waves on a beach, bubbles rising in a glass of champagne,\r\nmelting ice, pouring flows from a container and sails blowing in the wind.\r\nIn these examples the free surface is the surface of the sea, the interface\r\nbetween the gas and the champagne, the surface of the ice, the boundary\r\nof the pouring flow and the surface of the sail. The PI will concentrate\r\non applications arising from fluid mechanics. However the methods developed are\r\ngeneral and have applications outside fluid mechanics and the PI proposes to\r\ninvestigate them as well.  The research will  benefit applied mathematicians interested in nonlinear\r\nfree surface flows and applied scientists in need of accurate schemes\r\nto solve three-dimensional free surface flows. The proposed application\r\nto the nonlinear wave pattern generated by a ship is relevant to\r\nship hydrodynamics. The study of waves on sharp  interfaces  has  \r\napplications in oceanography. Such sharp interfaces form in oceans, lakes\r\nand the atmosphere between adjacent masses of different density associated with\r\ndifferences in temperature, salinity or amount of suspension. One of the\r\nreasons for studying such sharp boundaries is that they appear at the surface as\r\nfrontal lines where  dust, foam, timber and others accumulate.\r\nMany  of the problems proposed can be done in\r\ncollaboration with  graduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
