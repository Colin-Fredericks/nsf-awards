The  workshop is aiming at fostering collaborations between disciplines (mathematics, computer  science, engineering), identifying new directions and problems to work on, and engaging representatives from under-represented groups in collaborative research opportunities (we anticipate about half of the participants to be female researchers or students).  A new topic will be chosen each year by the organizer. A web page will be prepared for  each workshop, which will include links to resulting publications.  There will be no registration fee. The chosen location (Bellairs Research Institute of McGill University in Barbados, West Indies) already has a long tradition within our community (McGill researchers have very successfully organized such workshops on various topics for over 15 years, and the institute's facilities have been used by other academic institutions in the US and Canada). It allows for informal and very productive interaction, it has inexpensive lodging and is accessible via major US carriers at\r\nreasonably priced airfare.  \r\n",
