The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support an eight-month research fellowship by Dr. Diana S. Sinton to work with Dr. Ana Scopel at the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are to understand the invasion of exotic woody species and native shrubs into a protected area, by a case study of El Palmar National Park in Argentina.  First, they will characterize the changes in the abundance and spatial distribution of exotic woody species and native shrubs since the Park was created, second, they will characterize the expansion of each species in relation to disturbances and management, and third, they will create models for the dispersal of M. azedarach and its predicted growth.  They will use aerial photograph and satellite image analysis and interpretation, and supplementary fieldwork.  GIS-based, spatial analyses and other modeling techniques will be used to illuminate the processes affecting M. azederach and other woody and shrub species.  Biological invasions into protected areas are a worldwide problem, compromising conservation efforts and threatening biodiversity.\r\n\r\nDr. Scopel has an extensive background in population ecology and a thorough understanding of the Park landscape and specific properties of M. azederach.\r\n",
