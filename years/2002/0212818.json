 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite current interest in tropical forests as key components of the global carbon\r\ncycle and as centers of biodiversity,we remain largely ignorant of the inter-relationships\r\namong forest attributes (e.g.,dynamics,diversity,structure),and the physical properties\r\nof the environments in which these forests grow.In recent years datasets have become\r\navailable describing growth,mortality and recruitment of approximately 10%of the\r\nglobal diversity of tropical tree species.These data result from the development of a\r\nnetwork of large-scale forest dynamics plots coordinated by the Center for Tropical\r\nForest Science (CTFS),and established using methods identical to those used to survey\r\nand census the 50-ha Forest Dynamics Plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI),Panama.\r\nJust as data from the BCI plot have played a prominent role in our understanding of the\r\ncommunity-level consequences of ecological processes played out at local scales,we will\r\nshow how these plots now provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine a venerable\r\nquestion in tropical ecology:How do soil-borne resources influence the variation in forest\r\nstructure and demographic turnover rates observed among plots,and among habitat types\r\nwithin plots?\r\nTo achieve this objective we propose three sets of measurements.At nine plot\r\nsites we will characterize variation in soil-moisture availability through the year and\r\nthroughout the plots using a hydrological model (TOPMODEL).This model predicts\r\nsoil-moisture saturation deficit based on rainfall,stream-flow data and local topography.\r\nSecond,at five plots currently lacking soils data we will sample soil-chemical properties\r\nwithin standardized,topographically-defined habitat types.Third,at the same plots we\r\nwill perform seedling growth experiments using mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal\r\npioneer species to assess plant-availability of soil nutrients for each habitat type.These\r\nmeasurements will allow us to address questions at two spatial scales.At the among-plot\r\nscale we will be able to ask how stem density and basal area,as well as community-wide\r\npatterns of growth,mortality and recruitment,correlate with moisture availability and soil\r\nfertility.At the within-plot scale we will ask whether species exhibit specialization to\r\nparticular hydrological niches,and whether habitat types differ in soil fertility,in\r\nturnover rates,and in local species richness.Resolution of these broad questions\r\nconcerning correlations among soil-borne resources and characteristics of the vegetation\r\nwill in turn permit us to refine future hypotheses aimed at understanding the mechanistic\r\nbasis for interspecific variation in demographics and distribution.\r\nThis study will provide the first standardized large-scale measurements of the\r\nenvironmental context within which tropical forests grow.Our trans-continental approach\r\nto testing questions of ecosystem function and community organization has rarely been\r\nattempted,but it will be essential if we are to improve our understanding of the\r\nbiogeographic and biophysical limits to our ecological generalizations.Understanding\r\nhow variation in water and nutrient availability determines forest structure,composition\r\nand dynamics,and potentially influences local diversity through niche partitioning,will\r\nbe essential to predicting future vegetation responses to climate change and will also\r\nprovide a first step in guiding management to protect forest diversity.Wide dissemination\r\nand application of the results of this project is ensured by the active participation of in-\r\ncountry collaborators,and by data sharing through CTFS.",
