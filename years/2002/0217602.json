 "awd_abstract_narration": "Louis Stokes South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participantion (LS-SCAMP)\r\n\r\nThe Louis Stokes-South Carolina Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-SCAMP) has \r\nbecome a keystone for undergraduate science, mathematics, engineering and technology \r\n(SMET) retention and a catalyst for degree completion within the state. Committed \r\nleadership from top- level administrators is paramount to the successful \r\nimplementation of the goals proposed herein.The new LS-SCAMP Phase I will be lead\r\nby South Carolina State University (SCSU),nationally ranked for African American/Minority\r\nSMET degree completion and the largest producer of underrepresented minority SMET \r\ndegrees in the state. Currently all of SCSU's SMET baccalaureate degree programs are \r\nranked nationally as a result of African- American/Minority degree completion. Biology\r\n, Mathematics and Engineering Technology are ranked 4 th in the nation while Computer \r\nScience is ranked 13 th and Physics is ranked 21 st . LS-SCAMP includes all seven of the\r\nHBCUs in the state of South Carolina and represents a new beginning and a new era of \r\nsupport for the success of underrepresented minorities in SMET. To meet the strong\r\ndemand for higher education and to combat the persistent barriers toaccess, the new\r\nLS-SCAMP will build on the foundation established during the prior SCAMP phases.\r\nSpecifically the following Phase I goals will be achieved:\r\n\r\n1. Increase underrepresented SMET baccalaureate degree production at a rate that is\r\n40% higher than the national SMET degree rate.\r\n2. Strengthen and expand undergraduate research opportunities for SMET students.\r\n3. Provide opportunities for SMET students to develop knowledge and skills that\r\nwill improve their qualifications and enhance their preparation for graduate\r\nstudies in SMET fields.\r\n4. Build a transfer bridge to increase by 100% SMET majors from 2-year\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding track record for the production of minority graduates at many of \r\nthe Alliance institutions, the unprecedented level of support for the AMP program in \r\nSouth Carolina and the new statewide infrastructure, will allow the goals of Phase I to\r\n be met.\r\n",
