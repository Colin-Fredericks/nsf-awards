 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nSpatial scale poses a fundamental problem in understanding species diversity because\r\nmechanisms creating variation in diversity change with scale. Ecological communities are\r\nstructured over time as well as patterned across space. Community assembly, how species join\r\ncommunities over time, not only poses another problem, but also is responsible for observed\r\nspatial patterns. It is not well known how species diversity, community assembly, and spatial\r\nscale relate. This project examines three factors that may determine the degree to which\r\nassembly contributes to diversity at different spatial scales. The number of species in the\r\nregional species pool, the amount of nutrients available to communities, and the number of\r\ndisturbance types imposed on communities may all play important roles. Hypotheses addressing\r\nthese factors will be developed through computer simulations and tested through laboratory\r\nexperiments using bacteria, protists, and rotifers. These approaches, unlike most field studies,\r\nensure rigorous control over invasion sequence and environmental conditions and monitor\r\ncommunity dynamics over many generations. Overall, this project will provide an assembly-\r\nbased model explaining species diversity. Adding temporal dynamics of community assembly to\r\nour perspective will enable ecologists to better understand how and when spatial scale is critical\r\nin assessing the regulation of species diversity.",
