 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nWith the acquisition of a 300 MHz high-field Fourier Transform nuclear magnetic resonance (FT-NMR) spectrometer we are implementing modern NMR techniques, including variable temperature, multinuclear, and two-dimensional methods, in both teaching laboratories and undergraduate research projects. The main goal of the project is to update and improve the chemistry lab experiences afforded to both chemistry and non-chemistry majors. Other objectives are to improve undergraduate research experiences, to provide a regional NMR resource, and to provide opportunities for professional improvement to WSU chemistry faculty. To achieve our objectives, we are adapting and implementing a set of experiments from the chemical education literature into our Biochemistry, Organic, Inorganic, Polymer, and Physical chemistry courses, and into two advanced laboratories; the Advanced Organic Chemistry and the Instrumental Analysis laboratory courses. In conjunction with NMR, we are also using molecular modeling in organic chemistry to enhance the quality of the experiments. The chemistry students' experience with the FT-NMR techniques begins with the second-year course in organic chemistry and culminates in capstone research guided by the chemistry faculty. Students use laptop computers for off-line data processing, thus allowing time-efficient use of the NMR. We are using standardized student, faculty, and alumni surveys and course evaluation forms to assess our project. Classroom assessment techniques from the Field-tested Learning Assessment Guide (FLAG) project are being used to assess student learning. Project results will be disseminated through presentations at national professional conferences, submissions to peer-reviewed journals, and publication on the project web site.\r\n",
