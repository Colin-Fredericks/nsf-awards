 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: A Unified Theory of Pseudorandomness\r\nSalil P. Vadhan\r\n\r\nDuring the past few decades, randomization has become one of the most\r\npervasive paradigms in computer science.  The best known solutions to\r\nmany problems in algorithms, cryptography, reliable communication,\r\nnetwork design, combinatorics, and distributed computing surprisingly\r\ninvolve making random choices.  Thus randomness appears to be very\r\nuseful, but it is still not known to what extent it is truly\r\nnecessary.  Thus, this research asks: is it possible to reduce or even\r\neliminate the need for randomness in the above settings?  The\r\ninvestigators address this question via the paradigm of\r\nPseudorandomness, which is the theory of efficiently generating\r\nobjects that \"look random\" despite being constructed using little or\r\nno randomness.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this research builds upon deep connections recently\r\ndiscovered between four pseudorandom objects, namely pseudorandom\r\ngenerators, expander graphs, error-correcting codes, and extractors.\r\nThe investigators seek to strengthen these connections and use them to\r\nattack some of the open problems in the area, such as the construction\r\nof expander graphs with optimal expansion, the derandomization of\r\nspace-bounded computation, and a complete understanding of the\r\nrelationship between derandomization and circuit lower bounds.\r\nStudents at all levels are involved in the research, including\r\nundergraduates who explore conjectures about expander graphs through\r\ncomputer experiments.  The research is tightly integrated into new\r\ncourses being developed by the investigators, including a graduate\r\ncourse on Pseudorandomness, which focuses on the unified theory that\r\nis emerging; and an undergraduate course on Cryptography, which\r\nemphasizes the role of pseudorandomness in modern cryptography.\r\n",
