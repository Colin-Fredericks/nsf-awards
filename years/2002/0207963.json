 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY \r\n \r\nWith prior support from NSF, we have shown that TIMS (Thermal Ionization Mass \r\nSpectrometry) U-series dating of pedogenic carbonate can provide a precise chronology of \r\npedogenesis and reliable ages for appropriate Quaternary alluvial deposits (Sharp et al., \r\naccepted). Though the U/Th ratios of pedogenic carbonate of carbonate-clast dominated \r\nalluvium at Kyle Canyon (Nevada) are too low for U-series dating, pedogenic carbonate in \r\ngranitic-clast dominated gravels of the Wind River Basin (Wyoming) is highly suitable.  \r\nPrecise U-series ages  (1-2 percent, 2) may be measured on a few cubic millimeters of \r\npedogenic carbonate and require only very small corrections for detrital 230Th.  Suites of \r\nages may be screened for reliability using criteria inherent in the U-series results. The time \r\nlag between clast deposition and accumulation of datable carbonate.a critical parameter \r\nif U-series dates of innermost clast-rinds are to be used to date host Quaternary deposits.\r\nis estimated to be 5+  5 kyr in the Wind River basin.  O- and C-isotope analyses of a trial \r\nsuite of pedogenic carbonate samples shows that a temporally resolved stable isotope \r\npaleoclimatic record can be constructed using pedogenic carbonate dated by U-series. \r\nFunds are requested to further develop U-series dating of pedogenic carbonate and its \r\napplication to the refinement of a Rocky Mountain glacial chronology.  Emphasis will be \r\nplaced on resolving the timing of Bull Lake glacial advances (at their type locality) with \r\nrespect to other regional and global climate records. Moreover, we propose to characterize \r\nthe spatial and temporal accumulation of pedogenic carbonate in relict soils of Late-\r\nMiddle to Late Pleistocene deposits, and measure the O- and C-isotopic compositions of \r\ncarbonate samples dated by U-series. We will interpret these data to provide a \r\ncomprehensive history of paleoenvironmental change in the Wind River Basin throughout \r\nmuch of the late Illinoian and Wisconsin glacial cycles. Ultimately, our goal is to correlate \r\nthe soils-based paleoenvironmental record with the geomorphic expressions of \r\npaleoclimatic change.the well-preserved glacial moraines and glacio-fluvial terraces of \r\nthe Basin.by establishing a common chronological framework based on precise U-series \r\nages. \r\n \r\nThis is a collaborative proposal. Warren Sharp and Ken Ludwig (Berkeley Geochronology \r\nCenter) will be responsible for U-series analyses and age interpretations; Ron Amundson \r\n(U.C. Berkeley) will provide field and laboratory expertise in pedology and stable isotope \r\nanalysis and interpretation; Oliver Chadwick (U.C. Santa Barbara) will provide expertise \r\nin Quaternary geology, geomorphology and soil stratigraphy as well as familiarity with the \r\nWind River area.  \r\n",
