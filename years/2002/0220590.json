The backbone, enabling a cooperative research efforts in the Computer Science Department, fosters research and educational collaborations with other departments (specifically Biology and Psychology) and with other research institutions. The proposed research backbone is articulated in four inter-dependent threads: \r\n\r\nData structures and methodologies for efficient parallel execution of logic and constraint programming languages \r\n\r\nLanguages and methodologies for the design of knowledge based systems \r\n\r\nApplication of knowledge-based technology in Semantic Web, Universal Accessibility, and Computational Biology \r\n\r\nAutomated debugging and component-based programming for knowledge-based applications\r\nEnhancement of the educational program is expected to lead to improved recruitment and retention, increased transition towards graduate programs, and a stronger integration between research and education at the graduate\r\n and undergraduate level. These goals will be accomplished through the introduction of a pathways system throughout the undergraduate curriculum, where different pathways will accommodate the diverse student backgrounds. Focusing on an educational model for the training of Native American students in Computer Science, the institution expects to improve participation of a diverse student population in computer-related disciplines, with particular focus on the creation of an educational model for the training of Native American students in Computer Science. The proposed infrastructure provides research support, in the form of computing equipment (e.g., a 64-processor Beowulf platform, HP shared memory platform, robotic equipment) and human resources support (for faculty, students, and visiting scientists). The educational infrastructure includes the creation of a new computing classroom and provides human resources for the development of the new educational programs. A research team, consisting of 14 investigators, will benefit from this infrastructure by strengthening their interdisciplinary research through cross-fertilization of new ideas.\r\n\r\n",
