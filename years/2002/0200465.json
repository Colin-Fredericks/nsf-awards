 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will apply methods\r\nfrom computability theory to study the effective content and\r\nproof-theoretic strength of various areas of mathematics. In\r\nparticular, he will concentrate on computable model theory and\r\nalgebra, reverse mathematics and effectiveness of combinatorial\r\nprinciples, and effective notions of randomness and relative\r\nrandomness. In computable model theory, this project will\r\ncontinue the development of methods to address issues raised by\r\neffectivizing model-theoretic notions. These issues include the\r\nrelationships between the different ways that a given structure\r\nmay be effectivized, the relationships between the degree of\r\neffectivity of different models of theories with few models, and\r\nthe differences between the computability-theoretic phenomena\r\nthat can occur in general and those that can occur within\r\nwell-known classes of structures. Hirschfeldt will also study\r\ncomputability-theoretic and proof-theoretic aspects of\r\ncombinatorial principles, exploiting the connections between\r\neffective mathematics and the reverse mathematics\r\nprogram. Finally, the principal investigator will study the\r\nstructure of (effectively approximable) reals under notions of\r\nrelative effective randomness defined through the use of\r\nprefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of initial segments.\r\n\r\nThe study of the effective content of mathematics has received\r\nincreasing attention in the last few decades. It is a natural\r\noutgrowth of the efforts to understand and formalize the notions\r\nof algorithm and computable function undertaken in the early part\r\nof the twentieth century.  It is of both pure mathematical and\r\nfoundational interest, and has important connections with\r\ncomputer science. This project aims to further our understanding\r\nof how structure affects computability, and how computability\r\ninteracts with other fundamental notions of modern mathematics\r\nand foundations of mathematics, such as randomness and\r\nproof-theoretic strength. Computability theorists have developed\r\na highly successful theory of relative computational complexity\r\nof sets of numbers, which, in addition to its intrinsic\r\nmathematical interest, has been influential in theoretical\r\ncomputer science. One of the goals of this project is to continue\r\nthe development of an emerging parallel theory of relative\r\nalgorithmic randomness, which can act as a theoretical framework\r\nin which to consider questions such as: When should we say that\r\nan infinite set is more random than another, and what\r\nconsequences does the relative randomness of sets have for their\r\nrelative computational complexity?\r\n",
