 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to lay the foundation for a QoS metric that can be easily \r\nunderstood and can be used for the design of future packet networks.  The premise of the \r\nproposed research is that Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms have not been widely \r\nemployed because of both their complexity and their lack of relationship to user \r\nperceived performance.  Therefore, it is currently difficult to justify the investment in \r\ncomplex QoS technologies while their value to the end customer is unknown.  There have \r\nbeen cases where commercial networks have been over provisioned, resulting in all users, \r\nindependent of QoS requirement or priority, receiving the same service.  Based on these \r\nexperiences network customers are reluctant to pay extra for QoS.  \r\nHistorically, the telephony QoS metric, call blocking probability, was not only  \r\neasily understood but provided the foundation for network design.  Clearly this metric is \r\nnot suitable for packet networks like the Internet, since packet networks experience delay \r\nand packet loss in the presence of congestion. Recently, it has become increasingly \r\napparent that temporal characteristics of the congestion episodes have the dominant effect \r\non user perceived QoS.   Reinforcing the increasing importance of the temporal \r\ncharacteristics of congestion is the recent work in the Internet Engineering Task Force \r\n(IETF) on measurement-based temporal QoS metrics.  Once congestion occurs at a \r\nbottleneck point in the network it tends to persist and cause a user observable \r\nimpairment.  Thus,  there is a need to increase our understanding of the temporal \r\ncharacteristics of congestion.  To address this issue a new QoS metric is defined, the rate \r\nof congestion events per unit time, and a research effort identified to develop analytic \r\nmethodologies to study this QoS metric.  Specifically, this research will focus on: 1) \r\npredicting the frequency of congestion events for long range dependent (LDR) like \r\ntraffic, i.e., fractional Brownian motion, in a network context, 2) developing simple \r\napproximations for predicting the frequency of congestion events, 3) validating the \r\nresulting prediction methodologies for networks using real high resolution traffic \r\nmeasurements, 4) developing efficient techniques to measure the rate of congestion \r\nevents, and 5) relating the congestion event metric proposed here to new measurement-\r\nbased temporal QoS metrics.  A rigorous definition is proposed for the time between \r\ncongestion episodes, which leads to the application of first hitting time analysis for its \r\nprediction. The proposed research will exploit some recent theoretical results as well \r\ndevelop new methods for predicting first hitting times for a realistic traffic.   \r\nNetwork users have been struggling to quantify their perceived performance.  The \r\nnew QoS metric proposed here summarizes the network component of performance in \r\none easily understandable number.  Equally important, the proposed metric is structured \r\nin such a way that it can be used for network engineering.  We expect the proposed \r\nmetric, combined with accurate prediction techniques, will play an important role in \r\ndesigning future packet networks. \r\n",
