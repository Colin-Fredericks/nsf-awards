 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with questions in commutative algebra. While the\r\nquestions address a variety of topics, there is an underlying\r\ncommon thread that unifies them all: the theory of integral closure.\r\nThe PI, together with her collaborators, first plans to develop\r\nmethods that produce the integral closure of an ideal. In joint work\r\nwith Bernd Ulrich the proposer has established that linkage is a\r\nmethod for capturing integral elements over a complete intersection. Now\r\nthe investigator wants to extend this same procedure to Gorenstein\r\nlinkage and residual intersections. Second, the PI intends to clarify the\r\nconnection between the core of an ideal and the adjoint of Lipman (or the\r\nmultiplier ideal of Ein and Lazarsfeld), find an explicit formula for\r\nthe core, and compute the core of monomial ideals (a question posed\r\nby Eisenbud and Sturmfels). The investigator intends to use linkage\r\ntheory, residual intersection theory and Groebner basis theory.\r\nThird, the investigator would like to study the special fiber ring. This\r\nobject is very important from a geometric point of view because it\r\nencodes algebraic information on the special fiber of the blowup. The \r\nfocus here is on finding conditions that force the fiber to be unmixed or\r\neven Cohen-Macaulay. Last, the PI  plans to study the Hilbert function of \r\nzero-dimensional normal ideals (an ideal is normal if all its powers are \r\nintegrally closed). One of the proposer's goals is to show that all the \r\nHilbert coefficients of such ideals are non-negative, while another goal \r\nis to characterize the vanishing of the Hilbert coefficients in terms of\r\nthe Cohen-Macaulayness of the associated graded ring of the ideal\r\nitself or of one of its powers.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is concerned with problems in commutative\r\nalgebra. On a basic level commutative algebra is about techniques\r\nfor solving systems of polynomial equations. Commutative algebra\r\nhad a revolutionary growth in the past fifty years as it provided\r\nthe tools for understanding many problems in pure and applied\r\nmathematics. In many applied problems, polynomial equations and\r\nhence commutative algebra play a crucial role. Applied areas where\r\ncommutative algebra results have been used in the past include\r\noperations research, computer science, robotics, control theory, coding\r\ntheory and cryptography to mention a few.\r\n",
