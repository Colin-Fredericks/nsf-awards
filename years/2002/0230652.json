Enhancement of the Undergraduate program should yield the following: an increased attraction by students to pursue degrees in IE, better retention of students in IE majors, and better preparation of IE graduates to meet the future workforce needs of engineers employed in a high-tech society.  Additionally, planning efforts undertaken in this proposed planning grant will help to establish a framework that can be used by Industrial Engineering departments interested in improving their courses, curriculum, methods of delivery, instructional strategies, and overall preparation of their graduates.  Planning activities undertaken in this proposed  grant will initially be disseminated through the following venues: American Society of Engineering Education Conferences, Institute of Industrial Engineering National Conference, IIE Council of Academic Department Heads, ASEE Journal of Engineering Education, ASEE Prism Magazine, and the UCF WWW.  \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives to be pursued during this planning grant to ensure that the \r\noverall goals of this project are met include: 1) developing plans for introducing \r\nemerging topics into the IE curriculum; 2) developing plans for increasing student \r\nholistic problem solving capabilities; 3) developing plans for including more \r\nexperiential/active learning exercises; 4) developing plans for incorporating more \r\ntechnology into classrooms; 5) developing plans for improving instructional strategies \r\nand faculty professional development; 6) developing plans for enhancing professional \r\ndevelopment and leadership capabilities of students; and 7) developing plans for \r\nexploiting partnerships to increase the number of talented students in IE disciplines.    \r\n   \r\n",
