Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture predicts that points \r\nin  the entire space AH(M) can be classified by topological data \r\n(coming from the marked homeomorphism type of the hyperbolic \r\n3-manifold) and geometric data (which encodes the asymptotic \r\ngeometry of the ends.) Yair Minsky has made substantial progress \r\ntowards the resolution of Thurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture \r\nin the case that M has incompressible boundary. Prof. Canary will \r\ncollaborate with Jeff Brock and Yair Minsky on a program to \r\ncomplete the proof of this conjecture and a number of related \r\nconjectures. Recent work, by Anderson, Brock, Bromberg, Canary, \r\nHolt, McCullough and McMullen, has revealed surprising new \r\nphenomena concerning the global topology of AH(M). Components of \r\nthe interior may bump (i.e. have intersecting closures) and \r\nindividual components may bump themselves. Prof. Canary proposes \r\nto further study the global topology of AH(M). In particular, the \r\ntechniques used in the attack on the Ending Lamination Conjecture \r\nwill be used to study the continuity of the ending invariants.\r\n\r\nThe study of 3-dimensional manifolds employs tools from geometry, \r\ntopology, dynamics and complex analysis. It is the interplay of \r\nthese tools which gives the subject its rich flavor. A 2-dimensional\r\nmanifold or surface is a space which looks locally like 2-dimensional\r\nEuclidean space; examples are given by the surfaces of familiar \r\n3-dimensional objects such as doughnuts. Similarly, a 3-manifold \r\nis a space that looks locally like 3-dimensional Euclidean space.  \r\nA Riemannian metric is a way of measuring distances and angles in \r\na manifold.  For example, the universe we live in is a 3-manifold \r\nwith a Riemannian metric.  Surfaces were classified in the 19th \r\ncentury, and it was shown that all surfaces admit a beautiful \r\nRiemannian metric of one of three types: Euclidean, spherical or \r\nhyperbolic. The study of all possible such metrics on a fixed \r\nsurface was begun in the 19th century and has played a key role\r\nin topology, complex analysis, Riemannian geometry and algebraic \r\ngeometry. Thurston revolutionized the study of 3-manifolds by \r\nconjecturing, and proving in many cases, that every 3-manifold\r\nmay be canonically decomposed into pieces which admit metrics of\r\none of 8 geometric types.  Hyperbolic metrics are the most common \r\nand least understood class of such metrics.  Prof. Canary will \r\nstudy the space of all hyperbolic metrics on a fixed 3-manifold.\r\n",
