 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nWe are integrating Raman spectroscopy, a specialized tool commonly seen only in advanced research laboratories, throughout all four years of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum and also into some Physics and Life and Earth Science courses at Otterbein College. Our immediate goal is to enhance our chemistry curriculum by including activities that will carefully build students' understanding of vibrational spectroscopy throughout their four years of training. To achieve our goal, we are adapting and implementation inquiry- and project-based laboratory exercises that utilize the Raman microscopy into the General, Organic, Analytical, Inorganic and Physical chemistry courses. These activities draw on a variety of NSF-funded projects on forensic chemistry, modern instrumentation, and Raman spectroscopy. We are also using the Raman spectroscope in ongoing faculty-student research projects. In addition to chemistry students, this instrument is also being used by students in the Physics and Life and Earth Sciences departments. In total, approximately 110 students annually are being impacted by this curricular reform project. We anticipate the student outcomes of this project will include: (1) a greater understanding of the fundamental theories and applications of vibrational spectroscopy and (2) the further development of critical-thinking and research skills. Our long term goals are to develop multidisciplinary programs in the sciences and the development and dissemination of a national model for the implementation of Raman spectroscopy throughout the undergraduate science curriculum. \r\n",
