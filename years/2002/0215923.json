 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Mark Guiltinan (#0215923)\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to Pennsylvania State University under the direction of Dr. Mark Guiltinan to develop a Plant Growth Facility consisting of six growth chambers and a small greenhouse. The facility center will provide a physical home for the graduate programs, and an organizing role for the enhancement of Plant Sciences research, teaching and outreach programs.\r\nThe objectives of the center will be to: provide state-of-the-art research facilities for a core group of resident plant scientists, including current faculty and new hires; provide collaborative space in the new building to members of the Plant Science Center; develop and enhance collaborative interactions among plant scientists and with researchers\r\nin other fields, at Penn State and elsewhere; improve the Plant Physiology and Ecological and Molecular Plant Physiology graduate education programs, and; develop outreach programs for the general public and for pre-college students.\r\n\r\nThis center will support research in plant sciences for diverse studies, but will be particularly important to the growing number of plant scientists using the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana. The completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequence, along with major new funding programs in plant genomics at the NSF and USDA,\r\nhave brought us to a new era in plant research, requiring high throughput facilities for functional analysis of genes. \r\n\r\nPenn State has made a priority effort to enhance the life sciences; enhancement of the Plant Sciences Center will help us move forward on this path, by providing necessary facilities and maximizing laboratory space in the main building. This will in turn help to attract top faculty candidates who will be concerned about availability of such facilities. The facility will provide for the first time, an interdisciplinary, inter-college facility for high quality environmental growth of plants to support the many plant scientists at Penn State. It will also serve our teaching and outreach programs, providing a facility available to all for the growth of plants.\r\n",
