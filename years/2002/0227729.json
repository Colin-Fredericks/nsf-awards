The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners include the University of Maine at Machias (Lead Institution), Downeast Institute for Applied Marine Research  & Education, Sunrise County Economic Council, Eastern Maine Development Corporation, Town of Bealls, Carver Shellfish Inc, Washington County Commissioners, Maine Aquaculture Innovation Center, Cobscook Bay Resource Center, The Nature Conservatory, Maine Department of Marine Resources, Maine State Planning Office, and Maine Science & Technology Foundation.  The goals of the program are to produce a significant increase in applied marine research and technology transfer leading to commercialization of products and processes, and to increase the numbers of people from eastern Maine enrolled in associate and baccalaureate degree programs at the University of Maine at Machias preparing them for the new workforce in marine technologies.  To accomplish these goals new faculty positions will be created in the areas of marine ecology, marine biology, and natural resource economics. Research facilities for marine research will be installed.  Positions for managers to enable technology transfer and commercialization are being established at the university.\r\n\r\nMore than 40% of the households in the region have incomes less than $20,000 annually.  The economy of the region relies very heavily on renewable marine resources.  Marine aquaculture has a huge potential to revitalize the regional economy given increased research and education/training to provide the technological and business support as well as the trained workforce for start-up companies. The participation of underrepresented minority students in the program will be increased through several currently existing programs, such as Alliance for Minority Participation Program, McNair Scholars Program, Bridges to the Baccalaureate Program, and affiliate programs with the University of Puerto Rico.\r\n",
