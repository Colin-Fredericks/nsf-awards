 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe goal of this dissemination project is to develop a model public service ad campaign\r\nthat will advance the participation of women and girls in SMET through effecting a\r\npositive shift in attitudes among parents, educators, students and others in the community\r\nregarding girls' pursuit of interests / careers in SMET. The projects lead institution is \r\nStony Brook University and collaborating organizations / institutions include the Long \r\nIsland Fund for Women and Girls, Briarcliffe College, and television stations WLIW21 (PBS) \r\nand WLNY55.\r\n\r\nThis informal education project will develop a series of dynamic television spots, to be\r\ndisseminated through local television broadcasts and through online links. The target \r\naudienceconsists of parents, educators and other authority figures, as well as peers, who \r\nhave a great deal of influence over young peoples' perceptions of their educational and \r\nfuture professional options. Spots will reflect research findings that illustrate current\r\ngender inequities in SMET education and careers, and \"de-bunk\" some of the commonly \r\naccepted beliefs regarding gender-related causes for these disparities; information \r\nabout often ignored or unremarked historical and current contributions of women in\r\nSMET; and national statistics on professional shortages in the SMET\r\nemployment pool.\r\n\r\nThis video campaign will attempt to re-shape public attitudes regarding the gender\r\nappropriateness of girls' SMET pursuits. Using psychosocial research as a guide, the\r\nproject will disseminate information in ways that may directly alter attitudes among\r\nindividuals in the targeted groups, as well as encourage new behaviors that may then\r\ntrigger compensatory attitude changes. This is a novel approach which combines\r\ntechnology-based applications, marketing strategies, and psychosocial research to target \r\nchange in specific underlying public attitudes that hinder the participation of girls and\r\nyoung women in SMET.",
