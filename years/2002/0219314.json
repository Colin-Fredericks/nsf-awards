 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops time-domain solvers for wave propagation problems\r\nin two and three dimensions, with fundamentally improved properties,\r\nnamely, significantly reduced sampling requirements and, at the same\r\ntime, significantly higher accuracy.  Such solvers would allow modeling\r\nof linear and, eventually, nonlinear wave propagation in domains that\r\nare thousands of characteristic wavelengths in size, with interfaces and\r\nvariable coefficients.  This approach would also provide improved bases\r\nfor solving nonlinear advection-diffusion problems.  The solvers are\r\nbuilt upon two new techniques, namely, optimal quadratures to represent\r\nbandlimited functions, and a numerical generalization of separation of\r\nvariables to accelerate applying higher-dimensional operators.  Each\r\ntechnique contains the potential to significantly advance computational\r\nscience across a wide range of applications.  Together they provide a\r\nnew paradigm that efficiently organizes the information contained in\r\noperators governing physical phenomena.  This project develops these\r\ntechniques further, and develops multiresolution representations for\r\noperators and functions, based on the optimal quadratures.\r\n\r\nAny computational modeling of natural phenomena requires discretization\r\nof the underlying mathematical equations. This project addresses\r\nquestions of optimality and efficiency of such discretizations, and of\r\norganization of information for two important modeling areas, wave\r\npropagation and geophysical fluid dynamics.  This research aims to\r\ngenerate a much wider use of efficient techniques for representing\r\ninformation in scientific modeling, and to increase the speed and\r\naccuracy of simulations by up to two orders of magnitude, with\r\nforeseeable benefits to such areas as seismology, remote sensing,\r\nacoustics, optics, geophysical fluid dynamics, and quantum chemistry. It\r\nwould reduce the computational cost of obtaining high accuracy, which is\r\nnecessary to describe phenomena that are highly sensitive to changes in\r\nphysical parameters, and that often cause technological bottlenecks.\r\nThis Collaborative Research is led by the Department of Applied\r\nMathematics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and includes the\r\nDepartment of Meteorology at the University of Maryland at College\r\nPark.  It will fund one research associate, two visiting scientists from\r\nUMD and Ohio University, and one graduate student in a diverse research\r\ngroup that includes a research associate, two postdoctoral researchers,\r\na graduate student, and four undergraduate students.\r\n",
