 "awd_abstract_narration": "0218629\r\nLong\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is focused on an innovative approach to develop radiation systems for wireless networks in which the antennas are effectively indiscernible in their local environment.  It seeks to examine how both exterior and interior parts of existing buildings and structures might be used as transmitting and receiving systems for various wireless applications. The major issues that must be solved to successfully develop antenna systems that are essentially invisible, include understanding :\r\n\r\nhow to effectively excite existing structures\r\nhow to examine their basic radiation properties\r\nhow to predict their radiated fields\r\nhow to control their radiation characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn some cases minor modifications may have to be made to the existing structures, but the visual and structural impact of such actions would be minimal.  \r\n\r\nPossible candidates for investigation include flashing and gutters around the tops of buildings, lightning protection systems, metallic window frames, building supports, power lines and supports, portions of existing towers and billboards, metal roofs or cupolas, portions of the metal structure interior to a building, and non-structural conductors such as door frames and ceiling tile support grids.\r\n\r\nThe initial phase of the proposed research program will address the following tasks:\r\n\r\ndevelopment of appropriate feeding and matching techniques\r\nevaluation of the radiation properties for the proposed radiation elements\r\ninvestigation of the use of perturbing materials and modifications of the structures for\r\ncurrent and pattern control\r\n\r\nThe impact of the successful implementation of such antenna systems on the world of telecommunications should be most significant. The final results of the proposed study should provide essential information on the feasibility of using existing structures as effective radiators, as well as providing preliminary tools and procedures for the design of this new class of antenna systems.\r\n",
