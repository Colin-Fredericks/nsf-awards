 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nThis project is developing a new long-term experimental site that will serve as a focus for undergraduate ecology at East Carolina University (ECU). The ecology laboratory required for biology majors has been based on a series of outdated \"cookbook\" experiments and field trips, and lacked opportunities for investigative learning. We are developing a course that has relevance and value for all biology students at ECU, the majority of whom will pursue careers in health or biotechnology. We are modeling our project after a successful project at Southern Illinois University, and taking advantage of ECU's recent acquisition of 600 acres of land near campus. The project has three educational objectives: 1) to enhance learning of ecological\r\nconcepts; 2) to teach skills in data management and analysis; and 3) to promote an understanding of ecological principles that will inform students as future citizens. The sites illustrate important processes in community ecology that can be observed only on a long time scale. The accumulation of a valuable long-term data set will provide a wealth of opportunities for students to explore tools for data management and interpretation. We are working with the students to present and publish the data, and develop a nationally accessible website for the project (linked to the ESA website). Once the sites are established, we will encourage other ECU faculty, other North Carolina universities, and local K-12 schools to participate in the project.",
