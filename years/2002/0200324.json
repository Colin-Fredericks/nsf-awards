 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop novel nanocomposite foams, based on a combination of nanoparticle technology and supercritical fluids (SCF) technology.  With proper design of the nanoparticle type, content, dispersion, an orientation, the solubility of SCF in the polymer matrix, the rheological properties of nanoparticle containing polymer, and nucleation and foam growth mechanism can be tailored to generate a wide spectrum of foams with well-defined pore structure.  They include closed or open cellular structures; macro, mire, and nano-cellular foams.  The presence of nanoparticles can provide improved mechanical strength and physical properties, such as diffusion barrier and fire retardance, that are essential for many engineering applications.  The large surface area of nanoparticles may also serve as templates for added functions to the polymer foams.  Examples are bioactive molecules such as growth factors to facilitate cell growth in tissue engineering, an electric or magnetic conductive molecules for EMI shielding.\r\n\r\nThis project decribes a scientific effort at developing environmentally benign technology in direct response to regulatory action.  In order to remain viable and compete in the construction industry of the twenty-first century, industries producing polymeric foam products have no choice but to operate in an ecologically conscious manner.  Education impact and recruitment of underrepresented minorities is addressed through collaboration between the Center for Advanced Polymer and Composite Engineering at The Ohio State University and Florida A& M University - FSU.  By combining expertise in foam production from industry with thermodynamics, rheology, and polymer processing in academia, this project demonstrates the potential for rapid development of this alternative blowing agent.\r\n",
