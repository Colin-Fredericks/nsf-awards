It is well known that the collections \r\nof invariant probability measures and closed invariant \r\nsets for hyperbolic maps or flows is very large; remarkably,\r\nin many dynamical systems of algebraic origin where there \r\nare two (or more) commuting hyperbolic maps or flows it is \r\nconjectured that there are actually very few measures or \r\nclosed sets invariant under this bigger action. Despite (or \r\nperhaps because of) important contributions by several \r\nauthors, the mystery of this rigidity property of \r\nmultidimensional actions is still one of the central problems \r\nin modern ergodic theory.While seemingly unrelated, the \r\nmethodology of the study of rigidity of multiparameter actions \r\nis very suitable to study the arithmetical case of the Quantum \r\nUnique Ergodicity Conjecture, regarding the limit of the \r\nspatial distribution of a free particle on certain manifolds \r\nin a quantum steady state as the energy of the state tends to\r\ninfinity (the semiclassical limit).  This question has been \r\nconsidered previously by many authors mostly using tools from \r\nanalytic number theory; the approach proposed, using the \r\ndynamical approach, is new and has already borne fruits.\r\n\r\nThe theory of dynamical systems gives tools to study complex \r\nsystems, for example the evolution of a complicated deterministic\r\nprocess over time. There is a rich and distinguished tradition \r\nof using these powerful tools in other mathematical disciplines, \r\nmost notably in number theory and combinatorics. The research \r\nproposed is connected to several of the most exciting possible \r\napplications, including new implications to the theory of \r\nquantum chaos in mathematical physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
