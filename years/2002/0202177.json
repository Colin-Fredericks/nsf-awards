In particular, methyl isoborneol (MIB) and geosmin impart musty tastes and odors to drinking water even when they occur at concentrations as low as 5-10 parts per trillion;  although these compounds pose no health risks, their presence invariably causes complaints and safety concerns among consumers.  Activated carbon adsorption offers an important approach for removing geosmin, MIB and other odorants.   The research will be conducted in three sequential tasks: (1) fundamentals-oriented bench scale testing, including methane-steam thermal treatments of the carbon with characterization of diffusion rates versus reaction rates during thermal treatment, (2) coordination with pilot-scale manufacture of the tailored GAC and (3) pilot scale evaluation at a municipal water treatment facility.  The research will test the hypothesis that, using a methane-steam heat treatment process, increased odorant removal corresponds to increased pore volume, decreased surface acidity and increased graphene plane elongation. If successful, this project will result in activated carbons tailored to the effective removal of MIB, geosmin and other organic compounds.  This project is supported under the GOALI program of NSF; the PIs will work closely with NORIT Americas, Inc. in the developmental work and with the Passaic Valley Water Commission (NJ) in the pilot-scale evaluations.",
