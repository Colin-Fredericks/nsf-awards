 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) With its capability of visualization and manipulation at atomic and molecular\r\nlevels, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has become one of the most important\r\nadvancements in science and technology in the past decade. This project is adapting and integrating\r\nSPM into a two-semester Electron Microscopy (EM) course that has been taught at the\r\nUniversity of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC). The addition of SPM instrumentation to\r\nthe course gives students a broader view and experience on the cutting edge\r\nmicroscopy technologies. The integration also allows a more efficient approach in\r\nteaching the subject, because the course covers a wider range of techniques used in\r\nmicroscopy and emphasizes the application of these techniques in various fields. The\r\nimprovement of the course is being achieved by introducing, in addition to the existing\r\nhands-on experiments on EM, two verification-type experiments using SPM to visualize\r\natomic structures on well-defined crystalline surfaces in the first semester. This is\r\nfollowed, in the second semester, by three inquiry-based experiments that involve both\r\nSPM and EM. The improved course enhances the interdisciplinary education\r\nin science, mathematics, engineering and technology at UMKC.",
