 "awd_abstract_narration": "This joint Chemistry Division and Physics Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Oregon.  Geraldine Richmond is the site's Program Director. Twelve faculty members from the Departments of Physics, and Chemistry will serve as REU student mentors.  Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program.  Selection of the participants is based on a strong background in both chemistry and physics.  A special effort is made to recruit female and minority applicants using contacts with science programs at several women's colleges, at historically black colleges and at institutions where there is a higher percentage of Chicanos and Native American students.  This is an interdisciplinary Chemistry/Physics research program.  Students and research mentors participate in a collective program that includes research seminars, weekly meetings, social activities and follow-up activities after students return to their home institutions.  At the end of the program students present their research in an oral presentation and provide a written report.  At the closing of the summer, the students complete an evaluation.  All participants are tracked after they leave the program.\r\n",
