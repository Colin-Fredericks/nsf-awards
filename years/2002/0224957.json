The population of this southernmost of emperor\r\npenguin colonies, although sometimes fluctuating radically, had steadily grown in past\r\nyears, with as many as 1200 chicks counted. This probably represented an adult\r\npopulation of 2400-3000 birds. However, in 2001, after B-15 ground into the Cape\r\nCrozier area during the winter breeding period, no live emperor chicks were found. The\r\ncolony had disappeared. The goal of this project is to determine if the colony will re-\r\nestablish itself at Cape Crozier or relocate nearby to a different site. If the colony\r\nreestablishes at Cape Crozier, we will estimate the previous year's loss with a census of\r\nthe chicks present this year. The destruction of the colony site by the iceberg in 2001\r\nrepresents a natural experiment to examine the resilience of breeding emperors to short\r\nterm disasters. Broader impacts of this study are related to the historical importance and\r\nworldwide interest in this colony as it was the first emperor colony discovered, and has\r\nprobably the longest census record of any penguin colony.",
