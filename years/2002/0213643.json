 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is part of a larger project involving a survey of a random sample of contributors to each of the nine candidates who raised over five million dollars before July 31, 2000 and who sought either of the two major party nominations.  This survey is the first of its kind to include both large ($200 and more) and small (under $200) donors.   \r\n\r\nThe main theses being investigated involve the representativeness of the contributor pool as a subsample of the public, the impacts of candidate and contributor attitudes on the contribution decision, and the motivations for contributor' political activism.  The central theoretical claims of the research promise to enhance substantially our understanding of this topic.\r\n\r\nThese funds allow the investigators to ensure that the completed questionnaires that they have received can be coded promptly, facilitating timely analysis of the data.\r\nThe dataset to be produced will be of significant interest to numerous scholars interested in this topic.\r\n",
