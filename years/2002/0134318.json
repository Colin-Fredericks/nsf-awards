 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n--------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research component of this proposal deals with the study of \r\nsolutions to certain non-linear systems of Partial Differential\r\nEquations  which arise in connections with the geometry of \r\nCarnot-Caratheodory spaces. More precisely, we will study the \r\nsharp regularity of solutions to quasilinear subelliptic \r\nsystems, and apply the results to the theory of quasi-regular \r\nmaps in Carnot groups and in more general spaces. \r\nWe will study critical points of the energy for maps with \r\ntarget in the Heisenberg group and with domain in a Riemannian \r\nmanifold or in the  Minkowski space.\r\nThe analysis of boundary value problems for sub-elliptic \r\noperators, and the  study of qualitative and quantitative \r\nproperties of solutions of some  non-divergence form non-linear \r\nequations, are also part of this proposal.\r\nThe educational component of this proposal is centered around \r\nthe creation of Integrated Research Groups, in which \r\nundergraduate and graduate students work on basic research \r\nprojects supervised by the PI. One of thegoals of this \r\nactivity is the dissemination of information, through a \r\nweb-based data-base, seminars, and publications. \r\n\r\nPartial differential equations are used to provide a \r\nmathematical model for  real-life phenomena, such as \r\nchemical reactions, force-fields or conductivity. Such models\r\nallow both to better understand the phenomena and to try to \r\nforecast the future behavior of the system under study.   \r\nRoughly speaking, smooth solutions to PDE's correspond to \r\nsystems which can be  well understood and modeled. The study \r\nof regularity of solutions consists in finding smooth solutions.\r\nThe equations described in this proposal appear in the study of\r\nmotion under constraints (as in Robot arms motion),\r\nand in the study of diffusion in a non isotropic  media.\r\n",
