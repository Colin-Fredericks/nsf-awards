 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sophisticated experimental studies of several classes of layered materials, as well as recent advances in the fabrication and characterization of nanostructures such as quantum dots and wires, require a deeper theoretical understanding of strongly correlated electronic systems.  Realistic descriptions of aqueous actinide complexes also require the treatment of strong corelations in ways that go beyond the usual methods of quantum chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis theoretical research will employ a combination of systematic analytical and numerical methods to establish phase diagrams, to study far-from-eqilibrium dynamics, and to study charge-transfer in complex materials.  The role of strong electronic correlations will be investigated in three different electronic systems: layered materials such as the cuprate high temperature and organic superconductors, and quantum antiferromagnets; quantum many-body theory far-from-equilibrium as seen recently in the Kondo effect in quantum dots and Luttinger liquid behavior in quantum wires; and, aqueous plutonium complexes as found in nuclear waste.\r\n%%%\r\nThis is a broad-based theoretical program with the common thread that all critically involve electrons which interact strongly.  This calls for new and powerful techniques.  The problems chosen are diverse and range from the physics of high temperature superconductors to the chemistry of nuclear waste materials.\r\n*** \r\n",
