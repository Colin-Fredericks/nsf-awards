Proposed is a system that operates on an input sequence of calibrated and uncalibrated 3D range and 2D image data. The system will segment the range and color images, extract their features, establish topological relationships between features, and derive global topological relationships between features in the final 3D geometric model. The whole process will be fully automated except for the range-to-image registration process that requires minimal user interaction. The expected output consists of a complete photorealistic model of the scene. The resulting 3D models will be utilized in geospatial; the acquired data will also be used for teaching purposes in CS and Geography departments. Aided by the Center of the Analysis and Research of Spatial Information (CARSI), urban areas of downtown New York and the interior of Grand Central Station in Manhattan are being used as testbeds.\r\n",
