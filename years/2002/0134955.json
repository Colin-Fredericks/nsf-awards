Within this\r\nframework, the research component of this work will focus on three\r\nfundamental problems in physics: the Garrett-Munk spetrum of internal\r\nwaves in the ocean, finite-flux spectra in semiconductors with\r\napplications to semiconductor lasers, and Bose Einstein condensates.\r\nIn each case, novel weak-turbulence-inspired techniques will be\r\ndeveloped to compute the stationary energy spectra of the phenomena\r\nunder investigation, which will provide an analytic statistical\r\ndescription of their long-term dynamics.  Applications of this work\r\ninclude environmental aspects of ocean dynamics, semiconductor\r\nmanufacturing and increases in laser efficiency, and condensed-matter\r\nphysics and materials science at low temperatures.  The educational\r\ncomponent includes course development on undergraduate and graduate\r\nlevel that will incorporate an experimental component in an\r\nundergraduate mathematical modelling course, and a graduate course on\r\nwaves and weak turbulence theory.\r\n\r\nWhat do internal waves deep below the ocean surface, semiconductor\r\nlasers, and extremely cold metallic vapors have in common?  They are\r\nall very complicated physical systems composed of simple components\r\nthat interact weakly.  Weak turbulence theory addresses these type of\r\nsystems, and precdicts how the energy they contain will behave on\r\naverage over long times.  The question of how the energy of an\r\ninternal ocean wave depends on this wave's length has an elegant\r\nexperimental answer pointing to a universal law, but has eluded\r\ntheoretical explanation for more than thirty years.  This work aims to\r\nprovide such an explanation, which will furnish new insights into the\r\noceanic environment.  Semiconductors and semiconductor lasers\r\nmanufacturing and operation requires ever increasing efficiency.  This\r\nwork will explore an improvement that is based on a more efficient way\r\nof delivering energy to the working semiconductors and semiconductor\r\nlasers.  Three quarters of a century ago Bose and Einstein predicted a\r\nnew phase of materials, the Bose-Einstein condensate, that can only\r\noccur at extremely low temperatures.  Finally, six years ago, this\r\nphase was realized experimentally, and the the creators of the\r\nexperiment received this year's Nobel Prize.  This work will provide a\r\ntheoretical explanation of how extremely cold metal vapors settle into\r\nthe Bose-Einstein condensate phase.\r\n\r\n\r\nDate: December 17, 2001\r\n",
