The award, together with other funding, will provide\r\ntravel support for some of the speakers and for some participants who do not\r\nhave funds available through other source, with priority given to graduate\r\nstudents, recent Ph.D.'s, minorities and women. As part of the conference, a\r\nLecture Series on Clifford Algebras and Applications aimed at graduate students\r\nand recent Ph.D.'s will be presented on May 18 and 19, 2002.\r\n\r\nThe 6th Conference will be sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the\r\nAmerican Mathematical Society, the International Society for Analysis, its\r\nApplications and Computation (ISAAC), University of Arkansas, George Mason\r\nUniversity, and the Tennessee Technological University.  The organizers of the\r\nconference look for interaction among mathematicians, scientists and engineers.\r\nThe conference will include the following speakers, five sessions, six 90 minute\r\nlectures, and other activities:\r\n\r\nSpeakers: Christian Bar, Helga Baum, Carlos A. Berenstein, Michael Eastwood, Bertfried\r\nFauser, Alexander J. Hahn, Jacques Helmstetter, David Hestenes, Tadeusz Iwaniec,\r\nJan J. Koenderink, Bertram Kostant, Heinz Kruger, Anthony Lasenby, Shahn Majid,\r\nMichael McCarthy, Marius Mitrea, Victor Nistor, Tao Qian, Lee Smolin, Joseph\r\nVarilly, S.L. Woronowicz, Sijue Wu\r\n\r\nSessions:\r\n\r\n- Clifford analysis (Dirac operators, Wavelets, non-linear transformations,\r\nHarmonic analysis/Fourier analysis, Singular integral operators, Discrete\r\npotential theory, Initial value and boundary value problems)\r\n\r\n- Geometry (Geometric index theory, Conformal and noncommutative geometry,\r\nGeometric integral transforms, Spin structures and Dirac operators,    Twistors,\r\ntractors, and related topics, Invariant differential operators, Quaternionic\r\ngeometry)\r\n\r\n- Mathematical structures (Hopf algebras and quantum groups, Category theory,\r\nstructural methods, Quadratic forms, Hermitian forms, Witt groups, Clifford\r\nalgebras over arbitrary fields, Lie algebras, spinor representations,\r\nexceptional Lie algebras, super Lie algebras, Clifford algebras and their\r\ngeneralizations, Infinite dimensional Clifford algebras and Clifford bundles)\r\n\r\n- Physics (Perturbative renormalization and Hopf algebra antipodes, Spectral\r\ntriples and elementary particle physics, q-deformations and noncommutative\r\nspacetime, Quantum Field Theory using Hopf algebras and other algebraic\r\ntechniques, Spin foams and quantum gravity, Quaternionic quantum mechanics and\r\nquantum fields, Dirac equation in electron physics, Electrodynamics,\r\nNon-associative structures, octonions, division algebras and their applications\r\nin physics)\r\n\r\n- Applications in computer science, robotics, engineering (Quantum computers,\r\nerror correction, algorithms, Robotics,  inverse kinematics, space control,\r\nnavigation, cybernetics, image processing and engineering, Neural networks)\r\n\r\nLectures on Clifford Algebras and Applications (May 18 and 19, 2002):\r\n\r\nLecture 1: Introduction to Clifford algebras (Pertti Lounesto)\r\nLecture 2: Mathematical structure of Clifford algebras (Ian R. Porteous)\r\nLecture 3: Clifford analysis (John Ryan)\r\nLecture 4: Clifford algebras in mathematical physics (Heinz Kruger)\r\nLecture 5: Clifford algebras in engineering (Jon Selig)\r\nLecture 6: Clifford algebras in differential geometry (Tom Branson)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, poster session, round table discussion, and book exhibits are also\r\nplanned. The organizers expect to recruit two additional speakers.  Further\r\n information is available at\r\nhttp://math.tntech.edu/rafal/cookeville/cookeville.html.\r\n",
