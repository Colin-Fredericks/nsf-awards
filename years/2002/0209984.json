 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tourism is a major industry in the world, and poorer countries have invested resources in developing tourist attractions to showcase their natural environment to wealthy tourists. This dissertation research proposal by a cultural anthropology student investigates the impact of one such project in Huatulco, Oaxaca, Mexico, on the lives of local residents. The study will investigate three broad questions: how the direction of public resources to the tourist infrastructure affects local residents' perceptions of the resources available to them; how the redirection of resources towards tourism development and the growing tourist presence has changed the actual and expected standard of living for local residents; and how emigration is perceived by local residents as a strategy to accommodate expectations of higher living standards that may have been thwarted by tourism development.  The methods include participant observation, semi-structured interviews, the analysis of social networks, and the collection of household histories. Aside from contributing to the education of a young social scientists, this research will advance our understanding of the sources of Mexican migration to the US, and the social as well as economic costs and benefits of tourism development.",
