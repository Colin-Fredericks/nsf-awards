 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports improvements in the capability and reliability of the X-ray diffraction laboratory used for study of single crystals of biological macromolecules at Purdue University. The equipment to be obtained with this support will be used for in research aimed at determination of the three-dimensional crystal structures of proteins, RNA molecules, and of protein-nucleic acid complexes. Knowledge of such structures are essential to molecular level understanding of how biological macromolecules function in a variety of processes.  Three types of equipment will be obtained: a new diffraction instrument that will improve throughput and, by providing a more monochromatic and intense X-ray beam, that will facilitate the study of very large macromolecules. The new instrument will allow flash-frozen crystals to be saved in their frozen state for later diffraction experiments. A new optical system for an existing diffraction instrument will improve the intensity and quality of the X-ray beam, permitting more pricise measurements and use of smaller crystals than now possible. Finally a new microspectrophotometer will be obtained to monitor enzymatic reactions and measure ligand binding of crystalline macromolecules. The award provides improved infrastructure for one of the nation's leading academic laboratories in one of the most important areas of contemporary biology.",
