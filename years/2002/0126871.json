 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61)\r\nExperiments that utilize optical spectroscopic methods adapted from the literature are being introduced in a coordinated fashion into four teaching laboratories as a means of increasing student understanding of interactions of light and matter. Students measure the absorbance and fluorescence of metalloporphyrins in a freshman-level inorganic chemistry laboratory. They characterize protein-DNA interactions, DNA-ligand thermodynamics and kinetics, and protein unfolding equilibrium and kinetics in upper-level biochemistry and chemistry laboratories using absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy. In one laboratory course, students develop and test their own hypothesis for a well-defined biophysical problem. Web-based teaching tools are being developed and implemented to enhance and monitor student learning. Instrumentation to facilitate these activities include a UV-visible spectrophotometer, two scanning fluorometers (with computers/printers), and a rapid-mixing accessory for stopped-flow kinetics for dedicated use in the undergraduate teaching laboratories. This project is being assessed by an advisory board of chemistry and biology faculty and a teaching and learning specialist.\r\n",
