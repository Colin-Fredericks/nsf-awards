If such a map expands some\r\ncohomology class of the manifold, then the main idea is that there ought\r\nto be a distinguished invariant current representing this class.\r\nIntersections between  invariant currents should in turn give rise to\r\ninvariant measures that describe the distribution of orbits where the\r\naction of the map is most complicated.  Hence the linear action of a\r\nmeromorphic map on cohomology should go a long way toward determining a\r\nprobabilistic picture of the pointwise dynamics of the map.  To justify \r\nthese ideas, the investigator proposes to use a combination of techniques\r\nfrom complex geometry, smooth ergodic theory, and pluripotential\r\nanalysis.  Various problems in physics and mathematics reduce to questions\r\nabout the dynamics of particular meromorphic maps.  The investigator\r\nproposes to use some of these as starting points and test cases for his\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nThe study of dynamical systems has grown increasingly important in the\r\npast several decades.  Put briefly, a dynamical system is anything--e.g. \r\nthe weather, the stock-market, the solar system, etc--that evolves in\r\ntime according (at least theoretically) to definite and codifiable rules.\r\nThe general goal in studying a dynamical system is to make predictions\r\nabout its future state given its present one.  If the future is very\r\nfar off then this, as any honest forecaster will admit, is typically quite \r\ndifficult.  Small changes in the present state of the system can imply \r\nhuge differences in eventual outcome.  The research proposed here is\r\ndevoted to better understanding instability in dynamical systems--when\r\nit occurs, why it occurs, and how to recognize it.  The research is also\r\ndevoted to attaining partial control over instability by making\r\nstatistical predictions about the eventual behavior of an unstable system\r\nthat do not depend on perfect understanding of its present state.  The\r\ndynamical systems that the investigator proposes to study are mathematical\r\nin nature, but they are also archtypes for the systems that one analyzes\r\nin connection with real-world phenomena.  The idea is that weather and\r\nthe stockmarket and the solar system ought not be treated as a separate\r\nand totally unrelated dynamical systems but as particular examples\r\nof the same general phenomena and subject to similar kinds of analyses.\r\n\r\n**********************************\r\n\r\n",
