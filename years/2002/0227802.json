The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060). The partners include the Drexel University (Lead Institution), University of Pennsylvania, SAP America, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Philadelphia area high schools, and The City of Philadelphia.  The proposed goals are: (1) creating theoretical and methodological knowledge and innovation in the area of business intelligence, (2) spurring product innovation within the participating private sectors information technology forms, and (3) educational innovations by creating business intelligence related training and educational programs for students at the high school and college levels. The program focuses on basic research, methodology, knowledge creation and documentation. Business intelligence curriculum of 3-5 courses with input from the private sector partners is being developed. Methodologies and toolsets for business intelligence are being prepared and documented. The methodologies developed are being applied to specific projects in management in the City of Philadelphia government.  The high school curriculum will be evaluated and assessed after the first year and will then be disseminated to other high schools. \r\n\r\nThe development and application of business intelligence methodology to management of local government and private sector partners will make them more efficient.  The methodology and software will be available for other government and private sectors once it has been shown to be efficacious. In addition, workforce training using the business intelligence methodology will prepare graduates for higher paying jobs in the information economy. \r\n",
