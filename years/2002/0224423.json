The following projects will benefit from the instrumentation:\r\n\r\nHaptic Rendering of Complex Contact States and Compliant Motion and \r\nCooperative Virtual Object Manipulation. \r\n\r\nThe former is concerned with how to simulate and render, with high fidelity and in real time, the effect felt by a human operator due to the contacts involving the part he/she holds and other parts during manual assembly in a virtual environment. The device will enable a human operator to feel the resulted collision and reaction forces and torques to test the quality and fidelity of simulation. The latter project is concerned with how to simulate, again with high fidelity and real time, the cooperative manipulation process of physical objects in a virtual world via haptic devices. With full force and torque display from the device, the collaborative parties can obtain the necessary cues for effective coordination. This project provides the opportunity for cross-discipline collaboration between the PIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
