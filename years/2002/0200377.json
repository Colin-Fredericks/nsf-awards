 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant award is the first step toward the setting up of the Center for Experimental Research in Computer Systems (CERCS) seeks to address complex communication/computation systems by bringing together researchers with knowledge of the key technologies underlying these systems, and thereby, create research teams that can address future systems and applications in a fashion that is integrated across multiple technologies and heterogeneous system components.  The mission of CERCS is to develop new hardware and software technologies, to create technological advances, and to take advantage of these advances to remove technological barriers faced by complex, integrated systems.\r\n\r\nThe CERCS approach is experimental and fosters research in which new technologies are evaluated experimentally, with large-scale applications and on systems of substantial size or complexity.  The aim is to understand the challenging application requirements that cause novel system-level research, where insights at the system level motivate changes in how certain applications are implemented, and where new system technologies enable new classes of applications.  The Center will work with external partners to comprehend their needs and requirements, and to experiment with alternative solutions and approaches.\r\n",
