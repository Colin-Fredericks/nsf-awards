 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a terahertz (FHz) wave microscope for microscopic sensing and imaging applications. A THz pulse (T-ray) contains information for both sensing and imaging applications. Biological and organic compounds have distinct signatures within the THz region of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as molecular vibrational and rotational levels, and their chemical compositions can be examined by this proposed T-ray system. This T-ray microscope is capable of sensing and imaging structures at the cell level with a 0.5-p.m spatial resolution (1/1000 of one THz wavelength), and it is an exciting new way to carry out research projects for biomolecular spectroscopy and T-ray imaging.\r\n\r\nThe microscope will generate and detect picosecond electromagnetic pulses (T-ray signal) by using nonlinear optical crystals, ultrafast laser pulses and computer analysis. To overcome the wavelength diffraction-limit, this approach uses a near-field imaging modality by focusing the optical beams into an electro-optic crystal to generate (by optical rectification) and detect (by the electro-optic effect) the T-ray to a sub-micron resolution. The imaging area of the biomedical tissue, which is attached to the top of the electro-optic crystal, is comparable to the optical focal spot, and is independent of the THz beam wavelength. This microscope will have a superior throughput of THz radiation when compared to any other T-ray microscope. Moreover, this device will make significant contributions to student education, academic research, instrumentation development, and medical sensing and imaging applications.\r\n",
