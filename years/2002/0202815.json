 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knessl\r\n0202815\r\n     The investigator, together with colleagues and students,\r\nstudies a variety of problems in computer science, information\r\ntheory, and applied probability.  These have the common feature\r\nthat they can be reduced to solving recursion or differential\r\nequations.  Sometimes these equations can be solved exactly using\r\ntransform methods.  Then one can obtain asymptotic information by\r\nexpanding the results using methods such as the Laplace or saddle\r\npoint methods, the Euler-Maclaurin and Poisson summation\r\nformulas, Watson transformations, etc.  Many applied problems of\r\ninterest (especially nonlinear ones) cannot be solved exactly.\r\nFor these the investigator and colleagues develop appropriate\r\nasymptotic techniques that analyze directly the governing\r\nequations.  These are variants of applied mathematics methods,\r\nsuch as WKB expansions and matched asymptotic expansions.  The\r\nlatter are especially useful for asymptotic problems that involve\r\nseveral different scales.  The focus is on problems in\r\ncombinatorics, data compression, analysis of algorithms, digital\r\nand binary trees, queuing, and coding.\r\n     Computers play a progressively greater role in all of our\r\nlives.  Important problems in computer science include sorting and\r\nsearching, efficient data storage, and data compression.  To\r\ndecide on what is a good method to search out a given item in\r\nsome database, or a good method for storing music or video with\r\nminimal use of memory, it is important to analyze the method or\r\nalgorithm.  For example, one might ask for the average search\r\ntime, or for the likelihood that the search time will be very\r\nlong, exceeding some prescribed tolerance.  Such questions involve\r\nthe \"analysis of algorithms.\"   They can frequently be reduced to\r\nsolving certain classes of equations.  The investigator and\r\ncolleagues develop mathematical tools for obtaining solutions of\r\nthese equations, either exact ones or accurate approximations.\r\nApproximations are often sufficient, because for example the\r\nsearching problem is most important if the total number of items\r\nstored is very large.  This \"largeness\" shows up as a parameter in\r\nthe governing equation that facilitates its solution.  Related\r\nmathematical problems arise in other important areas such as\r\nmolecular biology and communications, and the investigators'\r\nmethods and results should thus find applicability to a wide\r\nrange of problems.\r\n",
