 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the National Science Foundation, provides support for a research-planning workshop for Antarctic lithospheric research. The workshop, entitled \"The Structure and Evolution of the Antarctic Plate (SEAP) 2003 Workshop,\" will be held in Boulder, Colorado, between March 3 and 5, 2003. There are five principal purposes for the workshop:(1) to highlight outstanding scientific problems for the next 10 years concerning the structure and evolution of the Antarctic Plate;(2) to discuss the feasibility of an ambitious initiative in the Austral geosciences, seen as the next generation of earth-based geophysical instrumentation on Antarctica and on and beneath the Austral seas, with primary emphasis on the broad-band seismic component ''Antarctic-Array'');(3) to identify auxiliary program needs to complement Antarctic-Array, in particular the roles of marine geology/geophysics and geodynamical modeling;(4) to discuss the relationship to other research initiatives that have originated both within (e.g., REVEAL, ANDRILL, ANTEC) and outside of the traditional Antarctic geoscience community; and (5) to develop a preliminary SEAP science plan. The workshop is expected to draw participants from both the US and international research communities. A report of the workshop will be produced within a few months after the workshop concludes.",
