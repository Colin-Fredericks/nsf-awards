 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective processes are of fundamental importance to manufacturing,\r\ngovernment, engineering, and management.  In all of these areas greater\r\nunderstanding and control of key processes can lead to improved\r\neffectiveness.   For the past 15 years, it has also been recognized that\r\nprocesses are fundamental to software development, and that effective\r\ncontrol of processes can lead to similar benefits, such as improved\r\nunderstanding, coordination, efficiency, and automation.  It has been hoped\r\nthat this would lead to reductions in software development cost,\r\nimprovements in software product quality, and reductions in software\r\ndevelopment time.  Our hypothesis is that progress towards these goals can\r\nbe speeded by establishing a scientific basis upon which to build the\r\nprocess technologies that will support more effective software production.\r\nThis research project will lead to the development of needed improvements\r\nto the Little-JIL process definition language, and the Juliette\r\ninterpreter.   These improvements will be validated by programming  and\r\nrunning multiuser, iterative software design processes that are effective\r\nin integrating the activities of humans and computer automation.  These\r\nprocesses should be of considerable value in themselves.  Their\r\ndevelopment, moreover, will sharpen and validate the Little-JIL process\r\nlanguage, resulting in clearer understandings of the underlying\r\nrequirements for effective process definition languages.\r\n",
