 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project goal is to offer a variety of academic services to low-income college students from underrepresented groups to enable them to complete a bachelor's degree and compete in the work force as professionals or continue graduate studies in computer science or electronic engineering technology. The services that the project provides to achieve this goal include scholarship stipends; a program of scholarly activities to prepare students to carry out research; an individual research project; seminars, and other educational activities; tutoring; academic counseling; motivational activities; internship in industry; and activities to assist participants in securing admission to and financial assistance for enrollment in graduate programs, especially in computer science and electronics engineering technology. The one-hundred twenty students selected for the project will be students who are academically talented, have potential to succeed in their studies, but have not had the opportunity to develop their talents and potential due to economic and other limitations. \r\n",
