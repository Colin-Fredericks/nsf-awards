These geotechnical engineered type structures are used for many purposes, and an important use is for flood protection and control.  Hundreds of miles of embankments and levees exist for flood control in the country.\r\n\r\nThe research is specifically related to damage assessment of such structures from surface blasts (the typical terrorist scenario), and the utilization and improvement of such structures for security purposes.\r\n\r\n\tThe most critical time for embankments and levees is during flood conditions.  Unlike many other natural disasters, floods occur routinely, and in any given year it is virtually certain flooding will occur in some parts of the country.  The breaching of a levee during a flood could cause large amounts of property damage and even loss of lives; especially near large metropolitan areas, e.g. New Orleans.  Unfortunately, it is also easiest to breach an embankment or levee with explosives during flood conditions.  \r\n\r\nSmall scale physical models will be tested, utilizing RPI's 100 g-ton geotechnical centrifuge.  Centrifuge modeling is extremely attractive as an experimental approach to the study of ground shock problems, and many such studies have been conducted.  Most of the previous research has been conducted on level ground, dry soil conditions and/or with embedded explosives - that is, not surface blasts.\r\n\r\n\tCentrifuge experiments will be conducted using a range of 50-100 gravities.  The explosive charges will vary in weight from milligrams to one gram, and will be detonated using exploding bridge wires.  A one gram charge in a 100-gravity centrifuge experiment is equivalent to several tons of actual explosives.\r\n",
