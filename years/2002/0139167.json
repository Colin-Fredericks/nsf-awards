 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates program at the College of William and Mary directly supports the participation of 10 junior level undergraduates for projects in physics of 10-week duration. In addition, the existence of this program has led to a private endowment, the DeWilde Fellowships for the support of 5 more, and other funds usually support an additional 5 undergraduates for a total robust program of 20. The William and Mary physics department, a large, nationally ranked Ph.D. granting program, together with the applied science department, and in cooperation with the NASA Langley Research Center and Jefferson Lab provides mentors and projects in atom-atom, atom-ion, and atom-surface scattering, surface physics, ultra-sonics, laser physics and laser-atom interactions, condensed matter physics with a variety of techniques, nuclear and particle physics, polymer physics, non-destructive evaluation, plasma physics, non-linear dynamics, quantum computing and quantum information, and astrophysics/cosmology. Seminars by faculty and students are supplemented by a workshop on the nature of graduate study. An opportunity to learn how to use a machine shop is very popular. Some common activities are planned with the REU program of the Hampton University Physics Department including 10-minute, American Physical Society style talks by the participants from both institutions.  The College has been especially successful in attracting women students to the program in the past and intends to continue striving in this direction.\r\n",
