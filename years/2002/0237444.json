 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to support the travel of several of the US participants to Qingdao, China, to participate in the 4th US-Japan-China Symposium on Lifeline Earthquake Engineering on October 28-31, 2002. Twelve papers are presented from US participants who have submitted papers to the symposium. Of those, three participants are supported by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Center (PEER), three are supported by the Mid-America Earthquake Center (MAE) and three are supported by the Multidisciplinary Center on Earthquake Engineering Research (MCEER). This project supports the travel funds for the remaining three participants plus partial publications costs for the conference material.\r\n\r\nA joint agenda for research in lifeline earthquake engineering is developed as a result of the symposium. The research agenda is agreed upon by the representatives from the three participating countries. The challenges in lifeline earthquake engineering are identified and specific approaches are proposed. Use of innovative technologies and the new laboratory/instrumentation at the NEES sites will be a particular new focus for the research agenda to be discussed at the symposium. The broad impact of the symposium are (1) the identification of specific research needs that are relevant to the US; (2) research areas where collaboration between the US, China and Japan are particularly suitable and desirable; and (3) mechanisms for developing joint research programs between specific institutions in the US and respective organizations in China and Japan. Findings from the symposium are included in the symposium proceedings volume, which will be made public and will be used in subsequent activities.\r\n\r\nFour women are included in the US delegation one of which is a starting assistant professor and one is a young research scientist. Results of the symposium will enable the development of a concrete plan for lifeline earthquake engineering research with a specific focus on the development of advanced technologies that will take the field to the next level of advancement.\r\n\r\nLifelines, which include transportation, water, sewage, power, and communications\r\nsystems are key to for any civilized nation's survival, particularly after major disasters.\r\nThis area of earthquake engineering has received little attention in the past decade.\r\nEvents of the September 11, 2001, have demonstrated, as all other prior major earthquake\r\nevents and natural disasters, that the ability of a community to recover from a major\r\ndisaster depends extensively on the availability and rapid recovery of the infrastructure of\r\nthe region. Thus, it is important that this research be pursued.  Research results will continue to make significant changes in the design and performance of civil infrastructures.\r\n",
