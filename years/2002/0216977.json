 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nModern, componentized Internet services allow server consolidation \r\nby sharing common service components. \r\nSuch sharing can potentially reduce the installation cost, \r\nspace, and energy consumption.  However, to date, services \r\nare seldom shared across server applications to avoid\r\npossible interference between them.  Service providers often run\r\nmultiple instances of shared services, one for each frontend\r\nservice. The only benefit gained thus far, from the deployment of\r\nmulti-tier services is that new services can be composed quickly using\r\nexisting service components. Since these service\r\ncomponents may execute on different machines, each optimally configured\r\nfor its services, multi-tiered services tend to be more\r\nscalable than monolithic counterparts.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research aims to address the shortcoming of current\r\nOSs in executing multi-tiered services. We will focus on OS extensions \r\nthat correlate and trace service activities across the tiers of a \r\nmulti-tiered server farm. We will develop mechanisms for online\r\nclassification of activities (e.g., premium vs.~basic service classes), \r\nas well as mechanisms that allow system administrators to insulate \r\n(performance-wise) different service classes even when the \r\nactivities of different service classes may overlap and \r\nshare backend services. \r\n\r\nThe same OS mechanisms that are used to manage multi-tiered \r\nservices can be used to analyze the interactions between different \r\ntiers and the interferences between different service classes. \r\nWe will show that a combination of service interaction analysis \r\nand service policing minimizes performance invasiveness \r\nbetween services/applications. \r\nWe will also investigate how to improve insulation between \r\nservices in this environment. \r\nWe will explore how service implementations may take \r\nadvantage of an improved OS infrastructure for multi-tiered",
