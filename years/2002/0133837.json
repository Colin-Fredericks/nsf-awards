Mahesh, University of Minnesota\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to perform large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent jets in cross-flow using unstructured grids.  The problem is chosen because its applicability to a number of important technical problems such as fuel injectors, V/STOL aircraft, film cooling of turbine blades and etc.  Furthermore such a flow cannot be correctly predicted by the current computational scheme of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS).  Unstructured grids are chosen to allow mesh points to be localized near the jet boundary and near the wall.  The method of computation will be based on a kinetic energy conserving scheme, which was developed by the PI.  The results will be compared to existing experimental data.  The LES scheme, once fully developed, will be applied to a range of other flows. The education plan involves development of new graduate courses, incorporate research component into both graduate and undergraduate courses, and including undergraduate students in research projects.\r\n",
