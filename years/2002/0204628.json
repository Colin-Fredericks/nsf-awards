The main goals of this part are: 1) geometric formulation \r\nof two-dimensional quantum Toda theories associated with simple Lie  \r\nalgebras; 2) Fermi-Bose correspondence for compact Riemann surfaces and \r\nclosed smooth Jordan curves; 3) proof of general Kleinian reciprocity on \r\ndeformation spaces; 4) construction of the universal Weil-Petersson \r\npotential for the universal Teichmuller space; 5) curvature properties of \r\nthe new Kahler metric on moduli spaces of punctured Riemann surfaces; 6) \r\nexplicit form of factorization formula for determinants of Laplace \r\noperators acting on higher order differentials; 7) Faddeev-Popov ghosts \r\nfor string field theory of open strings. Symmetries and Ward identities \r\nfor correlation functions are guiding  principles of the algebraic part \r\nof the project. The immediate and long term goals of this part are: 1) \r\nproof of adelic Fermi-Bose correspondence for vertex operators, complete \r\nconstruction of quantum field theory of multiplicative bosons and proof \r\nof A. Weil's reciprocity law; 2) construction of quantum field theories \r\non algebraic curves in non-zero characteristic with Artin-Schreier and \r\nKummer theories as main examples, proof of Artin's reciprocity law using \r\nquantum field-theoretical methods; 3) adelic formulation of the WZW \r\ntheory on algebraic curves in characteristic zero.\r\n\r\nIn mathematical development a pivotal role is played by ideas from  \r\nphysics, originated in the study of the surrounding world. The last twenty \r\nfive years have been characterized by dramatic success in application \r\nof quantum fields and strings to different areas of mathematics. The idea \r\nis to probe mathematical objects by quantum theories and to measure their \r\nresponse in order to get new information about the various mathematical \r\nproperties of these objects. Usually the output is encoded in terms of \r\npartition function and correlation functions of physical theory, and the \r\nproblem is to decode it back in mathematical terms. The goals of this \r\nproposal are the following: 1) to extend further quantum-theoretic method \r\nfor the study of complex analytic properties of surfaces in two \r\ndimensions and their families; 2) to develop a new systematic \r\nquantum-theoretic approach for arithmetic surfaces and algebraic number \r\nfields (like the usual field of rational numbers). Fundamental properties \r\nof these objects are discrete and it is only natural to study them at a \r\nmicroscopic scale using quantum theory. In particular, many classical \r\nmathematical results about fields of algebraic functions and algebraic \r\nnumbers, known as reciprocity laws, can be interpreted as conservation \r\nlaws (like conservation of energy) in quantum theory. The main goal of \r\nthe algebraic part of the project is to develop a new approach based on \r\nquantum theory towards fundamental laws that are satisfied by the very \r\nbasic mathematical objects: algebraic numbers - solutions of algebraic \r\nequations with coefficients being rational numbers, and algebraic \r\nfunctions - solutions of algebraic equations with coefficients being \r\nrational functions. Realization of the goals of the proposal will \r\ncontribute to the fundamental interface between mathematics and physics.\r\n",
