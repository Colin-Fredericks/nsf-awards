 "awd_abstract_narration": "0225424\r\nBrown\r\n\r\nThis proposal is being submitted under the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER)\r\nprogram and it focuses on answering critical feasibility questions pertaining to a new\r\ntechnique for the detection and location of buried landmines and unexploded ordnance. The\r\nsubject technique comprises a standoff, ground based, pulsed radar that launches\r\nelectromagnetic energy into the Norton surface wave mode of propagation. The Norton\r\nsurface wave travels along the air-ground surface at the speed of light in a vacuum and\r\nexponentially decays into the ground due to the losses in the ground. By selecting the\r\nfrequency properly, sufficient energy will be scattered by the landmine back along the\r\nsame propagation path and then received by the radar. This energy is usually insufficient\r\nto be above the system noise level so return pulse averaging is carried out using coherent\r\ntechniques. If N return pulses are averaged coherently the signal-to-noise power ratio\r\nwill increase by a factor of N rendering the signal scattered from the landmine\r\ndetectable. Location of the mine is achieved by using the pulse width to accomplish\r\nresolution in the range coordinate and the radar antenna to achieve resolution in the\r\nazimuth angle. In order to achieve area coverage and the best possible angular resolution\r\nclose to the antenna, it is proposed to simultaneously employ both beam steering and near\r\nfield focusing techniques. The critical study, to establish feasibility, is the\r\ndetermination of the highest operating frequency for which the Norton surface wave can\r\npropagate on the surface and penetrate sufficiently deep to detect antipersonnel and\r\nantitank mines. It is also proposed to develop the appropriate radar range equation for\r\nthe Norton surface wave, investigate techniques for maximizing the coupling of the radar\r\nantenna to the Norton surface wave, determine the variation of soil conductivity and the\r\nradar cross section values for typical nonferrous landmines, and investigate the maximum\r\nrange and angle resolution or the acceptable frequencies of operation. Having answered\r\nthese questions, it should be possible to establish the viability of such a radar subject\r\nonly to the need to compute the effects of surface roughness and buried debris on the mine\r\nscattered signal strength, i.e., the low signal-to-clutter ratio problem.\r\n",
