These include the global theory of\r\nthe moduli space of constant mean curvature surfaces in Euclidean\r\nspace, the application of new gluing techniques to construct\r\nnew types of Einstein metrics, a more detailed study of the\r\nanalytic and geometric behaviour of conformally compact Einstein\r\nmetrics and the deformation theory of such metrics, with special\r\nattention to self-dual conformally compact Einstein metrics in\r\nfour dimensions. The proposed techniques here include further\r\nextensions of Cauchy data matching, as developed by the PI and\r\nPacard, as well as refinements of the PI's `edge calculus'.Abstract for \r\nOther parts of the proposal involve use of the pseudodifferential\r\ncalculus of fibred boundary operators, as developed by the PI and\r\nMelrose, to the study of gravitational instantons, particularly\r\ntheir L2 cohomology. Finally, the PI and Vasy propose to\r\ninvestigate the connections between geometric scattering theory\r\non symmetric spaces of rank greater than one, as well as a\r\nclass of spaces asymptotically modelled on these, and the\r\nmicrolocal theory of quantum N-body scattering. For the human\r\nresources component, the PI proposes to continue his directorship\r\nof the Stanford University Math Camp, a residential summer\r\nprogram for talented high school students, and also to continue\r\nhis other outreach efforts to disseminate mathematics appreciation\r\nto the general public.\r\n\r\nFrom a more general point of view, the PI's research concerns\r\nproblems arising in geometry and analysis involving what are\r\nknown as curvature equations (the theory of Einstein metrics in\r\ngeneral relativity being the best-known case) as well as scattering\r\ntheory on spaces which possess high degrees of symmetry `at infinity'.\r\nA central concern throughout is the application of somewhat novel\r\ntechniques from harmonic and microlocal analysis to these problems. The\r\ntheme is that one should develop analytic techniques which are\r\nspecifically adapted to each geometric problem, and these geometric\r\nsettings in turn should suggest new developments in the analytic\r\ntechnology. This approach has proved very successful in the PI's\r\nprevious research. The problems considered here are inspired by main\r\ntrends in various aspects of mathematical physics, most specifically\r\nthe two somewhat separate fields of quantum scattering and some parts\r\nof string theory. Some of the current and proposed work has already\r\nstimulated interest on the part of some communities of physicists,\r\nand their intuitions provide an interesting guide for further mathematical\r\ndirections in this work. Beyond these motivations, the PI regards this\r\nparticular interplay between geometry and analysis as an important one,\r\nparticularly because the types of geometric objects studied here are\r\nbecoming increasingly important in many other places in mathematics.\r\nThe PI has also undertaken extensive human resources development,\r\nincluding the above-mentioned summer program, and is active in\r\nmentoring a number of young researchers.\r\n",
