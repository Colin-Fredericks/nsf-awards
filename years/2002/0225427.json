 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sensors and sensor systems are used in a wide range of industrial and consumer applications, providing real-time information that allows decisions to be made when and where required. Sensors allow industrial processes and applications to be more cost effective, reliable, and safe. In many applications, sensors and data collection processing must be distributed and placed in inhospitable or inaccessible environments. This complicates sensor and system design by requiring devices with small size, rugged construction, an efficient power supply for active components, communications for derived information, and simple installation with a minimum amount of infrastructure and overhead. \r\n\r\nIntegrated Smart Wireless surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors and systems composed of distributed wireless SAW sensors, sensor communication transceivers, and a centralized host. New generations of SAW microsensors promises to provide measurements of a wide range of physical and chemical parameters, including: temperature, pressure, chemical concentration, gas concentrations, etc. Compatible with integrated circuit-processing techniques, SAW devices can and will be combined with active circuitry into integrated smart SAW sensors.\r\n\r\nFor Western Michigan University, this project will provide a basis for the development of laboratory facilities for SAW design and fabrication and the expansion of our wireless communications capabilities. It will provide student research opportunities and demonstrate technology and results that are widely applicable to a broad range of electrical and computer engineering classes. This project will provide a range of distributed wireless sensors while significantly advancing WMU's goal of being a \"student centered research institution\". \r\n",
