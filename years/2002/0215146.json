 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project proposes to develop an integrated software package for the design and optimization of novel Simulated Moving Bed processes for multi-component separation and purification. Innovative design methods, simulation software and equipment have been developed and tested at the laboratory-scale for a number of biological separations, including amino acids, sugars, a peptide drug, an antibiotic, an anticancer drug  and an antiviral drug. Laboratory data show that the new technology can produce high purity (>99%) chemicals at high yield (>99%). When compared to conventional batch chromatography, this technology can increase product yield by 5% to 15%, increase throughput per bed volume and reduce solvent consumption by an order of magnitude. During this Phase I Project, new tools for parameter estimation and cost optimization will be developed and integrated with  existing design and simulation tools. This will result in  a user-friendly interface  for the integrated package. \r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this project are in the area of recovery and purification of pharmaceuticals and other biochemicals. The proposed technology is expected to impact purification costs  in a major way, resulting in annual savings of several million dollars per product.\r\n",
