Within science and technology studies, many observers of technocratic\r\npolitical thought have emphasized its hegemonic, instrumentalist, and undemocratic character.\r\nIn recent years, however, scholars have recognized that while this approach has contributed much\r\ntoward understanding the nature of technological society, it needs to be revised and augmented.\r\nA study of the New Deal provides an important opportunity to reconsider prevailing assumptions\r\nand scrutinize the complex nature of technocratic politics as a set of beliefs and practices.\r\n\r\nThe study centers on three main subjects -- planning, electrification, and state-building -- and\r\ndiscusses how science and technology affected policymaking in each of these areas during the\r\nNew Deal years. The section on planning illuminates how Rexford Guy Tugwell, Frederic A.\r\nDelano, Wesley C. Mitchell, and Charles E. Merriam sought to translate technocratic ideology\r\ninto action. With electrification, the study turns to technology itself and investigates the conflicts\r\nwithin the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Rural Electrification Administration over the\r\nproper relationship between technology and human values, and the appropriate political\r\nstructures for technological development. The discussion of state-building examines how Jerome\r\nN. Frank and William M. Leiserson used ideas about science to legitimize the New Deal state\r\nand justify its expansion of state power via the new administrative agencies of the 1930s. The\r\nfinal part of the project probes the postwar experiences of Henry A. Wallace and David E.\r\nLilienthal, examines the transformation of technocratic politics wrought by the cold war, and\r\nexplores how cold war instrumentalism replaced the technocratic liberalism of the New Deal.\r\n\r\nBy examining how the New Dealers understood science and technology as a resource for\r\npolitics, the project contributes to a renewed debate within STS over the nature of technocratic\r\nideology and its political ramifications. The New Deal reveals the full complexity behind\r\ntechnocratic politics. Some of the New Dealers adopted subjectivist beliefs about the nature of\r\nknowledge, some brought a nostalgic, agrarian dimension to their version of technological\r\nprogress, and most took seriously the problematic relationship between experts and democratic\r\nsociety and struggled over the question of whether technocratic politics could be made consistent\r\nwith democratic values. The diverse range of thought and experience among the New Dealers\r\nsuggests that an image of technocratic politics as naively positivist, dedicated to an unwavering\r\nfaith in technological progress, and overly willing to subordinate democratic values to a cult of\r\nexpertise requires refinement and reevaluation. The project will reinforce STS's current efforts\r\nto readdress the relationship between expertise and democracy and explore the full meaning of\r\nscience and technology as forms of political thought and practice.\r\n",
