 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nahmod's research lies in the overlap of harmonic analysis, geometry and \r\npartial differential equations. It aims at studying the behavior of \r\nnonlinear waves arising in geometry, ferromagnetism and gauge field theories; \r\nand that of functions along vector fields whose integral curves lack \r\nsufficient curvature. In the first part the focus is in geometric partial \r\ndifferential equations. Of special interest are Schroedinger maps, \r\nWave maps and other gauge field theories such as the Yang Mills equations\r\nin Minkowski space-time. All of these equations model `wave like phenomena'. \r\nTheir solutions arise as minimizers of the corresponding energy functionals. \r\nTo conform with natural physical situations, it is of interest to study their \r\nexistence, uniqueness under minimal regularity assumptions. These are \r\ndifficult issues because the nonlinearities of these equations involve not \r\njust the solutions but also their derivatives. Nahmod will address these \r\nquestions and plans to show that in the scale invariant set up solutions to \r\nthe Cauchy initial value problem exist globally provided that the data is \r\nsufficiently small when measured relative to the critical regularity norm. \r\nShe also plans stability issues; e.g. whether such a system remains close to \r\nits initial state as time evolves when the data has small energy. From a \r\nphysical viewpoint the latter models whether such systems are close to \r\nequilibrium. The techniques exploit geometric aspects of these equations to \r\nextract crucial information -such as special structures in the nonlinearity-  \r\nwhich is then used in the analysis. The method combines deep Fourier analysis \r\nwith gauge theoretic geometric tools. The goal of the second part is the \r\nstudy of the Hilbert transform along vector fields and its associated \r\nmaximal operator in two dimensions. Their treatment departs from the classical \r\nstudy of singular integrals for in the present situation, the singularity \r\nlives on some variety that is changing at each point. Nahmod will \r\ninvestigate how to develop time frequency techniques to study operators under \r\nno curvature assumptions. This is the case, for example, in studying \r\ndifferentiability properties of functions along vector fields. \r\n\r\nPartial differential equations are the mathematical models to the laws governing much of the phenomena in our physical world. The wave equation models the propagation of different kind of waves -such as light waves- in homogeneous media. Nonlinear models of conservative type arise in quantum mechanics while other variants appear for example in the study of vibrating \r\nsystems and semiconductors. The nonlinear Schroedinger equation arises in various physical contexts in the description of nonlinear waves- such as propagation of a laser beam in a medium whose index of refraction is sensitive to the wave amplitude, water waves at the free surface of an ideal fluid as well as in plasma waves. Some of the interesting questions are those about local and global existence of solutions, uniqueness as well as long time behavior of global solutions. The role of mathematical analysis is to understand the behavior of the solutions to these equations, provide the tools to extract their quantitative and qualitative information and \r\nlay the foundations upon which methods to accurately approximate the solutions are developed. Fourier analysis and more generalized adapted frequency decompositions such as time-frequency analysis' consists in decomposing complex objects via `modulated waveforms' into basic building blocks which are localized and easy to understand, and then piecing them back together in a straightforward manner. It works very similarly to a musical score. The modulated waveforms have four attributes: amplitude (loudness), scale (duration), frequency (pitch) and position (instant it is played). The objects could be speech, radar signals, as well as oscillatory \r\nexpressions arising in optics, AC ousting scattering, wave propagation and other phenomena of nonlocal nature.",
