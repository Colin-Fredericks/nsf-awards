 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCyberlogic is a semantic foundation for implementing evidential\r\ntransactions using the public key infrastructure (PKI).  Evidential\r\ntransactions form the basis of frameworks for authorization and\r\nauthentication, electronic commerce, business workflow, and digital\r\ngovernment.  Such transactions involve the exchange of physical evidence\r\nin the form of identity cards, driver's licenses, money, checks, visas,\r\nairline tickets, traffic tickets, birth certificates, and stock\r\ncertificates, as well as electronic evidence including PIN numbers,\r\npasswords, keys, certificates, and nonces.  Cyberlogic is an enabling\r\nfoundation for building and analyzing protocols that involve the\r\nexchange of electronic forms of evidence.\r\n\r\nCyberlogic builds on evidence, public keys, and protocols.  First, evidence\r\nis encoded by means of numbers using digital certificates and nonces.\r\nSecond, public keys are predicates so that any information $i$ signed by a\r\nprivate key corresponding to the public key $P$ entails that $P$ holds of\r\n$i$.  Indeed, the signed certificate is a proof for the assertion contained\r\nin the certificate.  Third, protocols are distributed logic programs that\r\ngather evidence by using both ordinary predicates and digital\r\ncertificates.   These simple building blocks can be used to\r\nconstruct a rich variety of services in a variety of domains\r\nranging from digital government to access control in computer systems.\r\n\r\nThe public key infrastructure (PKI) provides basic services for\r\nencryption, authentication, trust, authorization, and digital\r\ncertificates.  Cyberlogic is a protocol layer over the PKI that serves as\r\na reliable foundation for evidential transactions.  It provides a\r\nstandardized semantic and computational infrastructure for exchanging\r\nevidence in electronic form.  With such a foundation, it is possible to\r\ndesign secure electronic versions of transactions that currently require\r\nphysical forms of evidence.\r\n",
