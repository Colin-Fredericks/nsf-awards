 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs are arguably the most diverse and vulnerable coastal ecosystems and are \r\ncurrently undergoing unprecedented decline.  Both their diversity and vulnerability are \r\ninfluenced by genetic structuring, the spatio-temporal scale and pattern of geographic \r\ndifferentiation within and among species.  By documenting such structuring, we gain a better \r\nunderstanding of the origin and distribution of reef biodiversity.  Furthermore, data on the level \r\nand scale of genetic interconnections are crucial for predicting reef response in the face of \r\nstressors and for the design of appropriate conservation strategies.  \r\n\tOn the basis of morphological species ranges, previous workers have generally \r\ncharacterized reef organisms as widespread, especially in the Indo-West Pacific (IWP), the \r\nlargest and most diverse marine region.  Wide species ranges in the IWP imply dispersal across \r\nnumerous, vast, open ocean barriers, supporting the belief that reef organisms have \r\ntremendous dispersal abilities.  Past molecular studies found IWP populations to be typically \r\ninterconnected over basinal to sub-basinal scales.  However recent studies on stomatopods in \r\nIndonesia and supratidal crustaceans in the Americas encountered finer levels of genetic \r\ndifferentiation.  These studies raise the question: is fine-scale genetic structuring common \r\namong reef organisms? \r\n\tPreliminary data show fine-scale genetic differentiation in several widespread, reef-\r\nassociated gastropods.  Each species is composed of numerous, divergent populations with \r\nranges limited to archipelagoes or islands.  Their life history attributes are typical of many reef \r\norganisms, and initial data show considerable structuring in co-occurring taxa with different life \r\nhistory strategies.  The goals of this project are to document the extent of geographic, genetic \r\nstructuring in selected reef-associated gastropods in the IWP, and to use these patterns to \r\naddress questions about large-scale, spatio-temporal processes in the marine biosphere.  \r\nEvolutionarily significant units (ESUs), the relevant conservation and evolutionary units, will be \r\nidentified throughout the region.  Hypotheses about the source and dynamics of ESUs, and thus \r\npatterns of distribution and diversification, will be tested using sequence data. \r\n\tThe significance of the proposed work lies in the nature of fine scale genetic structuring \r\nencountered in these taxa, which makes them model systems for studies of marine speciation \r\nand biogeography, and has major implications for reef management and conservation of \r\nbiodiversity.  Fine-scale, but deeply divergent genetic structuring has rarely been encountered in \r\nmarine taxa and only in continental settings; its occurrence on islands is unprecedented and \r\ncontrary to expectations.  How can organisms capable of dispersing far into Oceania \r\ndifferentiate on an archipelagic scale?  This conundrum implies that rare dispersal events may \r\nbe highly important in the spread as well as differentiation of marine populations.  Exploring the \r\nphylogenetic nature of genetic structuring in independent gene trees will shed light on a variety \r\nof hypotheses about the origin of marine biodiversity and distribution of reef organisms.   \r\n\tHigh levels of genetic differentiation also imply that conservation and resource management strategies on reefs need to be appropriately scaled.  Understanding the size and distribution of genetically interconnected units is crucial for designing appropriate management units, such as marine protected areas.  Congruent genetic structuring delineates intrinsic breaks in the distribution of reef biota and thus identifies natural management units.  This project will lead to better management strategies for reef-associated marine resources, and will also have \r\ndirect educational impact at several levels.  The project team will be interacting with resource \r\nmanagers regularly.  The species studied are important food organisms, and provide an \r\nexcellent venue to introduce implications for resource management and thus influence reef \r\nmanagement strategies on numerous Pacific islands.  The results of this work will be \r\ndisseminated regionally as well as in the scientific literature. \r\n",
