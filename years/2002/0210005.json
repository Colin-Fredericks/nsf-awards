 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biomimetics allows one to tap into the ingenious designs of nature to inspire new technologies. Recent developments in the advanced materials sciences have given researchers unparalleled access to biological systems at all levels of structural organization, including nanoscale organization under nearly in-vivo conditions. In the framework of this general approach, The PI will focus on testing basic principles governing the function, structure, and operation of specially designed free-suspended polymer/inorganic, multi-nanolayered membranes that can act as highly sensitive photothermal elements. The design proposed is based on principles learned from recent studies of biological infrared receptors highly sensitive to thermal flux. The main focus will be on the application of these fundamental principles to the development of nano-structured materials based on bio-inspired principles. The PI will determine if bio-inspired, compliant nanostructures can be designed with unique nanothermal properties and sensing capabilities comparable to biological receptors. He will fabricate and test multi-layered, free-suspended compliant membranes with nanolayered structural organizations composed of regularly alternating nanolayers of inorganic nanoparticles and polymer interlayers. The membrane is designed to be capable of significant reversible deformations, while providing the transduction of mechanical stresses to an external detection scheme. He will identify, test, and optimize assembly technologies (e.g., layer-by-layer self-assembly on sacrificial supports or Langmuir-Blodgett transfer) for depositing compliant membranes on micromachined, microelectronic surfaces, while preserving their micromechanical and microthermal properties in a manner compatible with prospective photothermal cell design. Perforated solid substrates will be selected for membrane deposition. A critical issue addressed by this project is the manner in which structural and chemical design principles employed by biological receptors may be transferred efficiently to generate organized nano-structured materials with enhanced thermal responsive properties.",
