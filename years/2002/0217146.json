 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nGirls Under the Hood is a demonstration project designed to encourage teenage girls in rural\r\nMadison County, New York, to achieve excellence in Science, Mathematics, Engineering and\r\nTechnology (SMET) fields.  Central to the success of this project is the hands-on experience\r\nthat will demonstrate the relationship of SMET to the participants everyday lives. Using the\r\nautomobile as a vehicle for inquiry-based scientific learning, 24 girls ages 14-17 will\r\nexplore topics such as the science of internal combustion, the mathematics of fuel economy,\r\nthe engineering of the power train, the technology of computerized diagnostic equipment, and\r\nthe integration of all these fields.  In addition to exploring and learning many scientific\r\nprinciples behind the various systems of the automobile, participants will acquire practical\r\nskills that they can share with their families.\r\nDuring a seven-day residential summer camp, participants will experience two different\r\ncollege campus settings a mere five miles apart:  Colgate University, in Hamilton, New York,\r\na nationally-ranked liberal arts institution; and in America's Most-Wired; two-year school, the\r\nState University of New York College of Agriculture and Technology, in Morrisville, New\r\nYork.  Morning sessions will be held in the new automotive technology building at the SUNY\r\nMorrisville campus, where participants will engage in hands-on exploration of the\r\nautomobile.  Meals, lodging, and most of the afternoon and evening sessions will take place at\r\nColgate University, where the girls will further explore the basic scientific principles behind\r\nthe operation of automobiles and how those same principles can be transferred to a variety of\r\nother applications.\r\nGirls Under the Hood will capitalize on the natural curiosity of females in a non-threatening\r\n(cooperative, welcoming, and predominantly female) environment at a critical time in their\r\nlives when they are focused on getting their driver's license.  Through exposure to female role\r\nmodels (teachers, undergraduate teaching assistants and successful industry practitioners) and\r\nsolicitation of parent, school, industry and government support, this project will seize\r\nopportunities to relate course content to SMET careers, and to challenge students' ideas about\r\ngender appropriate careers.  The confidence that girls gain in their ability to understand the\r\nscience and technology of automobiles will carry over into confidence that they can succeed\r\nin other areas of SMET, and the applications they will see of SMET courses will encourage\r\nthem to take more courses in those areas.\r\nThe intellectual benefit of this project is that it will serve as an educational model for the\r\napplication of contextualized science education, as well as provide a better understanding of\r\ngender-fair learning opportunities in SMET education utilizing a unique combination of rural\r\npublic high schools, public and private universities, community, industry, and government.\r\nBroader impacts of the project include positive changes in participants' interest in SMET,\r\nconfidence in their ability to do math and science, and election of upper level math and\r\nscience courses.  An added benefit will be the establishment of an educational collaboration\r\nbetween a four year and a two year college.",
