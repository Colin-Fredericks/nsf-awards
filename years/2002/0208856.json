 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimization problems that arise in practice are often inherently\r\nonline; that is, the input data is not available prior to\r\ncomputation but, instead, is given as a sequence of requests\r\neach of which must be served before the next one is received.\r\nA classical example is the caching problem in two-level memory\r\nsystems. Modern computer architectures enhance memory performance\r\nby storing frequently accessed data items in a cache, which is\r\na small buffer memory. Memory locations stored in the cache\r\ncan be accessed quickly. Requests to memory locations that are\r\nnot in the cache are called faults or misses, and take much\r\nmore time.  After each memory access, an online caching algorithm\r\nneeds to decide whether to put the requested item in the cache,\r\nand if so, which item to evict from the cache. The objective\r\nis to minimize the number of cache faults.\r\n\r\nDue to incomplete information, online algorithms cannot, in general,\r\ncompute optimal solutions. This brings up the issue of performance\r\nevaluation: how do we tell good algorithms from bad ones? One measure\r\nof the quality of online algorithms is their competitive ratio,\r\ndefined as the maximum, over all request sequences, of the ratios\r\nbetween the solution computed by the online algorithm and the optimal\r\n(offline) solution. Thus, an algorithm with competitive ratio, say,\r\n1.5, always computes a solution that is within 50% of the minimum.\r\n\r\nThis research deals with the competitive analysis of online algorithms.\r\nSeveral research directions are being explored. The first direction\r\nis to study general techniques for the design and analysis of online\r\nalgorithms. Here, the most promising ideas include the\r\nwork-function algorithm (and its extensions) and the primal-dual method.\r\nBoth of these techniques, as well as some other, have been successfully\r\napplied to specific online problems, but the mechanism behind their\r\nsuccess is still poorly understood, and they still require an in-depth\r\nstudy to determine their applicability to other problems. Another\r\ndirection is to study several extensions of the competitive analysis,\r\nincluding access graphs (for caching), diffuse adversaries, loose\r\ncompetitiveness and resource augmentation. This work focuses on some open\r\nproblems related to these models, on adapting these models to other\r\nonline problems, and on designing new problem-specific models. The\r\ninvestigator is also continuing his work on several classical\r\nproblems in competitive analysis, including the k-server\r\nproblem, several versions of caching and scheduling problems,\r\nthe k-median problem, and other. The main goals of these efforts\r\nare to develop efficient competitive algorithms for these problems\r\nand to establish matching lower bounds on the competitive ratios.\r\n\r\n",
