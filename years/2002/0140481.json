The investigator seeks first to\r\ncharacterize all (non-tight) wavelet frames - these frames\r\npermit more flexibility than the widely-used orthonormal\r\nwavelets. Then he aims to characterize and find examples\r\nof wavelets whose dilation matrices expand in some directions\r\nbut not in others. Another goal is to prove that the\r\n\"Mexican hat\" wavelet family is dense in all Lebesgue spaces,\r\nso that this family can be used to approximate data in more\r\nthan just the mean-square sense. On a different topic, the\r\ninvestigator will also pursue questions about the fundamental\r\nmodel equations that underlie motion of thin fluid films. The\r\nproposed research aims to mathematically determine the\r\nstability of steady states of these equations. In particular,\r\n\"droplet\" steady states will be studied. The existence of such\r\nstable steady states would signal the possibility of creating\r\na pattern in the film.\r\n\r\nWavelet theory draws on fundamental mathematics and on\r\nengineering disciplines such as signal processing to create\r\ntools for efficiently analyzing and storing information.\r\nThe two-way street between basic research and practical\r\napplications has been particularly effective in recent years.\r\nAbstract mathematical theories from harmonic analysis have\r\nbeen transformed into large scale engineering solutions (for\r\nexample the FBI uses a wavelet compression technique to store\r\nits fingerprint images), while engineering challenges continue\r\nto stimulate fundamental research in mathematics. Many\r\nquestions about the mathematical equations of fluid flow are\r\nfamously difficult. In view of this difficulty, much research\r\nhas concentrated on special situations, such as a thin film of\r\nfluid either sitting on or hanging from a flat surface. These\r\nfilms arise in many industrial coating situations, such as the\r\nmanufacture of photographic film, or the coating of magnetic\r\ndisk drives. The mathematical understanding of these problems\r\nbecame substantial only in the 1990s, and even now, much more\r\nis known in one space dimension than in the physically relevant\r\ncase of two space dimensions, where this research will\r\nconcentrate.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
