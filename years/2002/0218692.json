 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project systematically investigates the value of pedagogical agent features (*image: character, realism, gender, ethnicity; *animation: task-related, expressive; and *pre-defined agent roles: expert, motivational advisor, co-collaborator) in supporting learning-related outcomes. Using Multiple Intelligent Mentors Instructing Collaboratively (MIMIC) as the research environment, the standard experimental research design includes multiple factors and will be analyzed primarily via MANOVA. Additional micro-genetic data from logged agent-learner interactions and supplemental case studies triangulate the findings. All participants are individually randomly assigned to treatment conditions with large sample sizes (125-200 students), including educational technology undergraduate  students from both a state university and a historically black university. The instructional content focuses upon the ill-structured domain of instructional planning with diverse learning outcomes, including metacognition, cognitive strategies, attitude/motivation, as well as traditional performance. Through extensive dissemination of results to the relevant multi-disciplinary communities, this project proposes to: a) illuminate principles of learning with pedagogical agents, b) facilitate computer scientists in prioritizing areas of future development for pedagogical agents; c) inform teachers of the most desirable characteristics of agent-based applications for their\r\nstudents; d) refine key features for pedagogical agents within distance learning course  nvironments; and, e) advise instructional systems designers in developing training systems for industry and government.",
