 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe research and educational program consists of developing a multi-scale\r\nexperimental program to study the mechanics of fracture in elastic-plastic\r\nmaterials. The research is intended to complement and guide multi-scale\r\nsimulations of fracture in elastic-plastic materials. The experiments will\r\nfocus on understanding the behavior of cracks that exist along the grain\r\nboundary of symmetric tilt bicrystals of either pure aluminum or pure\r\ncopper. In such a specimen there is a well known, but poorly understood,\r\nphenomenon known as directional dependence of fracture. If a crack is\r\nintroduced along the grain boundary, the amount it grows macroscopically\r\ndepends upon the direction within the grain boundary that it propagates. A\r\njudicious choice of crystallographic orientation and loading techniques\r\nwill ensure that the mechanical properties at the macroscopic length scale\r\nare identical for both cracks, yet the amount of macroscopic growth will\r\nbe different. Thus the explanation for the directional dependence must\r\ndepend upon deformation mechanisms at the smaller length scales as well as\r\nthe interaction of the deformation mechanisms across length scales.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments, cracks will be introduced and propagated in opposite\r\ndirections within the grain boundary of symmetric tilt bicrystals. The\r\nstructure of the asymptotic deformation fields will be measured under\r\nplane strain conditions to investigate a certain type of strain\r\ndiscontinuity, known as kink shear discontinuity, that is predicted by\r\ntheory and observed in some materials under certain conditions. The\r\nexistence of kink shear discontinuities depends critically upon plastic\r\nconstitutive relations at very small length scales. The next set of\r\nexperiments will be to measure the directional dependence of fracture\r\nunder both a monotonic and cyclic loading to document the degree of crack\r\ngrowth in different directions along a grain boundary. The final set of\r\nexperiments will measure the lattice curvature of the crystal close to the\r\ncrack tip to ascertain the density of geometrically necessary dislocations\r\nwhich play an important role in strain gradient plasticity. All the\r\nexperiments will be simulated with the discrete dislocation plasticity\r\ntechnique in collaboration with other researchers.\r\n\r\nThe educational component is to reach out to secondary schools in the\r\nneighborhoods around Columbia University, particularly in Harlem, to\r\ndevelop a science module that is suitable for students in their final two\r\nyears of high school with the goal of inspiring them to continue their\r\neducations. The module will demonstrate that materials are made of\r\ndiscrete atoms by discussing the phenomenon of diffraction. To do so, the\r\nstudents will first gain intuition into the diffraction phenomenon by\r\nidentifying and matching symmetries in diffraction gratings and the\r\nrelated diffraction patterns that are created with a standard laser\r\npointer. Then the crystallographic aspects of face-centered cubic metals\r\nand the symmetries of a cube will be introduced. Finally the students will\r\nbe asked to identify the two-fold, three-fold, and four-fold rotation\r\nsymmetries in separate Laue back reflection x-ray diffraction patterns and\r\ncorrelate the patterns with the crystallographic orientations that exhibit\r\nthe same sets of symmetries. Thus the students will identify the\r\nsymmetries inherent in crystals without having to understand any of the\r\ndetails of the diffraction process.\r\n\r\n",
