 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oakton Community College (OCC), in partnership with Maine Township High School District (three schools) and Niles Township High School District (two schools), is developing and piloting initiatives designed to increase the number of high school and Oakton students who pursue and receive degrees in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). The project has three key components: (1) the Summer Bridge Program; designed to help under-prepared students improve their math, English and study skills, (2) the Peer Tutor Training Program; aimed at recruiting high school juniors with exceptionally strong math skills (e.g., AP enrolled, National Honor Society) and train them to become Peer Tutors to assist OCC students who are struggling in STEM courses, and (3) the Student-Industry-Teacher Simulations (SIT SIMs) designed to augment STEM instruction in high school and community college settings with hands-on, contextualized learning modules developed by teams of industry professionals and community college STEM faculty. The STEM Club offers motivational activities such as encouraging all students to join and by hosting \"Scholar, Expert, CEO Forum\", visiting local business or companies, coordinating the AMATYC Math Competition, and holding other activities for career exploration in STEM. We are also working with four-year institutions to smooth students' transition from Oakton to the university.",
