Building on our previous experience in educational projects, five current members of the Mechanical Engineering Faculty and a current and former Associate Dean will spearhead the planning process.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the plan will be to develop means for achieving the following objectives:\r\na) Integration of emerging technologies into the curriculum. These technologies include\r\nmicro-electro mechanical systems (MEMS), nanotechnology, biotechnology, new\r\napplication of materials, intelligent systems, and advanced computer aided engineering\r\nsoftware b) Reform of pedagogical methods by introducing the results of cognitive\r\nresearch, industry needs and technological literacy concerns into the design of the\r\nlearning environment c) Consistency of instruction by formulating department policies on\r\nexpectations, responsibility, ethics, homework, report writing and team work d) Issues\r\nrelated to retention, timely graduation and greater enrollment of women and e) Broader\r\nimpact of the reform effort and dissemination of results.\r\n\r\nThe planning activities will be carried out by involving the Department's stakeholders,\r\nnamely: faculty (including adjuncts and graduate teaching assistants), students and\r\nemployers. After gathering the views of all the stakeholders, each course will be analyzed\r\nto determine a strategy for implementing the proposed changes. A report detailing the\r\ncurriculum reform plan will be prepared. The report will also include a plan for\r\nevaluation of the implementation phase of this effort.\r\n\r\n",
