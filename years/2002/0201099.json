 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to investigate the behavior of\r\nFourier transforms under various restrictions and to obtain\r\nsharper estimates of Fourier transforms and Periodizations.\r\nThe research will be focused on two main objectives. The\r\nfirst one is to obtain new versions for the  Uncertainty\r\nPrinciple in Harmonic Analysis. The Uncertainty Principle\r\nis a statement which says that a function and its Fourier\r\ntransform can not be simultaneously concentrated on small\r\nsets. The famous Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in\r\nQuantum Mechanics is one of the examples of the more general \r\nUncertainty Principle in Harmonic Analysis. In particular,\r\nthe investigator will study functions with Fourier\r\ntransforms supported on sets with certain type of densities\r\nto get new versions of the Uncertainty Principle and apply\r\nthe results for Partial Differential Equations and Signal\r\nProcessing. The second objective is devoted to the relation\r\nbetween functions and their periodizations over integer\r\nlattices in higher dimensions. Periodizations are often\r\nused in Harmonic Analysis as a link between Fourier series\r\nand Fourier integrals. They arise in problems having\r\nperiodic structure  that is why they are an important tool\r\nin such applied sciences as Electrical Engineering, Signal\r\nProcessing and Crystallography.  \r\n\r\nIn this proposal the investigator  studies various\r\nproperties of Fourier transforms. The Fourier transform is\r\na major mathematical tool extensively used to  represent,\r\nconvert and recover digital data, information and signals\r\nin Signal Processing, Computer Science and Electrical\r\nEngineering, Crystallography and Tomography. The author\r\nproposes to further investigate  properties of Fourier\r\ntransformations  which should lead to a deeper understanding\r\nof the behavior of  Fourier transforms under various\r\nrestrictions. The development of the proposed Uncertainty\r\nPrinciple in Harmonic Analysis will lead to tools to determine\r\nhow much information is sufficient to recover signals and\r\ndata. In return, this study of Fourier transforms will give\r\nnew techniques not only in theoretical  areas such as\r\nMathematical Physics, in particular, Partial Differential\r\nEquations but also in applied sciences such as Image\r\nProcessing, Electrical Engineering and Numerical Methods.",
