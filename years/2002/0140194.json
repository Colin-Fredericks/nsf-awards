Over the past few years, the P.I.\r\nhas been actively involved in developing this area, in\r\nparticular establishing connections with more traditional\r\nareas of mathematical analysis, including harmonic analysis,\r\nanalysis on manifolds, partial differential equations, and\r\nnumerical analysis.  On a limited class of self-similar\r\nfractals it is possible to construct operators that play the\r\nrole of the Laplacian, one of the central objects in\r\ntraditional analysis on Euclidean spaces and manifolds.\r\nThe work of the P.I. has led to a deeper understanding of\r\nthese Laplacians.  At the same time he has studied certain\r\nrelated nonlinear problems on these fractals, and has\r\nworked on extending the scope of the theory to include a\r\nwider class of fractals.  This project will build on and\r\ncontinue this work. A second area of research is the study\r\nof harmonic analysis of fractal measures and functions with\r\nfractal spectrum.   Previous research has shown that for a\r\nspecial class of fractal measures there is a generalization\r\nof the theory of Fourier series.  By duality this yields a\r\nsampling theorem for functions whose spectrum lies in\r\ncertain special fractals.  The proposed research will\r\nattempt to find out what happens outside this narrow class\r\nof examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis on fractals is an emerging area with tremendous\r\npotential in both pure and applied mathematics.  Scientists\r\nin diverse areas have realized that many objects in the\r\nreal world can be modeled by fractals, and mathematicians\r\nhave been exploring the properties of fractal sets and\r\nmeasures.  This project will enhance the mathematical\r\ntheory, both by making connections with more traditional\r\nareas of mathematics, and by developing numerical tools\r\nthat could be used by applied mathematicians and scientists\r\nin the future.  This project includes collaborative work\r\nwith undergraduate students (REU) on computer experiments\r\nto explore examples and generate conjectures.  It is expected\r\nthat this experimental work will lead to deeper theoretical\r\nunderstanding of the subject.\r\n",
