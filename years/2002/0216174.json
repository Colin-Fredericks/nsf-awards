 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Brown University to purchase a field emission scanning electron microscope.  The instrument will have new capability currently not available at Brown University. It will provide information about chemical composition and structural information. Furthermore, the LEO Model 1530VP Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope will enable researchers at Brown University to examine materials used in research on such topics as liquid crystals and reactive mesogens, biological cells, fuel cells based on microfluidics, organic crystal growth, carbon nano-tubes, and upper mantle rocks.  Furthermore, the EDS capabilities will allow obtaining X-ray dot maps indicating chemical composition, and this is a new capability at the institution. Through the NSF-sponsored Materials Research Science and Engineering Center the PI's will provide outreach programs to three Historically Black Colleges and Universities.  These colleges will have remote access to the instrument and use it in their teaching and research.  This program will be piloted through Hampton University and then extended to two other colleges. This scope will be made available to industrial partners and will be used it in teaching at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Brown University to purchase a field emission scanning electron microscope.
