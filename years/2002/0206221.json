 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on an institution-wide strategic initiative to interpret the process of science for informal learners of all ages, the Museum of Science will work over four years to develop, evaluate and implement a project to communicate the processes of science through weather forecasting.  The project is based on the idea that processes involved in short-term weather forecasting are basic to the process of science.   MOS proposes to create a 1,800 square foot exhibit, programs for students and teachers, an interactive website, and one-minute television spots aimed at helping people understand weather forecasting.  The project is grounded in MOS strategic commitment to engaging people in the activity of science and the use of new technologies.  The major component of the project is an exhibition of weather in which visitors will learn how to forecast the weather over the next few hours using different levels of technology, including naked eye observations, data from weather maps, and real-time images from space satellites and ground radar stations.  Ancillary programs include educational materials for over 100 WeatherNet schools in New England, an interactive website that will reach several hundred thousand users, and television spots on the process of weather forecasting to be aired on WBZ-TV Channel 4.  Over the course of its life the project will engage several million children and adults in the process of science.\r\n\r\n",
