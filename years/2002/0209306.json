The methods of investigation\r\ninclude: Kodaira-Spencer-Kuranishi deformation theory, Lichnerowicz formulas for \r\nDirac operators and vanishing theorems, twistor correspondence, Kaehler orbifolds, \r\nnilpotent Lie groups, moment maps for various spaces with geometric structures, \r\nharmonic maps  and others. If the project is successful, it is expected a new examples \r\nof Einstein Hermitian manifolds to be obtained, the existence problem of HKT structure \r\non arbitrary hypercomplex manifold to be solved (negatively) and some characterization \r\nor rigidity type results for manifolds with many complex structures to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe role of the abstract spaces constructed from the complex numbers in the\r\ntheoretical foundations of quantum mechanics is significant. It increases in the\r\ndevelopment of quantum mechanic to the theory of quantum fields. A more recent\r\ninvestigations in the theoretical physics are directed toward a unification of the\r\nquantum mechanics and general relativity. This, yet hypothetical theory, is called \r\nstring theory and for a long time the Kaehler geometry of the complex spaces has served as its mathematical\r\nfoundation. In mathematics little is known about the structure of\r\na general non-Kaehler complex spaces. However, in the fast-growing development\r\nof the string theory an abstract models based on the non-Kaehler geometry appeared\r\nin the last years. Such spaces have also additional geometrical properties\r\nwhich makes the study of their mathematical structure more tractable. The\r\ninvestigation on the project will contribute to the understanding of some of the \r\nmathematical problems related to these physical models.\r\n\r\n",
