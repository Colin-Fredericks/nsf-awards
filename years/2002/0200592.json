 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator is working in the field of\r\nrepresentation theory of finite groups. Mainly he studies\r\nquestions related to the conjectures of Alperin, Dade, and Broue.\r\nThese conjectures state that certain invariants of a finite group\r\nand a fixed prime number can be determined by the same invariants\r\nof subgroups which are again related to that prime. The first\r\nconjectures are concerned with invariants that are integers,\r\nwhereas the third conjecture predicts equivalences of categories.\r\nThe first two conjectures and consequences of the third have been\r\nverified for a convincing number of examples. It is likely that\r\nthese three conjectures are consequences of a single fact, object,\r\ntheory, or construction which is still hidden. Probably more\r\nimportant than solving these particular conjectures would be the\r\ndiscovery of this hidden feature. The principal investigator works\r\non general ideas of how to approach these conjectures. Graduate\r\nstudents are involved in this effort by writing computer programs\r\nwhich will either discard or give more evidence to the\r\napplicability of one of the suggested approaches.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator studies representations of groups.\r\nGroups can be viewed as mathematical abstractions of the notion of\r\nsymmetry. They are among the most basic notions in many fields of\r\nmathematics and are applied widely, for example in cryptology,\r\nphysics, chemistry, and computer science. Representations of\r\ngroups are manifestations of a particular type of symmetry on\r\nother mathematical objects, as for example the four rotations and\r\nfour reflections, that a square in the plane allows, form a\r\nrepresentation of a group with 8 elements on a two-dimensional\r\nvector space. More specifically, the principal investigator\r\nstudies mysterious coincidences in the representation theory of\r\nfinite groups which have been discovered about fifteen years ago\r\nbut could not be explained so far. This research is not aimed at\r\nimmediate applications outside mathematics. However, in the\r\nhistory of the interplay between mathematics and other sciences,\r\nin particular with physics, it is a repeated pattern that theories\r\nand results which were considered as important within the edifice\r\nof mathematics became precisely what was needed in the other\r\nsciences in order to describe our real world. For example, group\r\nrepresentations which have been studied a century ago became much\r\nlater the right tool to describe particles in nuclear physics.\r\n",
