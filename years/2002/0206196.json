 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nTropical forests include a diversity of habitats, which has lead to specialization in\r\nplants. Near Iquitos, in the Peruvian Amazon, nutrient-poor white sand forests are found\r\nimmediately adjacent to nutrient-rich clay forests, each harboring a unique composition\r\nof habitat specialist trees. Why does habitat specialization occur? Our hypothesis is that\r\nthe combination of impoverished soils and herbivory creates strong selective pressure for\r\nplant defenses in white sand forest. Species that have not evolved high levels of\r\nantiherbivore defense are therefore at a disadvantage in white sand forests and excluded\r\nby herbivores.\r\nTo test whether herbivores select for higher optimal antiherbivore defense in\r\nwhite sand plants, we are comparing defense investment in 33 species from 6 genera that\r\ninclude several phylogenetically independent pairs of closely-related white sand and clay\r\nspecialists. In addition, we have established a reciprocal transplant experiment to\r\nmanipulate the presence of herbivores and directly test to what degree herbivores\r\nmaintain the low overlap in species composition between the two forest types. If\r\nherbivory has a significant effect on habitat specialization, it will suggest a new way that\r\nherbivores may influence plant evolution: by sharpening habitat boundaries due to abiotic\r\nfactors and thereby increasing the potential for habitat specialization.",
