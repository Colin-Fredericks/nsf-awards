Reinhart, Associate Dean for Research, College of Engineering, Professor Manoj Chopra, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Central Florida (UCF), Orlando, Florida and Professor Wa'il Abu-El-Sha'r, Director, the Center for Environmental Sciences and Technology (CEST), Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) at Irbid, Jordan.  They plan to gather and exchange information and to identify common environmental concerns related to hazardous waste management. They will focus on the phosphate mining industry, a major industry in both the US and Jordan. The objectives of this research are to: collect and review information available on the phosphate mining industry in the US and Jordan, identify methods to minimize water consumption and environmental impact of byproducts, conduct site visits in both countries, identify training needs for regulatory personnel, identify methods to increase awareness for waste generators concerning waste minimization and regulations, and plan a follow up seminar for industry representatives, consultants, and regulators.  Based on the data analysis and site visit results, it is anticipated that recommendations regarding phosphate mining environmental impacts will be made. A workshop on these findings is planned.\r\n\r\nScope:  The results of previous US-Jordanian collaboration reveal a lack of information on hazardous wastes and its management in Jordan.  There is no operative hazardous waste disposal facility in the country, even though there are plans to finish constructing an already existing site in Jordan. The project will address a topic that is important to the United States and Jordan where the phosphate mining industry is strong.  The two sides plan to increase the collaboration between JUST and the University of Central Florida.  The project is mutually beneficial, is expected to promote research, teaching, training and learning in this field, and is expected to give US researchers an understanding of the issues faced in other geographical regions.  The project meets INT criteria for support of cooperative projects that are mutually beneficial.\r\n",
