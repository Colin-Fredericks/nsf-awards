 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on the development of high-performance computational \r\ntools for financial engineering. The goal is to develop computational \r\nmethods to evaluate complex financial products used to manage foreign \r\nexchange, interest rate, equity, commodity and energy price risks and credit \r\nrisk, and manage large portfolios of assets. The methodology is based on \r\nextensions to financial engineering of finite-element methods successfully \r\nused in diverse branches of engineering to solve numerically multi-\r\ndimensional partial differential and integral equations. Partial integro-\r\ndifferential equations arise in the study of Markov jump-diffusion processes \r\nand associated optimal stopping and stochastic control problems in financial \r\nengineering. The aim of the present proposal is to develop both the \r\nnecessary mathematical theory to extend finite element methods to jump-\r\ndiffusion processes and develop high-performance computational tools \r\nbased on these methods that can be effectively implemented and used by \r\nindustry practitioners in the financial services, as well as researchers in \r\nfinancial engineering, applied probability and branches of operations \r\nresearch that use continuous-time Markov processes. Specific challenges in \r\nfinancial engineering to be addressed in the project include high \r\ndimensionality and jumps.\r\n\r\nMethodologies developed in this project will help financial institutions, \r\ncorporate treasuries and energy companies accurately value complex \r\nfinancial instruments, efficiently manage risk of financial transactions, and \r\ndynamically manage portfolios of assets. In addition to financial \r\nengineering, we anticipate that this project will have a broader impact on \r\nresearch and application areas that use continuous-time Markov processes as \r\na modeling framework. Constructive approximations and computational \r\nalgorithms for jump-diffusion processes developed in this project should \r\nprove useful for diverse areas of application that use jump-diffusion \r\nprocesses. This proposal will support the new Ph.D. major in financial \r\nengineering at Northwestern University. This new Ph.D. major will result in \r\ntraining of highly qualified researchers in financial engineering. This project \r\nis a part of the long-term development effort at Northwestern University in \r\nthe area of financial engineering. This project will also help the Department \r\nof Mathematical Sciences at the University of Nevada Las Vegas establish a \r\nresearch program in financial mathematics.\r\n",
