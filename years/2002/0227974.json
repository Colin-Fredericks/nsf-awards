Voronov\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to discover and study new algebraic\r\nstructures in topology suggested or motivated by mathematical \r\nphysics, in particular, quantum field theory and string theory. \r\nMore specifically, the project aims at discovering a new algebraic\r\nstructure on the homology of an n-sphere space, by which we mean \r\nthe space of continuous maps from the n-dimensional sphere to a \r\ngiven manifold. This part of the project, joint with Dennis \r\nSullivan, generalizes the work pioneered by Chas and Sullivan \r\nin the case n=1, i.e., that of a usual free loop space. Another \r\ngoal is to establish connection between Chas-Sullivan's work and Gromov-Witten invariants, which we believe to be a holomorphic \r\nversion of Chas-Sullivan's algebraic structure. Gromov-Witten invariants come from sigma model of quantum field theory, and Chas-Sullivan's work \"String Topology\" may be regarded as a \r\ntopological version of the physical construction. This part of \r\nthe project is suggested to be completed by developing a fusion intersection theory of semi-infinite cycles in infinite \r\ndimensional manifolds. Finally, part of the project is\r\ndedicated to relating the above to Kontsevich's Conjecture, \r\nwhich generalizes Deligne's Conjecture and unravels a deep \r\nrelation between deformation theory of abstract n-algebras \r\nand the topology of configuration spaces of points in an (n+1)-dimensional Euclidean space.\r\n\r\nThe main idea of Algebraic Topology is to be able to recognize\r\ntopological properties of a geometric object by associating \r\nalgebraic data or structure to the geometric object. Sometimes \r\nthe geometry is too complicated to allow immediate understanding \r\nand work with the object, while the algebraic information is \r\nusually simpler by its nature. This project suggests some new \r\nalgebraic structure for a sphere space, the space of maps from \r\nan n-dimensional sphere to a manifold. Such spaces are quite complicated and the classical work of Chen, Segal, Jones, \r\nGetzler, Burghelea, Fedorowicz, Goodwillie, and others, produced \r\nnot only the computation of the homology of loop spaces, which \r\nare the particular case of sphere spaces for n=1, but \r\nalso revealed amazing connections with algebra (Hochschild\r\ncomplex). Also, recent progress in string theory emphasized \r\nthe importance of invariants associated to holomorphic maps \r\nfrom the 2-sphere to a manifold (Gromov-Witten invariants). \r\nIn this project we undertake an analogous study of continuous \r\nmaps from the n-sphere to a manifold, which for n=1 has already \r\nenabled significant progress in topology.\r\n",
