 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this research project is to place constraints on the mechanism of isostatic compensation for topographic and intracrustal loads beneath a portion of the southern Appalachians.  Although it is frequently asserted that the Appalachians possess no crustal root, the Moho beneath the highest elevations in the Blue Ridge and Valley & Ridge provinces remains poorly imaged.\r\n\r\nRecent studies in the Sierra Nevada and other young mountain belts indicate that they are supported by density heterogeneities within the upper mantle rather than by thickening of the crust.  This suggests that a significant amount of interaction can occur between the crustal and mantle components of the lithosphere during mountain building.  Seismic profiles across older mountain belts, however, indicate a variety of mechanisms for isostatic compensation.  Profiles across some Archean-age orogenic belts in the Baltic and and Canadian shields reveal significant relief on the Moho, suggesting crustal roots may persist for over 1.5 billion years.  In contrast, seismic profiles across many Paleozoic orogens show a relatively flat Moho, presumably in reponse to subsequent collapse, extension, and erosion.  A notable exception is the Ural Mountains, a late Paleozoic orogen that escaped major extension, leaving the collisional architecture largely intact.  Extensive seismic profiling  across the southern Urals indicates a crustal root anywhere from 6 to 15 km thick.  The root appears to be much thicker than required for compensation of the existing topography. \r\n\r\nIn spite of extensive seismic profiling, very little is known about the crustal velocity structure or the configuration of the Moho beneath the southern Appalachians.  New seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection profiles are being used to model the transition in crustal seismic-wave velocity structure from accreted crust beneath the Carolina Terrane to North American craton beneath the Blue Ridge.  In particular, the new data are being used to: 1) image the Moho by taking advantage of elevated reflection coefficients near the critical angle; 2) map variations in averaged P- and S-wave velocities to constrain variations in the bulk composition of basement rocks across the study area; 3) test models for elastic bending of the continental lithosphere by incorporating the new estimates for relief on the Moho; 4) isolate the crustal contribution to the observed gravity by modeling the gravity field predicted by seismically determined variations in composition (density structure) and crustal thickness (this places constraints on any density variations within the uppermost mantle that help to support topographic and intracrustal loads); and 5) determine the extent to which the original deep structure of this orogen survived the effects of subsequent collapse and extension.  The results are being used to assess the long-term stability of individual terranes/crustal blocks within Paleozoic orogens.\r\n\r\nThe experiments are targeting the regional gravity low associated with the Blue Ridge province.  Both instantaneous blasts at dimension-stone quarries and delay-fired blasts at crushed-stone quarries are being used as seismic sources. The use of quarry blasts, a valuable but largely untapped energy source for refraction/wide-angle reflection profiling, eliminates the high costs of drilling and explosives normally associated with crustal-scale, active-source experiments.  The new experiments are helping to link the crustal images and velocity estimates from previous studies in the Carolina Terrane and associated East Coast gravity high, the Tennessee Valley & Ridge, and the Inner Piedmont and associated gravity gradient.  The combined results provide high-frequency control on crustal velocity structure across an important part of the orogen, allowing future passive-source experiments to focus on related structures within the uppermost mantle.",
