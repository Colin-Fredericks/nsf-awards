 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS - 0204188.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will seek analytic realizations of \"stringy\"\r\ncohomology of singular varieties with trivial canonical bundle. He will study\r\nthe implications of such analytic realizations (and their generalizations)\r\ntowards providing new explanations of gauge symmetry enhancement mechanisms in\r\nstring theory. In collaboration with S. Sethi, the PI will continue his program\r\nto analyze the supersymmetric matrix model quantum mechanics which has been \r\nconjectured to provide a definition of M theory. Graduate student G. Firestone, \r\nwill study the L2 index theory for the nonFredholm Dirac operators whose L2\r\nkernels give the ground states for this theory. Sethi and the PI will examine\r\nmethods for computing gravitational anomalies of field theories arising from\r\nstring theories on singular spaces. S. Paban, S. Sethi, and the PI will examine\r\nthe constraints imposed by supersymmetry on deformations of the supersymmetry\r\nalgebra associated to an isolated five brane. The PI will investigate the\r\nextension of Witten's spinor technique of proving the positive mass conjecture\r\n by replacing the hypothesis of a smooth spin structure by the assumption of a\r\n spin structure degenerating on a codimension 2 submanifold.\r\n\r\nM theory gives a potential framework for providing a physical theory which\r\nincorporates both gravitation and the quantum physics describing high energy\r\n particles. The precise form of this theory is not yet fully developed. The \r\n measurable consequences are even further from being fully worked out. This \r\n project attempts to determine, for branches of this theory, fundamental \r\n consequences, such as the number of particles of different types, when these\r\n particles combine to make more complex matter, and the size \r\n and shape of these particles and their combinations.\r\nIn addition to developing the physical consequences of M and string theory,\r\nsuch computations can be used to check for potential errors in the underlying \r\nhypotheses of M theory. This project also seeks a better understanding of a\r\nmathematical model for the physical interactions between certain \"particles\"\r\n known as 5 branes, whose existence is predicted by M theory. \r\n",
