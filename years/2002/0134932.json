 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program (OMC) in the Chemistry Division and the Molecular Biochemistry Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division (MCB), Professor Dev Arya, of the Department of Chemistry at Clemson University, will pursue an interdisciplinary approach to the discovery of new ligands for nucleic acid stabilization and will perform natural product based synthesis of novel ligands.  He will also pursue studies on a variety of natural product-nucleic acid interactions and their subsequent development as useful tools in stabilizing higher order nucleic acid structures. A major portion of the research builds on the recent discovery in his laboratory of the stabilization of DNA and RNA triple helices by aminoglycoside antibiotics. Professor Arya proposes to develop an integrated research and education plan in nucleic acid chemistry with the long term goal of creating a recognized nucleic acid chemistry research and education curriculum in the Department of Chemistry, and to establish Clemson University as a globally competitive center of excellence in biopolymer education and research.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dev Arya, of the Department of Chemistry at Clemson University, with the support of the Organic Dynamics Program and the Molecular Biochemistry Program, will develop an interdisciplinary approach to research and education. He will develop a new course in biopolymers as well as transfer modeling and experimentation to the classroom to show students the synergism between education and research and its applicability to real life problems. Outreach activities planned by Professor Arya include working with K-12 students, inviting underrepresented and under-privileged students to spend a summer in his laboratory, and working with high school teachers in 23 high schools in 9 counties in western South Carolina.\r\n",
