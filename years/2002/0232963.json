The \r\nmini-symposium will consist of five distinguished lectures on current \r\nresearch topics on group theory and its applications, algebraic structures \r\nand algebraic geometry.  The distinguished lectures will be delivered by \r\nWilliam Fulton, Robert Griess, James Lepowsky, Gregory Margulis and Efim \r\nZelmanov.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the mini-symposium series is to put together a program in\r\nwhich some of the most oustanding scholars in selected areas of\r\nMathematics and Statistics will deliver lectures on timely research topics\r\nand methodology, with the objective of providing members of the \r\nmathematical community, especially early career mathematicians and\r\ngraduate students, an opportunity to broaden their repertoire of research\r\ntools and to learn about new research venues. The event also provides a\r\nforum for members of the mathematical community to interact with\r\noutstanding scholars in a relaxed atmosphere. The above list of speakers\r\nincludes two Field Medalists (the Field Medal is the highest recognition \r\nbestowed in Mathematics) and three members of the National Academy of \r\nSciences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
