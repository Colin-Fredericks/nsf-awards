 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nSynergistic Effects of Multiple Environments on Composite Degradation\r\n\r\nThis project employs an integrated approach to assess the long-term durability of polymer matrix composites exposed to complex multiple environments. Degradation conditions are simulated using several simultaneously operating environments to closely parallel real-world conditions, and the kinetics of main degradation mechanisms and their interrelations are identified through an extensive multi-disciplinary analysis. Finally, comprehensive experimental characterizations (mechanical, chemical and physical) of the degradation mechanisms across multiple length scales (nano to macro) are coupled with sophisticated analytical/numerical techniques to develop predictive models of long-term reliability. By integrating life-prediction methodologies and the appropriate kinetic descriptions of physicochemical degradation, this project provides predictive capabilities for the service life of composite materials in real-world, multiple environmental conditions, e.g. composite material retrofit and replacement of structurally deficient bridges, all-composite automobiles with enhanced fuel-efficiencies and deep-water offshore oil drilling platforms.\r\n\tThis project involves active collaboration with industrial partners (Cytec Engineered Materials, Inc. and Resolution Performance Products, Inc.) and support from research/federal agencies (Brookhaven National Labs and Army Research Labs at Aberdeen Proving Grounds). An educational component provides for the significant enhancement of learning for both undergraduate and graduate students by integration of research and teaching. Specific activities also provide mentoring and outreach for underrepresented minority students in collaboration with other programs at Stony Brook.\r\n",
