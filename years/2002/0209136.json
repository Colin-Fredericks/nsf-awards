 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTERDISCIPLINARY WORKSHOP ON REPUTATION MECHANISMS IN ONLINE COMMUNITIES\r\n\r\nThis is an interdisciplinary academic symposium on Reputation Systems.  The production of trust is an important requirement for forming and growing open online communities. Online reputation reporting systems, such as eBay's well-known feedback mechanism, have emerged as an important trust building mechanism in such settings. The rising practical importance of online reputation systems invites rigorous research in this largely virgin territory. Do these systems truly promote efficient market outcomes? To what extent can they be manipulated by strategic buyers and sellers? What is the best way to design them? How should buyers (and sellers) use the information provided by such mechanisms in their decision-making process? This is just a small subset of unanswered questions, which invite exciting and valuable research. This workshop will bring together scholars and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines whose research informs the analysis and design of reputation systems. The workshop chairs will prepare a report summarizing the conclusions of the symposium. The report will provide a snapshot of the current state of the field and an agenda for future research.\r\n\r\n",
