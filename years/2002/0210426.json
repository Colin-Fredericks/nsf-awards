The proposal focuses on a convergent multi-investigator experimental and theoretical program to investigate fundamental electronic and magnetic properties of molecular inorganic clusters and to explore their device applications. This proposal represents the synergistic collaboration between (i) the synthesis of novel inorganic clusters with diverse electronic and magnetic properties engineered via judicious control of synthetic parameters, (ii) the fabrication and characterization of prototype electronic devices built from individual clusters and low-dimensional cluster arrays, (iii) the electronic and magnetic characterization of cluster arrays using state-of-the-art measurements, and finally (iv) the development of detailed understanding of cluster properties using high-level theoretical calculations, which will, in turn, guide the design of molecules and molecular electronic devices. The proposed research is firmly grounded upon the expertise and strengths of participating PIs that have already been demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThe synergy between their efforts is expected to result in a fundamental understanding of the electronic and magnetic properties of molecular magnetic clusters, which, in turn, may lead to the applications toward novel molecular electronic and magnetic devices. The proposed collaboration between synthesis and characterization efforts will provide detailed experimental information on the electronic and magnetic properties of new molecular magnetic clusters, which can then be fed back into the cluster synthesis efforts to engineer desired characteristics. Moreover, the interplay between theory and experiment will allow for the development of a fundamental understanding of electron and spin motion in these clusters and will therefore aid the design of clusters with novel properties and devices with new functionalities. The PI's expect that a synergy between synthesis, characterization, device fabrication, and theoretical calculations will ultimately provide important insight into the viability of single-cluster memory devices and spin-electronic (spintronic) devices using ordered inorganic cluster arrays.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research effort will provide powerful educational opportunities for students at Harvard and Berkeley by exposing them to a broad collaboration that encompasses synthesis, characterization, device fabrication, as well as theoretical calculations. The collaboration between Harvard, Berkeley, and IBM will also provide a unique setting in which undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students can participate in a collaborative interdisciplinary research effort in nanoscience and technology, while also being exposed to research at world-class academic and industrial research institutions. This unique opportunity, which won't be available to students without this collaboration, will surely broaden their vista and be of aid in their career decisions.\r\n\r\nThis Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) project is co-funded by the National Science Foundation Divisions of Electrical and Communications Systems (ENG), Chemistry (MPS), Materials Research (MPS), and Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (ENG).\r\n",
