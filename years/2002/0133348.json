 "awd_abstract_narration": "Designing Embedded Systems with Domain-Specific Languages\r\nStephen A. Edwards\r\n\r\nThis goal of this project is to provide tools to designers of embedded\r\nsystems that will allow them to more quickly create correct systems.\r\nIt proposes to do this by providing domain-specific languages and\r\ncompilers.  Such succinct, abstract languages reduce development and\r\ntesting time by providing more formal, correct-by-construction\r\nmethodologies and by enabling automatic implementation techniques.\r\nThe result will enable the development of these systems to proceed\r\nbeyond the current ad hoc C-and-assembly approach.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses three issues in the design of many embedded\r\nsystems: real-time software, software for communication, and software\r\nfor communicating across the hardware/software boundary.\r\nThese issues are addressed through the following specific investigations:\r\n\r\nNew Compilation Techniques for Synchronous Languages\r\n\r\nSynchronous languages such as Esterel provide very predictable\r\nreal-time behavior but are challenging to compile.  This project\r\nincludes developing new, more efficient compilation techniques for\r\nlarge systems described in the Esterel language and its variants.  \r\n\r\nNew Languages and Compilers for Communication Protocols\r\n\r\nNetwork communication is becoming a crucial part of every embedded\r\nsystem, but the growing complexity of the protocols and the need for\r\nbandwidth (e.g., for video) makes this software difficult to develop.\r\nThis project includes the development of a new language for\r\ndescribing such protocol software and a compiler for producing\r\nefficient implementations.\r\n\r\nNew Languages and Compilers for Device Drivers\r\n\r\nWriting software that communicates directly with hardware is currently\r\ntedious and error-prone, and unfortunately even more important in\r\nembedded systems since they tend to have application-specific\r\nperipherals.  This project aims to simplify this task by creating a\r\nlanguage and compiler for writing device drivers.  The results of this \r\nresearch will enable more diverse languages for  communicating across \r\nthe hardware/software boundary.\r\n\r\nThis project is also addressing the recurring complaint that academia\r\ndoes not produce students who understand both hardware and software\r\nwell enough to be effective embedded systems designers by developing\r\nnew courses along these lines.  At the undergraduate level, a new\r\nembedded systems project course is being developed that will give\r\nstudents the opportunity to learn about and use some of these new\r\ntechniques.  At the graduate level, a more sophisticated course is\r\nbeing developed that focuses on languages for describing embedded\r\nsystems and isses with their semantics and implementation.  This will\r\ngive future designers more tools for developing embedded systems and\r\nwill prepare students for research in automating embedded system\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project are being disseminated in three ways:\r\nthrough conference and journal papers, through the release of all\r\ndeveloped software to the public domain, and through the education of\r\nstudents in the use of the languages and compilers developed.  Just as\r\ncomputer-aided design tools have enabled the rapid, correct design of\r\nfantastically complex integrated circuits, this work is enabling the\r\nquick, correct design of tomorrow's complex embedded systems.\r\n",
