 "awd_abstract_narration": "NER: Massively Parallel Electron Photoemitter Micro-arrays for Nanoscale\r\nLithography, Imaging and Inspection Applications\r\n\r\n      Present electron-beam lithography, imaging and inspection systems\r\nare limited to serial scanning of patterns with only one beam. As a\r\nresult the ability of such systems to scan substantial areas at\r\nnanoscale resolution with practical throughput is not possible.  However\r\nif such machines were to scan using a massively parallel array of\r\nindependently modulated beams, the resultant parallelism would make\r\npossible not only significantly improved throughput for conventional\r\napplications in the nanoscale environment but also enable faster device\r\ndevelopment by software changeable patterns.  However at this time there\r\nis no practical multiple-beam electron emitter source available that\r\nwill meet system-level performance and reliability requirements.  The\r\ngoal of the proposed research is to prove feasibility of photocathode\r\nmicroarrays for massively parallel and independently modulated electron\r\nsources.  A key deliverable of the research will be a fabricated\r\nindividually gated array of sources with sufficient emission current\r\ndensity to expose a line of electron sensitive resist 5 to 100nm in\r\nwidth.\r\n       The successful demonstration of feasibility for photocathode\r\nmassively parallel microarrays will require a stable, low noise and\r\nreproducible photocathode and a viable scheme for fabrication and\r\nindependently modulating the current in each beam.  As a result the work\r\nwill focus on two key aspects.  First the extension of our previous work\r\nto develop a thin film stack photocathode and pretreatments that will\r\nprovide the emission stability and intensity necessary and second to\r\nexamine schemes for producing microarrays using such photoemitters.\r\n        Photoelectron source arrays will make nanoscale lithography and\r\nrapid e-beam review testing possible.  Lithography and testing on the\r\nnanoscale are necessary if the manufacturing at this scale for\r\nmicroelectronic devices, sensors and electrical- mechanical systems is\r\nto become as high in yield and rapid as sub-micron fabrication is\r\ntoday.",
