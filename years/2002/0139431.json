 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for an REU Site on \"Excavation and Reconstruction of a Northern Plains Bison Kill Site\" at the University of South Dakota.  The project represents a unique cooperation between academic units of the University and the W.H. Over Museum, a natural history museum which resides on the University Campus.  The project is highly interdisciplinary and provides opportunities for students with a wide variety of backgrounds, including social science, physical and natural science, education, and museum science.  The scientific aspects of the REU Site project are threefold:  (1) the excavation of the bison kill site using state-of-the-art archaeological methodology; (2) analysis and documentation of the artifacts taken from the Site; and (3) an educational program consisting of a professional exhibit at the museum and an accompanying K-12 curricular module.  In addition to the scientific component, the Site will offer students  field trips, social events, weekly discussions, and written and oral presentation of results in a variety of local and national venues.  This award will support eight students per year for three years.  In addition to students from the University of South Dakota and smaller schools in the surrounding region, an emphasis will be placed on involving Native American students who are enrolled at two tribal colleges in South Dakota.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
