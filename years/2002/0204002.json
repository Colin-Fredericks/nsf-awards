 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS - 0204002.\r\n\r\nThe PI's first program in this proposal is concerned with the \r\ngeometry of Hermitian or hyper-Hermitian connections with totally \r\nskew torsions. The results will be applicable to an investigation \r\nin quantum mechanical black holes. The PI's second program is to \r\nstudy the complex deformation theory and Hermitian geometry of \r\nnilmanifolds. Parallel to the algebraic analysis on the classical \r\nand extended moduli, he and his collaborators investigatge the \r\ngeometry on these spaces from the viewpoint of special holonomy \r\nand symplectic structures. A senior participant proposes to \r\nanalyse the structures of compact quaternionic Kaehler manifolds \r\nand the A-hat genus of non-spin manifolds with finite second \r\nhomotopy. Both issues are tackled through an analysis of the \r\nrigidity of elliptic genus. Through the theory of elliptic genus, \r\nthe two proposers will jointly calculate a Hilbert polynomial \r\nrelevant to holomorphic contact structures or rational curves \r\ninvariant with respect to a holomorphic automorphisms.\r\n\r\nThe proposed projects here are enabled by theoretical physicists' \r\nand mathematicians' knowledge on field theory, complex deformation \r\ntheory and differential topology of fixed point sets. All proposed \r\nprojects are intended to address issues relevant to current \r\nphyscial or mathematical issues. The PI's projects will address a \r\ntype of geometry less  known to mathematicians than to physicists. \r\nThe results will increase mathematicians' knowledge on Hermitian \r\ngeometry and directly addresses issues to theoretical physcists' \r\nconcerns. The senior participant's project addresses a long-\r\nstanding conjecture in the field of holonomy. The central tool in \r\nthis project is a novel differntial topological mechinary for \r\nstudying fixed point sets with respect to group actions. The \r\ninvestigators joint project will combine their expertise to \r\nextract topological information on a class ofspace central in \r\nalgebraic geometry.\r\n",
