 "awd_abstract_narration": "The alternating adsorption of polyelectrolytes and other multivalent organic and\r\ninorganic species has evolved in the past decade into a quickly developing new field of\r\nmaterials science.  The multilayer assembly technique, which involves the alternating\r\nadsorption of oppositely charged species from dilute aqueous or mixed solvent solutions,\r\nhas been used to create a number of systems with electrical, optical, dielectric and\r\nelectrochemical functionality.  Ultrathin films with high uniformity are can be created\r\nusing layer-by-layer assembly techniques.  The ease of fabrication, ability to control film\r\nstructure on a nanometer length scale, and the tunability of the final properties of the film\r\nmake polyelectrolyte multilayer approaches interesting as components in micron scale\r\nbattery applications.  Recent work from the Hammond research group has resulted in a\r\nnumber of microfabrication techniques that allow the incorporation of functional polymer\r\nmultilayers into micron scale devices.  New work in this group has also led to orders of\r\nmagnitude increases in the solid state ionic conductivity of polyelectrolyte multilayer\r\nfilms through the use of highly acidic polyions such as perfluorosulfonated ionomers, and\r\nthe incorporation of polyethylene oxide.  The goals of this work are to develop new\r\npolyelectrolyte multilayer systems with ionic conductivities suitable for thin film battery\r\napplications, to take advantage of the nanometer scale control that multilayer assembly\r\nprocesses provide to develop electrolyte films with gradient electronic conductivities for\r\nbattery electrode components, and to apply nonlithographic microfabrication techniques\r\ndeveloped in this group to create cheap, easily manufactured multilayer battery devices\r\non plastic, glass or paper substrates for plastic and paper thin film electronics\r\napplications.\r\n",
