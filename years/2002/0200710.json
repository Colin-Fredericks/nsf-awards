 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of this research proposal is the Anderson metal-insulator transport \r\ntransition and other phenomena in disordered systems. A new approach to the Anderson \r\nmetal-insulator transition based on transport instead of spectral properties will be \r\ninvestigated.  In addition, several related topics will be investigated. Constructive \r\ncriteria for localization in random media will be developed; an application is planned \r\nfor the Landau Hamiltonian with a random potential. Local Poisson statistics for the \r\nstrong insulator spectrum of Anderson-type Hamiltonians in the continuum will be \r\nstudied.  The spectrum of the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice will be studied. \r\nLocalization at low disorder in one or two dimensions will be investigated.\r\n\r\nFortysome years have passed since P. Anderson's seminal article on localization of \r\nelectrons in random media, but our mathematical understanding of the metal-insulator \r\ntransition is still very unsatisfactory.  In three or more dimensions a transition is \r\nbelieved to occur from an insulator regime, characterized by localized states, to a \r\nvery different metallic regime characterized by extended states. The energy at which \r\nthis metal insulator transition occurs is called the mobility edge. The standard \r\nmathematical interpretation of this picture is that there should be a transition in the \r\nspectrum of the random SchrAdinger from pure point spectrum (localized states) to \r\nabsolutely continuous spectrum (extended states). But up to now there are no \r\nmathematical results on the existence of continuous spectrum and a metal-insulator \r\ntransition (except for the special case of the Anderson model on the Bethe lattice).  A \r\nnew approach to the Anderson metal-insulator transition is proposed based on transport \r\ninstead of spectral properties. It is motivated by the fact that the intuitive physical \r\nnotion of localization has a dynamical interpretation: an initially localized wave \r\npacket should remain localized under time evolution, and delocalization may be \r\ninterpreted as nontrivial transport.  The main goal of this proposal is to show the \r\nexistence of such a transport transition.  \r\n\r\n",
