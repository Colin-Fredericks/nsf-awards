 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\"Flexible AC Transmission System\" (FACTS) devices refer to rapidly switching power semiconductor devices, used in power systems to control the power flow and stabilize voltages. The decentralized nature of their actions may cause deleterious interactions between one FACTS device and another, as well as between FACTS devices and generators in the system. Currently there is a general lack of understanding as to how to systematically coordinate and stabilize system-wide dynamics via local modulation of the faster FACTS devices as well as the slower generators. Nonlinear neurocontrollers offer a solution.\r\n\r\nThis project will evaluate the initial application of neurocontrollers based on different adaptive critic designs to two different types of FACTS devices (one at a time) on a multi-machine power system. An SGER form of proposal is chosen because this is preliminary work based on novel ideas, and if successful, the results will be used to generate a regular proposal which will further investigate the interactions between conventionally controlled generators and multiple neurocontrolled FACTS devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe significance of this work lies in:\r\n\r\no\tResearch Benefits: Locally placed neurocontrolled FACTS devices can provide system wide improved voltage support and stability, thus allowing the entire power system to be operated more efficiently with a smaller stability margin.\r\n\r\no\tBenefits to Society: Economically operated reliable and secure power systems are of national interest. When electricity demand exceeds available supply, it would be beneficial to produce more electrical power per installed Megawatt (and Dollar) of equipment, with the addition of relatively cheap intelligent neurocontrollers.\r\n",
