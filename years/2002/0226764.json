The technical program of the meeting includes the 3 mini-symposia of Biomedical Optics, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Terahertz Bioimaging and Biosensing Applications. Funding is being provided to support the participation of 8 young investigators who will give featured 30-minute presentations in the special mini-symposia on the topics New Technologies in Biomedical Optics, Recent Advancces in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Terahertz Bioimaging and Biosensing. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the 3 mini-symposia is high: the topics chosen for discussion represent new areas of investigation in Biomedical Optics and Imaging and are to be described by new investigators at the forefront of their respective fields. The mini-symposia will add significantly to the scientific quality of the Joint Conference, which currently represents the largest professional forum for Bioengineers worldwide. The information presented will have broad impact in the fields of biosensors, BioMEMS, medical imaging, and the areas of applied research that depend on such emerging technologies. \r\n\r\nEach recipient of support is expected to submit a report outlining their exciting new findings and their scientific experiences at the Conference. \r\n",
