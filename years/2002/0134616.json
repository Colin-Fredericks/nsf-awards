 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium gathers together outstanding scholars, analysts, and practitioners in science and technology policy who are within seven years of their PhDs.  It provides an opportunity to meet and exchange ideas and to present their work to a high-level (senior) audience. This research symposium is oriented toward eight theme tracks in science and technology policy: \r\nNew history of science and technology policy.\r\nR&D program analysis and evaluation \r\nExpertise, advice, assessment, and evaluation\r\nScience, technology, and human needs and values\r\nScience, technology, and international issues\r\nScience education, human resources, and workforce\r\nScience and technology policy institutions and processes\r\nScience, technology, and the public. \r\nProposals for these tracks were broadly solicited and peer reviewed for acceptance. Accepted authors were funded to attend the workshop held in Washington, DC. Senior scholars and practitioners served as discussants. The new scholarship presented and the interaction among academics and practitioners have the potential to improve policy and programs and to benefit education in science and technology policy in a variety of ways.  An edited book containing the presented papers will be published.\r\n",
