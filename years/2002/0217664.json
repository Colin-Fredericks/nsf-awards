 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will model the complex interactions that occur during the in-mold coating of thermoplastic and composite parts. The goals of this processing model will be to predict mold and molding machine deflection during filling and coating, as well as optimal injection parameters for the process. Plans to experimentally validate the use of this model for coatings for injection molded thermoplastic parts where issues such as substrate compressibility play a key role in the filling stage and subsequent coating performance In-mold coating has the potential to greatly reduce the need for spray painting and coating of plastic parts, a major environmental hazard in contemporary manufacturing.\r\n\r\nIn-mold coating compounds have been used for many years to improve the surface properties of parts made from sheet molding compounds. To date, the process has not been applied to injection-molded thermoplastic parts, although the potential environmental benefits and cost savings resulting from elimination of painting are enormous. The major stumbling blocks have been the difficulty of predicting the behavior of the thermoplastic substrate during the coating process, and associated problems in mold design. Another potential application of large environmental benefit is as a substitute of gel coats for boat manufacturing.  This work will have an immediate impact on the automotive and consumer products industries, and will be directly applied to manufacturing courses in polymer processing and mold design at Ohio State University. The potential for alleviating a major environmental hazard is clearly very large. Another major potential application of large environmental benefit is as a substitute of gel coats for boat manufacturing. The Director of the Women in Engineering Program will actively engage a diverse student participation. \r\n\r\n",
