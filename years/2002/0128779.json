 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an innovative and versatile low-pressure injection molding (LPIM) process for the fabrication of net-shape ceramic components. LPIM has been recently recognized as an attractive process for the fabrication of high-precision, complex-geometry ceramic parts. However, one major factor that limits the use of injection molding process for production is the lack of reliability and throughput. Thus, there is an immediate need for technologies that can substantially improve the LPIM process. This project will utilize a low-pressure injection molding approach for the net-shape forming of high performance ceramics reliably and at low cost. Specific innovations include: utilizing an environmentally-safe solvent extraction debinder technique, improving the thermal conductivity of the current binder system, and demonstrating an improved fabrication versatility that is relatively insensitive to material and size constraints.\r\n\r\nThe commercial benefits will be to alumina ceramic based cross-flow particulate filtration systems for liquid waste streams; mullite based filters for hot gas streams; NZP based engine liners; and alumina based element holders for furnaces.\r\n",
