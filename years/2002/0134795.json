 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a result of the extreme exposure to radiation at the site of the former Chernobyl Atomic Electric Station, changes in the community composition of soil fungi have been identified. Some of these fungi have been shown to be able to decompose some of the carbon based radioactive materials from the fuel rods and from contaminated roof material. One of the properties that has been found in these fungi is that isolates from the Chernobyl area appear to show 'positive radiotropism'. These fungi appear to have evolved an ability to recognize radioactivity, the direction of the source and then grow towards the source. This ability does not seem to have evolved in isolates of the same fungal species isolated at a distance from Chernobyl.\r\n\r\nOur proposal is to further investigate the mechanics of this 'radiotropism'. We wish to identify the nature of the radioactive cues that elicit a response in the fungi and will use a range of radioactive sources (a, b, g, mixed bg, neutron and X-ray) at a range of doses to determine which type and dose of radioactivity these fungi respond to. We will also initiate investigations of the underlying biochemical changes that may be triggered to cause the growth changes in these 'adapted' fungi.\r\n\r\nThe work has ecological and environmental significance in that, if we can show that fungi can respond to radioactive cues, grow towards sources of radioactivity, which they can then decompose, this may be a potential bioremediation tool that could be used in contaminant remediation.\r\n",
