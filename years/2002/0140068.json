 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed lies at the interface between measurable\r\nand topological dynamics. In these and other areas of dynamics\r\nthe problems  concerning the relationship between the dynamical\r\nand cohomological properties of systems proved to be very\r\nimportant. One circle of the proposed problems can be\r\ninformally called \"inverse problems for coboundaries\", and,\r\nroughly speaking, is aimed to understand how and to what extent\r\nthe dynamics of a measurable group action can be recovered\r\nfrom the cohomological information, and in particular, from the\r\ncollection of all measurable coboundaries. It turns out that,\r\nin the case of group actions, the algebraic properties of the\r\nacting group play an important role. Another line of the\r\nproposed research is an attempt to get a complete understanding\r\nof the possibility of constructing minimal topological models\r\nfor arbitrary families of measurable dynamical systems.\r\nIn the case when the family consists of one single ergodic\r\nautomorphism, the answer is given by the famous Jewett-Krieger\r\ntheorem.\r\n\r\nThe classical theory of dynamical systems originated with the\r\nstudy of qualitative behavior of the solutions of differential\r\nequations describing the motion of a mechanical system. The\r\nfundamental theorem of Liouville provided the bridge between\r\nthe classical theory and modern measurable dynamics. The study\r\nof the connections between the different and seemingly\r\nunrelated properties of the measurable systems, as well as\r\nrelations between the measurable and continuous structures in\r\ndynamics, strengthens our sense of connectedness of the entire\r\nbuilding of mathematics. \r\n \r\n",
