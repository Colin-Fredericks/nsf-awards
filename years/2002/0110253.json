 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tThis award provides funds for operating the National Superconducting\r\nCyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University as a national\r\nuser facility; for supporting the MSU faculty and staff to conduct\r\nresearch in nuclear science, nuclear astrophysics, and accelerator and\r\ninstrumentation physics; and for serving as a center dedicated to\r\ntraining the next generation of scientists.\r\n\tSince its inception, the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory\r\n(NSCL) at Michigan State University has played a significant role in\r\nnuclear and accelerator physics research, both in the U.S. and\r\nworldwide.  This role will continue at an enhanced level with the\r\nCoupled Cyclotron Upgrade now nearing completion.  In the 1996\r\nLong-Range Plan of the NSF/DOE Nuclear Science Advisory Committee, this\r\nupgrade project was recommended to be the highest priority for new\r\nconstruction.\r\n\tLarge intensity gains of intermediate-energy primary heavy-ion beams are\r\nmade possible with the coupled cyclotron operation.  Together with the\r\nincreased acceptance of the new fragment separator, it will be possible\r\nto produce fast beams of rare isotopes typically more intense by factors\r\nof 100 - 10,000 than available at the previous facility, providing\r\nluminosities in the light-to-midrange mass region (A<50) that will be\r\nunsurpassed worldwide.\r\n\tA versatile array of new experimental devices will be brought on-line\r\nthat will significantly enhance the ability of users to conduct cutting\r\nedge research with a broad range of rare isotope beams.  Three of these\r\nnew instruments are funded by the NSF: (1) a set of eighteen segmented\r\ngermanium detectors for studies of intermediate energy coulomb\r\nexcitation and knockout reactions; (2) a 4-Tesla-meter high-acceptance\r\nspectrometer that can be combined with large-area neutron time-of-flight\r\ndetectors for neutron and charged-particle spectroscopy at very small\r\nangles; (3) a high-resolution silicon-strip CsI detector array that\r\npermits measurements of isotopic abundances, excited state populations,\r\nand isotopically resolved correlation functions with a high precision\r\nand efficiency that cannot be matched by any existing detector array. \r\nOther new equipment under development include a stopped-beam facility\r\n(DOE funded) and a 9.4-Tesla precision Penning ion trap (MSU funded) for\r\nprecision mass measurements, weak interaction studies, and atomic\r\nspectroscopy.\r\n\tFor the next decade, the NSCL will be the premier rare isotope research\r\nfacility in the U.S., with a research focus on three major areas of\r\nforefront scientific interest:\r\n\t1. exploration of the nuclear processes that occur in explosive stellar\r\nenvironments and that are responsible for the ongoing synthesis of the\r\nelements in the cosmos;\r\n\t2. exploration of the properties of hot nuclear matter at sub- and\r\nsupra-normal densities (such as those found in neutron stars);\r\n\t3. exploration of exotic nuclei with unusual ratios of protons to\r\nneutrons and the determination of their properties.\r\n\r\n",
