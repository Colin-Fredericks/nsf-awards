While other\r\nconcrete equations like Isaacs equations from the stochastic optimal\r\ncontrol theory and special Lagrangian equations from calibration geometry\r\ndo not have the usual convexity condition. Only preliminary attempts were\r\nmade toward this direction in recent years. Though the complex\r\nMonge-Ampere equations have the usual convexity condition, the\r\nholomorphic invariance is too large. There is no theory of a priori\r\nestimates for the complex Monge-Ampere equations with non-smooth\r\nright hand side. This project concentrates on the following four parts. In\r\npart one, the objective is to derive Holder a priori estimates for\r\nfinitely piecewise linear Isaacs equations by further employment of the\r\nideas in recent work. In part two, the attempt is to study the regularity\r\nfor general fully nonlinear elliptic equations in 3-d in the light of\r\nrecent work that any homogeneous order two solution to fully nonlinear\r\nelliptic equation in 3-d must be linear. In part three, the purpose is to\r\nanswer whether any homogeneous order two solution to special Lagrangian\r\nequation of dimension four or higher is trivial. In part four, the aim is\r\nto study the Bernstein problem for complex Monge-Ampere equations.\r\n\r\nDifferential equations and differential geometry are further applications\r\nof Newton's calculus to the investigation of laws and shapes of nature,\r\nand even some phenomena of our real world. This project deals with some\r\nparticular equations, like Isaacs equations from optimal stochastic\r\ncontrol theory, special Lagrangian equations and complex Monge-Ampere\r\nequations from differential geometry. Understanding those equations would\r\nhave impacts on not only the related mathematical fields, but also fields\r\noutside mathematics like physics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
