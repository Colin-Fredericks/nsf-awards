 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe goals of this KTI-S project are to: enhance the professional development of the participating fellows and teachers; enhance science and mathematics capabilities and enthusiasm among the populations served; and investigate the effectiveness of the methods used.   The project builds on and expands the K-Through-Infinity Professional Development Partnership (KTI-P), a prior GK-12 project. Four different educational environments are included: a metropolitan science museum that serves urban Milwaukee schools; a local public school district revising its science and mathematics curricula and pedagogy; a local private K-16 school organization seeking to integrate its science curriculum; and a new District of Columbia Charter School that is working with UW-Madison researchers to develop its science curriculum.\r\n \r\nThe key element of our approach is a robust concept of team design developed during our first GK-12 project and implemented in many different settings. Fellows and teachers work with university and school district resources to develop new curricula and relevant, cutting edge materials coming out of research, map the standards to these products, and then implement them in classroom learning environments. Some fellows work intensively with a small number of teachers and classrooms, while others work with a larger number of teachers through such mechanisms as summer institutes and degree programs, and then follow those teachers back into multiple classrooms in different schools and even different districts and states. \r\n\r\nThe KTI-S teams work in ways aligned with school, district and state resource allocations.  KTI-S takes advantage of the four distinct educational settings and the extensive and intensive evaluation activities included to encourage Fellows, teachers and project staff to reflect on a larger question: how can team activities in very different settings be aligned with district, state, and university resources to most effectively help K-12 students learn, and experience the excitement of, science and mathematics, and in ways that provide fellows valuable K-12 classroom experience.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
