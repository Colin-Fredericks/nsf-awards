 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the University of California in Berkeley will upgrade two 400 MHz NMR Spectrometers with new consoles and variable temperature capabilities. This equipment will enable faculty to carry out research in the following areas:  a) exploratory and mechanistic studies of stoichiometric and catalytic organometallic reactions; b) synthesis of glycopeptide mimics by chemoselective ligation; c) applications of sulfonamides and sulfinamides to asymmetric synthesis and parallel synthesis; d) preparation, characterization and use of dendrimers; e) structure and dynamics of metallo-supramolecular assemblies; and f) cobalt-mediated syntheses.   \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including catalysis and materials chemistry.",
