 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a real time\r\ncoating property sensor to measure intrinsic material properties of thermal spray coatings.  The project proposes to develop this technology into a production capable tool for thermal spray process development and control with the following attributes: measures useful coating properties in situ; usable by real world spray shop operators at both small and large shops; relatively inexpensive (<$25K); able to operate in harsh environment; and uses minimal assumptions and complexities associated with property interpretation.  The project will demonstrate feasibility of producing such a tool under Phase I.  Under Phase II, a production tool will be developed and important relationships between the tool output and the functional properties of the coatings will be generated.  Despite this need, there are no simple procedures currently available to rapidly determine the mechanical properties of coatings both in laboratory and industrial settings. As thermal spray coatings evolve from a role of life extension of components to performing a prime reliant function, there exists a critical need to develop procedures to obtain design relevant properties.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this project will provide commercial thermal spray customers with engineering support directed at improving quality and repeatability of coatings application.  This should result in significant capital expenditure savings for companies over many disciplines that are involved in manufacturing.\r\n",
