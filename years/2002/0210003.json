Preliminary  results suggest that adsorption of CO2 could account for a small but significant percentage of the terrestrial CO2 sink, and exchange  between the aqueous and adsorbed phase could influence 14C dating in groundwater.  The preliminary data comes from experiments with tuff (felsic volcanic rock).  Core samples were isolated from the atmosphere at the time of drilling, and were later opened and heated under vacuum to extract inorganic dissolved carbon (DIC) from water in the rock pores.  Carbon recoveries in excess of available DIC suggest that a sizeable reservoir of adsorbed carbon exists in these rocks.\r\n\r\nA pilot project is proposed to investigate CO2 adsorption and associated isotopic fractionation on five volcanic rock materials representing suites of felsic and mafic minerals under dry, wetted, and saturated conditions.  Samples will be characterized for surface area, porosymmetry and mineralogy before use.  For dry and wetted experiments, crushed rock will be preheated at  2000C to generating adsorption isotherms, and again at 6000C in order to quatify the effect of trace organic coatings that may be present.  Adsorption isotherms will be measured under drying conditions and in the presence of a mono-layer of adsorbed water.  Isotopic fractionation will be evaluated by collecting head space gases after equilibration and measuring the d 13C of initial and equilibrated CO2.  Isotopic exchange will be evaluated by reintroducing CO2 with a unique d13 C signature and measuring head space gases again after equilibration.  Adsorption in saturated systems will be measured by introducing CO2 into the head space of a saturated slurry and monitoring the head space CO2 concentration and the pH to calculate the mass partitioned into the aqueous and adsorbed phases.  Isotopic fractionation and exchange will be measured in the same fashion as for dry and wetted experiments.\r\n\r\nResults from this work will be used as a first step in estimating the magnitude of CO2 adsorption as a terrestrial sink of atmospheric CO2, and the extent to which adsoption and exchange may alter 14C activities in groundwater.  The results will also be used to formulate a more targeted study of adsorption sites and mechanisms.  Educational impacts of the study include student training at both the graduate and undergraduate level.\r\n",
