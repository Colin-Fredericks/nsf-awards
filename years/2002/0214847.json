 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project  proposes to develop a novel, electro-optical sensor capable of capturing single airborne particles and analyzing their compositions on a time scale of a few minutes. The sensor concept is based on a previously developed innovative technology for single-particle electrodynamic capture and Raman spectroscopy. The electrodynamic trap is capable of capturing and suspending single airborne particles of sizes 1 to 100 m. Analysis of the trapped particle by Raman spectroscopy provides a fingerprint of the vibrational structures of the particle's chemical components, analogous to that obtained by infrared absorption spectroscopy, but with single-particle sensitivity. This in turn leads to identification of the particle as bacterial or otherwise, as well as to preliminary identification of the bacterial species. In this Phase I project,  a compact sensor that can continually screen ambient habitat air and analyze each trapped particle on a time scale of minutes will be devised.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in defense and health-related industries. \r\n",
