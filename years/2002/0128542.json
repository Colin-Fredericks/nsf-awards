 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a new low cost electro- chemical fabrication method to produce flexible photovoltaic cells based on the commercially important copper indium diselenide (CIS) films. The project will develop an innovative n-CIS solar cell with fewer components and processing steps. The cell will be constructed on a flexible foil to reduce weight, fragility and balance-of-system costs. The project also develops a new roll-to-roll electrodeposition technology for large volume manufacturing. Phase I will synthesize CIS films and construct n/p heterojunction devices on metal foils. It will evaluate the solar cell performance to validate the concepts. The proposed n-CIS solar cell configuration and its fabrication are specially designed to simplify manufacturing, reduce costs and increase production speed. It will circumvent the complexity, expense, safety and scale-up issues of the present p-CIS technology. Its commercialization will provide a timely solution to the nation's escalating energy and environmental problems. It will avert future power crises and help reduce global warming.\r\n\r\nApplications for the copper indium diselenide technology range from the electric utility to satellites. Flexible, lightweight, photovoltaic cells may be used in non-utility applications such as electric vehicles, building integration, mobile systems and new space systems. Lower costs, fewer components and easier manufacturing could translate into a wider spectrum of commercial markets.",
