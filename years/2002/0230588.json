The project will develop lower level engineering courses that utilize the strengths of\r\nboth faculties. The result of this collaboration will be engineering courses that are more attractive to a\r\ndiverse range of students and the development of high school teachers who appreciate engineering design\r\nand encourage their students to explore applied science design issues and careers.\r\n\r\nWith this planning grant, an inquiry-based pilot course in structural design will be used to explore\r\nthe role of an Engineering-Education collaboration in improving engineering education. A second-year\r\ncourse, ioIntroduction to Structural Designlr, will be planned and taught. It will be accessible for Secondary\r\nEducation majors while maintaining the necessary technical content for Engineering students. The course\r\nwill provide the rudiments of structural design for Education majors and lower-level Engineering students.\r\nStudents completing the course will participate in jointly taught coursework, will learn both technical\r\ncontent and educational methods, and will be prepared for higher-level coursework within their major. The\r\ncollaborators will develop a general methodology for team-teaching of modified engineering content that\r\ncan be employed throughout the curriculum in a series of courses to provide content for Education students.\r\nIf the first course is successful, a detailed plan for further collaboration including other collaborative\r\ncourses, possibly involving local engineering projects, will be developed.\r\n",
