 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project examines the feasibility of using gestural interface technology and interactive robotics to facilitate receptive and expressive language development of children with severe and/or multiple disabilities.  Developed by AnthroTronix, Inc., the technology uses a child friendly robot controlled by various interfaces adapted to individual needs, regardless of physical limitations.  The robot imitates movements and tells the child's written or spoken stories, providing reinforcements and motivation for learning.  Speech and language impairments, affecting 10% of school children, including most children with severe disabilities, significantly impact abilities to read, write and communicate.  Objectives are to examine the technology's (a) applicability across a range of disabilities, ages, and interventions in the promotion of speech, language, reading, and writing skills, and (b) ease of use by therapists and teachers.   Methods will include qualitative data and pre-post tests with 3-5 children representing a range of disabilities, cultural backgrounds, and ages who attend a K-5 public school.  Results will enable Beta Prototype design specifying a range of applications for children with disabilities and  will determine specific interventions to be tested in the next phase of the research.\r\n\r\nCompletion of the project will enable the refinement of the hardware and software to target specified interventions that promote language literacy across a range of children with disabilities.  The technology will be marketed in a package that includes a CD-ROM and instructional manual to teachers and therapists working with children with disabilities.",
