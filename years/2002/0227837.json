The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 02060).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Eastern Iowa Community College (Lead Institution), Iowa State University, University of Iowa, City of Davenport, Kaizen Corporation, USDA-Peoria Research Lab, and DavenportOne.\r\n\r\nThe program produces web-based publication of summaries of emerging research written in language for the business/investment audience, training curriculum to educate entrepreneurs in AG-based Biotech business, and a model for economic development of rural communities in the AG-based biotech sector. Continuing education/training for business developers will be conducted. In addition, they will create a system to capture and screen emerging Agriculture Technology-Bioscience ideas, technologies, and patents that have marketplace potential; communicate research information to potential entrepreneurs and the economic development community of eastern Iowa; educate potential entrepreneurs, business development consultants/trainers and economic development professionals on the process of creating a business based on emerging research; disseminate the results and practices to other regions; promote the development and effective use of Native American governments for economic development and management of their lands;  and establish internship programs in industry and government for the workforce. \r\n\r\nThe AG-based Biotech sector produced $1B in 1995, and is expected to reach $10B by 2005.  The community college expertise in training coupled with the research universities is a powerful team to produce both the sources of technologies and the trained workforce to create new companies in this rapidly growing economic sector.  The community colleges can also provide continued business tech support to small emerging companies to improve their probability of success in the early stages of development.  Eastern Iowa is suited to be a large player in this emerging technology sector, resulting in economic well being and creation of new jobs. The model will also be helpful to other rural, agriculture-based regions.\r\n",
