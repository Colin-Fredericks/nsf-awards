 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the proposed research effort is to develop methodology which\r\nallows simulation of effects playing an important role in nano-scale\r\ndevices, within the framework of existing device simulators. The important\r\nunderlying mechanisms are, on one hand, quantum effects such as tunneling\r\nand quantization, and, on the other hand, many-body effects, electron-ion\r\ninteractions and single-dopant effects. The goal of the project is to\r\ninclude these effects into existing models and codes in such a way, that\r\ntheir influence on device performance is accurately represented, while\r\nsimulations can be made at a computational cost comparable to that of\r\nexisting particle-based device simulators. The basic approach to achieve\r\nthis goal consists of the use of novel forms of effective quantum potentials\r\nand quantum versions of existing particle-based approaches to simulate\r\nshort-range many-body interactions. Comparison will be made with\r\nexperimental data provided by the Nanostructures Research Group at ASU, and\r\nIntel and Motorola.  The calibrated tools can help device designers in\r\nfabricating optimal device structures with a reduced cost. The educational\r\neffort of this project will be closely tied to the proposed research\r\nactivities. This will be accomplished via specially developed\r\ninterdisciplinary courses in a classical as well as a distance learning\r\nformat, and through the direct participation of students in the research\r\nproject on the graduate as well as the undergraduate level.  Course\r\nmaterials will be developed for this purpose and will be placed on the\r\nComputational Electronics Hub that is being developed as part of an existing\r\nNSF sponsored project.",
