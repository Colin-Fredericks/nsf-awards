One application of this work is to well-posedness\r\nfor quasi-linear hyperbolic equations with initial data of low Sobolev\r\nregularity. In joint work the investigator has established a best possible\r\nresult for general quasi-linear equations with quadratic growth in the\r\ninhomogeneity; proposed work investigates relaxing the regularity assumption\r\nin special cases such as the Einstein vacuum equation, where a null condition\r\nindicates that better results should hold. Wave packet techniques are\r\nalso being used to establish norm estimates for eigenfunctions on\r\nRiemannian manifolds with metrics of limited differentiability.\r\nThe proposed research includes establishing best possible bounds\r\nfor compact manifolds with Lp pinched curvature. The investigator\r\nis also adapting the above methods to establish norm estimates\r\non solutions to mixed-type wave equations with Dirichlet conditions on a\r\nconvex obstacle. This is carried out by reflecting the metric across the\r\nboundary to obtain a Lipschitz metric on an open set. The geometry of\r\nthe resulting geodesic flow suggests that wave packet techniques can be\r\nused to establish the same norm estimates on solutions as hold in the\r\nnon-obstacle case.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research involves the study of waves traveling in rough media;\r\na rough medium being one where the physics which governs the speed of waves\r\nchanges abruptly from point to point. By studying the properties of a\r\nspecial family of localized solitary waves, the investigator is able to\r\nanswer questions about the possible concentration of energy that can occur\r\nfor general waves traveling in such media. This work has important\r\napplications in the study of nonlinear wave equations; that is, situations\r\nwhere the wave can be considered to interact with itself. One such example\r\nis the gravitational field equation arising from Einstein's general theory\r\nof relativity, where the geometry of space itself is the object of the\r\nequation. Rough solutions, and thus a rough media, necessarily arise when\r\nconsidering what kind of singularities the theory can lead to. The research\r\nalso has implications for investigating the fundamental vibrational modes\r\nin rough media. It is known that refraction in such media can lead to high\r\nconcentrations of energy that can be detected by examining these modes.\r\nWork is being done to relate the possible degree of concentration of energy\r\nto the roughness of the underlying media. The research finds applications\r\nas well in studying the reflection of waves off obstacles. The techniques\r\ndeveloped to study rough media are being used to show that waves reflecting\r\noff of convex obstacles must diffuse to the same degree as do waves\r\ntraveling without reflection.\r\n\r\n",
