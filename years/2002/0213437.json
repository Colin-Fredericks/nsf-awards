 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant cell wall is a dynamic structure that can be modified in response\r\nto developmental and environmental signals.  In this manner, the cell wall\r\nprovides structural information that helps maintain cellular form and\r\nfunction during plant growth.  The structure of the cell wall also changes\r\nin response to pathogen infection and stresses, such as drought, high salt\r\nand cold temperature, in a manner that helps protect plants from biotic and\r\nabiotic stresses when grown in natural environments.  Expression of many of\r\nthe structural proteins in the wall have been shown to be cell-type\r\nspecific, suggesting that these proteins play novel roles in modifying cell\r\nwall structure in order to provide mechanical strength and assist in proper\r\nwall assembly.\r\n\r\nProline-rich proteins (PRPs) represent an integral family of structural\r\ncell wall proteins whose expression has been linked to active growth in a\r\nnumber of plant systems.  We have used a combination of PRP promoter/GUS\r\nfusions and epitope-tagging to characterize the expression of these genes\r\nin arabidopsis and their localization to the walls of specific cell types.\r\nTwo of these proteins, AtPRP1 and AtPRP3, are expressed during the early\r\nstages of root hair outgrowth but are localized within different regions of\r\nthe root hair cell wall.  These results suggest that individual PRP gene\r\nfamily members may play distinct roles in helping to establish root hair\r\ncell wall structure during wall assembly.  In addition, we have shown that\r\nAtPRP4 is expressed in guard cells and localizes to the inner shelf of the\r\nguard cell wall.  We have isolated several T-DNA insertion alleles for\r\nthese three proteins and we propose to characterize the loss-of-function\r\nphenotypes in these mutants associated with root hair and guard cell\r\nfunction.  In addition, we will examine the ability of epitope-tagged PRP\r\nsequences to become cross-linked within the wall in wild type and mutant\r\nPRP backgrounds.  In combination, these experimental approaches should\r\nprovide new insight into the nature of the amino acid sequences encoded\r\nwithin individual AtPRPs that are sufficient for their targeted\r\nlocalization within the cell wall and their insolubilization within the\r\nextracellular matrix.\r\n\r\nIdentification of the function of structural cell wall proteins in defining\r\ncell-type specific matrix structures is an important first step in our\r\nability to modify the cell walls of plants in a manner that will let them\r\ngrow in adverse environments.  We have shown that the AtPRP proteins\r\nparticipate in determining cell wall structure in guard cells and root\r\nhairs, two cell types that are crucial for nutrient uptake and maintenance\r\nof water balance during growth.  Further analysis of the function of these\r\nproteins may allow us to devise novel mechanisms for enhancing plant growth\r\nunder conditions of water and/or nutrient limitation.\r\n\r\n",
