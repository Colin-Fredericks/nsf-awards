 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the roles of affective imagery and cultural\r\nworldviews in risk perception, decision-making and behavior, using global\r\nclimate change as a case study. Past research has focused on the role of\r\ncognitive factors like knowledge, mental models and general environmental\r\nbeliefs in risk perceptions of climate change. Recent research, however, has\r\nalso begun to focus on the role of affective factors. This project will\r\ndevelop and test affective image analysis as an innovative method to study\r\npublic risk perceptions along both cognitive and affective dimensions.\r\nAdditionally, cultural theorists argue that cultural worldviews are also\r\nimportant factors and need to be included as explanatory variables. This\r\nproject will operationalize and test the predictions of cultural theory.\r\nFinally, many researchers assume that risk perceptions and behaviors\r\ncorrelate, yet little focused research has been done. This research will\r\ntest this assumption, using climate change as a case study.\r\n\r\nThis project also addresses several applied questions: Does the American\r\npublic perceive global climate change as a serious risk? What specifically\r\ndo they fear about it? Do these risk perceptions translate into personal\r\nactions and/or support for mitigation policies?  This research will\r\ncontribute to the continuing discussion on global climate change, as\r\nscientists and policymakers attempt to find scientifically appropriate and\r\npublicly acceptable solutions to this global problem.",
