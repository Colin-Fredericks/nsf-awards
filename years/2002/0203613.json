 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Vessel (R/V) Cape Hatteras is a general purpose Regional Class vessel, owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the Duke University/University of North Carolina Oceanographic Consortium.  Since its construction and delievery in 1981, the vessel has operated from its homeport at Duke University Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, North Carolina.  For the past 20 years, the vessel has supported a variety of oceanographic research funded by the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, United States Geological Survey, Naval Oceanographic Office, the Department of Energy, and the State of North Carolina.  Funds in this proposal were requested to upgrade and enhance the capabilities of the R/V Cape Hatteras.  Renovations and modifications will enable scientists to utilize state of the art instrumentation and equipment; to work on a safe and modern platform; and allow  the ship to operate for approximately another 10 years in the North Atlantic coastal region.  This mid-life refit would include the renovation and upgrading of all cabins, labs, and interior spaces; relocation of the aft crane to the winch deck; the addition of two science berths; the replacement of all helm and engine controls; the replacement of most interior plumbing; and the replacement of all exterior and interior coatings.\r\n***\r\n",
