 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information theory has enjoyed over fifty years of rigorous research,\r\ndevelopment, and application.\r\nIn spite of its relative maturity,\r\nnew challenges arise due to novel  applications and emerging theoretical\r\ndevelopments (e.g., there is a resurgence of interest in source\r\ncoding in multimedia applications, molecular biology, and security).\r\nIn the 1997 Shannon  Lecture Jacob Ziv\r\npresented compelling arguments for ``backing off'' to a certain extent\r\nfrom first-order asymptotic analysis of information\r\nsystems in order to predict the behavior of real systems with\r\nfinite (and often small) lengths (of sequences, files, codes,\r\ndatabases, etc.) One way of overcoming these difficulties is to\r\nincrease accuracy of asymptotic analysis by replacing first-order\r\nanalyses (e.g., a leading term of the average code length)\r\nby full asymptotic expansions and more\r\naccurate analyses (e.g., large deviations, central limit laws).\r\n\r\nThis research primarily focuses on an important aspect of\r\nsource coding, namely, the redundancy rate problem.\r\nRecent years have seen a resurgence of interest in\r\nredundancy rates of lossless and lossy coding.\r\nWe describe analytic, combinatorial and algorithmic methods that\r\nwork hand in hand to solve this and other problems in information theory.\r\nThe redundancy rate problem for\r\na class of sources corresponds to determining the extent to which\r\nthe actual code length exceeds the optimal code length.\r\nThis problem is an ideal candidate\r\nfor second-order asymptotics\r\nsince one must look beyond the leading term of the code length,\r\nwhich is known to be the entropy of the source.\r\nFollowing Hadamard's precept we study these problems using\r\ntechniques of complex analysis such as generating functions,\r\nRice's formula, Mellin transform, Fourier series,\r\nsequence distributed modulo 1, saddle point methods,\r\nanalytic poissonization and depoissonization, and\r\nsingularity analysis.  We present new results for\r\nwell-studied problems (e.g., optimal codes for maximal redundancy,\r\nmemoryless and Markovian sources) as well as novel formulations of old problems\r\n(e.g., redundancy of the class of mixing sources, redundancy of\r\narithmetic coding and the Lemepl-Ziv codes). Furthermore,\r\nwe apply the techniques developed as a part of this study\r\nto related problems such as prediction (based on pattern matching),\r\nrandom number generators, the average worst case probability of\r\nundetected error in channel coding, pattern matching approach to\r\n(exact and approximate) run length coding, and others.",
