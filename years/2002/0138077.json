 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will offer new insights into cross-cultural differences in superior-subordinate interaction in rapidly changing organizational settings in three countries of the European Union (EU) and in the U.S. The study will challenge the traditional assumption from U.S. research findings that managers are seen as subordinates' major link to their information environment. In this light the subordinates' information inquiry process will be explored in terms of frequency, types of information sought, other relevant information sources, and their information seeking tactics. Based on interview and survey data, the study will provide useful information on the underlying dynamics of superior-subordinate relationships in terms of: 1. the level of subordinate pro-activity in soliciting different types of information; 2. the differences in tactics used to solicit various types of information; 3. the effect of a superior's leadership style on the extent and nature of information inquiry; and 4. the influence of organizational norms/rules on inquiry patterns. Upon exploring such dynamics within each of the four countries, cross-country comparisons will be made, looking at the moderating effect of major relevant cultural dimensions such as vertical individualism and power distance.\r\n\r\nThe study will make a contribution to the field of organizational behavior through a distinctive inquiry into subordinate information seeking patterns in the context of both organizational turbulence and of cross-cultural comparison. This information is crucial in times of rapid organizational change and international interdependence, when information inquiry in the midst of such an environment is of strategic importance.",
