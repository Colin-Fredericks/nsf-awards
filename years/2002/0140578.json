 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues study permutation and linear\r\nrepresentations of finite and algebraic groups. The focus is\r\non primitive permutation representations and irreducible\r\nlinear representations.  These results will be applied to\r\nmonodromy groups of coverings of curves and higher dimensional\r\nvarieties over finite fields and to various questions in\r\nprobabilistic group theory.  The investigator expects to make\r\nsignificant progress on outstanding conjectures about automorphism\r\ngroups of curves in positive characteristic, the size of images\r\nof rational points for maps between varieties over finite fields\r\nand monodromy groups of coverings of curves of small genus.\r\nIn characteristic zero, the investigator and collaborators plan\r\nto obtain a complete classification of the possible monodromy\r\ngroups of indecomposable rational functions.  This is a much\r\nmore ambitious project than the solution of the Guralnick-Thompson\r\nconjecture that was recently solved.  The techniques involve\r\ndetailed analysis of properties of simple groups and translating\r\nproblems in arithmetic algebraic geometry to group theory.\r\nMany of these results will give detailed information about\r\nquestions in probabilistic group theory as well.\r\n\r\nSince the classification of finite simple groups was announced\r\nin the late 1970's, there have been some remarkable applications\r\nof this theorem in many areas of mathematics.  This proposal\r\ncontinues in this tradition.  There is also a long history of\r\ntranslating problems in number theory and geometry (particularly\r\nover finite fields) to group theory.  The investigator intends\r\nto obtain quite detailed results about finite simple groups\r\nand their subgroups.  Some of the investigation into finite simple\r\ngroups is quite natural but other aspects are motivated by applications\r\nto curves and varieties over finite fields. This will give insight into\r\nvarious problems about maps over finite fields -- in particular, about\r\npolynomials and rational functions.  This has applications to\r\ncoding theory and cryptography as well as answering basic\r\nquestions in the field.  A special case of this is the study\r\nof \"exceptional\" polynomials.  These were first studied by\r\nDickson in his thesis in the 1890's.  The major result in\r\nthe area, using the classification of simple groups, was only\r\nobtained in 1993 by Fried, Saxl and the proposer. The investigator\r\nintends to classify all such polynomials.  These results about\r\nsimple groups will also give detailed information about probabilistic\r\ngeneration of finite groups.  These kinds of questions have become\r\nincreasingly important in the design of algorithms in computational\r\nalgebra.  These results show that by following certain recipes, one\r\ncan be reasonably sure of picking a generating set for your\r\nfavorite finite group.\r\n",
