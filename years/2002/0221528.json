 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Next Generation Internet (NGI) poses scalability challenges to the efficient operation of \r\nthe  transport  protocol  (TCP).  In  particular,  as  the  product  (bandwidth  x  delay)  grows,  the \r\ncongestion window required to .fill the pipe. becomes quite large, especially on cross-country \r\nlinks. One well known  problem in TCP in this scenario is the selection of the .initial \r\nwindow.. More recently, new challenges have emerged because of the increasing popularity \r\nof nomadic access to the Internet via wireless links (e.g., wireless LANs, satellite links, \r\nUMTS, etc).  The data rates on wireless links have been constantly on the rise, approaching \r\nthe 50Mbps on 802.11a wireless LANs and thus providing an effective extension of backbone \r\nservices to mobile users. However, wireless links tend to introduce random packet errors and \r\nloss  that are not correlated to congestion.  This creates problems to conventional TCP \r\nprotocols (e.g., TCP New Reno and TCP SACK), which interpret any loss as a buffer overflow \r\n(i.e., as a symptom of congestion) and thus reduce the congestion window unnecessarily with \r\nconsequent loss in performance. The drop in performance is proportional to the (bandwidth x \r\nlength) product  of the connection and can be quite significant in the high  bandwidth NGI \r\nenvironment, especially on cross country paths  including .last hop wireless LANs, UMTS \r\nlinks, or  high bandwidth satellites.   \r\nSeveral  approaches  to  enhance TCP  congestion  control  over  high bandwidth  wireless  links \r\nhave  been  reported  in  the  literature  (e.g.,  TCP  Peach,  TCP Westwood  (TCPW)).  Some  of \r\nthese  enhancements  have  been  quite  successful.  For  example,  TCPW,  a  TCP  variant  that \r\nuses bottleneck bandwidth share estimation. to adjust the congestion window upon loss, has \r\nshown scalable properties and good link utilization in large leaky pipes., (i.e. large \r\nbandwidth delay product, and non negligible  random packet loss).  \r\nThis proposal is about carrying out a systematic, experimental investigation of performance \r\nof TCP over wired/wireless paths. This investigation will include the comparison of various \r\nTCP enhancements proposed so far in the literature. It will consider a representative set of \r\nexperimental  environments  and  application  scenarios.  The  proposed  project  is  in  part \r\nmotivated  by  our  recent  positive  experience  with  TCPW  Internet  experiments  of  large  file \r\ntransfers over lossy paths. In this project the researchers will broaden the scope to include a vast gamut of TCP wireless enhancement techniques. The researchers  will  identify the pros and cons of each scheme, characterize the traffic/network environment for which it is best suited, and, more generally, develop  models  that  relate  wireless  media  characteristics,  TCP    congestion  control \r\nparameters and performance results.   \r\nIn summary, given:  (1) the increasing importance of nomadic computing and  wireless access  \r\nto the high speed wired Internet; (2) the performance degradations observed in conventional \r\nTCP  protocols  over  wireless  path,  and  (3)  the  encouraging  improvements  offered  by \r\nmodified, wireless versions  of  TCP  (which  yet  retain  the  basic  end  to  end  paradigm),  the researchers believe this a very appropriate time to engage in a systematic, experimentally based \r\nevaluation of wireless TCP  protocols  by  a  team  that  includes  protocol  developers, \r\napplications developers and network measurement experts.",
