 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to explore the effects of team-based effects on learning engineering at the undergraduate level.  The work will be undertaken in two main phases.  The first phase includes the development, validation, and testing of a new student assessment protocol for team-based learning in engineering.  The second phase includes the development and use of an observation protocol in assessing team behaviors, which will be used in refining the model of team design offered in the proposal.  Several propositions have been put forth as to what factors affect the outcomes of group learning experiences. The work will take place at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Pennsylvania State University, and with students participating in electronic teams as part of the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA).  The team represents expertise in engineering and educational psychology.\r\n",
