Ellison of North Carolina State University and Anne Decourchelle of the Astrophysics Department of the Center for Nuclear Studies in Saclay, France.  They propose to study the self-consistent theory of nonlinear particle acceleration and photon emission in supernova remants.  The objective is to provide an accurate and efficient means of interpreting X-ray and GeV gamma ray emissions in supernova remnants and TeV gamma rays. The research utilizes data collected during various space missions, including the US Chandra and European mission XMM-Newton, and data obtained from current and future spacecraft missions and ground-based telescopes.  \r\n\r\nThe US investigator brings to this collaboration on expertise in shock acceleration and cosmic ray origins.  This is complemented by French expertise in X-rays from shock heated plasma emissions in supernova remnants and experience with data gathered through spacecraft missions.  The collaboration will lead to a new state-of the art code that will advance understanding of the shock acceleration of cosmic rays and impact other astrophysics topics, such as, the origin of cosmic rays and the evolution of supernova remnants and their influence on interstellar medium.\r\n\r\nThis award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).  NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator. The CNRS will support visits by French researcher to the United States. \r\n",
