 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joint Performance Optimization of Wireless Networks and Control Systems\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent control technology is not well suited\r\nto operation over a packet based network, and conversely,\r\nmost networks are not optimized for control applications.  \r\nMoreover, critical network performance parameters that affect control\r\nsystem performance, such as bit rates\r\nand delay and packet loss statistics, depend on various\r\nchoices made in the network, such as powers allocated to wireless\r\ntransmitters, bandwidths or time-slot fractions allocated to \r\nchannels, and routing methods.\r\nSo in addition to the challenge of working out how a control\r\nsystem can be made to work in a packet-based \r\nnetworked environment, we also\r\nhave the challenge of working out how the network should be \r\nconfigured, or operated, so as to improve control system performance.\r\nThis proposal addresses two fundamental issues that arise.\r\nNeither solves the whole problem, but each addresses a critical issue.\r\n\r\nThe first topic involves joint optimization of\r\na controller and critical communication and network\r\nparameters such as transmit powers, packet routing, and\r\nbandwidth and time-slot allocation. \r\nTo simplify this problem, only the affects of these\r\nnetwork parameters on bit rates, hence quantization noise, is \r\nconsidered.  The second topic considered is\r\nsimultaneous routing and resource allocation for wireless\r\ndata networks.\r\nThis is the problem of jointly finding an optimal set\r\nof flows and communication resources that maximize the performance of\r\nthe network, with respect to some objective such as optimal\r\ncontrol system performance.\r\nHere we hope to develop algorithms to dynamically allocate\r\ncommunication resources (such as transmit powers, bandwidth)\r\nand simultaneously optimize routing decisions.\r\n",
