 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fields Institute in Toronto, Ontario is running an intensive\r\nprogram in Applications of Set Theory to Analysis from September\r\nto December 2002.  This is an award for the support of junior\r\nU.S.  participants in that international program.  Long-term\r\nactivities in the semester include graduate courses and seminars,\r\nand shorter activities include a workshop on Descriptive Set\r\nTheory and a workshop on Banach Spaces, Algebras, and Subspaces\r\nof Baire Class 1 Functions.\r\n\r\nEven people whose only contact with higher mathematics comes from\r\nwatching reruns of \"Star Trek\" or \"The Simpsons\" will have encountered\r\nthe phenomenon that the decimal expansion of Pi requires infinitely\r\nmany digits. The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its\r\ndiameter, therefore, is a manifestation of the actual, as opposed to\r\njust the potential, infinite. While the existence of the actual\r\ninfinite has had a profound influence on mathematics, its acceptance\r\nwas not immediate and the history of the subject is fraught with\r\ncontroversy.  Two major branches of mathematics which devote much of\r\ntheir resources to the study of the infinite are analysis and set\r\ntheory. Much of analysis is concerned with understanding limiting\r\nbehaviour in various contexts. A simple prototype of this is found in\r\nconsidering the number Pi as the limit of increasingly longer finite\r\ndecimal approximations to Pi. Many of the spaces which analysts study\r\nconsist of limits of simpler objects. Set theory, on the other hand,\r\nstudies the infinite in a more abstract setting, concentrating on the\r\ncombinatorial and structural implications of the infinite. While the\r\nconnections between set theory and analysis have always been\r\nacknowledged, too much of the work in these two areas has gone on\r\nlargely unheeded by researchers in the other area. The chief purpose\r\nof the current proposal is to create an environment where leading set\r\ntheorists and analysts can collaborate on problems which straddle the\r\nboundaries of their subjects.\r\n",
