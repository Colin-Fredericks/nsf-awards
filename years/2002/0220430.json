 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports students in Fairleigh Dickinson University's (FDU) new program in applied mathematics. FDU's current undergraduate enrollment in the mathematical and computer sciences is 135 fulltime students. Approximately one half of these undergraduates are academically talented, but financially needy (as per the criteria defined by the U.S. Department of Education). FDU actively recruits in the New York City metropolitan area, an area of high population density near inner city secondary schools. Students who participate in the new mathematics program come from the current FDU population, from regional high schools and from community colleges as transfer students. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the mathematics program are to encourage and enable qualified students to enter the high technology workforce following completion of their BS degrees. This emphasis was selected by an FDU university committee because of several intersecting factors: 1) The northern NJ/NYC metropolitan area contains dozens of medium-to-large potential industrial partners who have a documented need for this type \r\nof workforce. These organizations include Merck, Pfizer, Bristol-Meyers Squibb (pharmaceuticals), and ISO, Aetna, Prudential and other casualty and life insurance firms; 2) The U.S. demographics strongly indicate a growing need for such a national technology workforce to keep pace with foreign competition in medical, pharmaceutical and actuarial research and production; 3) There has been an ongoing national decline in numbers of students entering the mathematical sciences. The possible high-technology workforce shortfall in this strong growth area appears to be increasing. A survey of schools in the region revealed there are few applied and computational mathematics programs currently offered by regional universities. There are none that specifically train students to enter the high-technology workforce as statisticians or actuaries immediately following receipt of an undergraduate mathematics degree. \r\n \r\n",
