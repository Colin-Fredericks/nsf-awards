The program will implement strategies for introducing both graduate students and undergraduate students to the research environment at a much earlier stage than usual and acquainting them with a greater number of faculty.   It will increase the interactions between graduate and undergraduate students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and senior faculty.  \r\n\r\nFirst-year graduate students will take a course, Invitation to Research, consisting of a number of short lecture series, taught by many different faculty, providing a glimpse into the various areas of mathematics in an informal setting.  Beginning in their second year, students will be involved in Working Group Rotations that acquaint them with different areas of mathematics, different research styles, and different faculty throughout the year. The graduate students' professional development is rounded out with courses that train them in effective communication of mathematics.  These initiatives will enhance the effectiveness of the graduate program, lessen the time students require to obtain a Ph.D., and improve their employment opportunities in academia and in industry.\r\n\r\nPostdoctoral fellows will participate in the full spectrum of VIGRE activities.  Undergraduate students will be involved in working group activities, in the Ross Summer Mathematics Program for high school students and teachers, and in a National Undergraduate Mathematics Research Conference that will be sponsored by Ohio State University.  \r\n",
