 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Programs, Prof. Brooks H. Pate of the University of Virginia will develop a state-of-the-art laser 2D microwave spectrometer.  This will introduce time-domain molecular rotational spectroscopy as a new technique to study chemical reaction dynamics.  Chemical reactions are described as population transfer between different localized structures.  For example, the reaction can take place between different electronic states where the electronic configuration is different for the reactant and product.  Molecular isomerization reactions can similarly be described as changes in the nuclear configuration of the molecule.  One common feature of reactions is that the molecular structure is usually different in the reacting configurations.  For isomerization reactions, this result is readily apparent.  For reactions between different electronic states, there is often a structural change caused by the different bonding of the two electronic configurations.  During the chemical reaction the moments-of-intertia are time-dependent quantities.  The reaction kinetics can, therefore, be determined by measuring the time evolution of the rotational spectrum.   \r\n\r\nThe successful development of this new field of molecular spectroscopy will make it possible to unravel reaction pathways for complex reactions involving several isomers.\r\n",
