 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discrete event systems (DESs) are systems evolving according to the occurrence of certain discrete qualitative changes, called events.  Examples of events include the arrival of a customer in a queue, the termination of an algorithm in a computer program, the loss of a message packet in a communication network, the breakdown of a machine in a manufacturing system.\r\n\r\nIn this proposal we consider stochastic DESs modeled by Markov processes, and study control problems that satisfy qualitative properties.  We outline a program of work aiming to develop a unified framework for qualitative control of stochastic DESs.  In particular, we propose to study the control of stochastic systems with general qualitative constraints such as safety, non-blocking, recurrence, and stability; optimal control subject to qualitative constraints; control under complete or partial observations; effects of using deterministic versus randomized policies; and effects of using stationary versus non-stationary and asymptotically stationary control policies.\r\n\r\nSafety constraints are specified as unit-interval-valued vectors serving as an upper bound for the state probability distribution of the controlled Markov chain.  Non-blocking specifications require that the probability of hitting a target set of states stays above a certain minimum value.  Recurrence or liveness amounts to the probability of hitting a target set of states infinitely-often being bounded below by a positive constant, while convergence or stability demands that the state probability distribution enters and stays in a `safe' set within a finite number of steps.\r\n",
