 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Educational Television Endowment of South Carolina, in collaboration with the South\r\nCarolina Educational Television Network (SCETV), will carry out a program to increase middle\r\nschool girls' enthusiasm for and understanding of technology and introduce them to women who\r\nwork in science and technology fields. The project is a three-year pilot program called TECH\r\nTEAM that consists of afterschool technology clubs, workshops in computer applications at\r\nSCETV and Summer Technology Day Camps. Partners include the Girl Scouts of the Congaree\r\nArea, Inc., the Girl Scout Council of the Pee Dee Area, and the College of Education of the\r\nUniversity of South Carolina. In addition to the girls themselves, TECH TEAM will train the club\r\nfacilitators - teachers and Girl Scout leaders - in video and computer-based technologies, project\r\nbased curriculum development and techniques for gender equitable education in an annual series\r\nof Saturday workshops.\r\n\r\nThe TECH TEAM project will take place in three South Carolina school districts - the School\r\nDistrict of Fairfield County, Richland District One and Marion District One - all of which are\r\nconsidered critical needs districts. Fairfield is a rural county in which 40.8% of the adults have\r\nless than a high school education and unemployment is at the second highest level in the state.\r\nMarion District One is in a poor, rural area in which 76% of the students qualify for free or\r\nreduced lunch, over 50% come from single parent homes and 75% are minority. Richland District\r\nOne is an urban district. 80% of students are minority and 58% qualify for free or reduced lunch.\r\n\r\nTECH TEAM is designed to increase girls' technological fluency through a progressive sequence\r\nof technology applications in a hands-on, project based setting. In the first year, 2002-2003, the\r\ngirls will videotape interviews with local women who work in the fields of science, math,\r\ntechnology and engineering. To locate their interviewees, they will learn and use research skills,\r\nincluding both informal and Internet-based techniques. The girls will edit their videos using a\r\ncomputer-based editing program, and broadcast them to schools across South Carolina via\r\nSCETV's Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS). They will host two-way call-in shows on\r\nthe ITFS, allowing students anywhere in the state to respond and ask the girls questions.\r\nIn the second year of the project, 2003-2004, the girls will create a Web site about TECH TEAM\r\nthat will be integrated into www.knowitall.org, SCETV's Web portal for teachers and students. The\r\ngirls will design the layout of their site and publish writing, post videos and contribute to a\r\nthreaded discussion that will be developed for the site. In TECH TEAM's third year, 2004-2005,\r\nthe girls will create a searchable database of their videos for inclusion on the site, adding dynamic\r\nelements that require the use of computer codes, so that they extend their fluency in the use of\r\ncomputer technology. They will learn about SQL (Structured Query Language), and they will\r\ndevelop CFML (Cold Fusion Markup Language) to make their databases Web accessible. In\r\naddition to the afterschool clubs, they will attend a series of Saturday workshops taught by\r\nSCETV programmers.\r\n\r\nDuring each summer of the project the TECH TEAM girls will attend a Summer Technology Day\r\nCamps at SCETV's Telecommunications Center in Columbia. The camps will allow all the\r\nparticipants to meet each other, work in SCETV's computer labs, and present their work to an\r\ninvited audience. Throughout each year a video crew will document the progress of TECH TEAM\r\non videotape and interview the participants. This material will form the basis of a CD-ROM to be\r\nproduced for teachers' professional development. The CD will be mailed free of charge to every\r\nmiddle school in South Carolina and will be made available nationwide through SCETV's\r\nmarketing division. Evaluation and assessment of TECH TEAM will be conducted by Dr. Kenneth\r\nStevenson of the College of Education of the University of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe impact of TECH TEAM goes beyond gender equity considerations to universal issues of\r\ntechnology education, teacher training, adolescent development, the design of afterschool\r\nprograms, and partnerships between schools and informal education providers; TECH TEAM will\r\nadvance understanding of these areas as they apply not only to girls but to all students and\r\nteachers.",
