The workshop, which is being organized by Dr. Meredith Blackwell of Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, and Dr. Rosario Mendel Ortiz of the Instituto de Ecologia, in Xalapa, Mexico aims to train thirty U.S. and Latin American students in culture, identification, and systematics techniques for ascomycetes, a group of fungi that numbers over 32,000 species.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, about 32,000 species of ascomycetes have been described.  It is, however, estimated that the number could in reality be double that number and many of the anticipated new species are believed to occupy Neotropical habitats.  Indeed, mycologists who work in the region have discovered well over 100 undescribed ascomycetes in the past year alone. It is important, therefore, to have a new generation of well-trained mycologists from both the U .S. and Latin America to work with these ecologically important organisms and contribute to biodiversity assessment and monitoring. The proposed workshop, with its focus on the latest techniques, training, and students, will promote an exchange of ideas, knowledge, and cooperative interactions among an upcoming generation of Western Hemisphere mycologists.\r\n",
