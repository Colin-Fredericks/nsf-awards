The emphasis is on a combination\r\nof techniques from analysis and of other fields such as\r\nanalytic number theory and singularity theory. The objects\r\nof study are related to diophantine equations, maximal\r\naverages over subvarieties and their discrete analogues,\r\npolynomial type ergodic theorems as well as oscillatory\r\nintegrals and integral operators with degeneracies. A set\r\nof problems are discrete in nature, where mapping properties\r\nof operators related to classical exponential sums play a\r\ncrucial role. Tough these appear as discrete analogues of\r\nwell known constructs in analysis, they in turn can yield\r\nto new insights both in ergodic and number theory. Another\r\ndirection is to study problems related to oscillatory\r\nintegrals with degeneracies, where the usual \"curvature\"\r\ntype conditions are replaced by assumptions on the\r\nsingularities or only assuming genericity.\r\n\r\nDuring roughly the past decade the scope of harmonic\r\nanalysis has been vastly extended by  incorporating methods\r\nfrom seemingly different fields of mathematics. This has\r\nled to an essentially deeper understanding of basic partial\r\ndifferential equations under periodic conditions (such as\r\nthe nonlinear Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics and\r\nthe Wave equation), new phenomena in ergodic theory meaning\r\nthat measurements do not have to be taken regularly but\r\nonly very rarely to understand physical processes. The\r\nproposed research will concentrate on these types of\r\nproblems Where a combination of methods of different fields\r\nof mathematics seems to be needed.\r\n  \r\n",
