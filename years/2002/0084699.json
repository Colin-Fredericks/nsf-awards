 "awd_abstract_narration": "0084699 \r\nSmith\r\n\r\nThis award from the Division of Astronomical Sciences supports the operation of the International Gemini Observatory, under the management of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc.  This observatory will operate two 8-meter optical/infrared telescopes in a collaboration consisting of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe Gemini 8-meter telescopes are designed to work effectively at optical and infrared wavelengths.  They are located at sites with superlative astronomical observing conditions, one in the northern hemisphere on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, and one in the southern hemisphere on Cerro Pachon in the Andean foothills of central Chile.  Gemini's scientific mission is focused on fundamental questions, using new technologies and new observational and operational approaches.  These key scientific themes include:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe origin of Planetary Systems - a detailed mapping of dusty disks around nearby stars will enable planetary formation to be studied directly.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe identification of Extrasolar Planets - exploiting Gemini's infrared facilities and advanced instrumentation to observe directly planets around other stars.\r\n\r\n3.\tThe origin of Stars - Gemini's near infrared capabilities will enable the direct study of protostars and young stars shrouded in dust.\r\n\r\n4.\tThe Internal Structure of Stars - high-resolution spectroscopy of nearby stars will enable the observation of stellar oscillation modes that will provide insight into the internal structure of stars.\r\n\r\n5.\tThe Origins of the Chemical Elements - high precision, high resolution spectroscopy of distant, faint objects will allow the study of absorption and emission lines that trace the enrichment of chemical elements as a result of stellar evolution.\r\n\r\n6.\tThe Origin of Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei - high sensitivity spectroscopic observations of dense gas clouds surrounding super massive black holes will enable the masses and structures of active galactic nuclei to be studied.\r\n\r\nThe award provides funds for operations and maintenance, for the development of new instrumentation and for facilities renewal.  The observatory will also engage in an ambitious program of education and public outreach in Hawaii and in Chile, and provide support for similar efforts in the partner countries.\r\n",
