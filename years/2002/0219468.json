 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of developing efficient automated systems of logical\r\ninference is a key step toward the dream of creating verifiable,\r\nreliable, and secure hardware and software systems.  This research is\r\naimed at developing a well-founded, unified theory of practical\r\nlogical inference, that combines complementary ideas and powerful\r\napproaches for propositional inference developed in AI, formal\r\nverification, and theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\nThis unified theory will focus on (ii) combining the different\r\nrepresentations used in the various approaches to propositional\r\ninference, such as Boolean decision diagrams and conjunctive normal\r\nform, in order to take advantage of the diverse algorithmic techniques\r\nassociated with each; (ii) developing new and improved inference\r\nalgorithms using the combined representation; (iii) precisely\r\ncharacterizing the power of various heuristic inference techniques,\r\nsuch as clause learning and randomized search; and (iv) developing a\r\nrigorous understanding of how problem structure indicates the\r\npotential effectiveness of particular inference strategies.\r\n\r\nThe research will involve theoretical work using methods of proof\r\ncomplexity as well as experimental work on logical encodings of both\r\nreal-world verification problems and AI planning problems.  The\r\nultimate goal research is to significantly expand the size and\r\ncomplexity of software and hardware systems that are amenable to\r\nformal analysis.",
