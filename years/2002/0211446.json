It is an important field in its\r\nown right and has applications in other fields of Mathematics, and also in\r\na wide range of other sciences including Computer Science, Chemistry,\r\nPhysics and Biology.\r\n     The Summer Conference on Topology and its Applications was first held\r\nin New York in 1984; it has been held each summer since then, except 1986.\r\nFor most of its existence this series of conferences has been an important\r\npart of the international topological landscape. Most of the participants\r\nhave been Americans, but an increasing number come from across the world.\r\nUntil 1994, all these conferences were held in the United States, but to\r\nencourage and support worldwide participation, that year the Conference\r\nwas held in Amsterdam, and it has since been held in Mexico City and North\r\nBay (Ontario); about half of the future Summer Conferences are expected to\r\nbe held in the United States. The holding of the conference in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere for the first time, in New Zealand, recognises the\r\ntopological strength of that country. It is also expected that this will\r\nlead to increased participation in the conference series by topologists\r\nfrom south-east Asia and Australia.\r\n     This year the conference will be held at the University of Auckland,\r\nNew Zealand, July 1 to 4. More details about the conference may be found\r\nat the conference website http://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/Topology-2002/\r\n\r\n",
