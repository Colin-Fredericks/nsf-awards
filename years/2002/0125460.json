 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nBy integrating computer ethics across the curriculum, this project addresses the following \r\nconcerns: 1) the increased use of instructional technology in the classroom; 2) the growth \r\nof enrollment in online distance education programs; 3) the need to improve the knowledge \r\nof ethical, social and legal issues in computing of women and underrepresented minorities; \r\nand 4) the limited ties between technology and other disciplines. The workplan is to: \r\n1) develop modules that are interdisciplinary in design and that capitalize on the life \r\nexperiences of Mercy students for all the general education courses offered at the College; \r\n2) develop modules addressing the specific issues of online distance learning courses; \r\n3) lead workshops on designing ethics modules for all courses for the Mercy faculty on a \r\nfaculty seminar day; 4) design and conducting an online workshop for faculty at other \r\ncolleges and universities; and 5) develop a new course for computer information science \r\nmajors. These curriculum enhancements are designed to: 1) increase the diversity of \r\nstudents who are knowledgeable about computer ethics and the related social and legal\r\nissues so the rewards of technology can be reaped by all in an equitable manner, and \r\n2) emphasize oral, written and critical thinking competencies while focusing on the \r\ninterdisciplinary connections of computer ethics.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this work, we are adapting a range of materials previously developed and made available to the community via NSF support. These materials include a range of case studies in computer ethics and the social aspects of computing.\r\n\r\nThis course includes an online team-taught module with a faculty member of DePaul \r\nUniversity and student-student collaborative projects from the two institutions.",
