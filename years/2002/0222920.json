 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graph drawing and information visualization tools are essential in many fields, including telecommunications,databases, and software engineering, where the models contain millions of objects and relationships. Even though graph drawing is a rich discipline, the promising new concepts and algorithms in the field have had too little practical impact in application areas. \r\nThis project presents an integrated research and education plan focusing on graph drawing and information visualization techniques for large data sets and graph processes. \r\nThe research component of this work focuses on the design and implementation of efficient data structures and algorithms for visualization of large graphs with the goal of impacting real-world problems in application areas. This problem is especially relevant because recent technological advances have brought about increased data volumes and increased data complexity. The theoretical aspects of this work include designing scalable force-directed methods, hierarchical graph decompositions, alternative visual representations for graph processes, external memory algorithms, and data structures that support efficient navigation operations. \r\nThe theoretical results will be used to develop practical tools that will be packaged in a software library and an Adaptive GrAph Visualization Environment, AGAVE, that uses the new graph modeling standard GraphML. Through industrial collaborations, the new methods will be calibrated and tested using real-world data.\r\nAlternatives graph representation methods and techniques for visuazalizing dynamic graph processes will also be investigated. The educational component of this proposal includes: (1) Creation and management of the already funded new Graphics and Visualization Lab; (2) Design and implementation of educational tools for visualization of large graphs and graph processes; (3) Supervision of graduate and undergraduate students; (4) Active involvement in outreach and integrative activities.\r\n\r\n",
