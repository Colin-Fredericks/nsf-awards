 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the US-European Workshop on Bridges is to  the recent\r\nadvancements in bridge engineering, focusing on new materials and technology, monitoring\r\nand diagnostics involving integrated sensor systems, new methods of analysis, design,\r\nevaluation, repair and rehabilitation of bridges used in Europe, and identify the most\r\nsuitable topics for joint research projects. The major areas to be covered include: (1)\r\nadvanced materials (high-strength/high-performance concrete and steel, composites,\r\nfiber-reinforced concrete, smart materials), (2) development of load and resistance models\r\nfor steel and reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete structures, (3) diagnostic\r\nprocedures (tests, performance monitors, nondestructive techniques, signal processing,\r\nintegrated sensor systems, acoustic and optical techniques), (4) materials and techniques\r\nfor repair and rehabilitation of concrete structures (reinforced and prestressed concrete,\r\nsteel, new composite materials). Accordingly the Workshop attempts to  state of\r\nthe art summary of main topics as viewed on one hand in the U.S. and, on the other hand,\r\nin Europe, identify the research needs, in particular topics for cooperative projects; and\r\nderive some recommendations that reflect the needs in manpower, technology transfer and\r\neducation for the near future. The Workshop involves researchers and consultants. The\r\nlocal organizers also organize special meetings, a conference, and field trips to the\r\nconstruction sites. The results will be presented in the final report.\r\n",
