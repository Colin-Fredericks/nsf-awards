 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDr. Therese Markow has worked to involve significant numbers of undergraduate and graduate students in active research, including co-authoring scientific papers with undergraduate students at Arizona State University, where she held a faculty position in the biological sciences. She initiated the Minority Access to Research Careers program at ASU in 1993. The program works to improve support for students from underrepresented groups who may enter research careers in bioscience. ASU MARC participants receive a wide range of support. The program has helped many minority students pursue research careers in the general biological sciences, with particular focus on and success among Native American students; more than twenty-eight undergraduate students, twenty-one graduate students, and nine post-doctoral students were mentored. \r\n\r\nDr. Markow was especially noted by her students for conveying her passion and integrity as a scientist. Her international research record and partnership with her students in research publication are meaningful reflections of her dedication. Although Dr. Markow is now Regents Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona, the ASU MARC program continues.\r\n",
