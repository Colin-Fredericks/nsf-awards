 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT DMS - 0203219.\r\n\r\nProfessors Boyer and Galicki propose to investigate several \r\nprojects in geometry and topology. The objective of all the  \r\nprojects is to study fundamental questions in Riemannian \r\nGeometry with two main focal points:  Contact Geometry of\r\norbifold bundles over Fano varieties and the existence of some\r\nspecial (i.e., Einstein, positive Ricci curvature) metrics on such spaces. \r\nThe questions and problems proposed here are deeply rooted in the\r\nprincipal investigators' earlier work which exploited a fundamental \r\nrelationship between contact geometry of Sasakian-Einstein spaces and \r\ntwo kinds of Kaehler geometry, namely Q-factorial Fano varieties with \r\nKaehler-Einstein orbifold metrics with positive scalar curvature, and \r\nCalabi-Yau manifolds with their Kaehler Ricci-flat metrics. \r\nThe most recent work of the principal investigators has led to an \r\nimportant breakthrough in the study of such structures when,\r\nusing recent results of Demailly and Kollar, the principal investigators\r\nwere able to construct new examples of compact Einstein manifolds in dimension \r\n5 as well as many positive Einstein metrics on families of rational\r\nhomology 7-spheres. The techniques used by the principal investigators borrow from\r\nseveral different fields; the algebraic geometry of Mori theory and intersection\r\ntheory, the analysis of the Calabi Conjecture, and finally the\r\nclassical differential topology of links of isolated hypersurface\r\nsingularities. These methods can be extended much further and in\r\nvarious directions. An example that stands out in this respect is the \r\nquestion of the existence of Einstein metrics on exotic spheres, which is \r\none of the main objectives of this proposal. More generally the principal investigators \r\nwant to  address several classification problems concerning compact Sasakian-Einstein \r\nmanifolds in dimensions 5 and 7. These two dimensions are important for two separate \r\nreasons. In view of earlier work higher dimensional examples can be constructed using \r\nthe join construction. At the same time these two odd dimensions appear to play special \r\nrole in Superstring Theory. In the context of recent developements in\r\nString and M-Theory the principal investigators also propose to\r\ninvestigate some related problems concerning  self-dual Einstein metrics in \r\ndimension 4 and exceptional holonomy metrics in dimension 7 and 8.\r\n\r\nThis project is intended to further the understanding of the mathematics\r\nof certain important types of geometry. While this endeavor is not\r\ndirectly motivated by advances in technology, the history of mathematics\r\nadequately demonstrates that today's pure mathematics often becomes\r\ntomorrow's applied mathematics. Indeed the mathematics being considered in\r\nthis project is currently being used in the field of Elementary Particle\r\nPhysics, more specifically, in the attempts at understanding a unified\r\ndescription of the fundamental forces of the universe.\r\n\r\n-\r\n",
