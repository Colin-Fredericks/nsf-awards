The current theory of structure formation (called the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario)  predicts  that massive  galaxies  were  built from  smaller galaxies that  collided and  merged, inducing bursts  of star formation and resulting in the different  types of galaxies observed today.  This entire sequence  of  events  is  thought  to  be  seeded  by  quantum fluctuations in the very  early Universe  and governed  by mysterious \"dark  matter\"  which constitutes  about  85%  of  all matter  in  the universe.   While the CDM theory is successful in explaining many observations, it faces an increasing number of problems which may lead us to revise or even abandon this paradigm.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental, unanswered questions is whether realistic galaxies with properties similar to those of observed galaxies can be formed in the CDM model. This project will specifically  focus on  stellar feedback  and heavy element enrichment and their role in the evolution of galaxies. Dr. Kravtsov and his collaborators will address this question by using very high-resolution, state-of-the-art computer simulations which include all the main processes thought  to  be important in  galaxy. In particular, the simulations will account for the release of enormous amounts of energy and heavy elements into the surrounding gas by the explosions of young, massive stars. This energy release, or \"feedback\", is thought to play a critical role in controlling the rate at which interstellar gas is turned into stars and in shaping the overall properties of galaxies. \r\n***\r\n",
