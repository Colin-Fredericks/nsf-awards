 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr Naomi Ward, Dr Karen Nelson, and Dr John Heidelberg of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) have been awarded a grant to sequence the genomes of the bacteria Acidobacterium capsulatum and Verrucomicrobium spinosum. These organisms are representatives of the acidobacteria and verrucomicrobia groups, which, due to their widespread distribution and relative abundance in soil and water, are attracting growing interest from microbial ecologists. Acidobacteria appear to be sensitive to chemical changes in their environment (i.e. addition of fertilizers to soil) and may serve as indicators for soil nutrient levels. There is evidence that verrucomicrobia may be key participants in the methane cycle and hence indirect contributors to global warming. In addition, some verrucomicrobia are involved in symbiotic relationships (partnerships) with other organisms such as nematodes, in which the bacteria appear to manipulate to their own advantage the ratio of males to females produced. Other verrucomicrobial symbionts defend their ciliate host from predators by shooting out a specialized harpoon-like structure. To date, there are no completed genome sequences from members of these two groups. The goal of the project will be to identify genes present in the genomes of these two organisms, and assign a function to the genes. The sequencing approach will involve a so-called random shotgun strategy, in which the DNA is broken into fragments and the DNA sequence of the fragments determined randomly. The resulting individual sequences will be assembled into one piece using computer software that recognizes overlaps between the different sequences. Any gaps left in the sequence will be filled in to produce a complete molecule. Comparisons can then be made with existing genomic databases, to identify the genes present. \r\nThe results of this project are expected to have far-reaching impacts on the scientific community, firstly because the sequence data will be made publicly available through the TIGR Website, and secondly because the groups represented by these two organisms are of interest to virtually all researchers working to determine the microbial diversity of soil and water. These researchers can use the sequence information to formulate hypotheses about the distribution and ecological role of these bacteria. The sequence data will also serve as a resource for those researchers seeking to understand the symbiotic relationships of verrucomicrobia. This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n",
