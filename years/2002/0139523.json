 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Northern Arizona University will host a summer research program for six students recruited nationwide. Minority students and students from colleges and universities without doctoral programs are especially encouraged to apply, and have been a major component of previous programs. The program will run for eight weeks, with each student working on an individual project tailored to his or her own mathematical background. Two students will work with each faculty advisor in a subject area to include Applied Mathematics and Analysis and Combinatorics. Descriptions of projects available for each forthcoming summer are posted on the department's homepage at http://odin.math.nau.edu/ REU/. As well as carrying out their research, students participate in seminar series, each giving a fifty-minute presentation at the end of the program. Students also write up their work in a form suitable for publication; these will put into a single bound volume. Students are encouraged to give talks at meetings etc. after the program has concluded, and the most successful will submit their work to a journal for publication.",
