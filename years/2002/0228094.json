 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the creation of a co-processor architecture evaluation  environment which integrates architecture-level simulation with industrial CAD  tools. The end-goal is to facilitate the design of high-performance  domain-specific co-processors. In the evaluation environment, the designer will  have the capability of 'test driving' a wide variety of design alternatives with  respect to real application ppograms. The mechanism is to `drop-in' components  into predetermined templates, gauge their effect on virtual machine instruction  execution, and use that information to evaluate virtual machine instruction  traces. There are three aspects to this research: (i) integrating existing or  user-constructed component libraries and synthesis tools into an architecture-  level model generator, (ii) integrating the same into an interprocessor network  simulator, and (iii) extending an existing architecture-level simulator to  include data parallel SPMD architectures. A graphic user interface is being  developed to help the user mix-and-match components. The resulting environment  will target not only professional designers, but also students in computer and  advanced digital design classes.",
