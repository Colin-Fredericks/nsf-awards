 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dissertations Initiative for the Advancement of Limnology and OceanoGraphy (DIALOG) is an interdisciplinary project that works through several professional societies to target recent Ph.D. recipients across the full spectrum of disciplines relevant to the biologically oriented aquatic sciences. This project will quantify and characterize recent aquatic science Ph.D.s, consolidate and disseminate Ph.D. dissertation abstracts, establish electronic lists to facilitate distribution of job opportunities, and run an international \"capstone\" symposium for selected recent graduates to foster interdisciplinary insight, peer networking, and early career development.  DIALOG will foster international as well as inter?institutional contacts, and include graduates from both developing and developed countries. Demographic data will facilitate the characterization and tracking of human resources. The on?line Dissertation Registry will provide a comprehensive yet concise summary of new research for scientists, policy makers, and agency representatives and facilitates integration of a new generation of researchers into the broader community. The electronic distribution list will provide a mechanism to target and disseminate information across institutions and foster communication across disciplinary and international boundaries. The international symposium will support participant diversity at all levels, and bring together individuals whose work transcends traditional boundaries. Activities will establish peer networks and enhance insights and perspectives to accelerate career development and advance interdisciplinary approaches to science.",
