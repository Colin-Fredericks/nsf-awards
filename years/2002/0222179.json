 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project analyses the historical emergence of the notion of the scientific model, and specifically the emergence of the assumption that models are universally valid representations of nature, by investigating the role of anatomical models for the formation of science and the state around 1800. Using archival sources and surviving model collections, the project will analyze and compare practices of model production and model use at two state institutions where science was developed in its conceptual and institutional framework explicitly for state use: a public naturalhistory museum and model workshop founded during physiocratic reforms in late eighteenth-century Tuscany, and a military training hospital established in enlightened absolutist Austria. The project will focus on three question areas: 1) How does the interplay between conceptual developments and social dynamics within the workshop establish the models as universal representations, and how does model use support or challenge these claims to universality? 2) What kind of science was developed conceptually and institutionally through model production and model use at the museum, and at the hospital? 3) What is the envisioned function of this science for the state, and what is the function of the image of the human body conveyed through the models for enlightened absolutism and subsequent regimes? Fund are for travel to relevant research sites in Florence and other parts of  Italy.\r\n",
