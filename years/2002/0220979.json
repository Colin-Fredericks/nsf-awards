In addtiion, a weekly seminar is to be held at MIT,  in conjunction with the Knight Science Journalism Program and the new Science Writing degree program at MIT, on \"Current Events in Science and Technology.\"  Also the workshop is to be highlightedin the newsletter for the Society of the History of Technology and newsletters of several other scholarly societies in order to stimulate thinking about the subject among as wide an audience as possible.  John Krige, Editor of the journal History\r\nand Technology has offered to publish a summary of the workshop and any papers\r\nthat are produced as a result of our discussions.  \r\n",
