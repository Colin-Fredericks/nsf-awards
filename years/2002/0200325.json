 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent striking results establishing the existence of the functorial symmetric powers of degree 3 and 4 for cusp forms on GL(2) as automorphic forms on GL(4) and GL(5), as well as transfer of generic cusp forms from odd special orthogonal groups to general linear groups, by the investigator and his collaborator, has opened a new front in automorphic forms and number theory.  They have resulted in surprising new estimates towards Ramanujan--Selberg and Sato--Tate conjectures, together with a large number of impressive, definitive and new results in number theory, automorphic forms and geometry obtained by other mathematicians.  The investigator explores extensions of these to higher powers of forms on GL(2) as well as transfers of generic forms on other classical groups and their simply connected similitude coverings.  The well-known and still open case of transfer from GSp(4) to GL(4) then becomes a special case of this.  Beside exploring new ideas of Langlands on transferring beyond endoscopy, a situation which is already present in the third and fourth symmetric powers, he plans to investigate any possible extension of his method to infinite dimensional groups.  He has a solid approach to establishing the stability of root numbers necessary for these transfers, by means of his method, and studies Bessel functions and the full generality of all the root numbers defined from his method.  Stability of a subclass of these root numbers is the last serious problem in establishing these transfers.  The investigator is also working on a number of problems concerning poles of local intertwining operators as well as those of automorphic L-functions coming from his method.  Much of this work is carried out in collaboration with collaborators.\r\n\r\nThe theory of automorphic forms is a very powerful, exciting and promising part of modern mathematics.  Through a number of deep conjectures, mainly due to Robert Langlands of the Institute for Advanced Study (Langlands program), it tries to unify objects from different parts of mathematics such as number theory, analysis and geometry.  Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, which is a consequence of relating plane curves defined by equations of degree three with rational coefficients to functions on complex upper half plane, provides an excellent example of this vast program.  The investigator's recent work with his collaborators has led to new, striking and surprising correspondences of this sort with many consequences in number theory and geometry.  While this has resolved some very long standing and significant problems, many more important questions need to be answered.  In this project, the investigator uses methods of analysis, i.e., the study of continuous objects, that he has developed over his career and have been fundamental in the recent progress, to establish new correspondences of this kind between objects of a discrete nature with many applications to different parts of number theory and geometry.  The project involves many collaborations and training for graduate students and postdocs.\r\n",
