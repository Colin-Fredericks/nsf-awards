 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the use of a highly sensitive technology to measure the amount of trace metal ions presented in water or other liquid samples and the eventual development of portable instrumentation.  This novel approach to detection is effective, sensitive, selective, inexpensive, hazard-free, and truly portable. The system uses an innovative high-resolution bi-cell surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detector combined with anodic stripping voltammetry to achieve detection of ultra-low concentrations of trace metal ions in water.  The device based on this technology can be used as a laboratory instrument as well as a portable device for field evaluation of water quality.  Further, it could be used as a clinical diagnostic tool for detection of toxic metal ions in blood or saliva samples.\r\n\r\nThis effort will provide an accurate determination of trace metal ions in water.  This technology could have a significant impact for protection of the environment.  The ability to determine what is hazardous in the environment is very important.",
