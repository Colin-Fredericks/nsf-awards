 "awd_abstract_narration": "These research projects concern the set theory of the real line,\r\na part of descriptive set theory.  The principal investigator\r\nstudies various ideals of sets of real numbers. Cardinal\r\ncharacteristics of the continuum and the associated families of\r\nsmall sets are central to this research.  Specifically, he\r\nfocuses on problems concerning the consistency of various\r\ngeneralizations of the Borel Conjecture, a statement asserting\r\nthat the families of sets in question consist entirely of\r\ncountable sets.  He also studies the extent of the duality\r\nbetween the two classical notions of smallness: measure zero and\r\nthe first category. This problem concerns finding parallels\r\nbetween the measure concepts such as strong measure zero and\r\nuniversal measure zero, and their first category analogs.\r\n\r\nThe study of the structure of the real numbers marks the origins\r\nof set theory and has been the object of systematic research\r\nsince the beginning of the last century.  Concepts of measure and\r\ncategory have been studied rigorously for about one hundred\r\nyears, and have been successfully used in many areas of modern\r\nmathematics.  Bartoszynski pursues several problems in this area.\r\nThese problems may yield positive answers that are theorems of\r\nmathematics or they may turn out to be independent from the\r\nstandard axioms of set theory.  The positive answers involve new\r\nresults in both finite and infinite combinatorics and have\r\napplications reaching beyond traditional set theory to real\r\nanalysis, measure theory, and topology.  On the other hand, the\r\nindependence results, particularly ones using forcing, have\r\napplications within set theory itself.",
