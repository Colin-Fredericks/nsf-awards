 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vernal pools are ephemeral wetlands that are home to many endemic plants and animals.\r\nAt Travis Air Force Base in California, a restoration project is in progress to create new vernal\r\npools that will have similar levels of biological diversity as natural pools. The proposed research\r\nfocuses on the federally endangered vernal pool endemic annual plant called \"Contra Costa\r\ngoldfields\" (Lasthenia conjugens; Asteraceae). The primary goals of the proposed study are to\r\ncompare changes in levels and patterns of genetic variation over time in natural vs. artificial\r\npools and to assess the relationship between insect-pollinator activity and genetic variation. To\r\nachieve those goals, a kind of genetic fingerprinting technique will be used to measure genetic\r\nvariation and that information will be compared to information obtained by making detailed\r\nobservations of pollinator activity.\r\nThe results of this research will have broad scientific implications and will help guide\r\napplied, conservation management decisions. More broadly, this study will contribute to our\r\nunderstanding of the genetics and evolution of species endemic to the unique and rapidly\r\ndisappearing vernal pools. Few detailed studies of any vernal pool species have ever been\r\nconducted. From a conservation management perspective, this study will assess the\r\neffectiveness of an ecological approach to habitat restoration in preserving the genetic integrity\r\nof a species and in preserving important plant-pollinator relationships.",
