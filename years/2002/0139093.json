 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objectives of this work are to develop a thorough \r\nunderstanding of three-dimensional water waves of finite amplitude, and \r\nultimately to develop a practical model to describe these waves efficiently. \r\nA model that is both accurate and computationally efficient could have \r\nmany practical applications. Specific problems to be addressed are: (1) the \r\nexistence and stability of three-dimensional, doubly-periodic, traveling \r\nwater-wave patterns, through the full range of depths; (2) the prevalence \r\nof hexagonal, rectangular or crescent-shaped waves (or other multiply \r\nperiodic wave patterns) among ocean waves; (3) the long-wave and \r\nmodulational descriptions of water waves, and the subsequent stability \r\nanalyses that are feasible in these cases; (4) the design and implementation \r\nof algorithms to make practical use of exact solutions of asymptotic \r\nmodels in shallow and deep water; (5) the relation between the detailed \r\ndynamics of three-dimensional, nonlinear waves and some commonly \r\nused ocean-wave transport models; and (6) the impact of a detailed local \r\ndescription of nonlinear wave dynamics on these transport models, in the \r\npresence of large amplitude nonlinear waves or under conditions of \r\nnonlinear wave focusing. These problems will be studied using analysis, \r\ncomputation, asymptotics, and algebraic geometry, involving the full \r\nequations and approximate models, all in conjunction with state-of-the-art \r\nphysical experiments.\r\n\r\nThe destructive force of large-amplitude ocean waves is well known. \r\nLarge-scale ocean waves have a major impact on the design of ocean-\r\ngoing ships, of off-shore oil platforms, and of other structures in a coastal \r\nenvironment.  These waves also impact the scheduling and routing of \r\nshipping patterns, and they strongly affect air-sea transport processes. Yet \r\nmost theoretical models of ocean waves now in use are based on waves of \r\nsmall amplitude. In this investigation we focus on developing a thorough \r\nunderstanding of large-amplitude waves. The ultimate goal is to develop a \r\npractical, mathematical model that may be used operationally in the \r\napplications listed above. In particular, the investigators plan to build on \r\ntheir recent work in which they have observed certain coherent patterns of \r\nlarge-amplitude waves. They have observed these patterns in laboratory \r\nexperiments, as solutions to the well-known equations of water waves, and \r\nas solutions to other equations that are (more) approximate models of \r\nwater waves. Their work involves a variety of mathematical and \r\ncomputational tools as well as state-of-the-art laboratory experiments. In \r\nthe present work the investigators will combine all of their tools to \r\nunderstand and describe these coherent patterns and to use them as the \r\nbuilding blocks for a practical model of ocean waves.\r\n",
