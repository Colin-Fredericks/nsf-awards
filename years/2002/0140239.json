 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund U.S. graduate students and post-doctoral \r\nfellows attending the Centre de Recherches Mathematiques in\r\nMontreal  for periods of several weeks during a semester of\r\nactivities centered on the theme of Groups and Algebraic Geometry\r\nduring Spring, 2002.  The activities planned include a strong\r\ncomponent of training, including 1) a four day workshop on\r\nHilbert Modular Varieties and Forms, 2) a one week Winter school\r\non Computations in Coxeter Groups, 3) a one week workshop on\r\nGroup Actions on Rational Varieties, 4) a two week workshop on\r\nInvariant Theory, 5) a one-month concentration period on the\r\nLanglands Program for Function Fields, 5) a two week workshop on\r\nComputational Lie Theory, and 6) a one week workshop on\r\nAlgebraic Transformation Groups.\r\n     The Centre de Recherches Mathematiques in Montreal is one of \r\nCanada's three research centers in the mathematical sciences, and \r\nhas a broad mandate covering all of the various aspects of\r\ndevelopment of the discipline, with activities comprising theme\r\nyears in various topics, a general conference program, an\r\nindustrial program, a publications program in partnership with\r\nthe American Mathematical Society, as well as activities devoted\r\nto education.  The themes cover some of the most exciting areas\r\nof the mathematical sciences and typically alternate between pure\r\nand applied disciplines.  This award will provide support for\r\nU.S. students and postdoctoral fellows so that they can attend\r\nthe events during the Spring 2002 semester.  This semester is\r\nthematically devoted to Groups and Algebraic Geometry, a\r\ndifficult area of research in which few, if any, universities can\r\noffer coverage by advanced courses which allow for adequate\r\ngraduate student preparation. This award will allow students to\r\ntake advantage of an exceptional opportunity for education and\r\ntraining by the world's leading experts in areas that have seen\r\nsignificant numbers of recent breakthroughs.",
