 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0204886\r\nHildebrand\r\n\r\nDiscoveries in the last few decades have shown that magnetic fields affect the structure and energy balance of gas in galaxies; that they provide substantial vertical support for the gas layer; that they transport energy and modify the structure of interstellar shocks; that they accelerate and confine cosmic rays; and that they strongly influence the collapse of clouds to form stars.  Much of our understanding of these fields has been gained by observations of the polarization of starlight due to partial absorption in magnetically aligned grains along the line of sight, and by observations of polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains in relatively dense regions.  Although the polarization measurements have advanced our understanding of magnetic fields, the interpretation of the results has been limited by unknown factors.  The polarization depends on the inclination of the mean magnetic field from the line of sight; on the turbulence of the field; on the degree of alignment of the dust grains with the local field; and on the size, shape, and composition of the dust grains.  This project, directed by Dr. Roger Hildebrand at the University of Chicago, addresses opportunities to expand the role of polarimetry by investigating each of the factors.  \r\n\r\nThe University of Chicago polarimeter, built by Dr. Hildebrand, has an important role in these investigations, but there is increasing reliance on complementary observations in other parts of the spectrum.  The work on the magnetic field inclination combines submillimeter wavelength polarimetry with measurements of line widths for ionic and neutral molecules.  Observations in the wavelength range from 850 to 1300 micron will be made with the instrument SCUBA at the James Clerk Maxwell telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.  Observations of the microwave foregroung will rely on the instruments DASI (at the South Pole) and MAP (space mission) which are already deployed for measurements of background polarization.  \r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
