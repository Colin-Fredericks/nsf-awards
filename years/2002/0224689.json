The congress is intended to promote interaction between specialists in all aspects of the study of the geology of lake deposits. Specialists in geochronology, sedimentology,\r\npaleoecology, paleoclimatology and sedimentary geochemistry will all be in attendance at the meeting, which is expected to draw approximately 200 participants. Cross-fertilization of ideas at conferences such as this are critical for graduate students at an early stage of career, both in establishing a wide network of contacts (both in the US and internationally) and in efficiently showcasing their work to a key element of the scientific community. We request sufficient funds to defer registration costs and provide partial travel support for approximately 10 students. Selection criteria for student support grants will be based on both relevance of the student's research work to the general conference goals, and on evidence from the student (advisor's letter of support and personal statement) indicating the quality and significance of the work to be presented.\r\n",
