 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop novel electroencephalogram (EEG) classification methods that result in a practical, real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCI) system.  BCIs are hardware and software systems that sample EEG signals from electrodes placed on the scalp and extract patterns from EEG that indicate the mental activity being performed by the person.  The long-term goal of this line of research is a new mode of communication for victims of diseases and injuries resulting in the loss of voluntary muscle control, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), high-level spinal cord injuries or severe cerebral palsy.  The autonomic and intellectual functions of such subjects continue to be active.  This can result in a \"locked-in\" syndrome in which a person is unable to communicate to the outside world.  The interpretation of information contained in EEG may lead to a new mode of communication with which subjects can communicate with their care givers or directly control devices such as televisions, wheel chairs, speech synthesizers and computers.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this project are the design and testing of an EEG system for experimentation in real-time EEG pattern analysis constructed of off-the-shelf components for under $5,000, development of new techniques for a novel approach to studying the cognitive components of mental tasks and how they vary in time and across subjects, demonstration that real-time feedback to the subject will produce a biofeedback situation in which the subject can learn to modify their EEG to increase classification accuracy, proof by demonstration that accuracy and classification time will be sufficient for two persons to interact over the net in a simple game controlled by two BCI systems. The evaluation of the results of this project in light of these objectives will be based on the accuracy of EEG classification, the speed with which the classification can be performed, and the expense of the EEG system and of its maintenance and extendibility.\r\n\r\nThe most significant impact of this project to the disabled community will be an easier to use, affordable BCI system.  The inclusion of a wide range of mental tasks will result in a better understanding of which mental tasks are easiest for subjects to consistently perform and for detection algorithms to reliably identify.  Better BCI systems will also be significant for other classes of users who can benefit from augmented communication interfaces in applications that require extremely fast commands.  The significance of this project to the BCI research community is the specification and testing of the inexpensive system for experimentation with EEG signal analysis.  The system based on off-the-shelf components and software to be developed and made publicly available is expected to allow a number of additional research groups to enter the BCI field.  Also, this project's results on the analysis of cognitive components in EEG measured during a wide range of mental tasks will broaden the set of mental activities available to users of BCI systems.\r\n\r\n",

This project was aimed at addressing some of the fundamental limitations of current approaches to BCI, including artifacts in EEG, the high cost of EEG equipment, the long training time required of BCI users, and the stimulus-driven nature of current interfaces.\n\n\nResearch Activities\n\n\nTo address difficulties due to artifacts in EEG signals, this project focused during the early years on new transforms that can be applied to multichannel EEG to extract relevant components.  Most transforms have been applied to EEG samples at single time points.  Our results show that by including EEG samples from a number of consecutive time points, sometimes called embedding them in time, results in better isolation of artifacts in a small number of components.  In a comparative study of transforms applied to our EEG collected during protocols to evoke P300 ERP waves, we found that PCA (principal components analysis) outperforms more recently-developed transforms.\n\nAnother difficulty with current BCI approaches is that they are stimulus driven---a user must respond to a number of visual or auditory stimuli and their brain response is measured to predict which stimulus they were attending to or expecting.  This is the basis of the most common BCI, the P300-Speller.  Our lab has instead focused on mental tasks performed spontaneously by the user.  This removes the requirement of a device for presenting the stimulus, and therefore results in a BCI system that can be used by subjects who have lost the ability to control their gaze.\n\nWe have recorded EEG from impaired and non-impaired subjects, in their home and in the lab, while they are performing various mental tasks, such as counting backwords, multiplying numbers, visualizing a three-dimensional object tumbling, imagined hand movement, and imagining a song. \n\nOver the duration of this project, experiments have been conducted with a variety of EEG signal representations and classifiers.  Signal representations include, energy in frequency bands, wavelet transforms, coefficients of auto-regressive models, and raw signals.   Our most recent results show that the combination of raw signals, embedded in time, with artificial neural networks provides the most reliable mental task prediction.\n\nNo EEG patterns are known that at all moments indicate which mental task is being performed.  Therefore, we experimented with ways of combining evidence from consecutive EEG time samples, and found that an approach based on a multihypothesis sequential probability ratio test worked well.
