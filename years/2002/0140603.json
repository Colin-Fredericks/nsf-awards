The researchers will undertake a study of hydrophilic/hydrophobic membrane development via thermally induced phase separation (TIPS). A great deal of valuable research has been done on the thermodynamics of polymer systems that undergo phase separation.  However, a more thorough understanding of the kinetics of phase separation and structure development is necessary to complete the picture and allow membrane manufactures to control the porous characteristics of the membranes.  Specific goals are to:  1) conduct kinetics studies of membrane structure formation;  2) to form a series of membranes using TIPS with various copolymers and diluents; and  3) to measure performance parameters such as flux and solute rejection. \r\n\r\nThe project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities. The U.S. scientists have considerable expertise in membrane formation and the kinetics of structure development and the Japanese researchers have a greater mastery of membrane characterization techniques, especially in terms of fouling and protein adsorption.  In addition, the U.S. group has the optical microscopy equipment to do some of the kinetics experiments and the Japanese group has the light scattering equipment to extend the studies into the range of smaller domains and earlier times in the phase separation process.  It is anticipated that the results of this research will enable membrane manufactures to control the microstructure of the membranes (that is, pre size and pore size distribution).  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The project advances international human resources through the participation of a graduate student.  The researchers plan to make their research results available to membrane scientists through the open literature, oral presentations at meetings of professional society meetings, and Professor Lloyd's web site. \r\n",
