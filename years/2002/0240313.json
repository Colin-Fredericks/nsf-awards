 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many neuromuscularly impaired and/or elderly individuals find  it  too difficult or too frightening to walk. Often these individuals  can  walk  in  controlled environments, but lack the strength  to  recover  from large force disturbances encountered  in  the  real  world. Such individuals might be helped if a lightweight, active,  leg  orthosis occasionally acted to compensate large  forces  and  stabilize gait when a fall is immanent. There are three technical  and two scientific challenges that must be addressed to make such  a   device  possible.  Technically,  the  system  must  be   very  lightweight, have no need for external (e.g. e.m.g.) sensors, and  have a battery that lasts at least an entire day. Scientifically,  the  system must act with appropriate mechanical behavior and  be  able  to  estimate the user's ground-relative limb  configuration  and motive intent based on a minimum of sensory information.  All  five  of  these issues will be addressed in this study.   On  the  Educational frontier, the subject of computer architecture is one  of   the  most  rapidly  evolving  in  the  field  of  electrical  engineering  and  computer science.  In order to  teach  computer  architecture  to undergraduates, we must give them  a  laboratory  substrate  that  is both motivating (in that students  can  build  circuits  that solve interesting problems in real time)  and  not  prohibitively difficult to use. The educational portion  of  this  grant  will  be  used  to complete work on a  scalable  FPGA  lab  substrate  for computer architecture education. It will  also  be  used  to  aid an ongoing effort to restructure MIT's common  core  curriculum in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science into  a  more coherent whole.",
