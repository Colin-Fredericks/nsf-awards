NCAM will work with the League to disseminate and\r\ninstitutionalize use of resources that can make technology-enabled science, technology,\r\nengineering and math (STEM) learning resources accessible to students, faculty and\r\nadministrators at community colleges.\r\nProject goals are to elevate the issue of accessibility within the community college system;\r\ndisseminate NSF-funded demonstration models, guidelines, tools and resources that enable\r\ncreation of accessible STEM content; and encourage the community college system to\r\nparticipate in the development and implementation of accessible specifications for distributed\r\nlearning platforms.\r\nNCAM will conduct presentations and workshops at annual League conferences, offer on-site\r\nAccessibility Forums at member colleges, and deliver online training and resources through the\r\nLeague's Web-based learning community, Transformational Learning Connections\r\n(LeagueTLC). Products and demonstration models that will be shared include:\r\n* distributed learning industry specifications and standards\r\n* developers' guidelines to creating accessible content, focused on math and science solutions\r\n* accessible online physics curriculum with multimedia lectures, quizzes, and electronic texts\r\n* demonstration models of accessible math and science content within software\r\n* access authoring tools including shareware and commercial products and tutorials\r\nProject activities will strengthen capacity within community colleges to create and utilize\r\naccessible math and science content in technology-enabled learning. Guidelines and technical\r\nresources will facilitate community college creation, maintenance, control, packaging and\r\npresentation of accessible digital content.\r\nResults will serve a wide array of users of online community college content \" people with\r\nsensory disabilities, people with learning or print disabilities who benefit from multiple modes\r\nof presentation, and people with physical disabilities who use assistive technologies for\r\nnavigation and control of content.\r\nAccessible content and systems will improve the quality of learning, teaching and/or work life\r\nfor all of these users, whether they are community college students, faculty members and/or\r\nadministrators.\r\nThrough this initiative, the League for Innovation in the Community College will encourage use\r\nof its resources to connect and empower learning between innovative leaders and model\r\nprograms in community colleges that are recruiting and preparing students with disabilities for\r\nSTEM careers. This Project will also serve to build support and generate strategies within the\r\nLeague to mount a major learning thread on accessibility at one of the League's conferences.",
