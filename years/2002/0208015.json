 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the development and analysis of efficient\r\nnumerical algorithms for problems arising in computational modeling,\r\nwith emphasis on two main topics: algorithms for systems of equations\r\narising from the stochastic finite element method, and algorithms for\r\nalgebraic systems arising in models of fluid dynamics.  The first of\r\nthese addresses the fact that models of physical phenomena often\r\ncontain parameters or equation coefficients whose precise properties\r\nare not well understood.  Examples include permeability properties of\r\nmedia in which quantities (e.g., pollutants in groundwater) are\r\nflowing or diffusing, and boundary conditions (e.g., along the ocean\r\nbottom).  In the stochastic finite element method, the random aspects\r\nof problems are handled in a manner analogous to the introduction of\r\nnew spatial dimensions.  This methodology appears to have the\r\npotential to be more efficient than Monte-Carlo methods, provided\r\nefficient algorithms are available for the algebraic systems that are\r\ngenerated after discretization.  Our aim is to study the algorithmic\r\nissues that arise from this approach.  For the second project, we will\r\ndevelop and study efficient algorithms for solving systems of\r\nequations arising in models of incompressible flow, principally,\r\nmethods for eigenvalue problems derived from linear stability analysis\r\nof steady solutions, and multigrid algorithms for the discrete\r\nconvection-diffusion equation.  These are fundamental problems arising\r\nthroughout fluid dynamics, and their efficient solution is critical\r\nfor development of effective computational models.\r\n\r\nThe general aim of this project is to enhance the utility and\r\neffectiveness of mathematical modeling for understanding scientific\r\nand engineering phenomena.  There are useful models for many disparate\r\nphysical processes, including blood flows, dispersal of environmental\r\npollutants, performance of aerospace vehicles, and atmospheric and\r\noceanographic phenomena.  Understanding such processes through purely\r\nexperimental techniques is prohibitively expensive or impossible,\r\nwhereas the use of modeling and together with algorithmic solution\r\nintroduces a basic understanding of the physics by providing\r\napproximations to quantities such as flow rates and pressures.\r\nAccurate solutions are only available, however, if reliable and fast\r\nsolution algorithms can be used.  Moreover, it is often the case that\r\ncertain aspects of models, such as the geologic properties of\r\ntransporting media or the velocities of flows along boundaries, are\r\nnot known with certainty.  Our goal for this work is to develop fast\r\nsolution algorithms for mathematical models and to ensure that the\r\nsolution strategies are able to handle uncertainty and to produce\r\nreliable statistical information about solutions at low computational\r\ncost.\r\n",
