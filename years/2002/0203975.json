Families such as the Henon and Lozi families have been\r\nintensively studied in recent years and many beautiful results\r\nhave been obtained. However, we are still far from having a\r\ncomplete understanding of them. In dimension 1, due to the\r\nefforts of many researchers during the past two decades, there is\r\nan almost complete theory. Parallels and differences between the\r\ndynamics of families in dimensions 1 and 2 have been exploited by\r\nseveral authors. The past work of the PI includes the development\r\nof a 2-dimensional analogue of Milnor and Thurston's kneading\r\ntheory and the study of braids and braid forcing. The present\r\nproject proposes to further the study of dynamics in dimension 2\r\nas well as some aspects of braid theory and Teichmuller theory.\r\nThe main topics to be studied are: Horseshoe braids,\r\nGeneralized pseudo-Anosov maps and piecewise linear models for \r\ndiffeomorphisms in dimension 2, Real and Complex Henon maps and\r\nthe Pruning Front Conjecture, Renormalization in dimension 2, and\r\nsome aspects of infinite-dimensional Teichmuller Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamical systems is the branch of mathematics that describes\r\nsystems that evolve in time. Typical examples are planetary\r\nmotion, population patterns, weather prediction or the  economy.\r\nSince Newton, it is believed that simple mathematical laws are\r\ncapable of describing the long term behavior of many of such\r\nsystems. The problem is that often such simple mathematical\r\nlaws lead to extremely complicated long time behavior.    \r\n \r\n\r\n",
