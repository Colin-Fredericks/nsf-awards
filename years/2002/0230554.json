It is important to change the way students are educated to better develop their creativity, promote their critical thinking, enhance their knowledge discovery skills and promote life-long learning and teaching. The vision for achieving this presented in this proposal is to develop a research-based educational experience for students throughout their undergraduate tenure. This experience will focus on: (1) systems thinking, and an appreciation of the societal and environmental impacts of engineered systems; (2) Information Technology\r\n(IT) applications and computational modeling; and (3) experience in the design, conduct and analysis of hands-on laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\n",
