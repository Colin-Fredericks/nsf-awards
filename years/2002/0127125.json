The project is impacting more than 400 students per year and is being used in General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Ecology, Instrumental Analysis, Environmental Chemistry, and Undergraduate Research within the Department. The goals of this project are to:\r\n1) enhance student learning about the local environment through field experiences and laboratory exercises using IC;\r\n2) increase student understanding of instrumentation selection and sensitivity; and\r\n3) allow students to gain experience using currently important instrumentation.\r\n\r\nThe curricular modifications are modeled after successful experiences with IC at Calvin College and Western Carolina University. Particular experiments are being adapted from the educational and research literature and standard EPA protocols and are being implemented to fit our curricular requirements.\r\n\r\n",
