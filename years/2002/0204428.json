In the case of  infinite fundamental groups, the virtual\r\nHaken conjecture of Waldhausen has been serving as a guiding open\r\nproblem, because virtual Haken 3-manifolds possess similar nice\r\nproperties as Haken 3-manifolds, such as topological rigidity,\r\nresidually finite fundamental groups and geometric decomposition\r\nin Thurston's sense. Concerning 3-manifolds with finite\r\nfundamental groups, the Poincare conjecture is perhaps the most \r\nfundamental open problem. The well known Property-P conjecture \r\nmay be considered as a special case of the Poincare conjecture. \r\nXingru Zhang proposes to continue his investigation of the virtual\r\nHaken conjecture and the Property-P conjecture, along with some \r\nclosely related problems, such as embedded or immersed essential \r\nsurfaces in 3-manifolds, various exceptional Dehn surgeries on \r\nhyperbolic knots, and representations of 3-manifold groups.\r\n\r\nThree dimensional manifold topology, including the knot theory,\r\nhas been one of the most active research areas in topology over \r\nthe last twenty-five years. This is a rich, beautiful and \r\nchallenging area where  topology meshes up harmonically with \r\nalgebra and geometry. For instance, if a compact 3-manifold \r\nwithout boundary admits a complete  hyperbolic metric, then the \r\ntopology, the fundamental group and the hyperbolic metric  of the \r\nmanifold mutually determine each other. In general, it is \r\nfundamental to know that to what extent the topology of a compact \r\n3-manifold is determined by the fundamental group of the manifold,\r\nand that whether the interior of a compact 3-manifold admits one \r\nof the eight standard  complete metrics under the condition that \r\nthe manifold contains no essential 2-spheres or 2-tori. In this \r\nproposal the PI plans to continue his investigation in this \r\ndirection.\r\n",
