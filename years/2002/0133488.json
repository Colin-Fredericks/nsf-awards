 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internet data traffic is doubling each year. If this rate continues,\r\ndata traffic will surpass voice traffic around the year 2002. However,\r\nnot included in the Internet traffic growth rate estimates are the\r\npotential data generated by web phones and mobile web-enabled PDAs,\r\nnor are the effects of future, unforeseen ``killer apps'' that may\r\ngreat increase the current demand for bandwidth. Thus, the data growth\r\nrate could be significantly higher in the aggregate and at the very\r\nleast, some ``hot sites'' may experience a quadrupling of traffic each\r\nyear.  Unfortunately, due to technological barriers, bandwidth growth\r\nrates per fiber will be limited to only doubling per\r\nyear. Consequently, short falls in available bandwidth may result,\r\nthus placing the burden to effectively manage bandwidth on overworked,\r\nnetwork management teams. Network managers will require techniques and\r\ntools that enable them to \"nowcast\" not only their local network, but\r\nsurrounding networks as well in order to ensure, stable, effective\r\nbandwidth allocation in the face of dynamic, high-bandwidth, next\r\ngeneration ``killer web apps''.\r\n\r\nTo address this \"nowcasting\" problem, we propose the use of a new\r\nparallel simulation modeling technique called \"reverse\r\ncomputation\". Here, network models designed for parallel execution are\r\nable to execute both forwards and backwards in simulated time. For\r\nsimplistic network models, reverse computation has been shown to\r\nreduce the state memory requirements of parallel optimistic\r\nsimulations by a factor of 100 and increase the overall speedup by a\r\nfactor of 6 when compared to classic state-saving techniques used to\r\nsupport rollback processing in optimistic simulations. We also believe\r\nreverse computation will allow large-scale network models to scale to\r\nmuch larger processor configurations as well as enable a more\r\nefficient design of simulation experiments.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to understand the fundamental\r\nfunctional and performance limits of reverse computation when applied\r\nto the modeling of large-scale systems. Because of its importance and\r\nimpact, we have selected network models as our driving application.\r\nTo achieve this goal, we propose to investigate reverse computation in\r\nthe following five major research thrust areas:\r\n\r\n1. the design and implementation of perfectly reversible computation\r\nalgorithms for event-list management, and time management to enable\r\nscalable, efficient optimistic event processing,\r\n\r\n2. the development of processes and techniques to effectively model a\r\nlarge-scale, multi-protocol network scenario in a parallel simulation,\r\nreverse computation framework,\r\n\r\n3. the comparison and contrast of reverse computation performance to\r\nstate-of-the-art conservative synchronization techniques,\r\n\r\n4. the creation of new methods and techniques for the design of\r\nsimulation experiments that take advantage of reverse computation,\r\nand\r\n\r\n5. the exploration of the linkages between reverse computation,\r\nquantum computing and classic parallel/distributed computing that\r\ncould lead to a more unified view of these disparate classes of\r\ncomputation.",
