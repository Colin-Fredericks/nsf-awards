Project activities are based on the hypothesis that providing students an environment that ties all the components of student success into a coherent path with a clear purpose will significantly increase success rates in STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nSTARS will first provide faculty training on advising, mentoring and teaching and learning best practices and opportunities to enhance and/or initiate research endeavors; second, it will merge recruitment, pre-entrance preparation, advising, and mentorship efforts to create a seamless environment, and third, it will provide students superior advising, interdisciplinary research mentoring and exciting ways to learn. STARS will provide a coherent undergraduate student experience, which will result in a significant increase of the success rate of STEM students.\r\n\r\nSTAR Objectives:\r\ndouble STEM graduates attending graduate school in 5 years;\r\nprovide STEM students a seamless environment of recruitment, pre-entrance preparation, advising, mentorship, and research;\r\nprovide experiential learning experiences to 90% of the STEM graduates where students develop independent research skills.\r\nimplement teaching and learning approaches such as: Inquiry Based Learning, Peer Instruction, and Cooperative Learning to promote student learning.\r\n",
