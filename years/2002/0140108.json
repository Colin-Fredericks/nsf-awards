 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first experiment to measure the ratio of the elastic and magnetic form\r\nfactors of the proton at large four-momentum squared, Q^2 with good\r\naccuracy produced unexpected results. This experiment realized in 1998 at\r\nJefferson Lab used the recoil polarization technique, which takes advantage\r\nof the fact that the transverse component of the recoil proton polarization\r\nis proportional to the product of the 2 form factors, thus allowing accurate\r\ndetermination of the small electric form factor. In a second experiment at\r\nJLab in 2000, the measurement was extended to 5.6 GeV^2 , the results\r\nconfirmed the intrinsically different Q^2-dependence of the electric and\r\nmagnetic form factors of the proton beyond any doubt. The data from these 2\r\nJLab experiments have been a challenge for theoretical models which attempt\r\nto describe the proton structure in the non-perturbative domain of Quantum\r\nChromo Dynamics (QCD). As the simplicity of perturbative QCD may not be\r\nencountered at accessible laboratory energies, an understanding of the\r\nstructure of the proton (and likewise of the other nucleon, the neutron)\r\nrequires the use of phenomenological models which depend in parts on data.\r\nNucleons are the building blocks of the matter we are made of and in which\r\nwe live. A full understanding of the structure of the nucleon in terms of\r\nits quark and gluon constituents will be achieved only when we accumulate a\r\ncomplete data base of its response to the electromagnetic probe, electrons\r\nand photons, over a large enough Q^2-range; such experiment represent\r\nthe main part of the research program at JLab. We now have a third\r\nexperiment, recently approved with highest priority; it will extend the\r\nrange of Q^2 probed to 9 GeV^2.This grant will make it possible for\r\nme to continue leading this project to and through  the next phase, which\r\nrequire new detectors (a new polarimeter to measure the recoil proton\r\npolarization, and a new calorimeter to measure the associate scattered\r\nelectron) and will take  3 years to prepare.\r\n\r\n",
