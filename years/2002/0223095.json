 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conference FASEB Summer Research Conference on Calcium Oxalate in Biological Systems will be held from August 3 - 8, 2002 at the Vermont Academy in Saxtons River, Vermont.  The primary goal of this conference is to provide a multidisciplinary forum to discuss recent advances and future directions for research on all manner of calcium oxalate crystallization that occur in nature. More than 100 scientists are expected to attend this conference.  Specific objectives of the conference include the following: 1) to promote scientific exchange of ideas, information, and methodologies among scientists from diverse disciplines whose common focus is calcium oxalate, 2) to discuss areas of controversy and to identify new areas requiring investigation in calcium oxalate research, 3) to foster cross-fertilization of ideas and facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations, 4) to integrate information from diverse systems encompassed by the topics and disciplines of conference participants, and 5) to promote and encourage entry of young and new investigators into all areas of calcium oxalate research.  Special efforts have been made to include new young investigators and scientists from underrepresented groups in the conference program. Seventeen of the scheduled speakers are new young investigators, including nine women, comprising 37% of the total program. In addition, the conference program includes a total of fourteen women, including two of the three organizers, a substantial increase over the previous conference on this topic. Funds requested by this proposal will be applied specifically to support the participation of young investigators and underrepresented groups. \r\n",
