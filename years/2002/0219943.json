 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent and growing popularity of thin-client systems makes it\r\nimportant to develop techniques for analyzing and comparing their\r\nperformance, to assess the general feasibility of the thin-client\r\ncomputing model in modern networking environments, and to determine\r\nthe factors that govern the performance of these architectures. \r\nThis project involves carrying out a series of experiments to gain\r\ninformation and understanding on the effectiveness of thin-client\r\narchitectural mechanisms for graphical and multimedia applications in\r\nvarious network environments.  These experiments include performance\r\nanalysis using several real applications as well as controlled\r\nexperiments with specialized micro-benchmarks designed to isolate\r\nparticular aspects of thin-client architectures that have significant\r\nimpact on overall application performance. Application and user\r\nworkloads will be varied to understand and analyze the scalability of\r\ndifferent remote display mechanisms in terms of network and server\r\nresources.  These experiments will be conducted in a testbed\r\nenvironment in which network characteristics such as bandwidth,\r\nlatency, and packet loss are varied in a controlled manner to\r\nunderstand their impact on thin-client architectural design\r\nchoices.  The results of these experiments will have a fundamental\r\nscientific impact by laying a quantitative foundation for future\r\ninnovations in thin-client computing research.",
