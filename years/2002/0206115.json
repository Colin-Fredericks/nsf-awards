 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST 0206115\r\nOswalt  \r\n\r\nDr. Terry Oswalt, at the Florida Institute of Technology, will carry out  a spectroscopic study of wide binary star pairs that contain normal cool main sequence stars with distant non-interacting white dwarf companions.  White dwarfs are the slowly cooling  remnants  of  all  previous  generations  of  stars  in  the Galaxy.    The wide  binary  sample contains white dwarfs whose cooling ages span the entire history of the Solar neighborhood (~10 billion years).  Some may be members of the Galaxy's halo component.   Dr. Oswalt's study has two main objectives: (1) How far beyond the  Sun's age of ~4.6  billion years does the strong correlation between chromospheric activity and age in lower main sequence stars extend?  What variables other than age (e.g. mass, metallicity) affect chromospheric activity?  (2) What is the space density of cool white dwarfs stars, and how much does it contribute to the dark matter content of the Galaxy?  What are the ages of the disk and/or halo derived from the white dwarf cooling times? \r\n\r\nFor  several  decades  it  has  been  known  that  stellar  chromospheric  activity  strongly \r\ndepends upon stellar age in Solar-type stars.  Recently, it has been recognized that this \r\nrelationship breaks down, or at least depends on additional variables, in cool M-type stars less massive than about one fourth that of the Sun.  However, all this prior work has been calibrated using  stars  in  several  nearby  clusters  whose  ages  were  estimated  from  stellar  evolutionary models.  None are much older than the Sun.  Stellar ages are among the most difficult to determine fundamental properties of stars.  Cooling  times  for  the  white  dwarfs  in  wide  binaries,  corrected  for  their  progenitors'  main sequence lifetimes, provide relatively  robust estimates for the ages of their main sequence companions.  In the course of a prior investigation Dr. Oswalt has determined cooling ages for several hundred white dwarfs in wide binaries.   The uncertainty in age can be as small as 10-20% in pairs older than about 3-4 billion years, when the white dwarf mass is known.  The recent discovery of a few halo white dwarfs has spurred intense interest because they are the remnants of the first generation of stars in the Solar neighborhood and may be a large component of the Galaxy's dark matter.  Wide binaries may help to resolve the current dispute over the population membership of the candidates found to date.  A main sequence companion provides a unique benchmark for the determination of the mass (via  gravitational redshift), kinematics (via radial velocity) and chemical abundance (metallicity) that cannot be obtained from the near featureless spectra of single white dwarfs. \r\n***",
