 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Colorado in Boulder will acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) the mechanism, design, synthesis and evaluation of anti-cancer drugs involving DNA cross-linking (Koch); b) new \"naked\" and extremely reactive cations of a variety of elements, and studies of fluorinated bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (Michl); c) organic synthesis, including glycopeptides and glycoproteins, and derivatized structural analogs (Halcomb); d) organic synthesis involving a new class of catalysts for accomplishing hydroxyl-directed reactions (Sammakia); e) the design and characterization of nanostructured solid-state organic materials (Gin); and f) fundamental structural, spectroscopic and mechanistic investigations of metalloenzymes (Hagadorn).     \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in a number of areas including biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and catalysis.",
