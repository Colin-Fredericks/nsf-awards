 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is serving students in the western portion of Phoenix and Maricopa County, Arizona. The Project seeks to recruit academically talented yet financially needy students interested in the fields of computer science, computer technology, engineering, engineering technology, and mathematics (CSEMS), especially those from underrepresented groups in these disciplines. The Project's goals are to support CSEMS recipients in their academic endeavors, promote student success through the completion of an associate's degree and/or the transfer to a four-year institution, and expose participants to the various professional avenues that the CSEMS disciplines offer. The project utilizes existing structures at the college with a proven success record in promoting diversity and academic quality in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Through the college's Achievement in Mathematics and Science (AMAS) Program, Achievement in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science (AIMES) Programs, and Summer Bridge Program, strategies have been developed to recruit capable students, especially underrepresented groups, into the these disciplines and ensure their success in academic programs. \r\n\r\nThe project aims to achieve the following objectives:\r\n(1) 90% of CSEMS scholarship recipients make satisfactory progress (GPA of 2.5 or better) in a targeted program of study leading to an associate's degree as full-time students during semesters for which they receive scholarship support.\r\n(2) 100% of CSEMS scholarship recipients participate in at least 90% of CSEMS special events and activities during semesters for which they receive scholarship support.\r\n(3) 85% of CSEMS scholarship recipients make satisfactory progress towards their educational goals (i.e. be enrolled as full-time students at a community college in the following semester, transfer to a university, or have met the requirements for/been awarded an AAS or AS degree in the targeted programs.)\r\n(4) 50% of CSEMS recipients are from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the CSEMS disciplines (women, persons with disabilities, Hispanics, African-Americans, and/or Native Americans).\r\n\r\nThe Project is establishing support structures that are exclusive to CSEMS recipients. These include mentoring from Faculty Coordinators, Individual Education Plans, tutoring services and study groups, supplemental instruction, special events and activities, career counseling, and university transfer options. The Team is monitoring the progress of the students and conducting both formative and summative evaluations of project processes and outcomes.",
