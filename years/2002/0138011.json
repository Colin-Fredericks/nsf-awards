 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Paul A. Garris at Illinois State University\r\nto develop a new instrument for wireless monitoring of neural activity in\r\nthe brain of awake, unrestrained animals.  The new instrument, called\r\nreal-time animal telemetry (RAT), will combine two powerful technologies;\r\nmicrosensors for spatially and temporally resolved measurements, and digital\r\ntelemetry for remote data transmission and system control with high speed\r\nand high fidelity. The primary advantage of RAT will be sub-second\r\ncharacterization of brain function  with minimal perturbation of behavior.  \r\nThe proposed RAT instrument holds great promise for advancing the study \r\nof brain-behavior relationships.\r\n\r\nRAT will be a modular and multifunctional instrument, a design that advances\r\ndevelopment and affords flexibility to its application.  Several types of\r\nmeasurement techniques will be incorporated into RAT: Voltammetry which \r\nmonitors the chemistry of the brain and electrophysiology which\r\nmeasures brain bioelectrical activity.  Combined, the techniques assess the\r\nrelease of a neurotransmitter and its postsynaptic effect to obtain a more\r\nintegrative view of brain function. Although great strides have recently been made \r\napplying real-time voltammetry and electrophysiology to awake animals, \r\nthe connection between sensor and recording equipment is made by a cable tether.  Unfortunately, the hard connection affects behavior and hinders or even prevents \r\ninvestigation of important paradigms such as those involving social interactions \r\nand complex environments.  To overcome this problem, the new instrument will \r\nuse a wireless link.  Moreover, because real-time voltammetric and electrophysiological measurements are very susceptible to transmission artifacts, RAT will use high fidelity digital telemetry.\r\n\r\nUltimately, RAT should be commercially viable instrumentation in the support of\r\nbiological research.  The incorporation of well-established techniques will\r\nmake the proposed RAT instrument attractive to large number of users working\r\nin the neuroscience fields.  With further development, there is enormous\r\npotential for RAT to support other existing real-time microsensors.  RAT can\r\nalso evolve to accommodate sensor technologies that emerge in the future.",
