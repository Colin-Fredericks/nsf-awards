 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n     This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will create image processing based software that tracks objects using real-time video input for use in the teaching of mathematics and physical science.  Image processing has not previously been used in educational motion detection.  Compared to the currently used methods-real-time graphing and frame-by-frame analysis of stored video-the proposed innovation will have many advantages, such as the simultaneous display of video and graphs and the automatic generation of stroboscopic images. Phase I has two research objectives.  To develop a system that can track one object and display a graph of its motion on a computer screen in real time, and to investigate with teachers and students the applications of this system to understanding motion, graphing, shapes, visualization, and projection.\r\n     Used in conjunction with inquiry-based curriculum, the system proffered by Paul Antonucci & Associates could improve teaching and learning of physical science and mathematics nationwide, and it expands the possibilities for exploring motion in real-world situations.  This innovation will create the opportunity to surpass in learning effectiveness and ease-of-use the technologies now used widely in high school and college physics.  In addition it will potentially reach a much larger market-mathematics classrooms from middle school through college. \r\n",
