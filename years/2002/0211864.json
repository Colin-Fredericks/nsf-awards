They focus on the patterning events mediated by the\r\nEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), during which a localized\r\nsource of the EGFR ligand is modulated in space and time by a\r\ndistributed network of autocrine loops to produce a biochemical\r\nblueprint specifying the formation of a pair organ.  The\r\ninvestigators develop mechanistic models of EGFR signaling in\r\nDrosophila oogenesis.  These models are necessary to directly test\r\nconsistency of the proposed regulatory mechanisms, to make the\r\nexperimentally verifiable predictions, and to guide the design of\r\nfuture experiments.  The models should explicitly account for the\r\nkey components of the EGFR system: the receptor, four of its\r\nligands, ligand processing proteins, and intracellular signaling\r\ncascades.  The nonlinear reaction-transport models of spatially\r\ndistributed EGFR signaling networks are analyzed using a\r\ncombination of numerical simulations, asymptotic techniques, and\r\nbifurcation analysis.  The tests of model-based predictions rely\r\non experimental advantages of Drosophila genetics.\r\n     Signaling through the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor EGFR\r\nis essential in a number of developmental processes across\r\nspecies, from fruitflies to humans, and is extensively studied at\r\nthe molecular level.  The main goal of the project is to develop\r\nmodeling and computational tools necessary to describe\r\nreaction-transport processes in developing epithelial layers.  In\r\nthe context of Drosophila, the investigators aim to capture a\r\nlarge number of phenotypic transitions in eggshell morphology\r\nthat have been observed following quantitative manipulations in\r\nthe doses of the regulatory genes.  This leads to a class of\r\nmathematical problems that are also relevant in other biological\r\nand physico-chemical settings.  Given the highly conserved nature\r\nof EGFR systems, it is possible that the proposed analysis of\r\npatterning events in Drosophila oogenesis may be used to\r\nunderstand the role of EGFR in the formation of branched\r\nepithelial structures in the development of higher organisms.  The\r\nproject has a significant educational component: it brings\r\ntogether and trains students and postdocs in biology, engineering\r\nand mathematics.\r\n",
