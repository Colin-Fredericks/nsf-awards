 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. David Foster at Harvard University to purchase a mobile canopy access platform to support research at the Harvard Forest.  Forest canopies are key sites for the exchange of mass, energy and momentum within forest ecosystems.  However, examination of the physiological and physical processes occurring within the canopy is hampered by logistic difficulties of conducting research that involves sophisticated equipment at heights far above the ground.  The funds provided in this grant will allow the purchase of a mobile canopy access platform of the type referred to as an articulated boom lift in the construction industry.  This \"macromanipulator\" will enhance ongoing projects of six investigators whose work at the Harvard Forest focuses on tree physiology, ecosystem processes, and atmosphere-biosphere exchange.  \r\n\r\nForests are inherently three-dimensional systems.  A mobile canopy access system will provide investigators with the ability to expand their research into new areas and new dimensions.  A mobile platform is well suited to research at the Harvard Forest due to the relatively low stature of the forest (~ 20 m) and the extensive network of fire roads.  At present, canopy access at the Harvard Forest is limited to a small number of fixed towers.  A mobile canopy system will allow us to extend our studies to a broader range of community types and to sample from a larger number of trees.  In addition, a mobile canopy access platform is compatible with physiological studies that frequently require the collection of destructive samples.  Specific projects that will benefit from the purchase of this instrument include: Dr. Foster's studies of the impact of the hemlock wooly adelgid, a recently introduced pest of hemlock trees, Dr. Bazzaz's research on photosynthesis-nitrogen dynamics in forest trees, Dr. Holbrook's studies of water transport in tall trees, Dr. Wofsy's studies of CO2 exchange between forest ecosystems and the atmosphere, Dr. Aber's studies of the effects of chronic nitrogen deposition on forest ecosystems, and Dr. Steudler's research on global warming and carbon storage in mid-latitude forest ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe Harvard Forest is an important site for both research and teaching.  Much of the research at the Harvard Forest is directed at understanding the function and stability of forest ecosystems in relation to human disturbance and global climate change.  Thus, the acquisition of this instrument will contribute to our understanding of the health and resilience of this important ecosystem.\r\n",
