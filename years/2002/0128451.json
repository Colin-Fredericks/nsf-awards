 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop innovative technologies for smart infrastructure, and in particular coordinated wireless sensors and control devices. The first smart wireless devices will focus on measurement and control of environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity, although these devices are archetypes for a wider range of smart components. The behavior of the smart devices will be coordinated by the MetaOS, a software system developed by Ambient Computing, Inc. to provide traditional operating system functions to fully distributed collections of smart computing and networking devices. The system will demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of connected and coordinated smart devices.  The early commercial applications of the proposed work will focus on improvement of energy consumption and personalization of environmental parameters. Existing means of addressing these problems are highly proprietary, difficult and expensive to deploy, and have limited flexibility. The proposed more advanced systems will lead to significant reduction in overall energy consumption while providing personal comfort and financial benefits to consumers. \r\n\r\nThis effort aims to build some of the missing and necessary pieces for smart environments, specifically, small and low-cost wireless devices with integrated computing capabilities.",
