 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to continue a well-established and successful Summer program that provides undergraduates the opportunity to participate in the excitement of working in a premier science laboratory.  The goal of the program is to recruit students from the physical sciences with the hope they will be stimulated to the point of pursuing a research career in the Earth Sciences.  Recruitment of underrepresented minorities and women is emphasized.  Students in this program will work with faculty members of the Mineral Physics Institute (MPI) on projects that probe the physical and chemical properties of materials with a particular emphasis on the use of high pressure.  Working closely with members of the MPI, students will pursue their own projects and discuss their progress during weekly seminar sessions.  During the program, students will have the opportunity to visit other laboratories and institutions affiliated with the MPI.",
