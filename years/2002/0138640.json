 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) \"site\" at six primarily undergraduate institutions. This dispersed site is coordinated by David Rheingold at Juniata College and involves 12 undergraduates each summer for 2002, 2003 and 2004. While this REU site is geographically dispersed, it is linked by the common theme of physical organic chemistry. The research projects include the synthesis and material science applications of hexaazaanthracenes (Brisbois, Macalester); antiaromatic fluorenyl and indenyl dications (Mills, Trinity University);  rational syntheses of buckminsterfullerene (Mitzel, Trinity College); ordered arrays of polyphenols by tandem reactions (Rheingold, Juniata); synthesis and electronic structure of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl-phenylacetylenes (Mondanaro, St. Michael's College); and electronic effects in the cycloaromatization of arenediynes (Russell, Northern Kentucky University). Students will be recruited by each research mentor, with special efforts to recruit members of underrepresented groups. The mentors and undergraduate researchers will meet as a group at least twice each summer (once at a national meeting) and use electronic bulletin boards or tele/video conferences to discuss their research informally. The REU program will be assessessed by participant surveys and faculty evaluations of student progress.",
