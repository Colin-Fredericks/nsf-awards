 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Civil (54)\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to strengthen the sophomore-year experience in civil and environmental engineering by using advanced surveying measurements to solve real-world engineering problems and to introduce concepts of engineering design. The project adapts and implements the experiential learning concepts of the \"Sooner City\" project. The project targets the sophomores and uses real-world problems to engage students in engineering design early in the curriculum. The content of CIE 272 \"Civil and Environmental Engineering Measurements\" is being altered to include more (and different) surveying laboratories, and to integrate the surveying labs with the use of AutoCAD. Also, a new sophomore-level course CIE 372 \"Project Layout and Site Planning\" is being developed and initiated. Finally, faculty members in other programs at Syracuse University are using the equipment purchased for this project for undergraduate teaching in basin analysis, geomorphology, field ecology, geographic information systems, and architecture. With support from NSF, Syracuse University is acquiring advanced optical and satellite- based surveying equipment for hands-on use by undergraduate students in civil and environmental engineering, earth sciences, geography, biology, and other programs. As a result of this project, undergraduate students are learning how to make state-of-the-art optical and satellite-based surveying measurements, and how to work with the resulting data on the Computer. Students completing CIE 272 and 372 are developing highly marketable skills in surveying and computer applications, which will enhance their opportunities for summer jobs, cooperative education placements, and permanent employment. Engaging students in the hands- on solution of real-world engineering problems fills a void in the traditional sophomore-year curriculum. Collaboration with faculty in other departments stimulates cross-disciplinary teaching and encourages students to take additional courses outside their majors.\r\n",
