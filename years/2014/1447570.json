 "awd_abstract_narration": "This student travel grant supports graduate/undergraduate and young researchers to attend the 2014 International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling and to participate in the Doctoral Consortium (ICAPS-DC). The ICAPS DC is a primary method for broadening participation and improving retention of doctoral researchers in the field of automated planning and scheduling. The DC at ICAPS 2014 is the 12th occurrence of the event, and takes place in June 2014 in Portsmouth, NH, USA. This is the first ICAPS held in the US since 2007. Those receiving awards through the Support Fund are able to participate in events, including but not limited to the DC, where they can receive career and research advice from peers and mentors, present preliminary results and plans for their dissertations, and build professional relationships. To support career development, invited speakers present emerging research opportunities, discuss research skills and the process of transitioning to the workplace after graduation. The participation of Ph.D. students at ICAPS 2014 and the DC is be beneficial to both the students and the international planning community, and to ensure cross-fertilization among researchers in areas of planning, scheduling, robotics, operations research, combinatorial search, knowledge representation and reasoning, and applications.",
