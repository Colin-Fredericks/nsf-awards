 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to explore the feasibility of an approach to relate the generation and propagation of acoustic emission waveforms from atomistic sources with the relevant plastic deformation mechanisms in ultra-precision machining processes, based on adapting recent advances in nanolithography, ray acoustics and material point theories, towards real-time monitoring of surface quality. Ultra-precision machining processes have a broad range of applications in automotive, aerospace, medical, and defense industries. Real-time monitoring of these processes is hampered by low signal-to-noise ratios of conventional sensors, and costs associated with advanced in-situ instruments. Currently, acoustic emission offers a viable means for real-time and high resolution monitoring of these processes. However, physical principles connecting the process microdynamics with acoustic emission waveforms, which are critical for real-time monitoring of anomalies in ultra-precision machining processes, remain elusive. The physical principles and models from this research can be vital for harnessing acoustic emission signals for real-time process monitoring to assure nano-scale precisions and surface quality.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the investigations would lay foundations to advance sensing technologies for real-time quality assurance of ultra-precision manufacturing processes in the vital industries of today's economy. Considerable short-term impact will accrue from active research partnerships with the industry, and involvement of graduate and undergraduate students. The affiliated educational activities will include enriching a graduate course by employing the new experimentation facilities and other research outcomes as part of the lab, as well as by incorporating the results from the proposed research as course modules in process modeling and mechanics tracks.",

Building on earlier studies, this project has identified physical sources of specific components of acoustic emission signals, and has developed quantitative techniques to relate certain complex patterns present of AE signals from cutting materials to specific phenomena, and anomalies in a metal cutting process. Experimental studies were conducted at different length scales on multiple machine platforms and material combinations. The first study with a micro-endmilling process applied to create micro-fluidic channels on stainless steel blocks have established that 40% of variations in surface roughness (quantified in terms of Sa, an average absolute deviation of surface undulations) in the micro-endmilling process can be attributed to the built-up edge effect, i.e., the graduate accumulation of the material on the cutting tool and its deposition onto the surface of the cut material. The next study employed a microlithography process to scratch the surface of a Titanium alloy material containing two prominent types of micro-scale structures. Experimental investigations have led to the quantitative delineation of the differences in the frequencies, wavelengths and amplitudes of acoustic emission released during the microlithography process on the two types of microstructures.</p>\n<p>A Bayesian statistical method was then devised to detect anomalies in a process based on discerning information from acoustic emission and such signals that have a complex, bursty patterns that vary over time. The results suggest that the Bayesian approach can consistently detect incipient, critical changes in acoustic emission and such complex signals some 20-90% ahead of competing methods in benchmark test cases as well as a variety of real-world applications. Most pertinently, it can detect changes that lead to anomalies, such as the formation of built-up edge and surface scratches, in various precision manufacturing processes with 80% or higher sensitivities and specificities. We have further enhanced the speed of detection through the use of intrinsic time and frequency components. Extensive numerical, as well as real-world case studies, suggest that the present method can detect sharp change points with an average sensitivity of above 90%. This method was next implemented as an \"App\" and deployed as part of a demonstration of a smart manufacturing platform for discrete part manufacturing. These suite of techniques were next applied to monitor the acoustic emission and other signal patterns during machining of natural fiber-reinforced polymer composite materials. Results from these studies indicate that the high-frequency components (in 200 - 500 kHz range) of the measured acoustic emission signals capture the variations in the fundamental material removal mechanisms.<br /> <br /> The project has provided training to over 30 undergraduate students during the course of this project. The students were supported by Texas A&amp;M University's Undergraduate Summer Research Grant,&nbsp; Research-Intensive Community for Undergraduate program, and Aggie Challenge programs, in addition to an NSF REU supplement.
