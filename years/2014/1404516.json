The School provides an opportunity for advanced U.S. Ph.D. students and recent graduates to interact directly with top researchers in the field. The participants will learn current techniques in the most significant areas of probability theory, including noise stability, random walks on random fractals, stochastic models of evolution, phase transitions for random constraint satisfaction problems, correlated Gaussian fields, and branching random walks. It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas.\r\n\r\nThe 2014 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences Summer School in Probability will be an excellent opportunity for Ph.D. students and junior researchers to learn some of the most significant modern probability theory from the top experts in the field and to interact with them directly. The junior participants are often current and future academic faculty, able to spread the knowledge of the modern techniques further in the research community. \r\n\r\nSchool website: www.math.ubc.ca/Links/ssprob14/",
