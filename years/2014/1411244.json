 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objective: The objective of this multidisciplinary program is to develop disruptive Radio Frequency (RF) technologies that provide significant spectral efficiency gains at the physical layer, by leveraging recent advances in physical layer interference management and integrated receiver design. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\nThe intellectual merits of this project is composed of the following three thrusts: (i) RF Front-End Signal Projection and Cancellation for Enhanced Dynamic Range, (ii) Controlled Reflectors for Receiver-Centric Interference Management, and (iii) Fundamentals of Receiver-Centric Interference Management. The first thrust utilizes information about the structure of the interference to suppress it early in the receiver chain, shielding subsequent stages from full dynamic range requirements of the system. The second thrust develops RF receivers which double as controlled, coordinated reflectors, and are able to alter the effective channel gains to nearby receivers. The third thrust develops new interference management strategies in the light of the aforementioned new capabilities of transceivers and studies the fundamental limits of spectral efficiency under such technologies. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\r\n By developing collaboration and communication between two fields of \"information theory\" and \"RF Integrated Circuits\", this program opens new horizons in both fields. This project impacts the nation's economy not only by enabling greater network capacity, but also by spurring technological advances that can easily be transferred to the wireless and electronics industries, driving economic growth in those areas. This project also provides opportunities for research experience for undergraduates and includes several outreach activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany kinds of wireless coordination and the synchronization underlying it require same-channel full-duplex to be realized at greatest effect.  This included both relay-based systems, and coordinated systems.  In this project, we demonstrated the first fully integrated same-channel, full-duplex RF transceiver.  As compared to prior Full-Duplex work which involved large printed circuit boards, our approach was fully on-chip.  In addition, this work acts more as a software defined radio, allowing the system to be highly flexible in frequency (tunable across more than a factor of 10 in frequency), and bandwidth, with extremely high resistance to out-of-band interference.  This combination of duplex, tunability and resistance to out-of-band interference is especially useful, in the modern situation of a crowded spectrum: Tunability and out-of-band resistance means the radio to can move its frequency away from those of large interference sources, resisting them, while using the coordination enabled by full duplex to overcome more moderate in-band interference.  Critically, we also developed simple techniques for adapting to changes in antenna properties, which are highly sensitive to environmental effects and frequency of operation. We have also studied the fundamental capacity limits of communication networks with full-duplex capabilities under coarse, incomplete, and heterogeneous channel knowledge at the transmitters and receivers. \n\n Complimenting this work, we also further developed a full analytical description of N-phase passive-mixers, especially when used in a mixer-first receiver configurations.  This development is especially important in the context of interference mitigation, both because such receivers represent some of the most interference-tolerant RFIC receiver topologies known.  It is also provides a theoretical basis for estimating the fundamental limits on structures developed by others in support of full duplex, such as recently developed linear-time-varying circulators. We also studied the applications of our interference management techniques to device-to-device communication networks and cache-aided networks, which are expected to be important application scenarios in future wireless networks.\nThe techniques developed in this project can likely be applied to other apparently very different problems.  In particular, this research has inspired us to apply this same approach to cancelling stimulation artifacts in neural interfaces where simultaneous stimulation and detection of neural activity is needed. We have also pursued the application of our interference management techniques for enabling \"wireless distributed computing\".
