 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are fundamental problems to speeding up CPUs beyond what is \r\npossible today. Because individual transistors are not getting any \r\nfaster, manufacturers like Intel and AMD are no longer able to get \r\nmassive performance improvements just by increasing clock speeds \r\n(e.g., going from 2GHz to 10GHz). To overcome this, future CPUs will \r\ncontain hundreds to thousands of smaller computational cores on a \r\nsingle chip which will all run at the speed similar to current \r\nprocessors (e.g., 2GHz). This means that each single core will only be \r\nas powerful as current CPUs, but that the total aggregate power of all \r\nthe cores will be significantly more than what is possible today. An \r\nimportant problem with the advent of these new CPUs is that the \r\ndatabase systems that are used in all aspects of our society are \r\nill-suited for this change. Such database systems are used to store \r\nand access data for a variety of applications, including on-line \r\nbusiness (e.g., Google, Facebook), scientific instruments (e.g., \r\nastronomical telescopes), and medicine (e.g., MRI scanners). The \r\nreason that they are not ready to handle these new \"many-core CPUs\" is \r\nbecause most of them use ideas that were designed in the 1970s and \r\n1980s when processors only had a single core. Thus, the purpose of \r\nthis project is to develop both software and hardware technologies \r\nthat will allow database systems to utilize the full computational \r\npower of future CPU architectures. The results of this project will \r\nenable organizations to deploy future applications on fewer machines \r\nthat use less energy than what is currently used today.\r\n\r\nComputer architectures are moving towards an era dominated by \r\nmany-core machines with hundreds of cores on a single chip. This \r\nunprecedented level of on-chip parallelism introduces a new dimension \r\nto scalability that current database management systems (DBMSs) were \r\nnot designed for. In particular, it becomes exceedingly difficult for \r\nthe DBMS to perform concurrency control, logging, and indexing \r\nefficiently. With hundreds of threads running in parallel, the \r\ncomplexity of coordinating competing reads and writes to data \r\ndiminishes the benefits of increased core counts. Thus, in this \r\nproject the PIs propose to develop a software-hardware co-design approach \r\nfor DBMSs in the many-core era. On the software side, rather than \r\nattempting to remove scalability bottlenecks of existing DBMS \r\narchitectures through incremental improvements, the PIs seek a bottom-up \r\napproach where the architecture is designed to target many-core \r\nsystems from inception. On the hardware side, instead of simply adding \r\nmore cores to a single chip, the PIs will design new hardware components \r\nthat can unburden the software system from computationally critical \r\ntasks.\r\n\r\nFor further information see project web site at: \r\nhttp://db.cs.cmu.edu/projects/1000cores/",
