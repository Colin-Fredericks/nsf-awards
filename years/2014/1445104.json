 "awd_abstract_narration": "To prepare the country's youth more broadly for a globalized world, the U.S. National Commission on Mathematics Instruction (USNCMI) will engage with the international community and assist in improving the state of mathematics education in the country by implementing international education programs, participating in international benchmarking activities, and working closely with other countries and multilateral organizations. As a commission of the Board of International Scientific Organizations, the USNCMI serves as the liaison to the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI), representing the U.S. mathematics education community abroad while learning about the world's best mathematics educational practices. Through a series of local and international activities over the course of three years, the USNCMI will achieve the following goals: (1) advance the U.S. position in the international mathematics education community through continued engagement, leveraging the U.S. strength in research; (2) create opportunities for educators in the U.S. to learn from promising practices in other countries and engage with mathematics educators internationally; and, (3) communicate findings from Goals 1 and 2 to the mathematics education community and policymakers in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe USNCMI provides the vehicle through which the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reaches out to, and coordinates international activities with, the U.S. mathematics education community. Further, it takes advantage of the NAS network to disseminate its national and international interests, activities, and products. The USNCMI will continue to provide effective international representation and participation in meetings that involve learning and sharing the world's best practices in mathematics education. The primary activities of the USNCMI over the next three years are as follows: (1) Participate in ICMI leadership meetings, which provide vision and mission for fostering efforts to improve the quality of mathematics teaching and learning worldwide; (2) Participate in the influential ICMI Studies, which is a document that addresses how to better understand and resolve the challenges that face multidisciplinary and culturally diverse research and development in mathematics education; (3) Provide support for a strong U.S. representation at the next ICMI Congress (ICME-13) and the General Assembly in 2016, which foster  collaboration, exchange, and dissemination of ideas and information involving the theory and practice of contemporary mathematical education; (4) Support the U.S. bid to host ICME-14 in Hawaii in 2020, an international meeting that develops a scientific program addressing various aspects of mathematics education; (5) Host and facilitate the U.S.-Finland Workshop, which will discuss current mathematics education policies and best practices in the U.S. and Finland; (6) Hold the Park City Mathematics Institute International Seminar, which invites scholars from different countries to discuss viewpoints and other relevant issues related to mathematics education; and, (7) Disseminate opportunities and products of the USNCMI and ICMI to the U.S. mathematics education community.",

It represents the U.S. mathematics education community abroad while learning about the world?s best mathematics educational practices to inform work in the United States.  Under this award (September 1, 2014 - August 31, 2019), the USNC/MI achieved the following overarching goals: 1) advanced the U.S. position in the international mathematics education community 2) created opportunities for educators in the U.S. to learn about promising practices in other countries and engage with mathematics educators internationally; and 3) communicated findings from goals 1 and 2 to the mathematics education community and policymakers in the U.S.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe primary activities pursued in this grant and their respective outcomes are:\n\n1) Participation in ICMI Studies.  This series of studies contribute to a better understanding of multidisciplinary and culturally diverse research and development in mathematics education.  Each Study focuses on a topic or issue of interest in mathematics education.  ICMI Study 24 addressed \"School Mathematics Curriculum Reforms: Challenges and Changes.?  An American mathematics educator and researcher, Al Cuoco, served on the study committee.  Similarly, ICMI Study 25 addresses ?Teachers of Mathematics Working and Learning in Collaborative Groups.?  Hilda Borko from Stanford University and Despina Potari from Greece are co-chairing this study.  This grant helped fund the U.S. participation.  \n\n2) U.S. representation at the ICMI Congress (ICME-13) and the General Assembly in 2016.  The U.S. had a full delegation at the General Assembly held in Hamburg, Germany in July 2016, and was well represented by participants, sessions, invited speakers, and educators at the Congress.  This offers an opportunity for math educators from around the world to meet and share best practices.  This was the first time in history that an ICMI Congress had more attendees from the United States than from the host country. \n\n3) U.S. - Finland Workshop.  Following ICME-13, the USNC/MI in collaboration with University of Helsinki held a bilateral workshop in Helsinki, Finland entitled Supporting Mathematics Teachers and Teaching in the United States and Finland.  Thirty U.S. and Finnish mathematics educators and experts met in person and 70 professionals joined virtually.  A NAS Workshop Summary report was published in 2018, and has been downloaded 1,811 times.  All the material (videos, slides, report) is openly available and has been disseminated using multiple channels and approaches.    \n\n4) U.S. Bid to host (ICME-14) in Hawaii, 2020.  The USNC/MI endorsed and assisted in the preparation and submission of the U.S. bid.  Another country, however, was chosen to host the meeting.   \n\n5) Park City Mathematics Institute (PCMI) International Seminar. Members of the U.S. National Committee for ICMI organized week-long international seminars at the Park City Mathematics Institute in 2016 and 2017.  The goal of the seminars was to bring together two-person teams consisting of a university mathematics educator or policymaker, and a secondary teacher from a small number of nations to discuss major issues in mathematics education policy and practice.  By implementing what they learned at PCMI, the teachers and educators have helped their students become aware of real issues that can be confronted, explained and understood with mathematics.  In one case, a seminar participant used seminar materials to prepare a Data Analysis module for students who in turn excelled in the National Olympiad.\n\n6) Outreach and Dissemination.  USNC members have used professional society meetings to disseminate information and raise awareness about ICMI and USNC/MI activities.  The number of conference sessions organized at U.S. professional society meetings have increased (NCSM and AMATYC Annual Conferences, and NCTM Annual and Regional Conferences).  Furthermore, in 2018 the USNC/MI started a Webinar Series in collaboration with professional societies.  Also, professional societies have included USNC/MI articles and announcements in their newsletters. \n\nBroader Impact\n\nThis grant facilitated and promoted U.S. mathematics education in the world and assisted in the professional development of U.S. mathematics educators through the activities planned and held by the USNC/MI.  The commission increased its impact by facilitating the production of material that can be easily accessible and used by others, such as workshop summary reports, PCMI papers, etc.  The USNC/MI has represented the United States mathematics education community at large in ICMI and brought ICMI news and opportunities to the U.S.  An evidence of success in improving the outreach is the fact that more Americans are now involved in ICMI initiatives such as ICMI Studies and ICMI Congresses. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine E Bailey"
