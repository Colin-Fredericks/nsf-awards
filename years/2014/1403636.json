This will be the fifth conference in the biennial AREADNE series that provides opportunities for US students and scientists studying neural ensembles to be informed on the latest advances in the field, interact with their international peers and develop long-term professional relationships. The primary goals of the AREADNE conference include:  1.  To provide an open, interactive forum to foster discussion of cutting-edge results from scientific leaders in the field of neural ensembles. 2.  To enable the development of lasting professional relationships by creating an informal environment that predisposes attendees to free interaction. 3. To create a scientific venue that offers US investigators exposure to their European and Eastern Mediterranean peers in the field.  Additionally, the conference will provide a forum to foster interactions of established investigators with students, post-docs and other young scientists in the field.  \r\n\r\nEncoding and decoding of neural ensembles is a developing field in neuroscience.  The biennial AREADNE conference meets an important need in this field, as there is no other similar conference that provides a tight, focused, and intensive presentation of the subject and topics.  Single-track morning and evening sessions with invited speakers and evening poster presentations will be used to disseminate the latest advances in the field and promote interactions among the attendees.  Planned sessions include (1) early visual systems, (2) decision making, (3) patterns and network synchronization, (4) connectomics, (5) learning and plasticity, (6) molecular mechanisms, and (7) visuo-motor integration. For each theme, presentations will emphasize how sensory, cognitive, and motor states are encoded in the interaction of multiple neurons and in turn how these states can be reconstructed from neuronal ensembles. After the meeting, proceedings will be published on the web for wide dissemination to the scientific community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAREADNE 2014 Project Outcomes Report\n\nAttendees\n\nThe AREADNE 2014 Conference was held as planned 25-29 June 2014.  There were 23 invited speakers and 77 presented abstracts.  There were 93 total participants from 20 different countries: 47 delegates were from North America, 80 from Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, and 4 from the rest of the world.\n\nScientific Highlights\n\nAREADNE 2014 continued the same impressive quality and impact of presentations and discussions as seen at the previous four meetings.  A few of the talks are summarized below as highlights of the conference.\n\nSusumu Tonegawa from MIT demonstrated how a fear memory associated with a particular context could be artificially recalled by specifically labeling hippocampal neurons involved in formation of that fear memory and then stimulating that ensemble using optogenetics in a different context.\n\nPhilip Sabes from UCSF showed how artificial, patterned electrical stimulation in the parietal cortex could be used by a non-human primate to guide arm movements to a visual target by correlating stimulation with visual feedback.  After training with correlated electrical stimulation, monkeys could direct arm movements using only electrical stimulation with no visual feedback.  Moreover, Dr. Sabes showed that monkeys could combine both electrical stimulation and visual feedback in a statistically optimal fashion to guide arm movements more effectively than with visual feedback only.\n\nMark Churchland from Columbia University examined population responses in primary motor cortex to determine a neuronal signature of movement initiation.  Within the multi-dimensional neural state space, he found a large component of population activity that emerged at movement initiation that was common for all movement types to different directions and distances.  This untuned response resided in a subspace orthogonal to the oscillatory subspace that exhibited distinct neural trajectories for different movement types.  These results suggest that this untuned component may reflect inputs to motor cortex for triggering movement initiation.\n\nFinally, E.J. Chichilnisky from Stanford University used multi-electrode recordings of primate retinal ganglion populations together with high-resolution visual stimulation to infer the functional connections between individual cones within the photoreceptor layer, the intermediate bipolar cells, and the ganglion cells of the retina.  By stimulating individual cones while recording from ganglion cells, he has begun to characterize the linear and non-linear computations that occur from the photoreceptor to the output layers of the retina.\n\nGoals and Achievements\n\nThere were three primary goals for AREADNE 2014, all of which were met. The first, to provide a compelling forum for discussing cutting-edge results from the field of neural ensembles, was achieved as can be seen in both the high-profile list of speakers and the sustained attendance with the final session audience at 95 percent of the first session.\n\nThe second, to enable the development of lasting professional relationships, was fulfilled by the daily schedule that allowed a large fraction of time for one-on-one interaction that supported the numerous, lengthy luncheon discussions, nearly countless discussions during breaks, and the well-attended poster sessions that lasted late into the night each\ntime.\n\nThe third, to create a world-class scientific venue that offers US researchers exposure to their European and Eastern Mediterranean peers, is supported by the demographics presented above, the many personal comments the organizers received, and the overwhelmingly positive responses on the feedback forms.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe conference program book has been made available for free download as a PDF document from the AREADNE Conferences web site http://areadne.org.  In the 12 months prior to 31 July 2015, 4100 copies of program books were downloaded from all conference years combined.\n\nSpeak..."
