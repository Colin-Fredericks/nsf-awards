 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Brian Northrop of Wesleyan University is investigating how to direct chemical reactions to form specific linkages between molecules and form polymers. Polymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  These insights will provide more efficient methods for making a variety of materials and for creating new types of materials with novel properties. The results of this research are expected to impact applications such as the development of materials for the targeted delivery of drugs, new consumer care products, and new plastic materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this project Brian Northrop is investigating the fundamental reactivity of thiols with alkenes and alkynes. The research objectives include first principles computational modeling of thiol-ene and thiol-yne reaction mechanisms, small molecule model studies for synthetic testing of selective thiol-ene and thiol-yne reaction conditions, and implementation of these new methods in the synthesis of organic macromaterials. The project integrates these research goals with outreach programs that include hands-on workshops in polymer science for elementary school students and the development of an interdisciplinary program in materials chemistry that will increase the participation and retention of undergraduate students in the sciences. While both thiol-ene and thiol-yne reactions have found broad utility across multiple areas of polymer and materials chemistry there are, at present, few known methods for carrying out selective thiol-ene and thiol-yne reactions, which this research project addresses.  This research should enable the development of more efficient means to prepare complex, multifunctional materials with selectively tunable properties.",

Thiols are sulfur-containing molecules and alkenes are molecules with an &ldquo;unsaturated&rdquo; carbon-carbon bond capable of forming new covalent bonds with other atoms or molecules. A variety of thiols can be induced to react with an even wider variety of alkenes along what are known, broadly, as &ldquo;thiol-ene&rdquo; reactions. Such reactions have been known for a long time; related reactions between sulfur and alkenes date as far back as the vulcanization of rubber in the mid-1800s. More recently, interest in thiol-ene reactions has grown substantially as they have found applications that span multiple areas of chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science including high refractive index materials, dental resins, lithography, hydrogels, polymer synthesis, and drug delivery. Much of the utility of thiol-ene reactions stems from their reliability, high yields, and the variety of ways of initiating or catalyzing the reactions. Methods for promoting thiol-ene reactions include using heat, light, adjusting the pH, or adding catalytic amounts of initiators known as nucleophiles. Despite all their valuable attributes, few methods had been known for carrying out specific thiol-ene reactions selectively from within mixtures containing multiple thiol and/or alkene components.

With this multi-pronged approach we elucidated the fundamental details of the reaction mechanism for the most rapid class of thiol-Michael reactions: thiol additions to maleimides. With this deeper understanding of thiol-Michael reaction mechanisms we expanded our analysis to a range of different alkenes, ultimately discovering multiple ternary (three component), quaternary (four component), and ultimately senary (six component) sequential or &ldquo;one-pot&rdquo; selective thiol-Michael reactions.
