 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this WIDER Program planning project a team of faculty and administrators at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (AAMU) is establishing professional development opportunities in the use of evidence-based instructional practices in STEM courses for both faculty and students.  Recognizing that it is essential to implement effective pedagogy in gateway courses (where most attrition occurs), the project team is focusing on collecting baseline data about the extent to which evidence-based practices are currently being used in these courses and training faculty members to incorporate classroom and laboratory activities that require active student engagement, conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and problem-solving into the first two years of the curriculum.  Moreover, eight STEM faculty \"catalysts,\" including the four PIs, are designing courses in which evidence-based practices are central to student leaning.  Model students are being trained to lead Supplementary Instruction (SI) courses using evidence-based peer-to-peer learning strategies.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is twofold.  First, data generated through assessment and evaluation is expected to support the theoretical rationale that systematic change in STEM education must include a wide spectrum of stakeholders (administrators, faculty, staff, and students).  Formative evaluation will examine the fidelity of implementation of evidence-based practices and the quality of the projects major components.  Summative evaluation will focus on determining the overall diffusion of evidence-based practices throughout the STEM fields.  Secondly, dissemination of the results of this work is expected to provide a model for institutional implementation of evidence-based practices at colleges or universities of similar size and/or student body demographics (AAMU is a Historically Black University).  Several deliverables are being developed over the course of this project including (a) new gateway course materials (classroom and laboratory), (b) SI-leader training materials, and (c) evaluation and assessment materials for faculty and SI leaders.",
