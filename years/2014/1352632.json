 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly every movement we make is a decision under risk. People making economic or movement decisions seek to maximize rewards and minimize costs. However, instead of monetary costs, one of the predominant costs in movement is effort: the metabolic energy required to perform a movement. Surprisingly, there is no good representation of the subjective value that the brain assigns effort or how this valuation may vary across individuals, populations, or environments. In this project, the Principal Investigator will use a neuroeconomic decision making framework to quantify the subjective value of effort and gain fundamental knowledge about the role of effort valuation in movement decision making. Young adults will perform movement tasks requiring significantly different amounts of effort. During these tasks, metabolic cost (objective effort cost) will be measured. They will then make choices between risky effort and monetary lotteries, and perform a movement task that involves a tradeoff between effort costs and monetary costs. Findings will determine whether subjective valuation of effort provides a mechanistic explanation for changes in movement decision making and whether subjective valuation of effort exhibits similarities with the well-documented subjective valuation of monetary outcomes.\r\n\r\n In terms of broader impacts, this work can inform studies on the generalization of subjective valuation across motor and non-motor commodities, and how subjective valuation changes across the lifespan. The proposed studies will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in the areas of sensorimotor control, rehabilitation, and decision making and inspire future studies that leverage effort valuation to modulate movement in lieu of error and incentivize better motor and non-motor decisions. Findings will direct future research on the design of rehabilitation therapies and exercise incentive programs that optimize movements and improve decision-making in motor and non-motor domains. Broadening of participation will be achieved by working to introduce K-12 students at underrepresented schools to basic science and technology concepts related to movement decision making.",
