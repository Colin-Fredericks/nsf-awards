 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Illinois Urbana Champaign and Harvard University are awarded grants to develop software tools for scientific data digitization, sharing, integration and use. The considerable challenge to digitizing natural science collections in the U.S. (and globally) necessitate a focus on both digitization efficiencies and the utility of the generated data. This grant will develop a novel, extensible, open source toolkit (Kurator) for automated and semi-automated workflows with diverse curation services to aid biodiversity research and beyond. This project will enhance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training and learning. A postdoctoral fellow will be trained in provenance enhanced workflow technology and contribute to Kurator design and implementation. Principles of data management curation with a focus on provenance will be taught in undergraduate and graduate courses. This project will also enhance infrastructure for research and education through collaborations with iDigBio and the Encyclopedia of Life. Educational modules and outreach activities on data quality and data curation will be developed for undergraduates and high school educators. Several Thematic Collection Networks will provide data via iDigBio for testing to insure dissemination of high quality data. Critical community authority files that do not have associated web services will be made available to the greater community as Kurator actors and services. \r\n\r\nKurator will consist of a user friendly web interface for users to configure and launch workflows while maintaining provenance, and a workflow platform for rapid development of new curation services and workflow variants. The latter will also be used to \"wrap\" valuable domain authority files that are not currently available as services. New \"curator-in-the-loop\" workflow technology allows us to directly involve experts in semi automatic curation pipelines, using human interaction actors via FilteredPush, other syndication methods, and discovery environments. Kurator will allow examination of data lineages to facilitate the assessment of credibility, supports repeatability in publication, informs legal proceedings where data are regulated, and provides context for feedback to a given resource. Kurator will facilitate digitization efforts through custom processing of raw data obtained from hardcopy specimen labels against existing services, including taxonomic name resolution, georeferencing, and duplicate specimen detection, as well as newly created customizable actors for appropriate controlled vocabularies to clean the data. Where required, semi-automated services can invoke expert review using annotation services and existing discovery environments. Curation pipelines can be integrated with other workflows for analysis of ecological, evolutionary, phenological, genomic and related data, can be shared or repurposed easily, and can be made accessible for publication.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nBiodiversity Informatics is the application of informatics techniques to biodiversity information for improved management, presentation, discovery, exploration, and analysis, according to Wikipedia.  In order to derive knowledge of changes in biodiversity over space and time, it is critical to first assess the quality of data, i.e., determine in what ways data are (or are not) fit for particular research uses.  Through this award, the project teams built Kurator, a suite of software tools for evaluating and enhancing the quality of biodiversity data.\nData curation is a critical step in scientific data digitization, sharing, integration and use. The considerable financial investment made to support digitization of natural science collections, both in the U.S. and globally, requires maximizing digitization efficiency and the quality and utility of the generated data.  A powerful way to simultaneously address both issues is to employ computerized workflow technology that can automate and streamline data-curation processes.  \nKurator is an open-source computer platform for creating, executing, sharing and deploying web-enabled data-curation \"pipelines.\"  A key function of Kurator is to enable the assessment of fitness-for-use of natural science collections data by museum staff, research scientists, policymakers, educators and students.  To this end, the Kurator team worked closely with other biodiversity informatics specialists as well as with representatives of our targeted user communities.  Among such efforts, we contributed to an initiative led by the organization TDWG Biodiversity Information Standards to define standard measures of biodiversity information quality, and we worked closely with curators of biodiversity data to refine the user interfaces of the Kurator software and the data-quality reports that it produces.\n We refactored, and made more generally useful, software and methods for presenting biodiversity specimen data according to controlled vocabularies and for identifying data inconsistencies.  Two specific examples are checking that names of states and counties in datasets are spelled correctly, and flagging data records that contain localities with combinations of country, state and county that do not exist.  Working with curators of biodiversity data, we configured Kurator to produce data quality reports that help curators evaluate and, where necessary, improve the quality of their databases of record.  Such reports allow both researchers and curators to assess the fitness-for-use of their biodiversity data by presenting proposed changes, remaining problems and expectations about proposed actions.  These tools have proven to be so effective and useful that an instance of the Kurator web application, designed to make the data quality control \"toolkit\" accessible to anyone involved in data curation and digitization efforts at natural science collections, is deployed and available through iDigBio, the NSF-supported national digitization hub (www.idigbio.org).\n\nA postdoctoral fellow contributed to Kurator's design and implementation and in so doing received training in provenance-enhanced workflow and digital-notebook technologies.  A Brazilian doctoral student in computer science worked closely with the Kurator team to develop a formal model of data quality in biodiversity.  An undergraduate computer science major worked as a software developer in the project. Principles of data management and curation with a focus on data provenance were included in undergraduate and graduate education by lead PI Bertram Ludaescher at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana; Harvard PI Hanken included presentations about museum specimen digitization, data quality and database management in a graduate course taught in Cambridge.  Educational modules and outreach activities on data quality and data curation designed for college undergraduates and high school educators teachers were developed through collaborations with both iDigBio (www.idigbio.org) and the Encyclopedia of Life's Learning and Education group (http://education.eol.org/). Kurator and associated resources are freely available to the greater natural science collections community for use in managing their databases and related digitization efforts.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bertram Ludaescher"
