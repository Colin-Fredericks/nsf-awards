 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Iron pyrite is one of the most abundant minerals on the planet. Iron pyrite also has some key physical properties well suited to optoelectronics and energy storage applications. But numerous measurements indicate that the electronic transport and optical properties of bulk and nanocrystalline iron pyrite limit effective device development. The fundamental causes of these limitations remain mired in uncertainty, but recent work does suggest that defect structure and chemistry on the surfaces and interfaces of iron pyrite are of primary importance. This research project is a synergistic experimental and theoretical effort designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of iron pyrite and its surface physics and chemistry. In conjunction with this research activity, a collaborative K-6 outreach effort is planned to increase awareness of materials science, and to instill an interest in scientific methods in the younger generation. A series of hands-on materials science modules will be developed and disseminated in coordination with K-6 curricula at local schools in order to further their science programs for years to come.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: Recent observations of unusual optoelectronic phenomena in iron pyrite nanocube colloids directly link its unique {100} surface defect structure to the surrounding chemical environment. The experimental component of this research project aims to validate the surface interaction model through interface characterization and directed chemical modification of colloidal, thin film and single crystal samples. High-resolution, surface-sensitive spectroscopy, in conjunction with magnetic and electronic measurements that span a broad range of temperatures, are applied to iron pyrite's intrinsic and engineered surface structure to build a comprehensive structure/property relationship. A parallel theoretical effort systematically examines the nature of the excited states for iron pyrite's bulk and surfaces using some of the most detailed electronic structure calculations that can be done. For these purposes, the GW method, Bethe-Salpeter and time-dependent density functional theory relate optical and transport properties to their microscopic origins. In particular, the manifestations of electron-phonon couplings are systematically examined and compared to experimental observations.",

The materials are non-toxic, inexpensive, and earth-abundant. Successful application of these materials has proven challenging due to the high reactivity of both iron and sulfur, which ultimately makes their controlled processing into useful compounds challenging.  As such, the performance of iron sulfide compounds in various applications is limited to the quality of the underlying material structure, and this is intimately related to the chosen preparation method and targeted material morphology.  In the end, the resulting defect structure in the final product dictates behavior and material viability.  Therefore, to facilitate the future viability of compounds from this material systems, we have designed and undertaken a number of experimental and computational studies over the course of this project to better understand the highly complex structure-property relationships in iron sulfur compounds.\n\n \n\nProject Outcomes Both the monosulfide (FeS) and disulfide (iron pyrite, FeS2) compounds are technologically important, but exhibit complex defect structure and non-stoichiometry that inhibits material performance.
