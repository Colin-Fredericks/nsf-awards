 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some biodiversity lineages are of special conservation concern because of specific life history characteristics.  These 'short-range endemic' taxa are often small-bodied, habitat-specialized, and dispersal-limited which leads to naturally small geographic distributions which can be highly impacted by small environmental changes. This study focuses on a group of harvestman spiders, which are short-range endemics, to develop a phylogenetic and taxonomic understanding to better facilitate conservation. The investigators will use genomic and morphological data to investigate the nature of species boundaries, reconstruct species relationships, and describe new species. Species descriptions will be made available to the scientific community using digital taxonomic tools, and organismal information will be transferred more broadly via web-based resources. \r\n\r\nThis project has broader societal and scientific significance in many ways. The investigators will train a postdoctoral researcher, a doctoral student, and at least one undergraduate student recruited from under-represented groups at San Diego State University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Trainees will work with the PI and two of the most prominent harvestmen researchers in the world. This training represents a tremendous opportunity to transfer taxonomic knowledge across generations. The PI will develop a one-week \"Harvestmen Biology & Identification\" field course, to be offered in the southern Appalachians, helping to directly engage students in modern systematics research and conservation issues.",

We published a paper that details the methodology, recovery of UCEs for all arachnid orders, and phylogenetic informativeness at multiple hierarchical levels. The class Arachnida includes many taxa of medical and applied interest (e.g., spiders, ticks, etc.) - the continued development of this probe set (publically available at Arbor Biosciences) has the potential to transform arachnid phylogenetics at multiple taxonomic levels. We explored the utility of multispecies coalescent delimitation analyses (a way to understand what species are) in dispersal-limited taxa. Several recent empirical and theoretical studies suggest that the multispecies coalescent model may over-split taxa with high natural population structure. We pursued this possibility in multiple genera with genomic-scale data. We conducted generic-level taxonomic research on many taxa, involving original fieldwork in Appalachia, the western United States, and Japan, and revised the higher-level classification for a large group of harvestmen (Travuniodea).</p>\n<p>Our research activities provided support and training for a postdoctoral reseacher (both genomics and teaching training), a hearing-impaired PhD student (now at Harvard University), a first-generation Hispanic MS student (now at UC Berkeley), and a first-generation Hispanic undergraduate student (now at UC Riverside). We developed a harvestmen website (naharvestmen.com), and contributed heavily to another online resource (the Opiliones BUGGUIDE page). On BUGGUIDE, a full taxonomy for North American harvestmen was established, images from NSF-supported research were uploaded, links to all taxonomic literature are available, and biological information has been added. As of January 2018, publication of ten journal articles were supported by this award, all of which include graduate student co-authors, and half of which include postdoctoral researcher co-authors. All published manuscripts have been published as open access, and all published genetic data is available on GenBank. Multiple 1000s of specimens were collected and vouchered as part of the San Diego State University Terrestrial Arthropod Collection. Most specimen data are available online at the Symbiota Collections Arthropod Network (SCAN), almost all with high-quality geoference data, and some with specimen images. A full taxonomy for North American Opiliones has also been uploaded to SCAN.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marshal&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hedin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529383156_18164532114_c18f96c590_z--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529383156_18164532114_c18f96c590_z--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Speleonychia cave harvestmen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529383156_18164532114_c18f96c590_z--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Speleonychia cave harvestmen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An arachnid known only from lava tubes in southern Washington state</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marshal Hedin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marshal&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hedin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Speleonychia cave harvestmen</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529314890_25939504570_8d707fe70c_z--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529314890_25939504570_8d707fe70c_z--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zuma tioga harvestmen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529314890_25939504570_8d707fe70c_z--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zuma tioga harvestmen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A harvestmen species known only from the mountains of California.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marshal Hedin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marshal&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hedin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Zuma tioga harvestmen</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529484920_14972624836_8814c711fb_z--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529484920_14972624836_8814c711fb_z--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Briggsus harvestmen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354558/1354558_10293194_1517529484920_14972624836_8814c711fb_z--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Briggsus harvestmen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A harvestmen form the forests of western Oregon.
