 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boise State University (BSU), in cooperation with local high schools and the Idaho Technology Council (a state-wide organization of industry, research, educators, investors, and government), proposes to develop and implement a comprehensive program -- IDoCode -- that will provide high quality CS preparation for high school teachers. Its primary goal is to significantly increase the number of teachers prepared to teach CS in the state of Idaho, and its secondary goal is to increase the number of Idaho high school graduates that are motivated to pursue a CS degree and career. The project leverages two existing degree programs at Boise State: the IDoTeach program (a UTeach replication program designed to increase the number of secondary math and science teachers in the state of Idaho and its surrounding region) for preservice teachers, and the Master of Science in STEM Education for in-service teachers. IDoTeach will prepare teachers to teach the AP CS Principles curriculum, creating CS pathways in both programs. The resulting CS prepared teachers will be further supported through face-to-face workshops, mentoring programs, support from industry, professionals, and online resources. BSU along with local industry partners will work to recruit inservice teachers and high school students (potential preservice teachers) to the programs. The project will create a blueprint for states such as Idaho to provide high quality CS preparation high school teachers.",

The effort to bring lasting educational change required the IDoCode team to coordinate efforts with School Districts, Teachers, State Board of Education, Legislature, Industry, Parents, and Students.\n\nThe goal to bring computer science to all requires educational professionals take proactive steps to ensure wider student participation.  The chosen curriculum needs to be engaging to all students.  Student graduation standards that allow computer science to count towards graduation requirements is crucial to attract wider student population.  Providing school counselors, teachers, and administration with information to encourage all students to explore computer science educational skills - no matter the student?s future career plan!
