 "awd_abstract_narration": "International Nongovernmental Organizations' (INGO) focus advocacy efforts on some issues and not others, and the extent of harm does not explain this variation.  INGOs mobilize around some issues of moral concern, but neglect others with similar objective characteristics. The project will test potential explanations of variation in attention to issues via a mixed methods research design that explores INGO advocacy effort in the two issue areas of global health and armed conflicts, both matters of great public import. INGOS' choice of problems and strategies is important to understand because INGOs have long been recognized as potent drivers of international normative change.  Through their practices they have made critical contributions to compliance with international legal standards, particularly significant given the difficulty in enforcing international norms. This project develops a theory of INGO advocacy choices that emphasizes the constraints and strategic considerations affecting their behavior. The project hypothesizes that institutional survival motives incentivize INGOs to respond to the preferences of their donor constituency, as well as to the expected likelihood of their demands? realization. In addition, the theory underlines the importance of micro level dynamics.   INGOs' agendas evolve in a path dependent way, where previous choices constrain and enable current agenda. Next, this project hypothesizes that issues gain organizational support because organizations are more likely to do what other organizations do.  \r\n\r\nTo analyze the activism of INGOs, reasons for their issue choice, and path dependence, this project constructs the first quantitative database allowing for the statistical analysis of issue-specific INGO activism. The database will be useful for those who wish to understand how INGOs choose issues, an important question for many policymakers.",

We have seen significant activism efforts around tuberculosis, but not pneumonia; the Gujarat earthquake of 2005, but not the Kashmiri one; the Darfur conflict, but not the Eritrean-Ethiopian war. To address these puzzling patterns, this dissertation developed a theory of INGO activism as a good produced in a stylized moral economy characterized by the preferences of INGOs&rsquo; donor constituencies and the technologies available to INGOs. I examine two accounts of donors&rsquo; activism preferences: the first, which I call the cosmopolitan concern position, predicts that the causes most likely to be championed by international activists are those implicating the bodily harm or legal equality of vulnerable or innocent populations. I argue that this view, although well established, generates a series of anomalies, and therefore propose a modified account of the demand pressures facing INGOs. Drawing on recent work by moral psychologists, I propose we should expect donors to be partial to the wellbeing of those similar or familiar to themselves, and as such argue for the social proximity view of demand for activism as an important influence on INGOs&rsquo; issue selections. In addition, I expect INGOs&rsquo; issue choices to be influenced by demand-driven compassion fatigue, leading INGOs to prioritize novel crises and concerns over long-term problems.
