 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two day workshop will bring together an international group of scholars from several disciplines -- communication, engineering, management, and sociology, as well as a smaller number of senior, highly experienced, organizational change leaders.  The workshop will examine the central question of how to lead change successfully in the future so that change success rates consistently exceed the widely cited 30-50% range, when compared to objectives set by organizations prior to change. Both global organizational surveys, as well as academic studies, find that organizational change often yields a variety of negative results affecting many segments of society including: budget over-runs conservatively estimated at 134% of the original plan; greatly diminished staff resources that include high stress levels, demanding workloads, and negative emotional reactions; and loss of valuable time with little to no organizational gain in competitiveness, goal achievement or business value.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the workshop are to identify, examine, research, discuss, and begin to achieve consensus on:\r\n1)\tThe contextual factors, operating at multiple levels, and affecting the success rates of organizational change, both episodic and continuous;\r\n2)\tDifferent roles played by change leadership in initiating, facilitating, implementing, and/or sustaining change\r\n3)\tDifferent methods, processes, and styles of leadership making change success likely;\r\n4)\tThe multi-level effects within organizational change and the processes through which these effects impact the success of leading organizational change.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  This workshop comes at a critical point in research on organizational change. On one hand, a major type of change, episodic change, is described as infrequent, discontinuous, intentional and led from the top down in terms of the organizational hierarchy.  Although this change is occurring more and more frequently, many senior change leaders report serious deficits in their organizations' knowledge and capabilities to enact change successfully.  On the other hand, a second major type of change, continuous change, is believed by many change scholars to possess high potential for improving the quality, innovation and success rate of organizational change. Continuous change is characterized as ongoing, evolving, cumulative, emergent rather than planned, and generally enacted from the bottom up.  Yet to date, there is limited conceptual research on continuous change and virtually no empirical studies to strengthen our understanding of how it develops, the current success rates, and the types of change leadership that are likely to be more or less successful in shaping such change. Thus, this workshop provides a valuable opportunity to enhance and extend our knowledge about factors affecting the success of leading organizational change, both episodic and continuous, and to decrease the negative effects of change that affect many aspects of society. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This workshop includes expert participants of different academic disciplines, business functional areas, genders, nationalities, and industries. We expect the research and ideas discussed at the workshop to be presented and published in a variety of outlets and media, making them generally available to academic scholars, senior leaders, doctoral students, change managers, professional associations and the public at large. As a result, the workshop will not only advance research but also inform practice about leading organizational change successfully.",

Organizational Change: \n\n1) Bartunek &amp; Woodman:  Beyond Lewin: Towards a Temporal Approximation of Organization Development and Change.  Paper develops a more adequate temporal model of change by incorporating attention to sequence, timing, pacing rhythm and polyphonic dimensions.  Show that a number of dimensions of change that are \"masked by Lewin\u00c6s Model\n\n1.2  Recommended Activities to Further Develop Papers\n\n1) Bartunek &amp; Woodman:  \"Beyond Lewin: Towards a Temporal Approximation of Organization Development and Change\".\n\na. Develop temporal constructs and their relationships with each other more fully in order to develop the effects of change and proposed outcomes\n\nb. Conduct empirical research on change to develop strong measures of the five temporal dimensions\n\nc. Recognize how power and influence may be present in temporal patterns and may be overlooked if solely examining interactions among people\n\nd. Develop greater depth of information when exploring temporal dimensions to enhance their criticality for change\n\n2) Sonenshein &amp; Huy:  \"Toward a Theory of Managing Strategic Change\".  Tentative prescriptive model of managing strategic change as a process of conducting and learning from iterative experiments guided by top managers and energized by middle managers.  Cognitive and affective processes are included to facilitate design and learning from experiments and to deal with tensions arising from dealing with paradoxes and the unknown\n\n1.2\n\na)    Minimize the criticality of clear strategic vision, recognizing that it emerges through iterative experiments.\n\nb)    Maintain a regular (not irregular) rhythm of change in order to deal with fast changing uncertain environments\n\n      3) Schaubroeck:  \"Leadership Influence on Changes in Core          Organizational Value Identification and Role Self-Efficiency\". Drawing attention to, appealing to or deepening specific values is generally critical for: organizations or units  undergoing change and requiring new behavioral      orientations; organizational entry and socialization.  Leaders'  ability to change or deepen values appears possible in certain contexts.\n\n1.2 a) Scholars should clarify what is meant by \"Value promotion: Appealing to existing values; , identification with values\n\n         4) Chen  &amp; Cole:  \"Planting the Change Idea into Your   Employees\u00c6 or Your Boss\u00c6 Mind:  A Theoretical Model of  Organizational Change Through Inception\".  Inception is the  active yet covert manipulation of environmental or          communicative cues to induce the target to take actions that accord with the desires of the communicator.  It is a one-way, high-context communication.  Paper builds a multi- level theory about the conditions conducive to using      inception and the potential consequences of successful and failed inception attempts in organizational change.  It bridges scattered literatures in communication, organizational   change, voice,  (conceptual paper).\n\n5) Zhang: \"Leading Organizational Change from a Multilevel Perspective\".   Success profiles vary dramatically from entry-level management to executive management.  The  supervision level: captures  Decisive (task-orientation leadership) &amp; Hierarchic (expert leadership), while the Executive level:captures  Flexible (social leadership) &amp; Integrative (participative leadership). Manager\u00c6s styles and skills become increasingly critical to success while task-related competencies become less important.These styles appear to be the same across different regions, yielding a universal pattern may exist. The liabilities of strong leaders include  maintaining cooperative relationships, developing subordinates abilities; and inhibiting followers\u00c6 voice.\n\n1.2:\n\na)    Leaders should take three roles in accommodating changes; change driver, system builder and culture transformer.\n\nb)    Successful organizational changes can only be accomplis..."
