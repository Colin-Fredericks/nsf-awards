 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational simulations have become an indispensible tool in a wide variety of science and engineering investigations.  Quick and effective assessments of the resulting data are necessary for efficient use of researcher time and computation resources, but this process is complicated when a large collaborating team is geographically dispersed and/or some team members do not have direct access to the computation resource and output data.  Current methods for sharing and assessing transient data and preliminary results are cumbersome and labor intensive; each research team must create their own scripts and ad hoc procedures to push data from system to system and user to user.  Better tools and cyberinfrastructure are needed to support preliminary results sharing for collaborating computational science teams. \r\n\r\nThis project develops web-based building blocks and cyberinfrastructure to enable easy sharing and streaming of transient data and preliminary results from computing resources to a variety of platforms, from mobile devices to workstations, making it possible to quickly and conveniently view and assess results and provide an essential missing component in High Performance Computing and cloud computing infrastructure.",
