 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding for participation in a small field project making use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for atmospheric observations.  UASs are attractive platforms for atmospheric scientists due to their ability to fly into regions where other observation systems can?t, such as under the base of a supercell thunderstorm.  This award will allow researchers the opportunity to compare four different small UASs and their instrument payloads.  This work has broader impact through the development and testing of new technologies which will help to improve the understanding of atmospheric processes and the capability to forecast weather and climate.\r\n\r\nThe project will take place at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) in Colorado.  The four UASs will be flown near the instrumented BAO tower and also in the range of the Colorado State University CHILL radar and the Texas Tech University Ka-band mobile radar.  This will allow the researchers the opportunity to compare the UASs against proven, ground-based measurements.  The second step will be to fly all four of the UASs on a target of interest, such as a cloud or a thunderstorm.  The data will be used to refine the current systems and as a benchmark for the development of future systems.",

A field campaign was conducted to evaluate several small unmanned aircraft systems(sUAS) for making measurements pertinent to current meteorological applications. Two sUAS, in the ~5-kg, 3-m wingspan class were flown with integrated mutli-hole probes for wind velocity measurement and pressure, temperature, humidity (PTH) sensors. Two sUAS in the ~1-kg, 0.5-m wingspan class were also flown with simpler wind measurement systems and PTH sensors. FAA Certificates of Authorization (COAs), that allow for simultaneous, multiple-UAS operations were obtained to fly these sUAS at the 300-m instrumented meteorological tower at the NOAA Boulder Atmospheric Observatory in Erie, CO and over a 32 km x 32 km area of the Pawnee National Grasslands (PNG) near Ault, CO. The field campaign at PNG successfully targeted the morning planetary boundary layer transition and a thunderstorm gust front. Key outcomes of the project included i.) the first time multiple (3) UAS were flown simultaneously to make coordinated measurements of a thunderstorm outflow and ii.) simultaneous operation of 4 small UAS to sample the planetary boundary layer transition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/12/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eric&nbsp;W&nbsp;Frew</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447355575754_145--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447355575754_145--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Skywalker UAS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447355575754_145--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Skywalker UAS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Skywalker UAS is being launched.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RECUV</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;W&nbsp;Frew</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Skywalker UAS</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447355775890_IMAG0910--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447355775890_IMAG0910--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ground Station and Radar\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447355775890_IMAG0910--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ground Station and Radar\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The RECUV Mobile Ground Station and the Texas Tech Ka-band Doppler radar deployed to sample a thunderstorm gust front.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RECUV</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;W&nbsp;Frew</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ground Station and Radar</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447356188969_skywalker_bao--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447356188969_skywalker_bao--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Skywalker BAO\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1451258/1451258_10320073_1447356188969_skywalker_bao--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Skywalker BAO\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Skywalker UAS flying at the BAO tower in ...",
