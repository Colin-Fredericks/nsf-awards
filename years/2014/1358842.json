 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) site led by Professors Greg M. Swain and Robert L. LaDuca both at Michigan State University. In this project, students are learning how sustainable practices impact all fields of chemistry and how these practices cut across different disciplines of science and engineering. The research experience will provide them with the skills needed to carry out chemical research or chemical processes in an environmentally-conscientious manner. The overall objectives of the project are therefore, (i) to involve undergraduate students in graduate-level research in sustainable chemistry, (ii) to provide a positive mentoring experience for undergraduates, (iii) to better prepare undergraduate students for graduate school, (iv) to motivate undergraduate students to consider pursuing an academic career, and (v) to recruit undergraduate students for graduate school at MSU. Student interns will also participate in outreach activities that will provide high school and middle school students with educational benefits and the interns with valuable experience in communicating scientific information and mentoring. The impact will be even broader when interns communicate their positive experience with others at their own institutions. The activities will teach the student interns, who will be part of the next generation workforce, how chemical research is conducted in a sustainable and responsible manner.\r\n\r\nParticipating student interns will receive 10 weeks of hands-on, interdisciplinary research experience in sustainable chemistry and chemical processes. Student interns will be engaged in research involving green synthesis, water purification and quality monitoring, renewable energy-related materials, and advanced imaging and spectroscopy. Students will also benefit from weekly journal clubs, mentoring faculty research presentations and networking dinners, and from participation in teaching modules on research ethics, statistics, laboratory and chemical safety, strategies for applying to graduate school, and professional development. All of the program activities are designed to sharpen the student?s critical and scientific thinking skills, provide them with experience in all aspects of research from experimental design through performance and analysis, and help to make them knowledgeable about sustainable chemistry and chemical processes.",

The program provided undergraduate students, having limited access to STEM research opportunities, with training that will give them a competitive advantage as a graduate school applicant or a next-generation worker by offering: (i) intense research activities that broaden their technical and communication skills, (ii) professional development and teamwork activities, (iii) seminars and webinars that introduce students to a range of &ldquo;green&rdquo; research fields across chemistry, and (iv) informal gatherings for student and faculty exchange and networking. Knowledge and practices gained from the REU site&rsquo;s interdisciplinary research portfolio gave the student trainees the tools needed to understand, promote and implement sustainable chemistry and chemical processes. Future scientists trained to be environmentally-conscientious will benefit all of society. The REU site helped to prepare the students for graduate work in STEM disciplines. The importance of environmental stewardship was conveyed from the student trainees to the broader community at large via research presentations, networking and&nbsp; outreach activities. Students developed improved critical thinking and communication skills, and learned how to productively interact with colleagues in a laboratory setting. The professional development activities gave the trainees, individuals who will become members of the future scientific workforce, more confidence and make them more competitive for graduate school or employment. The REU participants experienced graduate-level research and training at a formative point in their careers, enhancing their desire to enter graduate school and ultimately become professional scientists. Finally, the student trainees experienced the benefit of positive mentoring, understand the importance of proper mentoring and learn ways that they can serve as mentors. The exposure to green chemistry and chemical processes provided the students with new ideas and tools that will ultimately lead them to pursue chemical processes and products that cost less, and are healthier and more sustainable. Overall, the program did an excellent job of training students to conduct independent research and preparing them for graduate work in STEM disciplines as evidenced by the following metrics: (i) 33 student trainees overall with 25 of these funded by NSF; (ii) 5 prior trainees in the Chemistry Ph.D. and 1 trainee in the Forestry Ph.D. programs at MSU; (iii) 10 prior trainees either in Chemistry graduate programs at other universities, completed or are pursuing M.S. degrees, or are actively applying to graduate programs; (iv) 4 prior trainees in Medical School or actively applying to professional schools. In summary, 20 of the 33 prior total trainees have completed, are in, or are actively applying to graduate or professional programs. Considering only the NSF-funded trainees, the following student cohorts were achieved: 2015 (62% M 38% F, 37% white 63% non-white); 2016 (60% M 40% F, 50% white 50% non-white); and 2017 (50% M 50% F; 50% white 50% non-white).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/21/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Greg&nbsp;M&nbsp;Swain</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
