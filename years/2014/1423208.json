 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to continue Dakota State University (DSU) participation in the CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to prepare highly-qualified Cybersecurity professionals for entry into the government workforce. DSU is one of the 13 Centers of Academic Excellence in Cyber Operations as designated by the National Security Agency (NSA) and graduates students in the most technical areas of Cybersecurity in their accelerated program where a bachelors and masters degree is earned in a total of five years. This project will enroll three cohort groups of 10 students each and will support them for the last three years before graduation. Almost half of students' activities are hands-on technical exercises in offensive security practices in hardware, operating systems, networks, databases, and software. All DSU CyberCorps\u00ae SFS members will take part in innovative mechanisms of community building such as the Cybersecurity Computer Club and taking part in the North Central Region on the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) as a team member or administrator of the competition. The NSF's CyberCorps\u00ae SFS program funds projects that address Cybersecurity education and workforce development. The Scholarship Track provides funding to award scholarships to students in Cybersecurity. In return for their scholarships, recipients will work after graduation for a Federal, State, Local, or Tribal Government organization in a position related to Cybersecurity for a period equal to the length of the scholarship. The Capacity Track seeks innovative proposals leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce Cybersecurity professionals.\r\n\r\nTo date, DSU has supported a total of 29 CyberCorps\u00ae SFS students and formed strong partnerships with both federal and state agencies, including the NSA, Navy SPAWAR, and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. The applicable undergraduate degrees at DSU have 452 students in target majors, which are made up of 200 students in Cyber Operations, 80 students in Network & Security Administration, and 182 students in Computer Science. These three majors account for over 40% of the total on-campus student population. The graduates of DSU CyberCorps\u00ae SFS will be well versed in security policy, infrastructure operations, and defensive programming and exhibit strong oral and written communication skills.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis 5-year grant awarded fifty-five (55) NSF CyberCorps scholarships to high-achieving students at Dakota State University. Since the program inception in 2011, the DSU CyberCorps Scholarship Program has funded eigthy-seven (87) such scholars and achieved 100% placement rates for employment in local, state, tribal, and federal government agencies. \n\nRecruiting higher percentages of students from diverse and underrepresented populations is a focus area that Dakota State University worked towards in this award.  To overcome challenges engaging underrepresented populations DSU has put forth work in developing clubs, institutes, and partnerships as well as expanding upon resources that already exist. \n\nOne example of a resource that enhances this proposed program from prior efforts is the CybHER Institute, part of the Madison Cyber Labs on the DSU campus.  CybHER reaches a very large range of female students through outreach events.  Targeted efforts to middle school through graduate students seek to encourage women who aspire to work in the technology industry.  The number of women studying in cybersecurity programs at DSU has increased by nearly 300%.  This is beginning to create a ripple effect as more of those scholars are showing increased interest in CyberCorps opportunities. CybHER is a resource that can have significant contributions towards DSU\u2019s goals in increasing the number of underrepresented populations in the program by generating a higher percentage of female participants.\n\nSimilarly, Dakota State University is taking a more active role in building relationships with area Native American tribes.  New collaborative efforts are under way with the Tribal Nations Research Group in North Dakota, as well as tribal communities in Crow Creek, South Dakota and Wolf Point, Montana.  From a geographic standpoint, these communities become increasingly reachable as the relationships continue to develop.  \n\nThese types of inclusive outreach efforts to underrepresented populations are necessary and important.  It is an effort that has direct impacts on the larger goals of the CyberCorps scholarship program.  Other related programs that Dakota State University is actively involved with such as GenCyber also share this interest in seeking greater diversity.  As DSU is heavily involved in GenCyber, collaborative efforts are in place, working to encourage underrepresented students.  Success in any of these programs can have significate impacts in the focused recruitment efforts of the others.  The proposed CyberCorps renewal aims to continue to look for ways to ensure a diverse, committed, and quality cohort of students enter the government\u2019s cybersecurity workforce.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua J Pauli"
