 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI:AIR Technology Translation project focuses on investigating the utility of the micro-laser assisted machining (Micro-LAM) system to perform precision drilling (micro-laser assisted drilling or Micro-LAD).  Previous research has found Micro-LAM to be essential in machining materials that are very hard and extremely brittle (e.g. semiconductors and ceramics). The Micro-LAM process modifies the material, in-situ during machining, so as to render these materials easier to cut and makes it more cost effective to generate useful end products.  The Micro-LAD system aims to achieve enhanced ductility through reduced hardness and decreased brittleness from laser heating and thermal softening, which promotes a more efficient, productive and less costly manufacturing process.  This research project aims to evaluate the Micro-LAD system that capitalizes on this fundamental material behavior and determines the degree and significance of the preferential heating and resultant thermal softening of the high-pressure phases of semiconductors and ceramics during the machining process.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as the technology translates from research discovery toward commercial application: improve the productivity and decrease the cost of drilling semiconductors and ceramics by extending the Micro-LAM technology to drilling with a proof of concept and performing a market analysis.   By advancing the capability associated with drilling semiconductors and ceramics by locally rendering them more ductile and less brittle, it will become easier to machine, resulting in greater productivity and reduced cost of manufacture when compared to the current drilling process in the marketplace. This new knowledge and expertise can be assimilated into teaching and educational efforts, as well as distributed into industry.\r\n\r\nOverall, the project will produce achievement in four core areas.  First, fundamental materials science and engineering research will be advanced and showcased in a real proof of concept.  Second, the principal investigators will work with the university?s technology transfer office and industrial partners to further integrate the research results into realizable structures, initially the proposed proof of concept and eventually a prototype and commercialization or production unit. Third, a business model or plan will be developed to engage industries? interests and for market research activities associated with the proposed research. Finally, students will achieve unique education and research experiences directly related to product innovation and the process of moving fundamental research into real world commercial use.\r\n\r\nPartners at the inception of the project include both academic and industry organizations: Western Michigan University (Kalamazoo, Michigan) and Micro-LAM Technologies LLC (Battle Creek, Michigan).  This project provides hands-on training opportunities to undergraduate, graduate, and post-doc students from manufacturing and mechanical engineering programs at the university, as well as entrepreneurship and business students from across the university, related to advanced scientific, engineering and materials concepts.",
