 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the investigators will carry out comprehensive studies of the data collected during the Deep Convection, Clouds and Chemistry Experiment (DC3) conducted during May-June 2013. DC3 collected a comprehensive dataset on cloud dynamics, microphysics and chemistry in a variety of convective events, over three regions, the southeast U.S., the Southern Great Plains and over the semi-arid region of eastern Colorado. The research will address two of the overarching goals of the DC3 program; understanding the gross electrical structure of storms and why particular storms have a so-called \"inverted\" electrical polarity; and improving our understanding regarding the production of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) by lightning. The work concerning the electrical structure of storms will utilize comprehensive Doppler and polarimetric radar and lightning mapping network data obtained in DC3 and will include a small sample of storms affected by the High Park wildfire in Colorado. Under the objective to improve how lightning-generated NOx is handled in cloud-chemistry models, the research team will use Lightning Mapping Array observations of total lightning flash rates to improve flash rate parameterizations, contribute to storm scale budget studies aimed at estimating the amount of NOx produced per lightning flash, and refine assumptions regarding where the lightning-generated NOx is \"released\" into the storm. The research team will relate detailed observations of ice particle types in anvil clouds (aggregates of frozen droplets) to the adjacent deep convection. Under this award, the research team will develop a number of collaborations to enhance this research, including collaborations with scientists that are conducting cloud-chemistry simulations of several DC3 cases using the Weather Research Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to the knowledge base regarding the coupling between cloud dynamics, microphysics and electrification/lightning. The research will utilize state of the art radar and lightning mapping information in order to improve our understanding of so-called \"inverted\" charge structures where positive electrical charge resides in the storm mid-levels, opposed to the more typical structure where negatively-charged hydrometeors resides at mid-levels. Utilizing the comprehensive measurements from DC3,the research team will also address the lightning-NOx problem, that is, quantifying the amount of NOx released in a storm produced by lightning. This work will be done from the point of view of improving required parameterizations for these processes in cloud-chemistry models. Hence this work will be interdisciplinary in nature, bringing together cloud physics and atmospheric chemistry specialists. This work will also improve our understanding as to how deep convection contributes to anvil ice water contents and ice particle types. Hence this work may lead to a better understanding regarding the radiative properties of anvils attached to strong convection. \r\n\r\nDC3 observations are expected to advance our understanding regarding storm dynamics, microphysics and electrification. Knowledge of these processes will provide a basis for improving the manner by which lightning-generated NOx (LNOx) is considered in cloud-chemistry models. The role of LNOx in contributing to upper tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas, can then be improved.  In general DC3 results are expected to improve our understanding regarding the impact of deep convection on the chemical composition of the UTLS (upper troposphere-lower stratosphere). Experimental data from the DC3 project will provide important datasets for model comparison exercises and assessment reports.",

First, we addressed the physical reasons why some strong convective storms have what is defined as an inverted, or anomalous electrical structure, characterized my mid-level positive charge opposed to mid-level negative charge. Our second objective pertained to the production and subsequent transport of NOx produced by lightning in convective storms. NOx transported to the upper troposphere can serve as a source for ozone, which acts as a greenhouse gas. Finally the third objective examined the microphysical structure of anvil clouds produced by deep convection. Ice particle habits in extensive anvil clouds impact their radiative properties. By examining multiple cases from the past DC3 project, we have shown that anomalous storms result from a combination of strong updrafts and reduced warm cloud depths, both of which serve to increase supercooled water contents in the mixed phase region and therefore cause positive charge to be generated on graupel. Ice crystals that rebound from the graupel are carried upward in the cloud and lead to this inverted charge structure, the negative charge situated over positive charge. For normal polarity storms, supercooled water contents are reduced owing to weaker updrafts and increased warm rain processes. The most novel finding under Objective 2 again pertains to inverted storms. We showed that lightning channels in inverted storms are rather low in the cloud, and therefore we were under the impression that these types of storms would generate less upper tropospheric NOx (produced by lightning) compared to normal polarity storms where flash locations are higher in the troposphere. However, due to overall larger flash rates (generating more NOx) and stronger updrafts in inverted storms, there is considerably more NOx transported to the upper troposphere compared to normal polarity storms. Hence anomalous storms may have considerable impact on the production of upper tropospheric ozone, and significant greenhouse gas. The worldwide impact of such storms has yet to be determined. Under the third objective, we collaborated with NCAR and analyzed in-situ microphysical and NOx concentrations measured by the NSF HIAPER aircraft that was deployed in the DC3 field project.

Anvil edges contained small ice crystals and limited NOx while interior portions of anvil contained chains of frozen droplets and higher NOx concentrations. These &ldquo;aggregates&rdquo; of frozen droplets evidently were generated in the main updraft core of the storm as supercooled droplets froze once they passed the -40 C level, the point of homogeneous freezing.
