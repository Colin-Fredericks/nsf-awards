 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underlying goal of this research is to understand how changing global scale economic patterns affect social organization, especially in small scale developing societies. In situations where there is close proximity between \"managers\" and \"workers\" what are the interpersonal rearrangements which occur?. Archaeological research such as that described below has the potential to trace out such interactions over extended periods of time.\r\n\r\nThis National Science Foundation award Douglas V. Armstrong (Syracuse University) to examine a revolutionary change in agricultural and labor systems in Barbados.  This research is being organized as a cooperative international effort between archaeologists at Syracuse University and the Barbados Museum and Historical Society.  The study will focus on the scientific investigation of cultural deposits at the newly rediscovered pioneer English settlement at Trents Plantation, a founding settlement originally known as Charles Fort.  The site, rediscovered through GIS (geographic information system) analysis of a plantation map dating to 1646, provides a unique opportunity to examine early life on a small-scale farm.  The excellent preservation of stratified deposits, spanning more than 350 years and including the only undisturbed (unplowed) enslaved labor settlement in Barbados, allow the scientific examination of the shift from small-scale farm to large-scale production of sugar, the transition to a sugar economy, the institution of slavery, and the rise of capitalism in the British West Indies. \r\n\r\nTrents was one of the first estates settled in Barbados in 1627. It began as a small-scale operation engaged in mixed agriculture (cotton, tobacco, indigo) by farmers using indentured and enslaved laborers.  It was part of a rapid and dramatic shift to agricultural/industrial production of sugar using large numbers of enslaved African laborers beginning in the 1640s.  The significance of Barbados to the rise of the plantation system in the Americas has been well chronicled by historians, but prior to this study no traces of pre-sugar era estates had been known and no intact and unplowed enslaved laborer settlements had been identified for Barbados.  \r\n\r\nThe study will use a rigorous set of archaeological methodologies to collect and analyze artifacts, dietary remains, and spatial relationships. The study will test a series of hypotheses examining changes in social systems in the colony.  It will: 1) explore and evaluate sites associated with the founding of an English colony in the Caribbean (1627-1640s); 2) analyze the record of social relations reflected in the shift from small scale farms that used indentured (European) and enslaved (African) labor to large scale capitalistic agro-industrial plantations that relied primarily on enslaved laborers from Africa (transitional era: 1640s-1680s; and early sugar era: 1680s-1720s; and later period of slavery 1720s-1834); 3) critically examine the landscape in which slavery emerged as the dominant form of labor; and, 4) assess changes in the local environment as lands were cleared for agricultural production. \r\n\r\nThe changes that took place in Bardados had profoundly impacted the social and economic structure associated with enslavement of Africans and the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade.  The plantation systems developed in Barbados were used as models in the British settlement of Jamaica and South Carolina, and established complex trading networks that linked merchant traders in Boston and England and provision farmers throughout New England. The changes set in motion in Barbados with the rise of the capitalstic sugar plantation and the shift to chattel slavery were profound and world changing.",

This shift corresponds with a change to a capitalistic form of finanicial backing by private investors from England and the Netherlands.&nbsp;The study involved survey and excavation of three loci at Trents Plantation -&nbsp; Locus 1: Early settlement and planter's mansion house (1627-1640s), and 1640s to 19th century); Locus 2: Enslaved laborer settlement (1650s-1838); Locus 3: Trents cave (1760-1850). Excavations allowed comparisions of data from the site of initial settlement in Barbados (1627) and related pre-sugar era contexts (through teh 1640s) with post sugar era planter contexts (after 1646).&nbsp;The primary focus of the NSF investigation was an intensive study of the enslaved laborer settlelment at&nbsp;Trents (1650s -1838).&nbsp;Survey, testing, and excavation at the plantation's enslaved laborer settlement define the extent of the laborer village. This is the only unplowed enslaved laborer settlement that has been found in Barbados. Five haborer house sites were extensively excavated.&nbsp; The houses are marked by foundations and mortar rubble as well as accumulations of domestic artifacts.&nbsp;At HA1 (house area one), we exposed a floor that had a nearly complete, albiet broken sgraffito slipware plate dating circa 1660-1710 along with quantities of lead glaze course earthenware sherds/ All the house sites projected similar patterns of relatievely inexpensive wares and high percentages of locally made&nbsp; domestic earthenware cooking pots.

Survey, testing, and excavation at the plantation's enslaved laborer settlement define the extent of the laborer village. This is the only unplowed enslaved laborer settlement that has been found in Barbados. Five haborer house sites were extensively excavated.  The houses are marked by foundations and mortar rubble as well as accumulations of domestic artifacts. At HA1 (house area one), we exposed a floor that had a nearly complete, albiet broken sgraffito slipware plate dating circa 1660-1710 along with quantities of lead glaze course earthenware sherds/ All the house sites projected similar patterns of relatievely inexpensive wares and high percentages of locally made  domestic earthenware cooking pots.

Broken pottery sherds were carved to create small round discs that were used either in games of chance or as backings for cloth buttons. HA3 had flink strike-a-lights fire starters that were made from flakes of flint, while HA4 had similar items, but all were made from flint cores. \n\nThe archaeological study at Trents demonstrated a signifianct shift in the cultural landscape associated with the shift to sugar.  This shift involved a dramatic expansion in the scale of opeations including the establishement of a separete laborer settlelment and an increase in acess to goods and evidence of wealth in the middens associated withthe planter (including expensive porcelain;s from the Far East, fine European tin enamel warea, glassware, and expendible bottle glass).  In contrast, through its history (1650s to abandonment in 1838), the enslaved laborer laborer households project relative poverty including inexpensive wares (locally made cooking pots. plain and banded imported European wares, and relatively few bottles and very little glassware.\n\nIn addition to addressing our defined research questions, related to the comparision of lifeways at the mansion house and village, during the survey of the site we discovered a cave site that projects a distinct pattern of material use that focused on iron (deposits date from 1760 to the 1850s). The inclusion of caches of steel blades, and iron hinges that were ground tro a point to create daggers (along with an associated grinding stone), as well as stratified evidence of a series of small fires and the butchering of lamb, suggest that the people who used this site were involved in both ritual practices and resistance.  \n\nThe study was carried out by Syracuse University in cooperation with the Barbados Museum and the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill.  Preliminary findings are publisehd in the Journal of the Barbados Museum and Historical Society and final analyses are being prepared for scholarly pulbications. The findings are considered extremely significant in Barbados and data from the excavations were presented to the Barbadian public in a formal exhibit (April -July 2016) at the Barbados Museum that was part of the 50th Anniversary celebration of Baradian independence. The exhibit included a public lecture to a full house at the Barbados Museum. Based on positive respones to the exhibit, this summer I will be working with the Barbados Museum on a Smithsonian Museum of African American History sponsored program involving capacity building and training in archaeology, curation, and heritage management.  \n\nFollow-up research based on findings from this study is leading to two new projects. One focuses on in-depth research into the broader role of Dutch and multi-national financial systems and private (multi-national) capital investments backing the shift to sugar and slavey. The second, follows from the discovery of the cave site at Trents and its focus on iron and steel, ritual practice, and resistance. This follow-up study will explore the compositional analysis of iron/steel to better understand the cultural meaning of these materials as understood and applied by enslaved (and free) Africans and their descendants in Barbados and the Americas. It will also look back across the Atlantic to better understand the composition of iron/streel from African and European sources.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas V Armstrong"
