 "awd_abstract_narration": "a non-technical explanation \r\nThis project will evaluate whether advanced environmental assessment tools can be used in a remote and ecologically stressed agricultural watershed. A new international collaboration will be formed through a project designed to evaluate suitability and geographic transferability of current strategies for measuring occurrence and ecological effects of non-point source contamination. The project will train U.S. graduate students and future Kazakh scientists and engineers in methods for studying contaminants and effects and also will advance environmental science by developing a geographically-neutral framework for assessment of non-point source contamination.\r\nThis workshop and pilot project will help build a framework useful in Kazakhstan and other developing countries promoting agricultural development while maintaining or improving environmental quality. Graduate students will have a chance to work together and will gain valuable international experience. The outcomes of this workshop and pilot project will benefit Kazakhstan and other developing countries thus improving international environmental security. The workshop and pilot project will enhance educational modules of existing graduate courses taught by project investigators. An interactive website will compare water monitoring activities and outcomes of the workshop and pilot project with efforts from Nebraska Watershed Network whose mission is to involve students and local stakeholders in projects that focus on the environmental stewardship of freshwater resources.\r\n\r\n\r\na technical description\r\nWhile developing countries move toward modern agricultural practices, they often do not have the infrastructure to monitor and evaluate impacts to water quality. Ecological degradation can accelerate to levels impacting agricultural productivity and environmental security. This workshop and pilot project will permit investigators to identify research questions related to water and sediment quality and ecological effects of nonpoint source contaminants that will help sustain productivity, while maintaining environmental quality. Few watersheds have sustained the degree of ecological and chemical impact in the Syr Darya river basin. Close study using state-of-the-art tools to study occurrence and effects of currently- and historically-used agrichemicals will help better evaluate and minimize future impacts. Moreover, initial results from this study will help form a framework for the assessment of the occurrence and ecological impacts of nonpoint source contaminants in Kazakhstan and beyond.\r\nA team from the U.S. will build on their current research in the fields of environmental chemistry and bioavailability to improve our understanding of chemistry and ecological effects of organic contaminants in aquatic environments. Objectives are to: 1) Hold an international workshop to present and compare approaches for measuring and predicting the ecological effects of biologically active contaminants in the Syr Darya river basin; and 2) Using a pilot project approach, develop a framework for measuring occurrence and ecological impacts of nonpoint source contamination in a remote ecosystem in Kazakhstan. Project participants in Kazakhstan are affiliated with al-Farabi Kazakh National University in Almaty, KZ and include Mukhambetkali Burkitbayev, Bolat Uralbekov, Omirzha Taukebayev and Nadir S. Mamylov.",

While developed countries such as the United States are grappling to maintain adequate environmental monitoring programs, resources to support these efforts in developing countries are severely limited. Both point and nonpoint source contamination of surface and ground water is more pronounced and severely affects water uses in many of these water scarce areas. Crop production in the semi-arid climate of southern Kazakhstan currently uses intensive irrigation from highly seasonal surface water supplies used for multiple purposes. Irrigation practices have not changed significantly over the past several decades and return flows from fields treated with fertilizers and pesticides annually delivers residues of these and legacy pesticides to the Syr Darya River and ultimately the rapidly disappearing Aral Sea. This project was undertaken to help catalyze international research to determine best methods for documenting the environmental occurrence and ecological consequences of this composite chemical load in a highly stressed agroecosystem.</p>\n<p>The collaborative outcomes of this project included an international workshop attended by U.S. and central Asia scientist who evaluated approaches for measuring and predicting effects of biologically active contaminants in the Syr Darya River. Many regions in Kazakhstan, including the Syr Darya, have been subjected to a history of intensive agricultural and other land use practices that continue to stress the sustainability and recovery of fisheries and other uses of the river and Aral Sea. Workshop participants exchanged ideas for effectively studying environmental occurrence and ecological effects of contaminants in remote regions. Technologies and approaches for sampling and measuring contaminants and biological effects to populations vary considerably, and their uses often limited by logistical feasibility. A pilot project immediately after the workshop facilitated collection of data to help develop a framework for measuring occurrence and ecological impacts of nonpoint source contamination in a remote ecosystem in Kazakhstan for future monitoring and comparisons to other regions. Chemical analysis of samples from the pilot project indicated that residues of both currently-used and legacy pesticides such as DDT and lindane, heavy metals and radionuclides occur in both the water column and aquatic sediments of the modern Syr Darya River. Genetic analysis of native fish tissue samples for stress markers suggest that ecological effects from chemical contamination are likely. Site-specific patterns of gene expression suggest that fish from some stretches of the Syr Darya are a greater risk of adverse effects from heavy metals exposure than others. Use of innovative passive sampling techniques during the pilot project suggests that these tools may be helpful, but require additional modification for use and deployment in remote regions such as the Syr Darya. Results of the pilot study will be presented at international conferences and published in refereed journal articles.&nbsp; Subsequent trips to the Syr Darya have been planned and it is likely that this project will result in a long-term exchange of ideas, information and a better understanding of ways to study the occurrence and ecological effects of pesticides and other contaminants in remote watersheds. The project both initiated and strengthened connections between U.S. and Kazakhstan scientists, including a new U.S. investigator, with greatly increased potential for future work and provided an international and highly relevant experience for students from three U.S. institutions.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/02/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;D&nbsp;Snow</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427834/1427834_10308814_1472822912244_P1020108--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427834/1427834_10308814_1472822912244_P1020108--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Field processing of CNIC samples\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1427834/1427834_10308814_1472822912244_P1020108--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Field processing of CNIC samples\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field crew processing samples on the shore of the Shardara Reservoir on the Syr Darya River</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M.
