 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Nicolas C. Polfer  of the University of Florida is supported by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to study the chemistry that takes place when proteins are analyzed by mass spectrometry.  The project will  expand the scope and improve the fidelity of mass spectrometric characterization of the fragmentation patterns of peptide ions generated from parent proteins.  This, in turn, improves the reliability of the high throughput  identifications of proteins in complex biological samples.  Advances in life sciences depend on the integration of reliable protein identification results with complimentary genomic and metabolomic information.  In this context, the project  will provide new avenues for the identification of proteins and hence advance our understanding of life processes.  In addition, the spectroscopic techniques developed in this work may also lead to applications in other areas of chemistry, such as mechanistic organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe analytical mass spectrometric and spectroscopic methods  the research team is developing are focused on probing the chemistry that takes place when peptides are fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID) for the purpose of peptide and protein sequencing by mass spectrometry.  Analytical laser spectroscopy techniques, in particular infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) and two-laser pump-probe schemes in a cryogenically-cooled 3-D ion trap, will be employed to: 1) provide a deeper understanding of labile and radical rearrangement chemistries that take place, 2) study the dynamics of these rearrangement reactions, and 3) develop methodologies that enable more control in the dissociation chemistry, for improved structural determination of peptides and proteins.  The proposed research is of significance to de novo protein sequencing and for the location of posttranslational modifications on the peptide sequence. \r\n \r\nIn the course of this research, graduate students are being trained in state-of-the-art mass spectrometric and spectroscopic techniques.  The technologies and the results of the proposed research will be communicated to high school students through workshops  aimed at high school science teachers.",

Mass spectrometers are devices that weigh molecules as charged particles, so-called <em>ions</em>. &nbsp;The mass of the ion can give clues to the identity of the molecule.

Another approach is to make the ions colder. At temperatures close to absolute zero, the initial energy of the molecule is well-defined, because it is almost zero. We have built a mass spectrometer to cool ions down to 20 degrees above absolute zero (approx.. - 250 <sup>o</sup>C). At those very cold temperatures, it is possible to for instance attach an N<sub>2</sub> molecule to the ion, which we term a <em>tagged</em> ion. This increases the mass by a known amount, namely the mass of the tag. Since its mass is distinctive, it is then possible to eject all other ions from the spectrometer, except for the tagged ion. Thereafter, the tagged ion is irradiated by the laser at a discrete infrared light frequency. If the ion absorbs light, it will dissociate by the predictable loss of the tag. By scanning the lasing, one can monitor the dissociation as a function of the laser frequency. In fact, this indirectly yields the infrared spectrum of the ion. Not only is this approach very sensitive, because the sole dissociation process is loss of the tag, the quality of the infrared spectrum is also very high, because at cold temperatures the structure is much better defined. We have shown that one can play the game of tagging and detagging with multiple ions of different masses at the same time. This means that the infrared spectra of multiple ions can be recorded simultaneously. We have thus overcome a major bottleneck for infrared spectroscopy coupled with mass spectrometry. While mass spectrometry is a powerful analytical technique, it yields relatively little structural information on molecules.
