Biodiversity data that document the degree of variation of life through species diversity, phenology, and geographic occurrence will be generated by science classrooms and delivered to scientists who need this data for sustainability research, enriching ongoing studies of invasive species, biodiversity, and climate science. Interviews and surveys will help identify and address scientific, social, and technological challenges associated with citizen science data sharing.\r\n\r\nThe research will result in: 1) new hands-on STEM learning opportunities in classrooms across the nation; 2) ecological research on sustainability in both professional research settings and in participating classrooms; and 3) insights into opportunities, challenges, and strategies for improving the distribution and use of citizen science data.",

In collaboration with multiple partners in the Smithsonian Institution, educators were trained in the BioCubes program for biodiversity observation, and the iNaturalist platform for sharing observations of living species.</p>\n<p>We found that there are numerous challenges that teachers face to incorporate citizen science activities in the classroom, which were more difficult to address than the issues educators had to address for doing citizen science in out-of-school learning environments. The findings were published in the International Journal of Environmental and Science Education, and included several valuable observations; for example, built-in flexibility in citizen science participation processes doesn&rsquo;t necessarily address the systemic issues (like resources for supplies or amount of time for science instruction) that were major barriers for teachers, but strategically identifying parts of the procedures that support variations to better meet teachers&rsquo; needs can be helpful. We also saw that there is clear benefit to allowing teachers and students to identify their own questions and locations for gathering data, and that it is unlikely to have a negative impact on the science for studies of biodiversity.</p>\n<p>However, we found that the parts of the participation process that are most important to turning classroom activities into scientific data that can be used for real-world research, namely data entry and data sharing, were also the ones that were least valued and least attractive for teachers. This was mostly because these activities were not adequately rewarding for teachers and involved a lot of &ldquo;extra&rdquo; work that didn&rsquo;t create an obvious direct benefit to them or their students. Providing more structure for data management processes, and developing technologies with more rewarding outputs such as visuals of the data and feedback about its use for scientific studies, are both promising directions for future technology development to support broader participation in STEM research. Other challenging situations teachers encountered included uncertainty around institutional support for new teaching methods and difficulty obtaining adequate technology access to support participation, as many inaccurate assumptions are made about classroom technologies, particularly for Title I schools. This also suggests that a person in a role of a &ldquo;mediator&rdquo; to provide extra help for the data sharing processes could be very helpful for turning student observations into useful scientific data.</p>\n<p>In addition to these findings, we also examined how data were validated by peer contributors on the iNaturalist platform, which is open to anyone for contributing to observations and identification of living creatures. In a paper that won an Honorable Mention award, we reported our findings on substantial self-selection biases as to which data volunteers gave attention to verify the species identifications, which were most prevalent with respect to the type of creatures (birds are most popular and everything else gets less attention) and whether the data were submitted from a computer or a smartphone. We believe the issue with the type of tools used to submit the observations has to do with image quality, as smartphones are not capable of good photography for some species (things that are small, far away, or moving) and that would make it harder for others to verify the species identification. We also observed substantial biases resulting from image aesthetics: &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; images taken by an experienced professional photographer got far more attention than &ldquo;good&rdquo; images by professional marine biologists, and &ldquo;average&rdquo; images from first-time observers (teachers and students) got the least attention of all. This is a potential problem for many citizen science projects, and one of the key things we learned is that most smartphone users can benefit from a little additional instruction in photography techniques to create better and more useful images.</p>\n<p>This project also supported the completion of a doctoral dissertation by Dr. Yurong He, &ldquo;Data sharing across research and public communities,&rdquo; as well as research experiences for an additional PhD student and an MS student who has continued on to a PhD program.
