GMT now includes more than 80 modules that share a common set of command options, file structures, and documentation. It is used widely to produce publication-quality graphic presentations.  GMT now has more than 25,000 individual registered users.   This award will support expansion on GMT capabilities to include: 1) code for plotting, velocity vectors from GPS measurements and their uncertainties as arrows with confidence ellipses, earthquake focal mechanisms as hemispherical projections on cartographically correct maps, ternary diagrams and geologic symbols; 2) an Application Programming Interface (API) between GMT and Python to support computational workflow scripting; and 3) tools for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing and analysis for spatially resolved imaging of Earth surface deformation associated with earthquake-generating faults, active volcanoes, moving glaciers, and unstable landslides, as well as the engineered withdrawal and/or injection of petroleum, natural gas, geothermal fluids, and carbon dioxide.   The developed GMT source code will be distributed, free of charge, under the GNU Lesser General Public License. \r\n\r\n***",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funding for this project has supported several new extensions to the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), a major and well established open-source software package widely used in the physical sciences, in particular the geosciences.  We estimate that there are more than 30,000 users worldwide, with several thousand US scientists using it on a daily basis in their workflows.  This grant has enabled GMT to expand its utility from cultivating predominantly a marine science user base to service a much wider audience within the solid Earth community.  Despite being a fluid undertaking with constant feedbacks from the user community leading to course changes along the way, we have nevertheless made many specific advances in pursuit of that goal: (1) In support of seismology, we have strengthened and augmented our basic tools for plotting seismic traces and displaying earthquake focal mechanisms on maps and in crossections; (2) to better support the broad field of geodesy we have improved our tools that plot GPS velocity vectors with uncertainty ellipses and added a new 2-D elasticity-governed gridding tool for vector component data.  Using the Green?s functions for 2-D elastic deformation we are able to grid the two horizontal velocity components simultaneously via the elastic coupling.  Furthermore, we have vastly expanded the capabilities of GMT5SAR, a separate toolkit built on top of GMT that handles the processing and analysis of radar interferometry, including the addition of many new satellite formats.  Satellite radar interferometry is a powerful new technique for measuring small displacements (&lt; 10 cm) of the surface of the earth due to earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, and subsidence from groundwater withdrawal; (3) To better support tectonophysics and structural geology we have added a new ternary plot module and greatly expanded our custom plot symbols which now offer a variety of specialized symbols for representing faults, foliation, bedding, etc.; (4) In support of geodynamics we are close to completing a major new interface to GMT from Python, which will simplify building geodynamical workflows.  The Python interface will join the recently released GMT/MATLAB toolbox and the raw GMT command line access and is expected to reach thousands of new users in the years to come.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul Wessel"
