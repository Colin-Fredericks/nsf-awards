 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most frogs and toads vocalize to communicate, and females typically use hearing to locate mates. Despite how essential tympanic ears are for hearing sound in air, outer and middle ear structures have been lost and regained many times in frogs and toads. This project integrates anatomy, physiology, development, and phylogenetic analyses to investigate the independent gains and losses of ear structures. Relating ear morphology to hearing ability will reveal novel mechanisms of hearing and will characterize the costs and benefits of various anatomical features for hearing low and high pitch sounds. Because the development of ear structures is linked to the development of other skull features, this project will identify changes in the size and shape of skull bones that accompany changes in ear structures. Moreover, developmental analyses will determine specific genetic and cellular changes that cause the loss of outer and middle ear structures, a type of ear defect that is a common cause of human deafness.\r\n\r\nIntegrative analyses of skull features will assess whether associated changes in skulls facilitate the diversity of ear structures, with data publicly available at Digimorph (http://www.digimorph.org/) and the CSU Digital Repository (http://lib.colostate.edu/repository/).  The research in this proposal includes natural opportunities to better educate the general public and university students about hearing, biodiversity, and conservation. Within the US, this proposal will be integrated into undergraduate classes as part of a new laboratory approach to teach students to conduct and interpret statistical analyses. In addition, US undergraduates will participate in the research efforts and participate in developing a bilingual museum exhibition about frogs that will be displayed at one or more US science museums. The Ecuadorian toad breeding program and a related Ecuadorian museum exhibition will contribute to amphibian conservation at a key moment when road-building and resource extraction threaten to have major impacts on wildlife in Ecuador.",

We characterized the evolutionary history of middle ear structures to confirm that some ear structures have been lost over 17 times, although the ?earless? species do have functional inner ears with cells that sense sounds. We measured sensitivity to sound to determine that earless species are consistently hard of hearing ? they can hear higher pitch sounds only when very close to the sound source. We found one group that likely regained middle ear structures, such that their ancestors very likely lacked middle ears but at some point shifted development to recreate a nearly fully complete ear. Strangely, these regained ears did not give the animal any hearing advantage ? as we showed for toads throughout development, only when middle ears are 100% fully developed do they make animals more sensitive to airborne sound, so this species which recreates nearly a complete ear did so without any measurable benefit for hearing. The work just described leaves a real puzzle: if animals are hard of hearing without fully complete ear structures, why would ear loss be so prevalent? We examined both evolutionary patterns and development to argue that animals aren?t losing ear structures because they gain some other important benefit, such as a fantastic jaw that allows them to eat new food items. Instead, we think changes in developmental timing disrupt ear formation without an obvious major benefit to accompany it. We found that animals with larger genomes are more likely to lose ears, and that larger genomes slow development rate. Although earless species initiate middle ear development right on time, we found that the later stages of development that occur after metamorphosis from a tadpole to a juvenile simply don?t occur. Although perhaps slower development does benefit the organism, we believe that biases during development make it easy for frogs and toads to lose ears over evolutionary time, and that they manage to find mates and survive with reduced hearing ability. We characterized one earless species that has very unusual patterns of mating ? instead of the males arriving at the mating pond and vocalizing to attract females, the females arrive and grapple for space, then males arrive silently and select a female.
