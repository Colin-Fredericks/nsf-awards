 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of US mathematicians in the 'Algebraic Lie Theory and Representation Theory' conference hosted by the International Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Edinburgh, Scotland during the week of September 1-5, 2014 and the accompanying LMS-CMI Research School for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other young researchers hosted by the University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland during the week of August 25-29, 2014.  In recent years there have been many exciting developments within algebraic Lie theory which provide significant advances and insights to the field. These innovative methods involve a mixture of combinatorial, algebraic, geometric, and topological tools.  However, the rapid progress made possible by this diversity of techniques means that even experts are not familiar with all facets of the field.  The workshop is designed to bring together leading researchers and young mathematicians from the US, Europe, and Asia so that these methods may be shared.  The research school is designed to bring young mathematicians up to speed on some of the most fruitful areas of current research.  The current schedule for the school features lecture series by Iain Gordon, Andrew Mathas, and Catharina Stroppel.  \r\n\r\nLie groups and Lie algebras have been a central theme in mathematics since their origins in the work of Sophus Lie in the late 19th century. They find profound applications in diverse areas of mathematics and physics. Their ubiquity and importance led to the expansion of Lie theory into many new areas.  This expanded area is now known as algebraic Lie theory.  Leading researchers can now be found in the US, Europe, and Asia.  The workshop and research school provide a unique opportunity for researchers from around the world to disseminate the latest results and techniques in algebraic Lie theory.  Both the workshop and research school place a strong emphasis on encouraging international collaboration and the involvement of up-and-coming researchers.  In particular, this grant will allow participation by US based mathematicians who are young researchers, from underrepresented groups, or who would otherwise be unable to attend.  It will provide a rich opportunity for US mathematicians to learn of cutting edge work and initiate international collaborations.  We anticipate this grant will have a significant impact on US based students and researchers in this exciting field.

The goal was to introduce the next generation of researchers to several areas of cutting edge research in Lie theory in a way which emphasized the breadth and interconnectedness of the field.  The feedback of the research school was uniformly positive.  There is every reason to believe that the young mathematicians' participation in the research school and workshop will have a significant impact on their careers and on future advances in the field.  It is planned to create a research monograph based upon the topics of the research school suitable for others who would like to learn about central questions in modern Lie theory.\n\nIn addition, a public lecture given by Arun Ram entitled \"The Glass Bead Game\" was a real highlight of the workshop.
