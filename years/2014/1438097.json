 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for  CoPI Hunter Snyder, who is a research associate at the Arctic Studies Center, to travel to Greenland to do pre-Dissertation Improvement Grant proposal consultation with local scholars and community members.   In addition, the CoPI would do a proof of concept for his Photovoices methodology in Greenland by engaging in trial video education and production training with local community youth.   The eventual topic for the video is how the Inuit balance between traditional hunting and fishing and prospective work in the newly developing mining industry.  Building on over 4,000 years of Inuit storytelling, and the CoPI?s expertise in video production and ethnography, the researcher hopes to collaborate with Greenlanders to capture and analyze their knowledge about changing livelihoods, the lived experience of varying types of labor, and the local meaning of social and environmental change through visual media.",

Prominent examples range from Worth and Adair&rsquo;s project with Navajo from the 1960&rsquo;s, Terry Turner&rsquo;s efforts to introduce video cameras to Kayapo amid unrest over resource claims to Arctic-focused projects (Elder, 1995) and more subtle and explicitly interdependent arrangements between respondents and anthropologists found in the work of John L.

Within the first few days, it became clear that an agenda of teaching video production would be irrelevant. The experienced fishers and hunters I spent my days working with were already media-savvy.

That an anthropologist can introduce the technology and indigenous peoples can produce unmediated moving images of their world is misguided and is actually runs counter to the entire history of indigenous media production, at least as it has been conceptualized by the social sciences. Since the project among Navajo began with a scholarly agenda and did not commence with a fortuitous air-drop of 16mm cameras, the images that resulted cannot be understood as merely indigenous images. But to that very point, the entire history of indigenous film production that has followed has inevitably begun with the same condition; the technology of the camera and the media that results becomes a &lsquo;new&rsquo; contact zone (Clifford, 1997) between anthropologists and indigenous peoples. When we say images produced from projects that introduce cameras and have contact with ethnographers are in some ways not able to be called indigenous video productions, we perpetuate the assumption that the world&rsquo;s indigenous peoples are actually distanced from other forms of cultural production and technology, and furthermore, when we mediate the process of indigenous image-making, we act against the methods set forth by our visually-oriented forefathers.
