The workshop sessions will focus on established connections between topics in Control and Dynamical Systems (CDS) program at Caltech and emerging opportunities.  This workshop is unique as it will bring in distinguished US and international researchers to participate and discuss future directions for the control and dynamical systems community.  The goal is recognize some of the successes of the field in the past 20 years and to talk about new opportunities in the next 20 years. A particular focus of the workshop will be on how the future directions of CDS can better serve the nation, and how to educate a new breed of scientists and engineers in this important area.  Sample application areas include aerospace and transportation, biology and medicine, communications and networking, economics and finance, energy and infrastructure, materials and processing, and robotics and intelligent machines. The workshop will be held on August 5-7, 2014 in Pasadena, CA.\r\n  \r\nThe workshop will include three major themes (1) control and feedback (2) dynamics and geometry (3) systems, networks and applications.  The workshop will have a strong educational component for graduate and undergraduate students, especially those seeking to define an exciting thesis topic for a 21st century control theory that continues to impact society and technology in numerous ways.  The outcome of the workshop will be published in the IEEE Control Systems Magazine for wider dissemination. It is expected that this workshop will have a significant impact in setting the direction of research and innovations in control system engineering.",
