 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds research to develop methods of remotely detecting small deformations of the ground surface and civil infrastructure.  Natural and constructed geotechnical facilities, such as dams, retaining structures, and earthen slopes, are vital components of civil infrastructure.  Monitoring movements and deformations of geotechnical facilities is important for ensuring acceptable engineering performance and identifying potential hazards to the public.  Ideally, problems should be detected at an early stage when the movements are both small in magnitude and localized in area.  In practice, this can be challenging due to the massive size of geotechnical facilities and the limitations of current deformation monitoring technology.  This research will focus on application and enhancement of an emerging remote sensing technology \"ground-based interferometric radar\" for detecting and measuring small and localized deformations of geotechnical facilities.  The ultimate goal of this research is to develop and improve technology that can be used to better understand the performance of civil infrastructure, detect problems at an early stage of development, and mitigate the effects of natural hazards on society.\r\n\r\nGround-based interferometric radar is an emerging active-source, scanning technique that has the potential to fill a gap in deformation measurement capabilities for geotechnical engineering applications.  Past studies of ground-based interferometric radar have focused on measuring large spatial-scale surface movements (e.g. landslides) where the surface area of interest may be tens of thousands of square meters and cover thousands of radar ground pixels.  This study will focus on the application of ground-based interferometric radar for detecting small (sub-mm) and localized (a few m2) movements where the region of movement may be pixel scale or smaller in size.  The conventional approach to collecting and processing interferometric radar data (developed for satellite-based studies) was not designed and optimized for these applications.  There are no in-depth studies of ground-based interferometric radar for detecting small and localized deformations.  Unique existing data sets will be used in conjunction with data collected from this project to meet the following objectives: (1) identify effective data collection and processing procedures for detecting and measuring sub-pixel to pixel scale surface movements using ground-based interferometric radar, (2) use controlled studies to quantify the accuracy and uncertainties in ground-based interferometric radar deformation measurements of sub-pixel to pixel scale surface movements, and (3) study methods to model and mitigate atmospheric effects and other noise. Successful completion of the project objectives will result in advancement of the state of knowledge regarding the application of ground-based interferometric radar for measuring deformations of the ground surface and civil infrastructure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research addressed the problem of detecting very small (mm-scale) and localized areas (a few square meters) of movement or deformation within a massive structure or landscape covering tens of thousands of square meters.  This measurement capability is important for civil engineering applications to detect and measure problematic changes in large structures (such as dams) at an early stage or identify locations of potential natural hazards, such as rockfall. \n\nThis specific focus of this research was on the problem of identifying potential rockfall locations by detecting small precursor movements that may indicate future instability.  By identifying these locations, remedial actions, such as removing the rock, can be performed before a rockfall event occurs.   The technology studied in this research is called Ground-based Interferometric Radar (GBIR) which is a remote sensing technology that uses radar waves to detect locations where the ground surface has moved.  The GBIR is mounted on a tripod and rotated while scanning the area of interest in less than a minute at distances from 35 m to 10 km.  Radar waves bounce off the surface and are recorded by a receiving antennae and saved.  At a second time (which can be minutes or months later) the radar again scans the site and records the radar returns.  If surface movements have occurred, the location of movement can be detected and the magnitude of movement can be determined from small shifts of the radar wave, as illustrated in the attached image.\n\nGBIR is an amazing technology that has been used to monitor large areas of movements such as landslides (thousands of square meters) and track mm-scale displacements.  Rockfall hazards present a more difficult challenge as the targets of interest may be very small (only a few meters in dimension), yet pose a major threat to the travelling public and cause significant damage or travel delays.  The attached image shows the GBIR being used to scan a site of persistent and damaging rockfall in Glenwood Canyon, Colorado. \n\nThe application studied in this research is use of periodic GBIR measurements to identify regions where very small movements are occurring (caused by the action of freezing water, roots, or erosion, for example).  This research project was performed to answer the following questions: (1) What is the smallest rock size we can detect using GBIR measurements? (2) What is the smallest movement we can detect using GBIR? (3) What is the best way to collect and process the data to identify these areas of movement? and (4) can seasonal GBIR measurements capture small movements at real sites?\n\nWe investigated the first three questions by performing controlled studies of rock movements.  We used both a synthetic rock-like material mounted on a precisely controlled guide and rocks in the natural environment of various sizes that were incrementally moved using an airbag jack.  The last question was investigated by performing long-term (three-year long) bi-annual measurements of field sites.   \n\nWe found that under ideal conditions using precisely controlled translational movements of a single, known rock target we could measure movements as small as 0.2 mm.  After studying various data collection and processing strategies of field measurements performed at offset distances of about 100m, we found that we could detect movements of rocks within the 20,000 m2 scanned area if the rock was about 2 m or larger in dimension and the movements were greater than about 0.5 mm.   The rock size detection threshold increases at larger offset distances.\n\nOur long-term, periodic measurements at field sites showed great potential for hazard detection using GBIR.  We detected a previously unknown hazard (tens of square meters in size) at one of the field sites and have continued to measure seasonal movements with the GBIR.  We also identified several other smaller areas of movements that may indicate potential hazards.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brent L Rosenblad"
