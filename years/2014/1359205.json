 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will establish a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Boston University (BU). The REU program will be offered annually to six qualified applicants, who will perform cutting-edge research with dedicated faculty members. The Site will leverage BU?s expertise in studying magnetic fields at all cosmic scales, in order to impart a deep understanding of the basics of electromagnetism to the REU students. Student projects will be selected from topics that will expose undergraduate researchers to magnetic-field phenomena in the universe and cover topics including solar physics, auroral and ionospheric physics, and heliospheric science, as well as magnetic fields on stars, exoplanets, blazars, and clusters of galaxies. Potential projects will involve both theory and data analysis from space physics missions and astronomical facilities such as the Discovery Channel Telescope.\r\n\r\nBy offering high-quality research experiences to students at a critical stage of undergraduate education, the REU Site will contribute to increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and engineers. Participants must come to grips with a large corpus of existing knowledge about the makeup, origins, and interactions of many types of physical and astronomical objects. They will also develop the analytical skills (mathematical, computational, and logical) necessary to process data, understand primary research, and to remain current with new developments in the field. The REU Site also has an active and highly developed strategy to recruit women and underrepresented minorities into its program, which will expand STEM training opportunities to these groups.",
