 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Multi-functional Integrated System Technology (MIST) I/UCRC is motivated by three major research/industry trends: 1.) Stepping beyond the current challenge of continued conventional scaling of integrated circuits (Moore?s Law); 2.) Exploring new functionalities at intersections of materials, processes, devices, and circuits for multi-functional systems; and 3.) Integrating nanoscale materials into micro/nanosystem manufacturing.  Through industry-driven collaborative research initiatives, interdisciplinary mixing will be promoted at the MIST Center in order to catalyze innovation opportunities such as combinations of computing, sensing, actuation, and energy storage/generation on the same system on a chip (SoC) or system in package (SiP). The MIST Center intends to contribute to the definition of the roadmap to next-generation integrated electronic systems.\r\n\r\nResearch at the MIST Center aims to link industry and academia and connect research advances in materials science, electronics, magnetics, acoustics, photonics, microfluidic devices, MEMS, and circuits to societally relevant technologies. The proposed MIST I/UCRC plans to integrate a strong team of complementary investigators, train the next generation of graduate students who are versed in the center?s precompetitive research, actively recruit and mentor participants from underrepresented groups in science and engineering drawing on programs at each center site, and team with industrial member companies, governmental agencies, and associations.",

The MIST Center, with its three sites at the University of Florida (UF), University of Central Florida (UCF), and University of Virginia (UVA), share a common vision <em>to innovate More than Moore hardware technologies for smart systems in the IoT era</em>. Its focus is on multi-functional hardware for the Smart-X IoT node with research structured around five requisite technology thrust areas: sensing, computing, wireless, power, and integration.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">The MIST Center strategic roadmap developed closely with its industry advisory board (IAB). Technology research efforts (five thrust areas) enable innovative solutions and platforms in the areas of wearables, IoT, sensor networks, and mist computing. These system technologies are leveraged by IAB members in their market pull areas of automotive, healthcare, consumer/computing, aerospace/defense, agricultural, environment, and other industries.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">The MIST Center is funded by a combination of support from NSF, the University sites, and annual membership fees from member organizations. The membership fee is $50,000 ($25,000 for companies with less than 200 employees). The Center uses a federated funding model, where companies purchase membership at at least one university site, but that membership grants access to the entire Center research and IP portfolio. Approximately 94% of the membership fees are used to directly support research of interest to the member organizations (UF charged zero IDC on membership fees). All project awards are made in one-year increments using the calendar year. In 2019 (Year 5), members enjoyed a 20:1 return on investment (i.e. $50,000 in membership enables access to $988,000 of center research). Key milestones achieved by the MIST Center are: 17 member organizations (+2 alumni), $3M in direct research expenditures (71 projects over five years), 79 pre-publication submissions to the industry advisory board, 12 invention disclosures (6 patents licensed), 88 graduate students, 61 undergraduates, and three participating universities.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">The broader impact of this research focuses on building collaborative multi-organization research networks, pre-collegiate and undergraduate educational/training activities, and broadening the diversity of all research participants. The I/UCRC framework naturally catalyzes significant collaborations between university and industry/government partners. The Center also synergizes and inspires research collaboration between the university sites. The interdisciplinary, experimental nature of the MIST Center research portfolio provides significant opportunity for undergraduate and pre-collegiate training. UCF has leveraged NSF REU supplements to support 3 undergraduate research students (including 1 female and 1 African American) who have worked on MIST Center research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/27/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jiann&nbsp;S&nbsp;Yuan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608476458298_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608476458298_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MIST Center strategic thrust areas\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608476458298_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MIST Center strategic thrust areas\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MIST Center strategic thrust areas</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N/A</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jiann&nbsp;S&nbsp;Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MIST Center strategic thrust areas</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608478965735_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608478965735_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MIST Center strategic map\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608478965735_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MIST Center strategic map\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MIST Center strategic map</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N/A</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jiann&nbsp;S&nbsp;Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MIST Center strategic map</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608479067216_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608479067216_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Phase I by the numbers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439680/1439680_10329813_1608479067216_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Phase I by the numbers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Phase I by the numbers</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">N/A</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jiann&nbsp;S&nbsp;Yuan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Phase I by the numbers</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
