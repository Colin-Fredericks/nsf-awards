The study examines relations between domestic workers and their employers in two sites to understand the effects of culture and social structure on employee-employer labor patterns and interactions, legal status, and understandings of legal rights.  Analysis is based on in-depth interviews with domestic contract workers, employers, and  representatives of government, nongovernmental organizations, and recruitment agencies.  Broader impacts of the project include improved understanding of comparative labor relations and the intersection between labor vulnerability and human trafficking, as well as graduate student research training.",

Our research team gained unprecedented access to this 'hard to reach' population as we completed 165 in-depth interviews with Filipino and Indonesian domestic workers in the UAE and 100 in Singapore. We did not engage in convenient sampling but instead ensured we had a diverse sample of interviewees that included those with and without a day off, documented and undocumented workers, and long-timers and newcomers.

One of our most significant findings is the emergent pattern of a diversity of experiences among domestic workers; we found differences in work standards, work responsiblities, and work conditions (e.g. salary, accomodations, day off) across households. Moreover, we found that these differences cannot all be explained by cultural relativism. Our key finding disagrees with current dominant paradigms on migrant domestic workers, which reduces their experiences in the United Arab Emirates and Singapore to \"slavery\" or \"human trafficking\" or \"structural violence.\" Moving from a structural determinist logic, our study will account for these differences by examining how the religion of employers, the principle of human rights as advanced by nongovernmental organizations such as Human Rights Watch, and the standards of employment advanced by sending and receiving states shape experiences of \"unfree labor\" for domestic workers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/31/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rhacel&nbsp;Parrenas</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
