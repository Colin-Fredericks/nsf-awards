With the pharmaceutical market worldwide estimated to be $1 trillion dollars in 2015 and with an aging population (which uses more pharmaceuticals) and water and wastewater treatment plants never designed to deal with extremely low concentrations of highly biologically active compounds, the problem will likely get worse.  One of the biggest, yet very subtle is the issue of antibiotic resistance in bacteria in natural waters.\r\nAntibiotic resistance constitutes a national and global public health threat. Evidence suggests that in addition to coming from hospitals, antibiotic resistant bacteria also emerge in the environment due to prolonged exposure to antibiotics originating in livestock and human wastes. On the other hand, many antibiotic resistant bacteria can subsist on antibiotics by using them as carbon and energy sources. Because nutrients influence microbial metabolisms and vary in quantity and composition across environmental compartments, they represent an important environmental factor that can affect antibiotic resistance and antibiotic subsistence in the environment.  However, how nutrients affect the emergence of antibiotic resistance and the occurrence of antibiotic subsistence in microbial communities is poorly understood. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to build an integrated research and education/outreach program to minimize the negative impacts of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance to environmental and public health. The research goal of the project is to understand the interactions between antibiotics and microbial (bacterial) communities under various nutrient levels and types (i.e., labile vs. recalcitrant). \r\n\r\nThe research approach will investigate the responses of bacteria to both nutrient starvation and antibiotic presence. The results of these studies will allow implementation in municipal and agricultural wastewater treatment to control the emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. The proposed project will use a novel analytical tool, quantitative (meta)proteomics, which can offer new and valuable perspectives to environmental engineering studies. The use of quantitative (meta)proteomics in the mechanistic studies on antibiotic resistance and antibiotic subsistence will lay the groundwork for exploring further application of this novel technology in other environmental engineering fields such as exposure and biodegradation studies.\r\n\r\nOne major source of antibiotics in the environment is livestock manure. The education goal of the project is to promote behavioral changes in livestock producers on antibiotic administration and manure management and to educate a new generation of environmental engineers specializing in solving agriculture-related environmental challenges. This will be accomplished by:\r\n1.) Raising the awareness of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance as environmental contaminants among livestock producers through outreach and education activities\r\n2.) Develop an integrated course module to stimulate interest in environmental science among high school students in rural areas, and,\r\n3.) Encourage rural students to pursue a graduate degree in environmental engineering",

Evidence suggests that in addition to coming from hospitals, antibiotic resistant bacteria also emerge in the environment due to prolonged exposure to antibiotics originating in livestock and human wastes.  On the other hand, many antibiotic resistant bacteria can subsist on antibiotics by using them as carbon and energy sources.  Because nutrients influence microbial metabolisms and vary in quantity and composition across environmental compartments, they represent an important environmental factor that can affect antibiotic resistance and antibiotic subsistence in the environment.  The overall goal of this project was to build an integrated research and education/outreach program to minimize the negative impacts of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance to environmental and public health. \n\n \n\nThe research goal of the project was to understand the interactions between antibiotics and microbial communities under various nutrient levels and types (i.e., labile vs. recalcitrant).  We investigated the biotransformation of antibiotics belonging to two extensively used classes of antibiotics, tetracyclines and sulfonamides.  Pure cultures capable of biotransforming tetracycline and doxycycline and a mixed culture capable of biotransforming sulfadiazine were isolated from contaminated environments.  The microbial transformation of these antibiotic compounds were investigated under various environmental conditions, such as different pHs, temperatures, and background nutrient conditions.  We found that the biotransformation products of tetracycline antibiotics possess lower antimicrobial potencies than their parent compounds.  Finally, genomic and proteomic approaches were used to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms for the microbial biotransformation of antibiotics.  These findings advance our understanding of an environmental process (i.e., biotransformation of antibiotics) that can significantly affect the persistence of antibiotics in the environment.\n\n \n\nBackground nutrient conditions also impact the proliferation of antibiotic resistance in the environment.  Antibiotic resistance can proliferate in the environment through horizontal gene transfer, where DNA is transferred from one bacterial host to another bacterial host.  Among horizontal gene transfer mechanisms, conjugation is considered an important mechanism in which donor cells pass their DNA to recipient cells through direct contact.  We used chemostat reactors to investigate how bacterial growth rates and background nutrient levels may affect conjugation rates.  Results show that growth rates played a more significant role on conjugation rates than background nutrient levels. \n\n \n\nThe education goal of the project was to promote behavioral changes in livestock producers on antibiotic administration and manure management and to educate a new generation of environmental engineers specializing in solving agriculture-related environmental challenges.  We generated outreach and extension materials about manure management practices and their impacts on the proliferation of antibiotic resistance.  We uploaded the materials to extension websites.  We also made webinars about how manure management practices may reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in the environment.  The audience of our webinars included extension educators, regulatory agencies, and producers in North America.  Finally, one postdoc and two master\u2019s students were trained on this interdisciplinary project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Xu Li"
