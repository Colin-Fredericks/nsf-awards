It is a premier venue for exchange of scientific thought and advances in the field. The program is designed to extend the well established topics in the field and to introduce the community to emerging areas. The 2014 GRC will include twenty-five lectures grouped in five areas: dynamics of polymer melts and glasses; crystallization and self-assembly; interfacial, surface, and nanoconfinement effects; interactions in biomacromolecular systems; and polymers for energy and electronic applications. The associated Gordon Research Seminar provides a complementary venue for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to present their work,  interact with one another and senior mentors, thus cultivating scientific exchange and their development towards fruitful careers in the field.",
