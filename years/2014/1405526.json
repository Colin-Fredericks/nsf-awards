 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports fundamental research on the electron beam melting process, an additive manufacturing technology that builds three-dimensional shapes out of powder metals.  The layer-by-layer fabrication process promotes distinct microstructural features dependent on cooling rates that are affected by part dimensions, among other factors.  Mesh and foam cellular structures are a particular benefit of additive manufacturing and can be used to improve or increase the strength-to-weight ratio of production parts in the aerospace and other industries.  Previously, these mesh and foam cellular structures fabricated by electron beam melting using a titanium alloy contained a titanium martensitic brittle phase that, hypothesized in this research, can be avoided by controlling the cooling rates during fabrication.  Cooling rates will be measured with a multi-wavelength pyrometer to obtain point-specific, layer-by-layer part temperatures; and the smallest part dimensions that can be fabricated without compromising mechanical properties and microstructural architectures will be determined.  \r\n\r\nResearch results and dissemination of these results will provide recommendations and strategies to the broad additive manufacturing and metals fabrication communities to avoid the occurrence of brittle microstructures regardless of part dimensions.  The lack of the titanium martensitic brittle phase will allow freedom in the design of parts containing mesh and foam cellular structures without compromising mechanical properties, which will provide an unprecedented benefit for using additive manufacturing technologies to directly fabricate next generation metallic components.  The research will be performed at the University of Texas at El Paso, a minority serving institution with a Hispanic-majority student population, providing an unparalleled experience for the students involved in the program in the growing field of additive manufacturing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on studying electron beam melting (EBM), a powder bed fusion metal additive manufacturing AM technology, for the fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V components.   Ti-6Al-4V is a material widely used for biomedical implants and aerospace applications.  The EBM manufacturing process offers the ability to fabricate complex and lightweight designs not possible with traditional methods.  The major objective of the project was studying and understanding the thermal characteristics of the EBM process to prevent the formation of a detrimental material phase (martensite), and develop strategies to fabricate parts with desirable microstructure.  Throughout the course of this project, EBM process monitoring methods were investigated and the effects of build conditions were related to mechanical performance.  The findings of this work will be used to improve the EBM build process by utilizing monitoring techniques, and provide additive manufacturing engineers useful data to optimize the EBM build set up. \n\nA number of significant results were found throughout this research and have been disseminated for the EBM additive manufacturing community.  Evaluation of two monitoring methods, an infrared camera (IR, Figure 1) and a multi-wavelength pyrometer (Figure 2), has been published.  Plots showing temperature and time are presented for both methods, providing insight to expectant data when using the respective piece of equipment.  The pyrometer provides a material emissivity independent measurement, allowing its use with a wide range of materials without a need to recalibrate.  However, it is only capable of continuously measuring a small (~2 mm) spot.  To obtain correct temperature measurements form the IR camera the emissivity of the material must be known.  However, the camera is capable of continuously measuring an entire layer for a specific period of time.  Both methods can be used to predict the resulting microstructure of EBM fabricated parts by measuring the cooling rates. \n\nA second set of results was obtained when studying the EBM build conditions provided the greatest number of parts which can be fabricated in a single build, as well as the methods to improve the properties of lattice structures.  It was discovered that a large numbers of parts in a single build, raised the temperature of the build, altering the microstructure and increasing the mechanical strength of the printed parts.  Microstructures are shown in Figure 3 with (a) being the lowest number of parts in a single build and (c) being the highest.  A third study was performed looking for methods to prevent the formation of martensite in mesh structures.  Martensite is a detrimental phase of Ti-6Al-4V which causes unpredictable fracture and is more likely to form in thin features.  It was found that multiple melt scans removed martensite from the lattice structures.  Microstructures are shown in Figure 4.  This finding is significant, as it provides a method to fabricate lightweight, high strength structures with predictable properties.  The project concluded by creating computational models of innovative mesh structures and subsequently tested EBM fabricated specimens, shown in Figure 5. \n\nThe broader impacts of this project are shown through the opportunities provided to several minority demographics.
