 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flightless birds, including species such as the ostrich and emu (which belong to a bird group called the ratites), present a remarkable series of traits related to their loss of flight.  Such traits include shortening of the bones in the forelimbs, extreme increases or decreases in body size, loss of the breast bone to which the flight muscles attach, and many other modifications.  Moreover, recent research suggests that this suite of traits may have evolved multiple times within the ratites.  By studying the evolution of such traits and determining which regions of the genome likely underlie them, we can gain insight into how evolution occurs in parallel in the natural world.  We can also gain a better understanding of the types of genes that change when morphological traits are lost in the way they have been in the ratites.  Ultimately, a better understanding of links between genotype and phenotype can help us understand the genetic basis for variation in the human phenotype.  We expect that some human malformations, including the loss of digits, bones in the hand or forelimbs, likely occur because of mutations in some of the same genes or regulatory regions that underlie flightlessness in the ratites.  In fact, one way we will attempt to find the genetic underpinnings of flightlessness in the ratites is to examine the evolution of ratite genes that are known from previous studies to cause similar morphologies in laboratory mice.  Thus this study will forge important links between mutations known in developmental studies in the lab and natural variations we find in distantly related vertebrates. \r\n\r\nThis project will use comparisons among the genomes of flightless birds, in combination with morphological studies and phylogenetic methods, to understand the genomic basis of traits contributing to flightlessness.  Complete sequencing of the genomes of 8 ratite species will yield a robust genealogical tree of ratites and their relationships to the tinamous, a volant bird group closely related to, and likely embedded within, the ratites.  This tree will in turn permit identification of conserved regulatory regions occurring near genes known to contribute to limb loss in better-studied models for development, such as chickens and mice.  The timing of origin and loss of regulatory regions, such as conserved regions occurring outside of genes, will reveal important clues about the regulatory and genetic basis of trait evolution in flightless birds.  Previous phylogenetic work in the strongly suggests that flight likely was lost independently in multiple lineages of ratites in parallel.  This scenario will add statistical power to our inferences of the genomic underpinnings of morphological change, because it will allow us to identify genomic regions that have changed independently in flightless lineages.  Thus, this project will also elucidate how convergent morphological changes occur at the genomic level.  These themes will be used in a number of outreach activities, including an educational video, classroom teaching of undergraduates, and graduate student outreach in local K-12 schools.",
