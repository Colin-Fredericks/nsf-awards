 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) and the Polymers (POL) Programs, both in the Division of Materials Research (DMR), and by the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS).\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: Compact energy harvesters that collect energy from the environment and direct it to useful work can be advantageous in places where battery replacement is costly or not possible, for instance in sensors on bridges, in large chemical plants, or in electronic implants for the human body. The research team is working on a polymer-based device that is a key component of energy harvesters. This so-called \"ratchet\" device is capable of transforming electronic noise into stable direct current. The project addresses fundamental questions on the physics of organic semiconductors, organic chemistry, and material science. The project provides great opportunities to recruit and train undergraduate and graduate students with the involvement of more experienced post-doctoral researchers. The energy-harvesting theme is used to increase the awareness about energy waste and energy efficiency not only among the research community, but also among K-12 students via outreach programs. Young individuals are exposed to creative and innovative thinking about harvesting waste energy in smart appliances.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: There have been a number of attempts to create electronic ratchets. However, previously reported ratchets deliver low electrical current and voltage, have very complex fabrication procedure, and/or operate at cryogenic temperatures. The main goal of this project is to create a new electronic ratchet based on organic semiconductors that is simple to fabricate and able to achieve high power conversion efficiencies at room temperature. The research activity puts an emphasis on understanding the physical processes that govern the device operation in order to achieve higher performance and long-term stability. The team combines theory and computational models with materials synthesis, processing and electronic characterization such as scanning electrostatic force microscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, x-ray diffraction, electroabsorption, and radio-frequency engineering. The optimized ratchet device is tested within an actual energy harvester over a wide spectral range of electromagnetic radiation.",

One fascinating idea is to harvest the energy from electromagnetic waves in the environment since we are surrounded by a lot of electromagnetic radiation that is produced by mobile phones, WiFi, TV and radio stations, satellites, and other radio frequency communications. Originating from this idea, we invented a new low-cost electronic device named ionic-organic ratchet, which is capable of transforming AC noise into DC current using solution-processed conjugated polymers blended with organic salt. Figure 1(a) shows the structure of the device, which is composed of a Si<sup>++</sup>/SiO<sub>2</sub> substrate, gold electrodes (source and drain) and an active layer. Figure 1(b) demonstrates that this device can convert noisy AC signals applied between the source and gate electrodes to a constant DC current between source and drain.</p>\n<p>During the past three years, our research efforts have been directed towards an in-depth understanding of the working mechanism and device physics of this novel device. We have identified the working principle of this device, i.e., it works like a charge pump, pumping charges from source electrode to drain electrode, as shown in Figure 2(a). We presume that this phenomenon is realized by the appearance of a rectifying junction at the drain electrode of the device, which results from the accumulation of ions at the two electrodes. We confirmed the existence of this rectifying junction using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). To understand the physical processes in a working ratchet device, we also modeled the charge transport processes in the device using Monte Carlo simulation. This work was published in Advanced Materials (Adv Mater 2015, 27, 2007-2012).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we studied the physics that govern the short-circuit current (I<sub>sc</sub>) of the device, which can provide guidance to optimizing the performance of ratchets. It is found that trap density (q<sub>trap</sub>), mobility (&mu;), and the rectification ratio (RR) of the contacts all have direct influence on the short-circuit current (I<sub>sc</sub>). We developed a simplified equivalent circuit of this device and carried out device simulations (Figure 3(a)), by which we clarified how these factors affect the performance of ratchets. On the basis of our deep understanding of this device, we have been able to fabricate ratchets that can be driven by an AC signal with frequencies up to 13.56 MHz (industry standard frequency for radio frequency identification tags (RFIDs)), which is relevant for practical applications (Figure 3(c)). This work came out as a paper in Advanced Materials (Adv Mater 2017, 29, 1606464).</p>\n<p>We also developed low-cost ionic-organic ratchets, which is critical to practical applications. We proposed a method, unique in its simplicity and low cost, for the fabrication of flexible ionic-organic ratchets. In the low-cost ratchet, aluminum foil takes the place of a highly doped single crystal silicon substrate as the gate electrode and device substrate; adhesive tape replaces the SiO<sub>2</sub> dielectric layer, and finally, the graphite pencil drawn electrodes replace vacuum-deposited gold electrodes (Figure 4(a)). We have also shown that a simple modification of the device configuration allows significant expansion of the operational frequency range (Figure 4(c)). We published this work in Advanced Electronic Materials (Advanced Electronic Materials 2017, 2, 1500304).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Thuc-Quyen&nbsp;Nguyen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411349/1411349_10308504_1501538492422_PrimaryImage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411349/1411349_10308504_1501538492422_PrimaryImage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Primary Image\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411349/1411349_10308504_1501538492422_PrimaryImage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Primary Image\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ionic-organic ratchet rectifying AC signals</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thuc-Quyen Nguyen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thuc-Quyen&nbsp;Nguyen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Primary Image</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411349/1411349_10308504_1501538607735_Figure1(a)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411349/1411349_10308504_1501538607735_Figure1(a)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1411349/1411349_10308504_1501538607735_Figure1(a)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1 (a) The schematic diagram of the ionic-organic ratchet.
