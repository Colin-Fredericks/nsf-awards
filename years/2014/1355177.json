 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea slugs of the genus Sacoglossa exhibit an array of unusual traits that may confer an evolutionary advantage.  For example, some sea slugs species are 'solar-powered,' like plants, as they can harvest and sequester functional photosynthetic chloroplasts after feeding on algae. This kleptoplastic ability, along with other traits, may account for their high diversification rate and species richness.  In this project, the researchers will combine genetic, anatomic, ecological and developmental studies to describe over 100 new species of sea slugs. Modeling will then identify factors that determine how species are distributed, and what makes some sacoglossans more ecologically and evolutionary diverse than others. \r\n\r\nMarine biodiversity is increasingly threatened by human activities and climate change, yet actual biodiversity richness is not reflected by the scientific names in many groups, hampering conservation efforts. Anti-cancer compounds have been isolated from some saccoglossans, and others have served as biological control agents for invasive algae, but taxonomic uncertainty has limited the potential for their use in these roles.  To fully leverage an improved understanding of this biodiversity resource, this project will train the next generation of taxonomists at two Hispanic and predominantly undergraduate serving institutions and during an international workshop, develop web-based resources, and provide new insight into factors that govern diversity in marine ecosystems.",

Based on data collected during this project, a phylogenetic analysis of the causes and consequences of larval dispersal in sacoglossan sea slugs revealed that the prevailing theory of the past 40 years may be incorrect. Studies of the fossil record argued that short-range dispersal was a \"winning\" strategy in the long-term, causing a lineage to differentiate into many daughter species. However, our research shows that while shifts to short-dispersal larvae are often favored in the short term, over evolutionary timescales this strategy dooms most lineages to eventual extinction. Thus, the \"winners\" in our group, and likely in many invertebrate groups, are lineages that retain the potential for long-distance dispersal by long-lived larval stages. Additionally, this project increased the size of the available dataset to include 5 genes for 300 species of sacoglossans, which will be used to further test the evolutionary relationships among members of this group and to identify unnamed sub-groups. NSF supported work resulted in the publication of several monographic revisions of major groups of sacoglossans (e.g., <em>Oxynoe</em>, <em>Polybranchia</em>, Caulerpa-mimics, <em>Placida</em>), with two more nearly completed (Juliidae, <em>Cyerce</em>), including the description of numerous new species and a new genus. These monographs implemented procedures for integrative species delimitation in sacoglossans and the development of novel morphometrics tools in systematics of soft bodied and shelled animals.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts: This award has resulted in 4 M.S. student theses and research opportunities for 5 undergraduate students, including 7 underrepresented minorities.

In total, 13 students from 6 countries participated in the workshop, including El Salvador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Brazil, India and the US.&nbsp;A paper summarizing the total sea slug diversity of Bocas del Toro was published in Marine Biodiversity Records, including all participants as co-authors, as a field resource for the STRI station; this paper provides a baseline for ongoing studies of heterobranch distribution and diversity in the Caribbean.&nbsp;This project also stablished a synergistic relationships with Krug's lab (collaborative award NSF DEB-1355190) resulting in coss-training of additional students. Several cross-lab meetings, collaborative fieldwork and other interactions benefited students from both labs.
