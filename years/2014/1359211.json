 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award creates a new NSF REU site focused on climate change and sea level rise (SLR) within the Department of Ocean, Earth and Atmospheric Science (OEAS) at Old Dominion University (ODU), in Norfolk, VA. ODU is located in a coastal urban environment that is directly affected by coastal flooding and hazards.  The PI's will bring 10 students to OEAS each summer for two years to complete a 10 week REU program.  Students will be engaged in research projects in the laboratories of their mentors. To garner a broader understanding of climate science and SLR, students will be informed with lectures from each mentor on their respective research related to urban climate change and SLR and a variety of lab tours and field trips. The PI's will also conduct tutorials on: 1) keeping a proper laboratory notebook, 2) writing a research prospectus, 3) critically reading journal articles, 4) creating effective presentations, and 5) delivering oral and written (e.g., poster) scientific presentations. Students will present their research in a final paper and a symposium.",
