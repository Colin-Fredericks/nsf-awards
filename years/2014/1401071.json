The FC conference is prestigious, and the students' work will stand alongside some of the most impactful research in the field. FC's research agenda includes SaTC's Trustworthy Computing System Perspective and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Perspective. The nature and inspiration of the field encompasses at its foundations the invention of cryptographic means to support social protocols such as contracts, exchange, and information intimacy.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the proposed activity is to sustain and expand the vibrancy of Financial Cryptography research, and research of allied fields, by connecting promising young students of the field to the research community. Their presence at the Financial Cryptography conference will establish relationships that will continue for decades, and guide the young researchers' careers.",
