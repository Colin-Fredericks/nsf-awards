 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phenology - the seasonal timing of biological events - is one of the most important organismal responses to climate change. For annual plant species, the seasonal timing of seed germination and flowering is crucial. Germination and flowering time interact to determine patterns of growth, flowering and seed set. Thus, an integrated life-cycle model that includes these events and their interactions is necessary for predicting under natural conditions each phenological transition, the overall life cycle, and the persistence of effects of environmental perturbations. Using the abundant genetic information on the molecular-genetic basis of flowering and germination in Arabidopsis thaliana, this project will develop integrated life-history models to predict genotype-specific performance across a geographic range with different climatic scenarios. These predictions will be tested using unique genetic material of different combinations of germination and flowering alleles in seasonally contrasting field sites.  \r\n\r\nThis work directly pertains to predicting plant responses to climate change. It aims to predict germination timing and synchrony under various climatic conditions, which is of direct interest in agricultural settings. The model will also predict how changes in germination timing affect reproductive timing and yield, which is important for predicting responses of crop species as well as the weeds that grow with them. Finally, it uses genotypes containing candidate genetic loci for dormancy manipulations to assess how those genes will respond to altered climates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: Changes in phenology- the timing of biological events - are a commonly observed and important organismal response to climate change.  For annual plant species, the seasonal timing of seed germination and flowering are both crucial for reproductive success and depend upon one another.  The timing of germination strongly influences flowering time, and flowering time determines the timing of seed maturation, which in turn influences germination timing.  Thus, to predict how annual plant phenology will respond and evolve under climate change it is necessary to consider how the genes influencing germination and flowering time interact across the life cycle.  The goals of this project (in collaboration with Kathleen Donohue\u00c6s group at Duke University) were 1) to develop a genetically informed integrated model of annual plant phenology across the life cycle and 2) to examine how natural variants of genes affecting germination and flowering time interact to affect phenology and plant performance in natural and experimental environments.  \n\nTo address these goals, the research team used the model annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana (a close relative of Brassica crops such as mustard, kale, and broccoli).
