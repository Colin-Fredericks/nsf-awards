This Gordon Research Conference on the Neurobiology of Cognition should help bridge the gap, at the very least by identifying the avenues for connection that have the most potential for near-term traction and by linking scientist from disparate fields. \r\n\r\nThe conference will take place in Newry, ME on July 20-25, 2014. The emphasis of the workshop is to facilitate in-depth discussion between scientists working in divergent fields whose integration is essential to understanding the neurobiology of cognition. NSF support will enable graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to participate in this high-profile workshop and will allow early stage investigators (non-tenured) to attend as speakers and full participants.",
