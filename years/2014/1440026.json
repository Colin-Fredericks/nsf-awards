 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells are the building blocks of life, yet they are themselves a\r\ncollection of proteins, small molecules, and solvent, none of which\r\nare, in and of themselves, alive. How living things can arise from the\r\n\"behavior\" of molecules, which are simply obeying the laws of physics,\r\nis the essential conundrum of modern biology. The rise of scientific\r\nsupercomputing has offered the chance to study living systems at the\r\nlevels of atoms, cells, and all levels in between.\u00a0\u00a0With Blue Waters,\r\nit is now possible to take the most critical step from inanimate to\r\nanimate matter by describing assembly and cooperation of thousands of\r\nmacromolecules made of billions of atoms.\u00a0\u00a0The ability to explore\r\nliving systems via the \"computational microscope\" of molecular\r\ndynamics simulations has a profound impact not only on the progress of\r\nbasic science, but also in the treatment of disease and the\r\ndevelopment of drugs.\r\n\r\nThis project will use Blue Waters to study three types of biomolecular\r\nsystems: the microtubules that make up the cell's cytoskeleton, the\r\nchemosensory array that acts as a \"bacterial brain\", and two highly\r\nrelevant retroviruses: HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and RSV\r\n(Rous sarcoma virus).\u00a0\u00a0The first project will model microtubules, in\r\ntheir native form, as well as the interactions between the\r\nmicrotubule, its regulatory partners, and anti-cancer agents.\r\nSimulations of the microtubule and its interactions with drugs can\r\nhelp drive the development of new microtubule-attacking cancer\r\ntherapies.\u00a0\u00a0The HIV part of the virus project builds on prior success\r\nin modeling the full HIV capsid to evaluate the effects of HIV drugs\r\non capsid stability and to model the essential interactions between\r\nthe capsid and host cell factors. Simulations of the HIV capsid\r\nprovide the necessary detailed knowledge of the vital infection\r\nprocess to develop new HIV therapies.\u00a0\u00a0The RSV part of the virus\r\nproject has constructed the first model of an intermediate stage in\r\nvirus capsid maturation, which will be used to describe the maturation\r\nprocess of retroviruses may open the doors to a new type of anti-viral\r\ndrug which attacks that maturation process.\u00a0\u00a0The chemosensory array\r\nproject seeks to answer how input from many chemical sensors on the\r\nbacterial surface are transduced across hundreds of nanometers in the\r\narray, leading the cell to decide if it should continue swimming or\r\nchange direction, to adapt to changing environments.\u00a0\u00a0The chemosensory\r\narray is a universal structure in bacteria, but absent in eukaryotes,\r\noffering a new target for antibiotic drugs - a desperately needed\r\nadvancement in combating bacterial resistance to current antibiotics.\r\nEach of the projects proposed presents an opportunity for petascale\r\ncomputing to contribute to mankind?s health and to answer one of\r\nmankind's oldest questions: \"What is life?\"",
