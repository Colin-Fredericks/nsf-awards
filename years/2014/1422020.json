This project supports the travel, conference, and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Student Research Workshop, held in conjunction with the ACL conference on June 23-25, 2014 in Baltimore. The workshop consists of two tracks: full paper presentations and poster presentations. All selected work has only student authors. The full paper sessions are composed of paper presentations followed by a discussion panel led by respected researchers in the field. The workshop is organized and run by students.\r\n\r\nThe Student Research Workshop provides a valuable opportunity for the next generation of researchers to enter the computational linguistics community. It allows the best students in the field to receive critical feedback on their work from external experts and to forge contacts with other students and senior researchers. The organizers also pair each participant with a senior researcher to provide specific feedback on the students' research.  The students who select papers for the workshop  and plan the sessions also gain valuable opportunities for professional growth and interaction with the researchers on the organizing committee of the main conference. The workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a skilled and diverse computational linguistics and natural language processing research community.",
