Kevin Boyce1 & Maciej A Zwieniecki2 (PIs)\r\n1.-Department of Geophysical Sciences, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.\r\n2. Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, Cambridge, MA 02138.\r\n\r\nDetached leaves are among the most common of plant macrofossils.  Because leaves are the primary interface between plant and environment, fossil leaf morphology has been widely proven to be a valuable source of information regarding past climates and atmospheric compositions.  From the leaf's perspective, however, the plant to which the leaf is attached is as much a part of its environment as regional climate.  Thus, fossil leaves may also preserve an untapped wealth of information concerning the habit and ecology of the parent plant as well as the vegetation structure of the landscape.  \r\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop anatomical proxies for interpreting three parameters of whole-plant ecophysiology from leaf fossils using the emerging mechanistic understanding of how leaf structure and physiology are linked.  1) Plant habit -tall tree or low shrub- is provided from variance in vein density between leaf compressions with similar total vein number.  2) Adaptation to water vapor pressure deficit -a sunny, exposed environment or a shaded, understory environment- is provided by the ratio of the vein-vein and vein-leaf surface distances in anatomically preserved leaf fossils.  3) Carbon assimilation and transpiration capacities are provided by the density of veins per leaf surface area in leaf compressions.  These tools will be established with a phylogenetically and ecologically diverse series of field-based measurements in both tropical and temperate forests, as well as greenhouse and growth chamber experiments to simulate conditions that no longer exist in the modern world.  First applications will focus on the ecophysiology of key fossils during the Cretaceous/Early Cenozoic diversification of flowering plants and the late Paleozoic diversification of seed plants - key topics in their own right, but also important for the introduction of these techniques to the larger paleontological community.\r\nA crucial point is that the proxies are based in understood physiological mechanisms, not just in statistical correlations.  Thus, they will be available to all paleontologists interested in any period of plant evolution from the first leaves and forests in the Devonian through to the Recent.  These tools will aid reconstruction of fossils and understanding of the evolution of physiology and ecology.  More broadly, this work will provide a new approach for constraining past climates and the carbon and hydrological cycles of deep time.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this grant was to develop mechanistically explicit proxies for original ecophysiology from leaf fossil anatomy and, in the original proposal, we were explicit that our work could only be deemed successful if adopted by the wider botanical and paleontological community.  Our use of leaf vein density as an indicator of transpiration and photosynthetic capacity has now become a standard metric that is widely used and the first outside publications are now appearing adopting our use of the relationship of the distance between veins to the distance from vein to leaf surface as an indicator of the plant\u00c6s capacity to tolerate exposed conditions with significant vapor pressure deficit. \n\n \n\nExploration of these new metrics for fossil and living leaf venation also led to the recognition of important and unexpected evolutionary patterns.  First, modeling of photosynthesis under different CO2 regimes indicates that the pattern seen in the fossil record of consistent low vein densities in all plants throughout time outside of flowering plant evolution indicates that the only available explanation is that productivity of non-angiosperms has always been consistently low with wide ranging implications for the evolution of plant architecture and ecology and for terrestrial ecosystems and the Carbon cycle as a whole.  This work has also led to an ongoing reconsideration of stomata function through time using the fossil record, living plants, and lab studies on synthetic idealized leaves in order to understand the basic physical mechanisms involved in complex paleontological patterns.  Other directions inspired by the result of low productivity prior to angiosperm evolution have included consideration of how angiosperm evolution may or may not have changed marine systems via nutrient run-off and whether traditional assumptions regarding rapid growth in Carboniferous lycopsid trees could be tenable with important implications for their overall biology.  Second, more derived flowering plants were found to be uniformly well adapted for vapor pressure deficit&mdash;even in those plants of sheltered conditions that would be more permissive of less optimal vein networks&mdash;while basal lineages of flowering plants had uniformly poor adaptation to exposed environments more akin to the ferns.  This result both highlights how unusual and different the vegetative biology of flowering plants is compared to all other plants and speaks to their early evolution.  Only two basic strategies are available among most non-angiosperms: thin leaves where sheltered environments are more permissive of poorly optimized leaves, as in ferns, and thick leaves in more exposed environments that require optimization, as in most gymnosperm seed plants. Thick leaves have little gas exchange potential, limiting photosynthesis even in full sun.  The thin leaves of ferns could, in theory, provide high gas exchange potential, but also limits them to sheltered and shaded environments where little photosynthesis is possible.  In a basic sense, the uniquely high productivity of flowering plants has been founded on their unique capacity to export thin leaves from the shadows to the exposed top of the canopy where high productivity is possible.\n\n \n\nA third approach to leaf fossils&mdash;using leaf size in conjunction with vein density and vein number to indicate forest canopy structure&mdash;does respond mechanistically as expected.  However, multiple situations can generate similar patterns and it has proven unlikely to provide a unique answer for a given set of fossil leaf bed characteristics.  As an alternative, we have begun exploration of an alternative route to the same information regarding forest structure: the link of wing shape and size in wind-dispersed seeds to dispersal behavior coupled with the distribution of dispersal behaviors across different types of vegetation.
