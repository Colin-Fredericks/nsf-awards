 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyprinodontiformes, commonly known as splitfins, are a diverse order of teleost fishes consisting of 10 families, and more than 800 globally distributed species.  The group includes killifishes, guppies, and swordtails, and is well known among aquarium hobbyists, toxicologists, and as a model organism in cancer research. Goodeids are an imperiled group of freshwater fishes that occur in Mexico and the Southwestern United States and consist of two main lines of diversification; a depauperate group of egg laying species, and a speciose group that bear live offspring. Many groups in the order, including the viviparous (live birthing) species, are understudied from an ecological and evolutionary perspective.The evolutionary relationships of groups within the order are unclear and the relationships of the species and genera within the Goodeidae family have not been adequately studied. The lack of a robust family tree has impeded both basic and applied research on the splitfins. Resolving the evolutionary relationships within the Cyprinodontiformes, as well as within the Goodeidae species, will advance our understanding of life-history evolution, morphological diversification, taxonomy, and conservation.  The researchers will write a handbook for aquarists and conservation biologists containing recommendations for maintenance and breeding guidelines for maintaining genetic and phenotypic diversity of goodeids in captivity. The researchers will work with the Goodeid Working Group to update the Goodeidae conservation status and trends information as well as contribute to aquarist-oriented publications and conventions to promote appropriate captive Goodeidae rearing.  These efforts will enhance conservation efforts of these fishes which are critical to resource managers especially considering the ongoing environmental changes in the areas occupied by the Goodeidae.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis integrative project will involve multiple graduate and undergraduate students, international and United States collaborators, and citizen scientists.  Specimens will be collected in the United States and Latin America and the vouchered tissue samples, which are important for future studies, will be deposited in research collections in the United States and Mexico. Citizen scientists will provide pedigreed larval specimens of all species of Goodeidae. These are historically difficult to obtain and will be used for scanning electron microscopic examination of trophotaeniae, a poorly understudied larval taxonomic character that is critical to the unusual live births in this group. This study will result in the construction of phylogenetic trees for the Cyprinodontiformes and the Goodeidae based on traditional (10 loci, and >7,000bp sequence data) and next generation sequencing approaches (anchored phylogenomics), offering the most comprehensive tests of previous phylogenetic hypotheses for these groups.  The incorporation of geometric morphometric and trophotaenial data, fossil calibrations, and phylogenetic comparative methods will allow for a better understanding of the timing of diversification and the factors that have played a role in radiation of this interesting group of fishes.  Finally, the research will assess changes in Goodeidae abundance and distribution, based on museum records and field sampling.",

Goodeids have an intriguing suite of features, which make them worthy of study from a diversification and radiation perspective. The Goodeinae display substantial disparity in ecologies, morphologies, and species richness in comparison to the Great Basin representatives of the family. These features suggest differences in diversification dynamics among the two main lineages of goodeid diversification (Goodeinae vs. Empetrichthynae) and geographic areas. Therefore, the major goal of this study was to investigate the diversification of this family, one of the most imperiled groups of freshwater fishes in the world. To address this, samples of all goodeid species and other closely related species of Cyprinodontiformes were obtained via fieldwork and through collaborations with colleagues. A targeted next-generation sequencing approach (anchored hybrid enrichment) was used to construct a data-rich phylogeny for the Order Cyprinodontiformes to better understand the phylogenetic position of the goodeids within the order. The results, based on &gt;100 loci, indicate that the familial level relationships within the order are not entirely in agreement with previous molecular and morphological studies. Next, both Sanger and next-generation sequences were gathered to investigate the phylogenetic relationships among the species and genera of goodeid fishes. Both phylogenies differ from previous mitochondrially based phylogenies of the group. Furthermore, the phylogenetic utility of two sets of commonly used legacy markers used in fishes was examined using the Goodeidae as an exemplar. The results of these analyses underscores the importance of quantifying phylogenetic information content as a fundamental step towards eroding false confidence in results based on weak and biased evidence. Next, body shape variation also was assessed for all species of goodeids coupled with morphological rate analyses. The results indicated that the Goodeinae have greatly elevated rates of morphological variation relative to the Empetrichthyinae. These results suggest that the Goodeinae diversified via an ecological opportunity scenario along habitat, rather than trophic axes as observed in many other groups. Next, scanning electron microscopy was used to examine surface features of the trophotaenia, a larval feature that has been important in higher-level taxonomy of the group. These results indicate that there is a greater degree of variation than was previously known and that this character does not seem to be taxonomically informative. Finally, the conservation status of species of Goodeinae (40 species) were reviewed and assessed. This portion of the study indicated that over half of the species should be recognized as endangered/critically endangered. This information is invaluable to resource managers and conservationists, especially considering the substantial levels of environmental degradation and species introductions in the region. These results further support the idea that goodeids are one of the most imperiled groups of freshwater fishes in the world. Over the course of this project, multiple master?s level graduate and undergraduate students received training in phylogenomics, comparative phylogenetic analyses, and general ichthyology including many first generation college students. More than 25 public presentations resulted from this project, and multiple publications involving students and project collaborators have been published. Much of the data from this study has been deposited on Genbank and Dryad repositories, thereby making the data available to the general public. The Citizen Science component of this study involved the Goodeid Working Group (GWG), an organization of aquarium hobbyists and scientific professionals, who provided difficult to obtain larval specimens of many species with known pedigrees for quantification of trophotaenial characters. The PI and project collaborators met with GWG members at several funded workshops focusing on goodeid fishes to exchange ideas and discuss collaborations.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
