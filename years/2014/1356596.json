 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Hawaii at Hilo seeks to establish a scholarship program for 19 economically disadvantaged students who intend to major in astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, marine science, mathematics, or physics.  The goal of the proposal is to recruit local Hawaii students as well as students from the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands (Samoa and Micronesia) and retain them in these targeted STEM fields through graduation. The following support services are planned for the participants: (a) a summer Bridge Program prior to the freshman year, (b) faculty mentoring, (c) peer-tutoring for introductory STEM courses, (d) summer and academic year research support on campus, (e) opportunities for research internships, (f) advising and support to participate in summer research programs at US mainland universities, and (g) community service in which students provide math and science tutoring for K-12 students. Some of the program activities operate in conjunction with, but expand upon, current university programs, such as the Keaholoa STEM Scholars Program (supported under the NSF Tribal Colleges and Universities Program), while other activities are new initiatives.\r\n\r\nData generated through assessment and evaluation supports the rationale that institutionalizing initiatives that provide students with a supportive community motivate them to become self-identified scientists who are retained through graduation.  Formative and summative evaluation focuses on determining which support strategies are most effective and which can be improved in relation to four areas (a) recruitment and retention, (b) student support activities, (c) research opportunities and internships, and (d) STEM careers/graduate education.  Data collection methodologies include mixed methods, including faculty and student participant surveys, interviews and observations.   Dissemination occurs through annual professional society meetings and peer-reviewed education journals such as the Journal of College Science Teaching. Project deliverables include results of summative evaluation and the activities developed within the project.",

Our specific goal was to recruit and support 30 students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds who intend to major in Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geology, Marine Science, Mathematics and Physics.</p>\n<p>Our applicant recruitment campaign included distribution of S-STEM scholarship information to the high schools and to the broader community in the state through presentations, flyers, print-ads in local newspapers, radio ads, social media, and the project website. The campaign yielded a total of 173 program applicants. 47 did not meet the financial need criteria, resulting in a pool of 126 applicants. Based on the academic eligibility requirements, the S-STEM selection committee awarded a total of 64 S-STEM scholarships over the project period. This outcome far exceeded the program goal of awarding 30 scholarships.</p>\n<p>Of the 64 students who were awarded STEM scholarship throughout the life of the project, 77.55% had been retained in the S-STEM program until 2020. Despite the devastating effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced so many students to leave school, by the end of the project 40 (64.5%) of our students have graduated or are within a year of graduation. 34 scholarship recipients (53.13%) have graduated with a STEM degree and 6 (9.38%) changed majors, but successfully graduated from UH-Hilo.

Through professional development workshops, STEM seminars on campus, support for attending regional STEM conferences, various pre-career experiences like internships, Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs at UH Hilo and in other institutions nationwide, part-time jobs and volunteer experiences, and personalized guidance in applying to graduate programs and the work force, the program helped prepare our students for success after graduation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the enhanced academic services that our program developed, we provided extensive personalized mentorship and success coaching to our scholars. As a result, (by data provided by our survey in the end of the project, of the 32 student responses): 13 (43.3%) received summer internships, 8 (26.7%) participated in a summer REU, 27 (84.4%) received another form of financial support including scholarships, grants, work study funds, 20 (62.5%) participated in volunteer projects, 15 (48.4%) attended or presented at STEM conferences, 3 (9.9%) have completed Study Abroad programs, 23 (76.7%) received some awards, honors and recognitions, 6 (19.8%) were accepted in the <em>UHH STEM Honors program</em>, 9 (29.7%) have been accepted in graduate schools,1 (3.3%) travelled the world with the <em>Semester at Sea</em> program, and 1 (3.3%) started his own company.</p>\n<p>In addition, <em>two</em> of our scholars (Native Hawaiians) have graduated from one of the <em>world most prestigious programs in Mathematics for undergraduates</em>, held in Europe, the \"Semester in Mathematics in Budapest\".
