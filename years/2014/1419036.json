The conference will advance strategies for how science can support decision-making related to climate change and the built environment, agriculture and natural resources.  Topics will include mitigation solutions to minimize the consequences of climate change and adaptation solutions for those consequences that cannot be avoided.  Over 1,200 participants from higher education institutions, government, civil society organizations, research and policy organizations, business, international organizations are coming together to work across traditional boundaries to connect science to decision-making. The conference will emphasize putting ideas into action by creating opportunities for participating scientists to share the results of their research and receive feedback on how they can more effectively advance knowledge that supports decision-making. These interactions will strengthen the connection between science and societal needs and achieves impact by engaging partnering organizations who will connect science to decision-making through specific new and ongoing initiatives, to be implemented and carried forward following the conference. The conference program will feature 11 keynote addresses, 7 plenary sessions, 30 symposia and 24 interactive breakout workshops. Over 200 distinguished thought leaders, scientists, government officials; policy experts and international authorities will speak over the course of the three-day event.",
