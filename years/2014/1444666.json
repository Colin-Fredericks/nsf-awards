 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Big Data\" has emerged as a new approach to computing that is transforming science, engineering, medicine, health care, finance, business, and ultimately society itself. The IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2014 (IEEE BigData 2014) provides a leadin forum for disseminating the latest research in big data research, development, and applications. The conference will take place in the Washington, D.C. area from October 27-30, 2014 in Washington, D.C. The PC co-chairs are Jimmy Lin (University of Maryland) and Jian Pei (Simon Fraser University). This award will help support travel of Ph.D. students at U.S. universities who are primary authors on full papers that have been accepted to the technical program or are participating in the doctoral student symposium.\r\n\r\nThis conference solicits high-quality original research papers in any aspect of big data, including infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and applications. Contributions will advance the state of the art in techniques, algorithms, and systems.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the conference homepage: http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2014/",
