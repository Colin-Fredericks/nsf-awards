 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a three year standard collaborative award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at the University of Dayton (UD), Central State University (CSU), and Wright State University (WSU) entitled, \"Collaborative Research: Collaborative RET Site-Inspiring Next Generation High-skilled Workforce in Advanced Manufacturing and Materials\", under the direction of Dr. Margaret Pinnell, Dr. Leanne Petry, and Dr. Ahsan Mian. The University of Dayton will serve as the lead institution on this collaborative Site.   \r\n\r\nThe new era of manufacturing will require highly skilled STEM professionals. As such, educators need to inspire youth to pursue STEM disciplines. This collaborative RET Site will leverage and sustain a prior UD RET Site and provide a total of 54 in-service and pre-service middle and high school STEM teachers, 18 per year over three years, with an intensive and transformative six week real world research experience that is thematically centered on materials and advanced manufacturing, a regional strength and economic cluster. The Site will facilitate this immersion by placing teachers  teachers with research mentors at one of the three participating universities to work on projects that connect with regional strengths in advanced manufacturing and materials. The RET experience will be enhanced through a materials boot camp, industry and laboratory tours and extensive interaction with a wide variety of STEM professionals through the Dayton Regional Stem Center (DRSC).    \r\n\r\nThe Site will target teachers from Ohio Region 10 districts eligible for School Improvement Support, and from partner schools (Dayton Early College Academy (DECA) and Dayton Regional STEM School (DRSS). After participation in this RET, teachers will continue their professional development through ongoing engagement with the PIs at all three institutions and the DRSC and will be prepared for leadership roles in their K-12 setting.  Participants will achieve long-term collaborative partnerships with the university research community, engineering professionals, and the DRSC. \r\n\r\nThe project will have a significant impact on the Dayton area and the engineering community nationwide by promoting engineering in K-12 STEM curriculum and recruiting teachers from high-needs and urban schools. It will also strengthen regional partnerships and collaborative relationships that support both STEM education at all levels and advanced manufacturing and materials development.",

Wright State University (WSU), Central State University (CSU), and University of Dayton (UD) collaborated on this project to provide current and future middle and high school (G6-12) teachers with the experience and skills required to successfully engage their students in STEM by providing real world engineering research in advanced materials and advanced manufacturing. The program had nine objectives that were met or exceeded successfully.&nbsp; The evaluation efforts were based on participant reflections, pre- and post-program Local Systemic Change (LSC) surveys, participation in academic year follow-up activities, as well as data collection and reflection during the follow-up academic year. The evidence collected regarding the nine objectives and full evaluation results collected and analyzed for the entire three-year collaborative program are published in journal and conference proceedings.&nbsp; The nine objectives and their outcomes are</p>\n<p>Objectives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Teach engineering concepts to over 1,000 PK-12 students over the project period, including </li>\n<li>Develop inquiry- and team-based STEM curriculum and innovative pedagogy to encourage interest in STEM and, in particular, engineering</li>\n<li>Disseminate curriculum deliverables through the Teach Engineering digital library, and professional development workshops such as the STEM Think Tank</li>\n<li>Have their STEM interest sparked by using modern engineering tools and gaining new knowledge of engineering careers</li>\n<li>Understand the social relevance and ethical implications of engineering activities related to manufacturing (human rights, environmental impact, etc.)</li>\n<li>Share knowledge, ideas and concepts working on teams with professional and pre-service teachers, research mentors and industry partners</li>\n<li>Acquire collaboration and networking possibilities through interaction with real-world engineering industry and government mentors and partners.</li>\n<li>Attain leadership roles in K12 setting through the RET program&rsquo;s professional development component.</li>\n<li>Achieve long-term collaborative partnerships with the regional university research community, and engineering professionals through substantial follow up activities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;Specific Outcomes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In three project years, a total 36 in-service teachers were selected from approximately 75 applicants from different schools including urban, rural and suburban public, private and charter schools and one career technology center. <em>In year 1,</em> participants represented twelve different rural, urban and suburban Grade 5-12 schools. These schools have a percentage of students on free/reduced lunch that ranges from 4.3% to 100% and a non-white population that ranges from less than 1% to greater than 95%. More targeted recruiting was done for the years 2 and 3 cohorts to increase the impact to minority serving schools. In year 2, the majority of schools participating in cohort 2 had 14% or fewer nonwhites and less than 40% considered to be from economically disadvantaged districts. In year 3, participants represented the following Grade K-12 schools: the majority of schools had over 50% non-whites and over 80% economically disadvantaged. The program impacted estimated 1800-2400 G6-12 students.</li>\n<li>Participants worked in groups to do hands-on research at three universities. Through this, the RET participants had a chance to work with undergraduate and graduate students</li>\n<li>Participants worked in groups to develop curriculum using the TeachEngineering framework that included inquiry-based content and incorporated use of activities that helped in structuring class time, that facilitated student engagement, and that integrated application of prior learned content to solve higher level problems. TeachEngineering identified the curriculum developed through this RET program as highly innovative. A total of 15 STEM curricular units were developed and piloted in three years. Several curricular units are published in TeachEngineering website.<sup> </sup>&nbsp;Examples of curricular units developed include: Doghouse Design (Grades 4-5), Can You Hear Me Now? (Grade 8-10), Out-of-the Box: A Furniture Design + Engineering Challenge (Grade 8-10), and Cell Phone Packaging Design (Grade 8-10). </li>\n<li>The results from this RET program were disseminated through conference presentations and proceedings (e.g. ASEE, ASME, DESS, conferences), professional development sessions, and TeachEngineering digital library. In additional to the TeachEngineering publications, the team published one journal, six conference proceedings, and gave fourteen presentations at national and international conferences, and two invited talks.</li>\n<li>Participants had the opportunity to interact and network with professionals from different fields throughout industry tours and guest lecture seminars. Through these interactions, they learned about various applications of engineering, the different types of job opportunities available for students, and the criteria and qualities that recruiters look for when hiring for the jobs. The guest speakers were described as engaging and informative.</li>\n<li>The RET program help create sustained relationships between college and school campuses. Specifically, WSU RET team members visited at least 18 schools and hosted 15 student groups at WSU campus to promote the concepts of materials and advanced manufacturing. Also, in the last three years, the undergraduate enrollment in the Materials Science and Engineering program of WSU has almost doubled.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ahsan&nbsp;Mian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170032214_intheWSUnews--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170032214_intheWSUnews--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"RET in the WSU news\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170032214_intheWSUnews--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"RET in the WSU news\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RET activities covered in the WSU news</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">WSU</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ahsan&nbsp;Mian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">RET in the WSU news</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170130542_RETASEEpaper2017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170130542_RETASEEpaper2017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"RET ASEE paper\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170130542_RETASEEpaper2017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"RET ASEE paper\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RET paper presented and published in ASEE 2017 conference</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RET team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ahsan&nbsp;Mian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">RET ASEE paper</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170292543_RETposter2015--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170292543_RETposter2015--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"RET research poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170292543_RETposter2015--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"RET research poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">RET research poster created and presented by an RET team</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RET team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ahsan&nbsp;Mian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">RET research poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170461185_REU-RETposter2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170461185_REU-RETposter2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"RET REU research poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1405950/1405950_10301943_1533170461185_REU-RETposter2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"RET REU research poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research poster created and presented by REU students based on RET-REU research</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">RET team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ahsan&nbsp;Mian</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">RET REU research poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
