It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the researcher's home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences.\r\n\r\nThe research initiation project from Alabama A&M University (AAMU) will overhaul undergraduate student instruction in six existing fish and wildlife courses that compose a concentration area in an accredited forestry program at a historically black university to improve performance on student learning outcomes. Course content will become substantial portions of learning modules to be designed and made available on Blackboard Learn\u00ae, an on-line instructional support program.  Class time will consist of performing quantitative and written assignments. Specific activities include making all lecture notes and assignments available on-line and developing, or expanding existing, quantitative homework assignments into lab experiments and field exercises requiring technically written research reports. \r\n\r\nThese activities constitute an evaluation of the merits of a relatively new teaching pedagogy (inverting the classroom) designed to increase performance on existing student learning outcomes related to achievement of quantitative and communication competencies. Experiential learning has the potential to improve quantitative problem solving and communication competencies to increase undergraduate success in wildlife biology.  \r\n\r\nThe activities will likely improve student learning outcomes in existing academic programs (minors) in Fisheries and Wildlife Biology disciplines where minority participation is extremely low (less than 1%).  As an NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdiction, this project broadens participation geographically as well as through efforts to attract and retain underrepresented minority students in biological and ecological sciences. The project leverages previous investments in course development and improvement from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Project outcomes will be disseminated broadly.",

A majority of society wishes to see its natural resources managed for conservation and wise use. The training of scientists and managers to promote protection of fish and wildlife and their habitats occurs primarily in the nation's land grant colleges, including Albama A&amp;M University (AAMU). AAMU is a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) with a fish and wildlife training program attached to its professionally-accredited forestry program.

Instead the courses were more like field and laboratory exercises that directly involved the students in using the course information that was provided on-line to collect original data on actual animals and their habitats. The students then analyzed the data in class and prepared a written report that was structured like a scientific article that would be used to share their findings with the scientific community and the public. Assessment of their learning outcomes showed substantial improvement in both their writing and mathematical skills after the class format was overhauled.

Student projects included diet analysis of river otters, building and maintaining an aquaculture-aquaponics system in the campus greenhouse, wildlife inventory for rare species of small mammals including bats, capture and measurement of stream fishes and their habitats, as well as investigating the impact of prescribed burning on wild hog use of forests.

Our students enjoyed interacting with these groups to spread the message of wildlife conservation and motivate students to study in scientific disciplines. Most of our students are minorities and women, thus demonstrating that these resources belong to all US citizens and motivating youth from diverse backgrounds to pursue scientific
