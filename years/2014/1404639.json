 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nPolymer brush-molecules are long molecular chains attached to surfaces.  Such structures are important in numerous technological applications, such as low-friction coatings.  Polymer brushes are typically anchored to the substrate via a chemical bond to increase their stability.  This project will be a systematic study addressing the role of polymer length, number of polymer molecules per unit area, and distribution of localized electrical charges along the molecules on brush stability and attachment.  It will be carried out using specimens that feature gradual and continuous variation of the aforementioned molecular brush attributes.  A new method will be introduced that enables removal of molecular polymer brushes from technologically important substartes such as silicon dioxide by selectively breaking the silicon-oxygen bond that holds the macromolecule attached to the substrate.  The scientific aspect of the proposed work will be complemented with outreach and education activities.  They include  i) training graduate students,  ii) conducting educational outreach activities at an elementary school,  iii) attracting women, underrepresented minorities, and local K-12 teachers to take part in research activities in coordination with NC State's Science House and Engineering House programs and the Triangle MRSEC Program, and  iv) organizing national and international scientific meetings in soft materials for students and faculty in the Research Triangle region.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe principal goal of this project is to gain detailed understanding of the stability of neutral and charged polymer brushes as a function of molecular weight, grafting density (i.e., number of polymer grafts per unit area), and charge density (for polyelectrolyte brushes) on solid surfaces.  Degrafting of polyelectrolyte brushes from underlying substrates will be studied systematically, addressing the role of molecular weight, grafting density, and spatial distribution of charges (as well as their mutual interplay) on the brush stability using combinatorial assembly methods.  Comprehending the role of charge distribution along macromolecular grafts and its interplay with molecular weight and density of the grafts is important for many applications utilizing charged polymer brushes.  \"On-demand\" chemical degrafting methods will be introduced and employed to characterize the properties of polymeric grafts (i.e., molecular weight, grafting density, and chemical structure of brushes prepared by post-polymerization modification) synthesized by \"grafting from\" polymerization.  In combination with selective analytical methods complete information about the graft molecular weight and chemical structure will be obtained.  New patterning methods will enable the formation of complex chemical patterns with adjustable compositional variation across pattern boundaries.  The latter strategy not only offers the ability to characterize fully the attributes of polymers grown via \"grafting from\" polymerization, but also paves the way towards generating complex chemical patterns with tailored spatial distribution of chemical heterogeneities on surfaces.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAssemblies of long chain macromolecules anchor to an underlying substrate and enhance functionality to the parent substrate.  Examples include: improved biocompatility, reduced friction, tailored wettability for various liquids, improved adhesion, and many others.  These properties are governed by the chemical composition of the building blocks, which constitute the polymer, the length of the polymers, and the areal density of the grafts on the substrate.  Traditionally such systems, often referred to as polymer brushes, have been considered to be stable because the polymers have been anchored to the substrates via covalent links.  In some instances polymer may detach/degraft from substrates, however.  In our work we identified the conditions under which this detachment takes place.  We have confirmed that neutral polymer brushes remain attached to the underlying support when exposed to good solvents.  However, adding charges, either permanent or generated by pH, to the grafted macromolecules increased the tendency of the polymeric grafts to break the covalent linkage that held them attached to the substrate.  Specifically, increasing the density of charges caused the polymers swell and expand when exposed to aqueous solutions.  Due of the presence of neighboring grafts on the substrate, the chains extended into the direction away from the substrate, which, in turn, created tension that was focused at the bottom-most section of the polymer brush close to the substrate.  When the tension acting over a small distance exceeded a certain critical energy of the liable bonds present in the head-group of the brush, the polymers broke off and were liberated from the substrate.  We established a number of effects that contribute to this degrafting behavior, including, the density (and location) of charges in the polymer, the areal density of polymers on the substrate, and the pH of surrounding solution that regulated the stability of the weak linkages in the polymer head group (i.e., presence of hydrolysable ester bonds or Si-O bonds).  We documented that polymer brush stability can be enhanced by protecting the head group chemistries through the presence of a hydrophobic block in the brush close to the substrate; this block collapsed in aqueous solutions and shielded the head group.  We have also studied situations, in which the brushes were deliberately removed from the supports by attacking Si-O linkages that held macromolecules anchored to substrates using a chemical called tetrabutylammonium fluoride.  The purpose of the latter studies was to learn about how the areal density of polymer grafts affects the overall stability of the system and to prove that one can generate chemical patterns on substrates featuring regions covered by polymers and those that were polymer-free.  Overall, the project led to better understanding of the stability of surface-grafted macromolecules and offered avenues to generate structured substrates with spatio-temporal coverage of macromolecular assemblies on surfaces.  Numerous technologically relevant outcomes will benefit from the results of our work, including, stability of hydrophilic coatings, generation of chemically-patterned substrates, and others.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jan Genzer"
