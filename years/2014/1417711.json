 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Bioavailability of Arctic Soil Carbon: Examining the Relationship Between Chemical Composition and Lability During the Holocene\r\n\r\nEnvironmental manipulation studies clearly demonstrate that temperature, nutrient input and moisture play key roles in driving above ground biomass production and microbial respiration. However, observed changes have yet to be linked to below ground processes of past ecosystem productivity and specifically how natural variations in moisture and temperature during the Holocene influenced microbial processing of soil organic matter. This project is to explore the relationship between chemical composition and bioavailability of Arctic soil carbon accumulated since the early Holocene. The project will result in a potentially transformative parameterization of the drivers of Arctic soil carbon usage that may be applicable globally. This research is directly related to understanding processes affecting Arctic soil carbon and will support an early career researcher. This study will provide training opportunities for a graduate student (Ph.D. student in Earth Sciences at the University of South Carolina) and several undergraduate students, who will be trained through existing summer research programs (NSF funded REU in Marine Biogeochemistry at USC). Strategies for outreach and information dissemination include: 1) recruitment of minority undergraduate to participate in summer research and present their findings, 2) inclusion of the Holocene climate data in upper level undergraduate and graduate courses, 3) creation of a project website to highlight the main findings of the project, 4) working with journalists to share the research on an internationally distributed Podcast, and 5) communicating the findings with other scientists through publishing in top-tier journals and through presentations at national or international meetings.\r\n\r\nCapitalizing on the premise that microbial cell membranes adopt the radiocarbon signature of their food sources, this work will fingerprint in situ carbon usage as a function of soil chemical polarity, contemporary moisture conditions and Holocene climate variability in a range of soils from the Arctic Circle to the Canadian high Arctic. The working hypothesis is that soil carbon bioavailability is strongly influenced by the chemical polarity of organic matter. It is expected that moist conditions favor both the production of more chemically polar compounds and increased microbial reworking of organic matter, such that variations in Arctic Holocene moisture are coupled to soil carbon bioavailability. Establishing a relationship between the soil chemistry and bioavailability will enable more accurate representation of soil carbon in Earth System models, which is especially critical in the Arctic. \r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nThe major goal of this project was to assess how Arctic soils today are different from the past and if this difference may contribute to future climate change.  The focus of this project was on soils in the North Slope of Alaska.  The Arctic is warming faster than most other regions of the globe and this is of great concern because warming will thaw soil that has been frozens for almost ten thousand years and make the soil carbon available for microbes today.  If soil microbes consume this thawed soil carbon, there is the potential for a carbon pool twice that currently in today's atmosphere to be released from the soils, which could enhance the human caused warming in the Arctic. Not only did this project increase student and public awareness of this issue overall through training and outreach, but this project added new tools and insights into Arctic carbon cycling.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe major activities of this project were (a) field collection of permafrost samples, (b) laboratory analysis of the soil cores, (c) sharing the results with the scientific community at meetings and in publications, (d) incorporating this research into my teaching, and (e) learning to communicate about climate change with the public.\n\nThis project was the first of its kind in the United States as it used carbon dating of microbial cells to estimate soil carbon consumption through the concept of you are what you eat.  The theory of this approach is that if microbes eat soil carbon that is thousands of years old, the microbes will look like they are thousands of years old.  At all of the locations studied we found that the micirobes and the soil carbon had significantly different ages, in that the soil carbon was always much older than the microbes.  These findings showed that micriobes were only able to access a small portion of the newly thawed soil carbon. \n\nSince the Principal Investigator had previously studied microbial uptake in other Arctic regions (e.g. Canadian high Arctic, Greenland), this project also provided insights into how the Alaskan soils are unique from other regions.  Based on the carbon dating approach, these results suggest that only a small portion of the thawing Alaskan permafrost carbon could be processed by microbes and later emitted to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.
