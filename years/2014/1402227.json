The key issues  are global well-posedness and blow up, profile decomposition, soliton resolution conjecture, unique continuation properties, Calderon problem with partial data, anisotropic inverse problems, uniform boundary regularity estimates, etc.  Several world leading experts are confirmed as participants and will give lectures.  The conference organizers aim to attract a broad range of participants including junior researchers and members of underrepresented groups. The achievements and impacts of Carlos Kenig in analysis will be celebrated in the conference.",
