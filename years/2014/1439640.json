 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed technology was developed in the NSF I/UCRC for Water and Environmental Technology (WET), and involves novel adsorbent material that can be used to efficiently remove organic contaminants and suspended particles from water. After use, it can be regenerated in-situ and its capacity to remove contaminants is recovered. The material can then be reused for water treatment. The proposed work will address the challenges identified for the commercialization of this technology, including a pilot scale demonstration. \r\n\r\nThe proposed technology would provide a cost efficient and environmentally sustainable solution to treat water and wastewater. Unlike other processes, such as activated carbon adsorption and air stripping which are widely used in the industry for water and wastewater treatment, the proposed technology does not create a secondary waste since the adsorbed contaminants are destroyed. The proposed work would be of interest to municipal water and wastewater utilities, manufacturing industry that need to treat their wastewater, companies that market point-of-use water filters and companies that provide water treatment solutions. In addition, the project would advance the state of the art in environmental science and engineering fields by providing a new adsorbent material for the removal of organic contaminants and suspended particles from water. Activated carbon (AC) has been designated as the Best Available Technology (BAT) by the US EPA for the removal of organic contaminants from water, and is very widely used world-wide; hence, there is tremendous market opportunity for the proposed technology as a superior replacement to AC.",
