 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project develops and compares cutting edge methods for the classification and analysis of American scientific research and compares them to existing manually generated approaches.  The project examines the strengths and weaknesses of four computational approaches: topic models, network-based partitioning methods, Wikipedia-based labeling, and an active-learning approach. In particular, the research examines whether or not the different approaches can correctly classify established research areas and discover emerging fields across a broad range of disciplines.  Each approach is evaluated based on a set of metrics measuring effectiveness, computational costs, human oversight costs, and the need to retain consistency with existing classification frameworks. \r\n\r\nThe work directly responds to a number of National Academies recommendations and National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) reports that suggest using computational approaches to classify scientific research fields. A longer-term impact is improvement in data collection, processing, and reporting of key national statistics on science and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nUnderstanding large document collections is a common problem for companies (understanding what customers are saying on social media), intelligence agencies (sifting through newspaper articles in a foreign country), individuals (coping with information overload in their e-mail inbox), and science policy analysts (understanding a nation?s research portfolio).  While our work addresses all of these scenarios, we particularly focus on the task of understanding a nation?s research portfolio: categorizing and summarizing the documents to an analyst as quickly as possible.\n\n \n Our new system for creating these overviews is called ALTO (Active Learning with Topic Overviews), which helps users understand the broad themes of a document collection and guide them to specific documents that require more attention.  Our system uses two technical components to achieve this.  Topic overviews quickly summarize the collection so that users can see what a document collection is talking about.  Active learning directs a user to specific documents that the system things the user is interested in.\n\n \n We evaluate the system by measuring how well users can answer questions about the activities of the federal government.  Our assumption is that the better their answers, the better the underlying system was at collecting and displaying relevant information.  Our method is both faster and more accurate than existing methods for interacting with users.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jordan L Boyd-Graber"
