 "awd_abstract_narration": "Disturbances to forests, such as logging or wildfires, typically lead to large losses of carbon and nutrients from both the plants and soils of the ecosystem. Virtually all forests are in some state of recovery from such disturbances, whether caused naturally or by humans.  Knowledge of the time required for a forest to recover its original amounts of carbon and nutrients after a disturbance is not complete, nor is an understanding of how regrowing plants, recovering soils and the year to year variation in climate interact to control recovery as a forest ages. This project takes advantage of long existing research plots in forests at the University of Michigan Biological Station to figure out how changes in forest structure, carbon and nitrogen contents of the forests, and variations in climate act together through time to influence how fast trees grow, nitrogen is retained, and carbon is captured and stored in forests. Scientists and students will make regular measurements of the types of trees, their stem sizes and mass, their patterns of leaf arrangement, the amounts of carbon and nitrogen in soils, and other factors in five forest that were cut and burned in 1936, 1948, 1954, 1980, and 1998 and so today range from 15 years to 115 years old.  Several nearby much older  forests will also be sampled. This will let the project link disturbances, climate and ecology for forests that are broadly representative of those across the northern United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThis project will involve students and forest managers in portions of the research and in the application of results to actual forest management. Undergraduate students will help design and carry out regular field measurements of tree and soil properties.  Results will be used in general ecology and forest ecosystem courses taken by students at the field station in the summer. Both undergraduate and graduate students will also be able to use the plots and other data to conduct their own research projects. The team will also host site visits and conduct workshops for forest managers in state and federal agencies, as well as those in local conservation groups.",

The study was based on over 75 years of forest census data, long-term plots, and data collection on soils, roots, downed woody debris, and other compartments of forest ecosystems at the University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS), a 110-year-old field station in the northern portion of the Great Lakes region. The goal of the study was to understand how factors such as increasing forest compositional and structural diversity, soil recovery from historic disturbances (1800's-1900s clearcutting and fire), and climate change and variability influence the total amount of carbon held in forests, their ability to grow biomass, and year-to-year variability in growth and carbon uptake. The study met every objective outlined in its original funded proposal, and in the process advanced the wider scientific understanding of forest succession, growth, and carbon storage. Key findings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As forests age over the decades and into centuries, their canopies become more structurally complex, enhancing the efficiency of resource (light and nutrients) use and maximizing carbon uptake</li>\n<li>Forests growing on different landforms and soils differ inherently in their rates of growth, and these differences can be readily mapped using ecoregional classification&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Clearcutting and fires in the late 1800's - early 1900's produced long-lived changes in soil nutrient availability that even today affect forest canopy structure and carbon uptake</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to share the intellectual merits of this project, its scientific results were communicated to the research community via 7 articles published in peer-reviewed journals, 2 M.S. student theses, and 3 presentations at professional conferences.
