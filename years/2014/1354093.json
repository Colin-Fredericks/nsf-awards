 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a synthesis of thirty-six years of research on African lions, focusing on how body size and habitat have molded the ecology and evolution of this unusually cooperative mammalian species.  Large body size allows lions to dominate competing, carnivore species and to monopolize the best locations for ambushing prey.  The distribution of these valuable hunting sites is limited to a few key areas in savanna landscapes, resulting in intense competition between neighbors, and ultimately in the evolution of cooperative behavior and group living.  This synthesis will address whether lions' cooperative behavior can most profitably be understood as the product of the differential survival and reproduction of individuals or of entire social groups.  The work will also assess the impact of lions on the population sizes of competing carnivore species, on the population sizes of the lions' preferred prey, and on the savanna vegetation consumed by these herbivores.\r\n\r\nThis project will produce a book to be published by the University of Chicago Press and written in a manner accessible for the general public.  The book will include chapters that address how lion behavior and ecology increases the risk of their becoming cattle killers and man-eaters, and how to use this knowledge to design appropriate strategies for mitigating human-lion conflicts.  The synthesis of information on this topic will be invaluable in designing effective conservation strategies for this iconic species.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nI have spent the past year analyzing long-term data to provide a comprehensive understanding of lion ecology and behavior that will be published by the University of Chicago Press.  The monograph will synthesize previously published work with new material.\n\nLions are the apex predators in savanna ecosystems and the only social cat.  Female pridemates compete cooperatively against neighboring groups; male coalition partners compete against other coalitions.   The source of this group-level competition arises from the heterogeneity of savanna landscapes.  Discrete \"hotspots\" of high prey availability, continuous water supply and vegetative cover are located at river confluences, and successful prides control a discrete set of adjacent hotspots.  At a larger scale, subsets of hotspots form \"neighborhoods\" where descendant daughter groups reside as \"satellites.\" Demographic variability sometimes results in the shrinkage of the dominant pride in the neighborhood to where a satellite pride can wrest control of the area.  Otherwise, satellites await opportunities to invade adjacent neighborhoods.\n\nIntergroup competition is intense, and wounding rates are similar across all pride sizes, but wounded solitary females suffer ~60% mortality the following year whereas females in prides of 2-12 females only suffer ~25% mortality.  However, mortality rates rise again such that wounded females suffer 40% mortality as lion society breaks down in excessively large prides.  The optimal pride size varies from 3-6 females in some areas and 3-11 in others. Singletons and pairs typically capture small prey, and prides within the \"optimal size range\" mostly take large prey.  However, excessively large prides rely on small prey, presumably because of restricted opportunities to forage on limited numbers of larger species. \n\nConstraints on pride size and geographical constraints on neighborhoods produces long-term stasis in population size, as a given habitat can typically only support a limited number of prides. However, with favorable habitat change, more prides can utilize a given neighborhood. Thus landscape-level changes allow populations to suddenly shift to new equilibria, owing to the granular nature of inter-group competition.\n\nMales only maintain residence for limited periods, and interbirth intervals are two years, thus incoming males accelerate their own reproduction by killing dependent offspring of preceding coalitions.  Larger coalitions dominate smaller coalitions and are more successful in killing cubs and evicting subadults in their new prides. Females in larger prides can better defend their offspring against incoming males, but excessively large prides are targeted by greater numbers of males, thus pride size only protects against infanticide up to a certain size.\n\nMales frequently capture Cape buffalo when mid-sized prey is scarce.

Thus coalitions become less stable at large sizes.\n\nSolitaries of both sexes arise through demographic processes: solitary females are either the sole survivors of larger prides, the only female in a cohort of dispersing females or females that have departed from excessively large prides.  Solitary females will team up to form a pair or trio, but only with females in adjacent territories in the same neighborhood. Daughters generally leave their mothers' pride if the resultant pride would have exceeded the local optimum and generally stay if the resultant maternal pride would have been too small.
