 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyperdiversification (extraordinarily high species diversity) is found in several animal groups, but its origins are not well understood. In this project, the investigators will produce a phylogeny of the diving beetles (Dytiscidae, 4200 known species) and investigate correlations between evolutionary origins of reproductive strategies and species diversification. The group is important as predators in aquatic systems and as food for both aquatic and terrestrial insectivores. The research will investigate coevolution of female reproductive tracts, sperm, and mating behaviors in a phylogenetic context to discover correlations and their contribution to hyperdiversification. Understanding the different impacts of traits on speciation should lead to a better understanding of species radiations that are not due to ecological changes.\r\n\r\nThis project will train both graduate students and undergraduates in species origins and diversification, phylogenetic analysis, coevolution and evolutionary theory, and the factors involved in these processes. The institution is a minority serving university and students from underrepresented groups in science will gain training in STEM fields. A course will be developed based on this project and material will be disseminated through publicly accessible web sites for researchers, educators and students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated the diversity of diving beetles, a family of about 5000 known species of aquatic beetles found throughout the world, and their sexual strategies and related anatomical structures (emphasizing sperm and female reproductive tracts).  The approach was based on examining these features using a genomic, phylogenetic analysis of the entire group and a basic, descriptive analysis of the features.  The project resulted in field collections of many thousands of specimens, dissections of the sperm and female reproductive structures of hundreds of specimens across all the major groups in the family and related groups.  Whole genomes were sequenced from 90 species, with 15 of these, from each of the major lineages in the family, sequenced using very comprehensive techniques, and the rest using more standard sequencing effort.\n\n               Major scientific results are still being developed, including the nature of changes in diversity of the sperm and female reproductive tracts across the group and through time, and correlations in these changes.  These conclusions rely on the phylogenetic analysis results which are forthcoming.  However, some clear conclusions include that the diving beetles represent one of the greatest diversifications of sexual strategies, sperm morphology and female reproductive tract structure in all the animals.  Sperm are hyperdiverse and including such syndromes as conjugation (multiple sperm joining together) and heteromorphism (different sizes or shapes of sperm in the same male).  Female reproductive tract morphology is similarly diverse with incredible arrangements of tubes, chambers, glands, ductwork and other features.  Together, these two syndromes imply intensive co-evolution of these features which likely helps explain the remarkable diversity in size, species and habitat of the group as a whole.\n\n               In addition, we discovered that diving beetles are equally diverse in genome characteristics.  Genome size in diving beetles ranges from fewer than 1Gbp to over 8Gpb (in comparison, humans have about 3Gbp).  This is by far the greatest range of sizes in any comparable insect group, and the largest genome sizes in diving beetles are the largest in beetles, and among the largest in insects. It is not known why the sizes are so diverse nor what ramifications this has for their biology.\n\n               Finally, this project resulted in large or some direct support in the training of 4 PhD students and approximately 20 undergrads in systematics, field biology and entomology.  Several thousand specimens were collected from throughout the world and made available publicly in the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico.  Networks of collaborators were established, and some 30 papers were published that cite support from this grant with numerous additional ones expected\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kelly B Miller"
