 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: The irradiation of solid materials with ion beams holds great promise for shape and surface control in materials processing at the nanoscale. When materials are irradiated by ions at sufficiently low energies that the ions don't penetrate into the bulk but rather stay near the surface, several interesting phenomena are observed. Certain irradiation conditions lead to ultra-smoothing, which has important potential applications in fields ranging from X-ray optics to light trapping devices to surgery tools. Under other conditions, one observes self-organized arrays of nanoscale surface ripples, mounds, or pits, with potential applications in fields such as optoelectronics. Although both phenomena are potentially rich sources of technological applications, currently the fundamental physical mechanisms determining ultra-smoothing or self-organized behavior are not well understood. The project is a tightly-integrated experimental (Harvard University) and theoretical (Southern Methodist University) study of the fundamental physical principles governing nanoscale morphology evolution during ion irradiation. The research activities are integrated with educational activities to train graduate students in nanoscience and nanotechnology. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description: This collaborative project explores the fundamental physical mechanisms of both the nanoscale topographic pattern formation by a high energy ion beam at a glancing incident angle, and the ultra-smoothing using low energy ion beam irradiation. The ultimate goal is to develop deep understanding and theory that could predict the outcome of arbitrary irradiation conditions. An important aspect of the project is the combined experimental approach and atomistic simulation to identify individual (nano-scale) ion impacts and correlate them with observed (macro-scale) morphological evolution. On one hand, a new multi-scale theoretical framework promises the ability to identify, via atomistic simulation, the atomistic origin of continuum effects such as stress. On the other hand, access to versatile experimental facilities allows measuring the continuum behavior and the critical material properties and testing theoretical predictions.",

The overarching goal was to perform closely-coordinated experiments and calculations, so as to better understand the relative importance of the various physical mechanisms at work during the pattern formation process.  This Project Outcomes report refers to the part of the work done at Southern Methodist University.\n\nMajor Results and Outcomes (Intellectual Merit)\n\n(1)  An improved method of comparing the results of experiments to the predictions of theory in thin-film applications was developed, which revealed that in pattern formation on single-component semiconductors (like Silicon or Geremanium), the recently-introduced mechanism of ion-beam induced stress seems to play a much more important role than previously thought, overturning our understanding of its importance relative to longer-studied mechanisms.\n\n\n(2)  Given the importance of stress discovered in (1), a more thorough model of its effects was developed, which revealed that the previously-neglected mechanism of material swelling becomes more important (which is observed at higher ion energies), it can stabilize the surface leading to the disappearence of patterns (also observed at higher energies), resolving a question that has been puzzling for some time. \n\n\n(3)  A careful comparative study of a variety of observations on two-component semiconductors (such as Gallium Antimonide), and simulations of ion impacts on the same materials, revealed that the patterns observed on these materials (which differ significantly from those observed on single-component materials) are most likely driven primarily by a chemical instability.\n\n\nThese findings meaningfully increased our understanding of the basic physics of IBPF, and led to the publication of three peer-reviewed papers, one submitted manuscript, and 2-3 additional manuscripts in prepartaion.  Also, it enabled travel to five national and international conferences to present the obtained results.\n\n\nSocial Impact and Workforce Preparation (Broader Impacts)\n\nThis research focused on a basic scientific understanding of IBPF, so its broader impacts on society depend on whether IBPF becomes widely used for industrial purposes.  If it does, this reasearch will have helped it reach that state.  If it is passed over in favor of even simpler methods of nanostructuring, then this research will have at least helped lead to that decision.  However, more immediately, this award funded the Ph.D. studies of one graduate student in applied mathematics at Southern Methodist University, who will now be able use that training to contribute to the industrial or educational sectors of society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott A Norris"
