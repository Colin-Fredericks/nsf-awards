The approaches are economically feasible and socially compelling approaches, with a focus on maintaining the health and independence of older adults in a home environment.  The project uses a mix of networking and monitoring technologies to connect older adults with a remote health coach (real person facilitated by a semi-automated program) and remote family members.  One of the key design issues is how best to preserve privacy and enable the participants to control the distribution and sharing of their data. The intervention is designed to provide coordinated and continuous health management.\r\n\r\nThe research for this project uses the integration of data from a variety of sensors in the home, yielding information for activity monitoring, sleep monitoring, gait and movement analysis, socialization measures, as well as a variety of cognitive metrics derived from computer interactions with adaptive games.   Rigorous computational engineering models of the cognitive and physical functions of the patient, as well as context and environment, are used to infer patient state and provide feedback for the patient and the remote health coach.  The modeling techniques include Partially Observable Markov Process and Hybrid Control Modes.  User models that incorporate behavior change principles are then used to drive algorithms to optimize automated feedback and recommendations that serve as prompts for a health coach managing a large number of patients.  These approaches to remote health management are evaluated by leveraging an existing prototype platform with the capability of collecting data from the homes of elderly participants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of our project on Integrated Communications and Inference Systems for Continuous Coordinated Care of Older Adults in the Home was to advance research related to the optimal delivery of remote health coaching interventions to older adults in the home.  We created a health coaching software platform to enable a single coach to remotely manage a large panel of older adults living independently in their homes.  This platform collected sensor data from the home, including interactive video exercise data, motion sensor data, sleep data, cognitive data from interactions with our cognitive computer games, as well as data that reflected a person\u00c6s level of socialization (phone, email, Skype, time out of home, etc.).  This monitoring data was then used to update our model of a person\u00c6s health behaviors and information needs.  Each person had an action plan for the health behaviors they wanted to accomplish that week.  We provided health interventions for physical exercise, cognitive exercise, sleep management and socialization.  Our software algorithms were able to generate appropriate messages that the coach could send via email to help people adhere to their health goals.\n\nOur project was highly multidisciplinary and made contributions to the fields of health care, computer science and neuroscience:\nHealth Care.  Our Health Coaching Platform provides a scalable method for providing proactive care to the home.  This is especially important for our senior population, where most of our health care dollars are being spent.  The interventions can be facilitated by lower cost personnel and even include family members and informal caregivers. \nComputer Science.  The impact to the field of Computer Science is twofold: 1) our new imaging analysis of the Kinect data from the interactive video exercise, as well as feedback in real time provides a framework for computer science work in this area, and 2) our dynamic user models that integrated participant preferences, medical history, and monitoring data provide a framework for tailored automated messaging.  This framework can be replicated for other applications. \nNeuroscience.  We have had several impacts to the field of Neuroscience from this project.  Firstly, we have developed techniques for monitoring cognitive function (working memory, divided attention, planning, executive function) in real time in a cost effective way.  The research has clarified the underpinnings and assumptions associated with the field of neuropsychological testing.\n\nFinally, in this project we have focused on addressing health needs of older adults that are not currently met with standard clinical care, such as sleep monitoring and management in the home, socialization monitoring and intervention, physical exercise monitoring and intervention, as well as cognitive monitoring and intervention.  We found it was important to address quality of life and independence, and not just the management of disease markers.  Our approach uses the untapped resource of motivated family members and informal caregivers as important members of a care team, giving them meaningful roles and communications tools.  Overall, this project has served to develop and demonstrate an approach to scalable remote monitoring and health management that may serve as a framework for both improving the care of older adults as well as reducing the cost of healthcare.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Holly B Jimison"
