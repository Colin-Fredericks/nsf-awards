 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is to study and develop single-photon detectors that employ photoconductive gain regions associated with trapping photo-excited carriers in quantum dots. These detectors have a unique ability to sense individual photons and are a key enabling technology for linear optics quantum computing and the security of quantum communications.  In addition, the realization of quantum repeaters requires the storage of quantum information.  Quantum-dot-based detectors have the unique ability to function in both capacities and may play a fundamental role in developing quantum networks.  The UW-La Crosse Physics Department has ~150 majors and offers an optics emphasis track in physics and engineering. This collaborative research program will help UW-L attract students interested in optoelectronics and quantum technologies and prepare them for future careers in these fields.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be a collaborative effort between the PI at UW-L and Dr. Richard Mirin at NIST-Boulder. The goal is to advance the state of quantum-dot-based single-photon detectors, making these devices suitable for practical applications.  The PI will design the single-photon detectors, conduct measurements, model the detection system, and analyze the data. The research group at NIST will grow prototype samples using to a state-of-the-art molecular beam epitaxy system and fabricate the devices in their clean-room facilities. The goals of this collaboration are to improve the number resolution, speed, and efficiency of the single-photon detectors while raising their operating temperature by optimizing the detection circuitry and integrating the devices with solid-immersion lenses, and optical cavities. These novel detectors provide a key enabling technology for linear-optics quantum computing, for increasing the security of quantum communications, and for studying the quantum nature of light.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI is working to develop single-photon detectors that utilize semiconductor quantum dots (QDS), referred to as QDOGFETs (quantum dot, optically gated, field-effect transistors).  These devices are unique in that they exhibit photon-number-resolving (PNR) capabilities and the potential for spin-preserving detection.  PNR detectors are a key enabling technology for linear-optics quantum computing, impact the security of quantum communications, and are highly useful tools in quantum optics research.  Alternatively, the realization of quantum repeaters for more advance communication systems requires the storage of quantum information.  Spin is one possible candidate for quantum memory, motivating interest in detection mechanisms that can preserve the spin of photogenerated carriers.  None of today?s top performing PNR detectors provide a means of storing quantum information and many of them exhibit cooling requirements (temperature &lt;1 K) that make them highly impractical, providing a niche that QDOGFETs could fill if their performance is improved.  In this work, the PI is investigating the physical mechanisms that limit their sensitivity and photon-number resolution. \n\nThe detection system is shown schematically in Figure 1.  A doped layer in the QDOGFET structure produces a pair of conductive regions, one closer to the QDs, which is the primary pathway used for detection, and a secondary one that is buried much deeper.  A photon is detected when it is absorbed and electrically charges a QD.  The stored charge screens the gate field in the transistor and changes the current flowing in the conductive regions by an amount proportional to the transconductance.  The photoresponse produced by each photon is quite small (~nA) and as a result can be obscured by electrical noise.  In addition, variation in the photoresponses based on the location of the charged QDs can limit the photon-number resolution.   \n\nHow does electrical noise limit sensitivity?  To answer this, the PI has developed a linear-systems model that takes into account the dominant sources of noise in the circuit.  It treats each resistive region of the two pathways as an uncorrelated source of 1/f noise (aka flicker noise).  As shown in Figure 1, the primary path is characterized by a gate-controlled resistance, RpG, in series with the resistances of two ungated regions, RpD and RpS.  Similarly, the secondary path is characterized by three similar resistive regions, RsG, RsD, and RsS.  Taking the noise contributed by each of the six regions to be independently adjustable, the standard deviation of the total noise in the detector?s output is calculated and compared to experimental data.  In this way, the PI has investigated how the various sources contribute to the total noise and how operating temperature, circuit parameters, bias conditions, and the QDOGFET geometry affect the sensitivity [as quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] of the detection system.  \n\nA sample of these studies is shown in Figure 2, where transconductance, SNR, and the standard deviation of the electrical noise are plotted as functions of gate voltage.  Notice that optimum SNR does not occur where the transconductance peaks, but instead is observed for gate voltages closer to zero.  This is due to a strong reduction in the noise associated with the gated portion of the primary conduction path.  The fact that the ungated regions produce the lion?s share of the noise when the SNR is optimized suggests that improved sensitivity should be possible by reducing the size of the ungated channel.  This will require more precise photolithography, but should be achievable.\n\nWhat limits photon-number resolution?  Of utmost importance in achieving quality photon-number resolution is an identical response from each charged QD regardless of its location within the QDOGFET.  The PI has investigated the spatial uniformity of the photoresponses by using an optical scanning microscope (OSM), as shown in Figure 3, to probe different groupings of QDs.  To enhance the spatial resolution of the measurements, a cubic zirconia solid-immersion lens (SIL) is placed over the active area of the QDOGFETs.  This reduces the diameter of the focused laser spot by a factor of 2.14 (the index of refraction of cubic zirconia) in comparison to what it would be in vacuum.        \n\nAn example of these measurements is shown in Figure 4.  Here, highly focused laser pulses are roster scanned over the active area of a SIL-capped QDOGFET while the response produced by each pulse of light is recorded. The resulting response maps illustrate the highly nonuniform nature of the responses.  The information contained in response maps acquired for various bias conditions and QDOGFET structural compositions will be used to optimize the photon-number resolution and guide the design of future devices.\n\nThis research is made possible through a collaboration between the PI at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse (UW-L) and researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder, CO and is helping to train undergraduate students in STEM fields.  Over the grant period, nine undergraduate students worked on the projects.     \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Gansen"
