 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\n\r\nThis research program will investigate a new strategy for making nanoparticles of different metals and alloys, and characterize their size-dependent properties. Many electronic, magnetic, and optical properties become size-dependent when the material is structured on the nanometer length scale. Flash memory, magnetic recording media in computer hard disks, and diode lasers in digital video players, are examples of technology using nanostructured materials.  The materials of interest in this research program are metals and alloys that have not yet been prepared as nanoparticles with good size control. The emphasis will be on alloys known to have interesting magneto-electronic or magneto-optical properties, or potential use as permanent magnets in energy-saving applications. The approach will use nanopatterned templates with regular arrays of pits to control the particle size. After depositing a thin film of the desired material, it will be heated until the film dewets and fills the pits. The uniform pit size will lead to a uniform particle size. This fabrication method will enable exploration of size-dependent behavior. Characterization of the magnetic, magnetoresistive, and magneto-optical properties will provide valuable new data that can be used in engineering nanostructured materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\n\r\nThis research program will investigate the formation of monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles created by the wetting and dewetting of thin metal films on nanopatterned templates, and to investigate their magnetic, magnetoresistive, and magneto-optical properties. While L10 FePt will be one of the target materials, there will be particular interest in magnetic metal alloys that have not yet been made by chemical methods, due to their oxidation sensitivity or complex crystal structures. The challenges are to overcome the sensitivity to oxidation that makes many of these particles impossible to prepare by solution chemistry methods, and to achieve crystallographic orientation to measure their anisotropic magnetic properties. There will be three strategies for preparing the magnetic alloy nanoparticle arrays, each with strengths and limitations: 1) shadow deposition on a nanoparticle monolayer, 2) deposition after seeding in nanohole arrays, and 3) using nanopillar arrays as a hard mask for a magnetic alloy thin film. In all cases rapid thermal annealing will be used to explore methods for crystallographically orienting the alloy nanoparticles. The templates will be dielectric materials (SiOx, SiNx, MgO) and conducting TiNx. The magnetic alloys will include L10 alloys, both familiar (FePt), and less studied (FeNi, MnAl, MnBi), materials for spintronics (the Heusler alloys Co2FeSi and Ni2MnGa, plus FeCoB), and for magneto-optics (the amorphous materials GdFeCo and TbFeCo). The results will lead to an improved understanding of metallic wetting and dewetting on the nanoscale. The nanopatterning process will be applicable to a wide range of complex materials, not only magnetic metal alloys. The preparation of monodisperse, passivated magnetic metal alloy nanoparticles will enable quantitative size-dependent measurements. The magnetization behavior will reveal the roles of surface chemistry and reduced exchange interactions at the particle surface. Novel resistance, magnetoresistance measurements will be made on individual nanoparticles. Smooth monolayer arrays of nanoparticles will be characterized by optical and magneto-optical spectroscopy. This project will involve the doctoral thesis research of a graduate student, along with several undergraduate research projects. There will also be impact to a broad audience through numerous educational activities associated with the magnetics community.",

Developing new ways to characterize and model these nanostructures on the nanoscale was also a significant goal. The main achievement was in demonstrating a new method to characterize individual nanoparticle magnetoresistance using conducting atomic force microscopy. This method uses a scanning probe tip that can make direct electrical contact to nanoparticles. If the metallic nanoparticle is surrounded by insulating material, the spatial resolution is limited by the size of the particle, rather than the radius of curvature of the probe tip. Here measurements were made on individual FePt and FeCoB nanoparticles. The former were made by dewetting and the latter by electron beam lithography. In both cases the metallic nanoparticles were part of a magnetic tunnel junction, so that the electrical resistance depended on the magnetization direction within the particle, relative to that of a reference layer. This enabled characterization of magnetic field- and voltage-induced switching for stable particles, and measurements of individual superparamagnetic particles, where thermal fluctuations lead to spontaneous changes in the magnetization direction. The fluctuations were analyzed in terms of their statistics, and modeled with an Arrhenius law in order to quantify the relation between the energy barrier for reversal and the current that generates the spin transfer torque on the magnetic nanoparticle. Atomistic micromagnetics software was used to simulate magnetization reversal dynamics in the nanoparticles as a function of magnetic field and temperature, providing insight into the experimentally observed differences in the fluctuation rates as a function of size. Figure 1 shows how the resistance fluctuates over time over a range of fixed bias voltages, for the 60 nm dot with zero local magnetic field. At -20 millivolts it is almost always in the parallel state, while at +350 mV it spends most of the time in the antiparallel state.</p>\n<p>Data like that shown in Figure 1 were collected for nanoparticles of different sizes. The smaller nanoparticles were found to switch less frequently, indicating that they were less susceptible to thermal fluctuations. This was surprising because smaller particles have fewer spins and are expected to switch more often. Figure 2 shows the relaxation for particles of different diameters, with lifetimes ranging from 1 microsecond for 80 nanometers, increasing to over 100 microseconds for 20 nm. Further measurements showed evidence of exchange bias due to coupling between the metallic interior of the particle and a thin shell of magnetic oxide. The oxide increases the magnetic stability, and an oxide shell has greater impact on the magnetization dynamics in small nanoparticles. The origin of these differences was revealed by micromagnetics simulations of magnetization reversal dynamics as a function of magnetic field and temperature. Figure 3 shows the in-plane magnetization as a function of time during a sub-nanosecond switching event. For 20 nm diameter particles the magnetization rotates coherently in the plane. Reversal in 60 nm particles involves creation of a vortex-antivortex pair, followed by their annihilation.
