 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the conference Seminar on Stochastic Processes (SSP) 2014 to be held at the University of California-San Diego on March 26-29, 2014. These seminars have been held annually since 1981; they have become the most important regular conference series for probabilists in North America. They bring together a diverse group of accomplished researchers and young investigators in probability and stochastic processes. The primary goal is to provide a platform for the dissemination of the most recent significant progress in research, and to enable participants to discuss their work in an informal atmosphere.  \r\n\r\nThe Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a fixture in probability, and many of the most prominent probabilists make a habit of attending it every year. The morning invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the field. Moreover, the informal format of the afternoon sessions gives graduate students and young researchers a unique opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends by engaging in high level open discussions, and by offering the opportunity to present their own research to leaders in their field. The synergy made possible by this original formula is very rarely found in more traditional meetings. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference. \r\n\r\nThe meeting website is at http://depts.washington.edu/ssproc/ssp_nextssp.php",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStochastic processes are used to model random systems that evolve over time and have important applications throughout the physical, biological, and social sciences.  For example, the movement of the price of a stock over time can be modeled as a stochastic process.  One can also use stochastic processes to model the evolution of a population over time or the spread of a disease.  The Seminar on Stochastic Processes is a conference that has been held annually since 1981 and has become one of the most important conferences in North America pertaining to stochastic processes.  Each year, some of the most influential researchers in stochastic processes in the world attend the event.  In 2014, the conference was held at the University of California at San Diego.  This year's program featured invited lectures by Rodrigo Ba&ntilde;uelos (Purdue University), Sandra Cerrai (University of Maryland), Neil O'Connell (University of Wawrick/Trinity College Dublin), Sebastien Roch (University of Wisconsin), and Ramon van Handel (Princeton University).  The program also featured three hours of tutorial lectures delivered by Vladas Sidoravicius (IMPA), which were aimed at new researchers.  New researchers were provided with the opportunity to give a very brief lecture on their work followed by a poster presentation.  There was also an open problem session in which participants discussed unsolved problems in their field.  Finally, the conference included a panel discussion designed to provide advice to new researchers in stochastic processes.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason R Schweinsberg"
