 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, performed by the research group of Professor Cynthia Friend at Harvard University and funded through the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry at NSF, aims at understanding how to design new types of materials that have the potential to improve energy efficiency and to reduce the amounts of noxious pollutants in the air. The overall goal of this work is to explore the potential for harnessing sunlight to drive chemical reactions important in reducing energy use and improving the environment.  The project is focused on understanding how to capture the energy in visible light using small structures (nanostructures) of metals and to use that energy for chemical reactions.  Training of members of the next-generation scientific workforce will also be achieved through this interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThe research will uniquely focus on versatile nanoporous materials because of the potential for fuller utilization of solar energy through plasmonic excitations that span the solar spectrum and because they are structurally robust. Model systems, consisting of Ag (Au) nanoparticles supported on titanium oxide(110), will also be investigated using a combination of theory, molecular-scale imaging, and reactivity studies. The investigation of these model systems will elucidate how important system properties (for example, the alignment of the electronic states of the acceptor reactant molecules or the semiconductor overlayer with the SPR excitations, the spatial extent of the SPR excitation, the size and thickness of the semiconductor layer) affect the photo-induced processes. Understanding of the reactivity of chemicals that are either volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) or key reactants in chemical synthesis will be the focus of the work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPhotochemical processes have great potential for efficient chemical transformations, including the production of valuable molecules and degradation of pollutants using solar energy.  In a photochemical process, excitation with light promotes the system to an excited electronic state that can lead to new pathways not accessible thermally.  Consequently, a fundamental understanding of reaction mechanism and the time-evolution of excited states is required to understand and predict photochemical reaction efficiency.  At the same time, advances in materials synthesis have produced new, complex nano-materials that have potential as photocatalysts but for which there is little understanding of their function. Our recent NSF-sponsored work has combined development of theoretical methodology to understand the time evolution of excited states on model systems with detailed experimental studies of photochemical reactions on titania as a model for metal oxide photochemistry more generally.  We also embarked on investigations of complex nanomaterials using the tools of surface chemistry to map out reaction mechanisms on these materials.  In the theoretical aspect of this work, we have developed methodology that addresses two major challenges in theoretical modeling photochemistry on semiconductor surfaces: (1) the modeling of defects, e.g. oxygen vacancies or interstitial metal atoms, in compound semiconductors such as MoS2 and TiO2, and (2) mapping the time evolution of excited states of the photocatalytic solid and reactant molecule.  In parallel, we have investigated two types of new complex nano-materials:  (1) nanoporous Au decorated with nanoparticles of TiO2 and (2) TiO2 nanowires (Fig. 1).  The chemical behavior of these materials for thermal and photo-oxidation reactions has been studied and compared to studies of single-crystal rutile TiO2(110) previously performed in our lab in order to provide a detailed understanding of the properties of the nanowires.\n\n            The NSF-sponsored work resulted in new methodologies for studying photon-assisted chemical reaction that can be more broadly applied to understand how light interactions with semiconductor materials to drive chemical reactions&mdash;a key part of designing materials for solar energy conversion.  The project also led to the education of next-generation innovators in science and engineering.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia M Friend"
