 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Summary:\r\n\r\nShape Memory Alloys (SMAs) are unique multifunctional phase-change materials.  They can switch between two shapes under thermal or mechanical cycling by a reversible martensitic phase transformation, and are promising for applications in sensing, actuation, energy conversion and harvesting, and damping.  This CAREER project bridges two thus far separate research areas, (i) grain boundary science and engineering and (ii) displacive martensitic transformations in SMAs, and seeks to understand mechanical interactions across interfaces during martensitic transformations in dual-phase SMA polycrystals.  This research will use experiments, analytical theory, and mesoscale computational modeling to explore two major interface effects: (1) the effects of grain boundary crystallographic character on strain transfer, accommodation, and compatibility at grain boundaries; (2) how a non-transforming, ductile phase precipitated along grain boundaries accommodates transformation strains from across phase boundaries.  Grain boundary engineering will be explored to enhance strain compatibility at grain boundaries, thereby improving the ductility and applicability of SMA polycrystals.  The fundamental understanding on strain transfer and compatibility at interfaces gained in this research will also be relevant to similar problems in many other polycrystalline metals and compounds.  \r\n\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Summary:\r\n\r\nShape Memory Alloys (SMAs)are unique multifunctional materials. They can  fail by brittle fracture along internal planar defects or interfaces called grain boundaries and this problem has significantly limited their applicability.  This project will quantitatively elucidate the mechanisms for  failure in SMAs by performing   experimental characterizations and computational modeling.  This work will also exploit grain boundary engineering strategies to improve grain boundary properties and enhance the ductility of SMAs, which will enable practical applications of SMAs in advanced technologies in both commercial and military sectors.  This project will also involve substantial education and outreach efforts.  The education activities include transforming both undergraduate and graduate core mechanical properties courses, contributing to computational materials course, and training undergraduate and graduate researchers who will become experts and leaders in mechanical properties, metals, and computational materials science.  The outreach activities will attract young students to science and engineering, promote public interest in engineering, and support professional development and advancement of women engineering students.",

It has been known for some time that the interfaces between the crystals, the grain boundaries, have significant effects on the mechanical properties of the materials. The grain boundaries effectively inhibit plastic deformation in adjacent grains and accordingly increase the yield stress of the metal or alloy.  The effects of grain boundary densities,distributions and misorientaion between two adjacent grains have been studied extensively and are reasonably well understood.  However the junctions between three or more grains can be expected to also have significant effects on the mechanical properties of the materials since the intersections between three or more grains should lead to large differentials in accommodation of plastic deformation.\n\nThe goal of this project was to elucidate the effects of multi-junction grains on the subsequent mechanical response of polycrystalline metals and alloys.  Experiments were performed utilizing columnar grained high purity nickel. such that individual grains intersected opposing surfaces of test pieces.  This configuration allowed the multi-grain intersection problem to be reduced to triple junctions.  Further, the orientation of each grain could be relatively easily determined, as could the relative orientation of intersecting grains.  With these orientations, surface slip analyses were observed and analyzed.\n\nThe results of these surface observations, coupled with  a computer program that allowed the resolved shear stresses to be determined showed that triple junctions do have significant effects on initiating plastic deformation in adjacent grains, as well as, in some cases, inhibiting the initiation of deformation dependingg on the specific geometric constraints of the relevant slip systems.\n\nThe importance of this study was  to increase the scientific understanding of the effects of multi-grained interactions on the subsequent mechanical behavior of ductile polycrystalline materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Duquette"
