 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current processors employ aggressive prediction mechanisms to improve  \r\nperformance and reduce power. To design effective optimizations, it is  \r\nincreasingly important to understand and quantify a program's dynamic  \r\nbehavior. However, today, most of these optimizations rely on  \r\nheuristics and are fairly ad-hoc. After some patterns are observed, a  \r\nhardware decision is made and the design space of the hardware  \r\noptimization is explored through simulation to determine the best  \r\nperforming configuration. However, because the design is targeted for  \r\nobserved and/or anticipated patterns, some dynamic behavior is not  \r\ncaptured and remains undetected.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a framework for quantitatively analyzing a  \r\nprogram's behavior in terms of regularities and patterns to provide  \r\ninsights into the design of next-generation hardware prediction  \r\nmechanisms. Inspired by DNA discovery tools, the research adopts  \r\nalgorithms used in string processing, compression and bioinformatics,  \r\nin order to summarize applications' dynamic data reference and branch  \r\noutcome behaviors. The findings from the methods and tools developed  \r\nin this project will have a big impact on the design and efficiency of future  \r\nhardware components. The PI will collaborate with industry partners to further  \r\nincrease the broader impact. The research will engage graduate and  \r\nundergraduate students and promote the participation of  \r\nunderrepresented groups.",
