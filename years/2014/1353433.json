 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the values embedded in formal mechanisms, such as risk assessment and cost benefit analysis, that could be used to assess the impact of emerging technologies, with synthetic biology as a case study. The project aims to refine the understanding of these mechanisms, facilitate their thoughtful use in policy-making, deepen the social debate about synthetic biology, and advance the debate about the values that ought to guide impact assessment for emerging technologies generally. The project sets out three applications of synthetic biology, develops formal impact assessments for them, and convenes a panel of experts who, collectively, have expertise in synthetic biology, governance of technologies, and the theory and use of impact assessments. With the help of this panel, the project's leadership team will engage in conceptual and philosophical analysis of the role of values in impact assessments. The project draws on literature in policy analysis, political science, economics, philosophy, and bioethics.\r\n\r\nMeeting the goals indicated above could contribute to the growing effort to develop strategies that ensure the governance of emerging technologies aligns appropriately with public values. The project will lead to a report that examines the role of values in formal impact assessment mechanisms, an additional report on how impact assessment mechanisms square with the recommendation by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues for \"prudent vigilance\" in policy on synthetic biology and other emerging biotechnologies, and scholarly papers reassessing the debate about proactionary (promoting freedom to innovate) versus precautionary (constraining innovation until there is sound evidence that no harm will result) approaches to policy-making. The work will also be disseminated through publications intended for a general audiences, interactions with journalists, public presentations, and on the web.",

Overview \nThe Hastings Center project \"Values in Impact Assessment\" examined the mechanisms by which society can decide when and how to make use of an emerging biotechnology such as synthetic biology.
