 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to explore transformative approaches for generating high-purity entangled photonic quantum states, on a silicon chip, that are capable of diverse applications for both long-haul quantum communication and on-chip integrated quantum computing. The approach is to integrate novel physical mechanisms, innovative device design, together with advanced nanofabrication technology, to produce unique device characteristics and dramatic cavity enhancement for realizing novel quantum functionalities.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed research aims to produce entangled photon pairs with performance orders of magnitude beyond current techniques, with the following excellent features integrated into a single chip-scale device: high quantum-state purity; long and tunable coherence time; high photon generation efficiency; capable of high-speed operation; large spectral flexibility; excellent device scalability; capable of multi-channel parallel operation; on an integrated platform but with easy interface with fiber-optic quantum communication links. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This research is expected to open up a new research avenue: quantum silicon photonics. It will provide excellent solutions to the current and future need of high-quality entangled photon pairs required for diverse quantum photonic applications, thus significantly advancing quantum information science and technology. Functionality innovations will be disseminated to the broader research community through published papers, and the research outcomes will be incorporated into the course offered by the PI. This research will result in training graduate and undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary areas of nanophotonics, nonlinear optics, and quantum information technology. It will also result in promoting the interest and participation of K-12 students through related outreach programs.",
