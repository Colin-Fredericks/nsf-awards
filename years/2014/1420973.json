 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) investigates how differences in the design and practice of elections in different countries affect how individuals in those countries think and behave.  In 2014, twice as many countries are democracies than just two decades ago. The CSES is well positioned to study this unprecedented and continuing wave of democratization. The CSES project provides coordination and leadership for the social science research efforts of over 60 nations, and has established itself as the most-well known data resource for this type of research. The project disseminates all of its data for free to the public, and is being used by thousands of scientists, students, policy makers, journalists, and citizens.\r\n\r\nCSES is arranged according to modules.  Each module is a questionnaire on an important topic of scientific interest, a topic identified by the research community and selected by project collaborators. The questionnaires are included in high quality, representative surveys that are conducted at the time of national elections in countries around the world.  Each module is in place for five years, to incorporate at least one national election in each country during the time span.  The current proposal is to complete the activities of the fourth module of the CSES, and to plan and design the fifth module.\r\n\r\nInvolving the collaboration of more than 200 scholars in the United States and internationally, CSES advances the understanding of enduring and fundamental questions about elections, vote choice, turnout, and citizens' attitudes about democracy and politics. The goals of this unique research program are to understand how society, politics, and economics shape the beliefs and behaviors of citizens, to examine and compare the nature and quality of democracy and elections across countries, and to understand how groups with different backgrounds, and living under different political arrangements, interact with democratic institutions.\r\n\r\nCSES collects survey data from each country, as well as background information about the social, political, and economic conditions in the country.  CSES designs, receives, cleans, checks, and merges all of these data, combining them into a single dataset which allows for comparison across countries.  All of the data are then made freely and immediately available via the project website.  This is a unique resource for researchers worldwide, and that is reflected in the large and growing number of publications that make use of the data.\r\n\r\nCSES data help in examining issues that are crucial to national policy in the United States, in a way that is not possible with other datasets.  It encourages international cooperation around issues of democracy, politics, and social science. The project is a unique resource in studying, and building scientific capacity in, developing democracies.  CSES is widely used in training students through university coursework, and students regularly serve as research assistants for the project.\r\n\r\nCSES-based research provides indispensable insight on how democratic institutions actually work and contributes to the debate about the virtues and vices of different electoral systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT AND BROADER IMPACTS\n\nThe 1990s witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of democracies around the world.  The independent watchdog organization Freedom House estimates that as of 2016, nearly two-thirds of the world?s countries are electoral democracies, nearly doubling the number of democracies from just two decades earlier.  More recent years have witnessed new challenges to these democracies. The largest movements of refugees since World War II, for example, has put great pressure on new and established democracies alike.  Will this and other pressures decrease popular satisfaction with democracy?  Will it initiate a turn to authoritarian leaders or to populist leaders?  \n\nThe CSES research project, a collaboration of scholars in more than 60 countries, is designed to be able to address these questions and many more that are equally important to science and society.  CSES collaborators conduct high quality, nationally representative surveys after elections in their countries.  CSES combines these surveys along with additional information about the country and electoral system into a single dataset for use ? at no cost ? by academics, students, policymakers, journalists, and the public.  At nearly 25 years of service to science and society, CSES has already yielded many important results about electoral democracy and is poised to tackle these and other new questions.\n\nPROJECT OUTCOMES\n\nCSES datasets are available from the project website (www.cses.org) to the public, for free and without embargo.  Tens of thousands of persons have downloaded CSES datasets. The project email list currently has over 6,000 subscribers, the project Twitter account is followed by nearly 2,200 persons, and a new blog by the project includes 25 posts which were viewed 8,000 times in total.\n\nOver 1,000 publications and presentations have made use of the CSES, including books, dissertations, and publications in prominent journals such as the American Journal of Political Science, the American Political Science Review, the British Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political Studies, The European Journal of Political Research, Electoral Studies, the Journal of Politics, and Party Politics, among many others.\n\nThe goal of the fourth module of CSES was to enhance knowledge of voter prefrrences for policies that affect income and wealth distribution.
