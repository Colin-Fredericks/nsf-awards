The proposed workshop provides\r\na forum for leaders from these facilities, regardless of scale, type or format of data, to\r\ngather and discuss commonalities and collaborative solutions to the increasing challenges\r\nassociated with providing data access for researchers. In addition, this workshop will act\r\nas a key end-user Assembly Group during the EarthCube Test Enterprise Governance process to\r\nidentify decision making processes and governance models that are most applicable to the geoscience\r\ndata facilities.\r\n\r\nA steering committee of experts from across the Geosciences, including Atmosphere, Oceans,\r\nand Earth Sciences will act to identify key participants and create a quality agenda. Social\r\nscientists will be utilized to ensure developmental evaluation and learning loops are incorporated\r\ninto the agenda; this includes the construction of key scenarios and exercises for discussion\r\nand breakout groups.\r\n\r\nResults of the meeting will include a set of common and unique requirements and challenges\r\nassociated with the communication, collaboration, interoperability, and governance structures\r\nrequired to ensure that the capabilities and opportunities of existing and emerging NSF/GEO\r\nfacilities are incorporated into the EarthCube concept.",
