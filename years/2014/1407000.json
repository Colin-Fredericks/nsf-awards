 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic architecture is the pattern and organization of genetic effects controlling phenotypic variation. I take an experimental approach to dissecting genetic architecture for the bioenergetic process of oxidative phosphorylation, a metabolic pathway central to energy use. Using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, I will systematically alter each of the enzymes involved in this pathway, and then measure the effect on the flow of electrons through the whole respiratory chain. Because these effects define the genetic architecture of this pathway and determine the response to natural selection, I hypothesize that the strength of the effect dictates the mode of selection acting on genes of the respiratory chain and membrane lipid metabolism. This metabolic control hypothesis makes explicit predictions for molecular patterns of polymorphism and divergence which I will test using genomic data from D. melanogaster and D. simulans. \r\n\r\nA major goal of modern biology is understanding the complexity of phenotypes and their underlying genetic architecture.  Purely statistical approaches to genetic architecture of complex traits (e.g., cardiovascular disease) have had mixed success. The type of metabolic control analysis done in this study is routinely used to diagnose metabolic and mitochondrial pathologies. By quantifying the full control distribution for this complex trait we may better uderstand the causes of such diseases. In addition, this project will involve the mentoring of undergraduate students.",

The distribution of control coefficients along a metabolic pathway provides a mathematical framework for understanding the single locus response to selection on a pathway and is a general model for genetic architecture of flux based traits.  This grant supported the development of a series of well-controlled stable enzyme activity mutants in Drosophila melanogaster for experimental use in gene perturbation experiments for phospholipid metabolism.  Control coefficients can be directly estimated by the quantitative sensitivity analysis of pathway flux, or steady-state membrane lipid composition, to the introduction of activity mutants in these gene perturbation experiments.\n\nIn total, genetic engineering of activity variation was undertaken for 14 loci contributing to the composition of inner mitochrondial membranes.

Transposable element based methods of genetic transformation introduced several complications to the development of these resources.

Experiments on similar resources (transposable element excision allele series) from our lab have continued for two decades following their initial development and the lines have been widely disseminated to other research labs.  The allele series developed here for Drosophila melanogaster phospholipid metabolism establish the experimental base for the specific investigation of homeoviscous/homeophasic adaptation via phospholipid head group modification and more general study of the genetic architecture of adaptive evolution in mitochondrial physiology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/24/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Spencer Koury"
