 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing SENSEI (SENSor Environment Imaging), an instrument that targets a broad range of big data science and engineering challenges, promises a unique sensor platform for 2D and 3D recording within dynamic environments. SENSEI contributes to a broad range of data-driven application domains. These range from fundamental research in instrument design and development to data processing, fusion and synthesis, enabling not only the creation of the instrument, but also its use as a resource for multi-domain science and engineering on the ground, in the air, and underwater.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, SENSEI is a spherical, (ultra) high-resolution (9-times-IMAX resolution and ~terapixel/minute flood of imagery), vision-based capture system capable of video-rate data-acquisition. The instrument will address domain challenges in science, engineering, medicine, and beyond by enabling investigation of big data acquisition, streaming, processing, archiving and access, visualization, and analytics.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this project will be felt in a variety of image-intensive scientific disciplines. The areas of environmental monitoring, remote sensing, situational awareness, homeland security, and mechanical and structural engineering can greatly benefit from the proposed instrument. The instrument will be designed for replication by the global community of researchers and the graduate students.  The technology will be communicated through classes, projects, theses, publications, as well as museum exhibits and conferences. Special attention has been paid to broadening participation through the Minority Serving Institutions Cyber-Infrastructure Empowerment Coalition (MSI-CIEC).",
