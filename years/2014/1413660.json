 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over billions of years, stars similar to our sun evolve to form red giants that eventually eject their outer shells, forming planetary nebulae (PNe).  Planetary nebulae play an important role in the chemical evolution of the galaxy by returning material created within stars to create brand-new stars.  The transition from red giant to planetary nebula is an important but relatively short-lived stage of stellar evolution, lasting only a few hundred thousand years.  The goal of this proposal is to study the basic physical properties of objects in this transition phase that are referred to as proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe).  This project will use a variety of observations and techniques to carry out this study. \r\n\r\nPPNe represent intermediate mass objects in the late stages of stellar evolution that are transitioning from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars to PNe.  The proposal will continue and extend an existing program of photometric and radial velocity measurements of post-AGB stars and PPNe within our own galaxy and in the nearby Large and Small Magellanic Cloud galaxies.  The combination of photometric light curves, color measurements, and radial velocities will permit the direct determination of fundamental parameters like stellar radius and luminosity.  In addition, stellar pulsation models will be used to constrain the mass and luminosity of the PPNe.  Finally, the program will investigate the degree of binarity in PPNe and its effect on the shaping of PNe.\r\n\r\nThis Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project will provide numerous and wide-ranging opportunities for the training of new scientists, the education of liberal arts students, and the science infrastructure at the PI's institution.   The project will communicate its results to the public through open houses held at the observatory on the campus of the PI's home institution.  The PI will continue to give community and professional lectures and will incorporate the results of the research into those presentations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn a series of studies, we investigated the variability of a class of star in a relatively brief (few thousand years) and poorly-studied phase of their evolution.  These stars are in transition between the second red giant (or ?asymptotic giant branch,? AGB) phase and the ?planetary nebula? (PN) phase, by which time the star has ejected its atmosphere and is surrounded by a glowing, beautiful nebula.  This is projected to be the future evolution of typical stars like the Sun.  We observed a significant sample of these post-AGB and proto-planetary nebula (PPN) objects to investigate variations in their brightness and velocity.  These variations can be caused by two mechanisms, the pulsation of the star and the effects of a binary companion, and they provide a key to understanding the properties and evolution of these stars.\n\n We carried out observations to monitor the brightness variations of these stars from 2008-2018 using telescopes at the Valparaiso University Observatory and at the Southeast Association for Research in Astronomy sites at Kitt Peak (Arizona) and Cerro Tololo (Chile).  A total of 33 stars were observed intensively.  All were found to vary in brightness, and 29 were found to vary periodically, with periods ranging from 30 to 160 days.  Spectroscopic observations were carried out to measure the velocity variations of five of the brightest ones, and they confirm that the variations are due to the pulsation of the stars.  The stars are found to be brightest when hottest and smallest.  We also used data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey to study light variations of a similar group of 22 stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, two relatively nearby galaxies.  Again, they all vary in brightness, with eight being periodic.  The cooler stars in the PPN sample are those that are found to vary periodically; the hotter ones also vary but on a shorter and perhaps non-periodic timescale.\n\n In addition to pulsation, we also used the same data to search for evidence of a binary companion in some of these.  The motivation for this is that many PN have a non-spherical and more bipolar shape.  Since stars are spherical, one would expect the nebulae to be spherical unless there was another force acting upon the material, such as the gravitational attraction of an orbiting binary companion star.  To investigate this, we carried out a long-term study (2009-2017) of the seven brightest PPNe observable from the northern hemisphere.  Evidence of a long-term (multi-year) velocity variation was found in only one case, and in that one the evidence is not strong.  We also looked for multi-year periodic variations in brightness that might be due to the gravitational distortion of a spherical star by its orbiting companion, causing a variation in its brightness as one receives light from the changing projected area of the star.  The brightness could also change if the companion caused some of the ejected gas and dust to be trapped in a disk around the binary, which might block out some of the light of the star as it orbits within the disk.  Such a long-term light variation was found in seven of the 33 PPNe studied in our galaxy, suggesting that these might have a binary companion.  Through extensive follow up of one of these PPNe, we found the light and velocity to vary with the same period (7.3 years) in a way that confirmed its binary star nature.  This indicated that at least some of the PPNe are indeed binary stars.\n\n One of the main outcomes of this study was the discovery that among the cooler PPNe, there exists an inverse linear relationship between the period of pulsation and the atmospheric temperature of the star.  Since these stars are in a phase in which they are evolving from lower to higher temperatures, the implication is that the pulsation period of the star decreases accordingly.  Combining our observed rate of period decrease with increasing temperature and the theoretical rate of increased temperature with time, we predicted that a period change should be visible in a decade or two in certain of the stars.  We observed this in one and possibly two of the stars.  This discovery gives general support to the theoretical rates of stellar evolution determined from the models.  Another outcome was the discovery that the periods that we measured for these stars are significantly longer than those predicted by the present models of stellar pulsation, indicating that further theoretical work is needed to better understand the physics of these stars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce J Hrivnak"
