 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is reaching out to under-prepared statistics instructors in the nation's community college system to provide them with modern content and the ability to teach it using evidence-based teaching methods. The statistics instructors in community colleges often lack sufficient resources or connections to take advantage of all that is offered by the growing statistics education community. At the same time, the explosive growth in everyday use of statistics places a great burden of responsibility on statistics educators.  Statistical literacy is vital for engaged and active citizenship. Leaders in the statistical community have identified educating educators as a critical need for the near future. Statistics education researchers have developed theoretically grounded and evidence-based pedagogical practices that can strengthen present and future teachers. \r\n\r\nThe approach being taken in this project is to pair 72 community college instructors in need of professional development with 12 established statistics educator mentors across 4 regional hubs.  The mentors will help these instructors gain both content knowledge and the ability to use current best evidence-based practices in their teaching. These practices are consistent with the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education. The instructors will participate in two expert-led workshops each year, will meet in monthly professional learning communities through which mentors will promote interaction and peer-learning, and will be integrated into the statistics education community. The project will also integrate these community college instructors into the national statistics education communities through the US Conference on Teaching Statistics, online connections, and conferences. The project is creating mentoring relationships and professional learning community programs.  \r\n\r\nThe regional hubs and mentoring relationships created by this project will provide ongoing opportunities for community college instructors to interact with the growing statistics education community that is dedicated to quality statistics education. The effectiveness of this approach to propagating best practices will also be carefully studied as part of the project. The project will examine whether this approach can become a foundation for future regional and national collaborative projects. By providing professional development opportunities beyond the abilities of most community colleges, this project could affect new and continuing faculty members for many years to come. It is creating both the social interactions and the structure needed to sustain these endeavors beyond the time frame of the grant.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTraining a New Generation of Statistics Educators (TANGO Stat Ed) is a professional development program that endeavored to improve the teaching of introductory statistics at two year colleges. It addressed NSF?s priorities of developing the STEM workforce, educating a STEM-literate populace, and implementing and disseminating best practices.  This was accomplished through four main activities:\n\nTrain two year college statistics instructors in modern statistics pedagogy by pairing them with mentors who are experienced statistics educators,\nIntroduce these instructors to the statistics education community, pedagogical resources, and national meetings on statistics education,\nCreate regional hubs around the country to provide sustained professional learning communities, and\nEvaluate the effectiveness of this program on increasing statistical and pedagogical content knowledge, improving attitudes towards modern statistics pedagogy, and student learning.\n\n\nStatistics, the art and science of learning with data, is a vital area which has seen exponential growth in recent years.  Improving the teaching of introductory level statistics courses empowers students to survive and thrive in such a world.  Statistical competencies, along with more positive affect towards statistics, increase students? desire to enroll in future statistics courses, choose data-related majors, and engage in professional and/or personal opportunities using data.  This leads to a workforce and citizens of tomorrow that are better trained to deal with the data deluge.  Focusing training at two year colleges also fosters the inclusion of underrepresented groups who attend these institutions at a higher rate than at four year colleges.\n\nThe need for improved teaching of statistics is particularly true at two year colleges, since they teach the majority of introductory statistics courses which are taught in mathematics and/or statistics departments in the U.S.  Many of these instructors have degrees in mathematics and, therefore, have not taken a course in applied statistics using modern statistics pedagogy.  In addition, these institutions often have sparse professional development opportunities.  We defined modern statistics pedagogy based on the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE), which was approved by the American Statistical Association.  It stresses the importance of using real data, focusing on conceptual understanding rather than procedural regurgitation, and active learning in the classroom.\n\nThe TANGO Stat Ed program included 62 two year college statistics instructors, entitled Next Generation Instructors or NGIs, from 37 institutions.  We estimate that these instructors taught about 8,000 students during the time of the program and will teach tens of thousands more throughout their careers.  Each training program began with a workshop on teaching statistics lead by prominent statistics educators, including textbook authors and two Chief Readers of the AP Statistics Exam.  A highlight of the program was convening at the US Conference on Teaching Statistics (in 2015 and 2017), where two-day workshops were held specifically for NGIs.  Throughout their involvement, the NGIs met up to two hours per month with their mentors - 21 experienced statistics educators.\n\nOver the course of the program, the NGIs improved their beliefs about the effectiveness of various pedagogies.  These included increased use of technology in the classroom, the decreased importance of teaching probability rules and distributions, and that students should produce more of their own data. Their practice also improved in that they lectured less, focused more on concepts over procedures, discussed variability and uncertainty, and led students in more class discussions. In addition, respondents reported an improved attitude towards statistics and statistics education as well as improved knowledge of both statistics content and pedagogical content knowledge.  All but one respondent said they changed the way they teach after participating.  Student learning was hard to assess due to logistical challenges in conducting such research.\n\nTANGO Stat Ed also supported and encouraged NGIs to begin taking on  leadership roles in their respective communities. Four NGIs applied for  and were approved to do a themed session at the American Mathematical  Association of Two Year Colleges (AMATYC) Annual Conference, two of whom  had never presented before.\n\nThe vast majority of NGIs felt connected to the broader statistics education community. NGIs and mentors have continued to get together informally, including at national conferences like USCOTS, electronic conferences like the electronic Conference on Teaching Statistics, and at the AP Statistics Reading.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Posner"
