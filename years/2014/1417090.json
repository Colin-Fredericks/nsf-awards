 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to improve HPD use-rates among workers in loud noise environments, reduce permanent hearing loss rates and usher in the field of sealed-ear bio-acoustical studies.  This HPD is expected to provide greater comfort and fit than custom earplugs yet have a cost similar to the annual expense of the foam type.  The use-rate with this HPD is expected to compete with and likely exceed that of the custom earplugs and be the new hearing protection device of choice for both markets.  The anticipated hearing protection device use-rate increase in loud workplaces will have the effect of improving workers? health and stabilizing their productivity rates, positions and wages.  The presence of this HPD with its novel approach to hearing protection on the market will enhance appreciation for hearing health and further popularize biophysics solutions to everyday issues.  The underlying research will open up interest in sealed-ear bio-acoustical phenomena.  Once the performance results of this HPD and the associated tympanic membrane response study reaches the mainstream audiological and acoustic research communities, the desire to evaluate the health effects of a range of in-ear audio devices and associated ear canal acoustics will become widespread.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project addresses the need for a hearing protection device (HPD) that is comfortable to wear, effectively blocks harmful sounds and yet enables communication.  HPDs go unused or misused in loud workplace environments due to discomfort and insufficient utility with regards to situational awareness leading to the single most extensive non-fatal labor-based sickness of permanent hearing loss in the United States and in particular, among members of the armed forces.  A prototype HPD is under development with a soft, ?disappears from perception? inflatable ear-coupler that fully seals and isolates the ear from exterior sound and with variability to adjust for differing loudness situations.  Tests will measure sound isolation, speech recognition, occlusion effect, and perceived comfort, occlusion and stress on the tympanic membrane compared to the most common earplug style hearing protection devices on the market today.  Standard audiometric methods such as Real Ear Attenuation at Threshold, Microphone In Real Ear, tympanometry, and reflectance will be used to perform tests.  Expected results include improved sound isolation, clearer speech recognition, significantly less to no occlusion effect, greatly preferred comfort levels and reduced stress on the tympanic membrane compared to the common hearing protection devices.",

Non-custom devices have their own shortcomings.  The difference in attenuation between two fittings of the same foam earplug in the same worker's ear on the same day shows that while the earplug appeared to be far enough in the ear canal to satisfy a cursory compliance check there is a significant difference in performance.  A good insertion can result in a 30+ dB (a power ratio difference of 1000) improvement in attenuation.  Inconsistency of fit is clearly problematic, but equally worrisome, the shape of a substantial number of listeners\u00c6 ear canals prevents good sound isolation even after careful training and placement. The worker with a bad fit may be lulled into a false sense of protection when he detects slight muffling of high-frequency sounds or when some of the \"edge\" is taken off shrill noise.  But because the poor fit has seriously compromised low-frequency protection, the effective overall protection may approach 0 dB!  Hearing protection is only effective if it fits as intended and is worn properly. \n\nConventional hearing protection is based on the premise that the protection device (including those that go over the ear) can completely seal the ear\u00c6s hearing mechanism from loud sounds that can cause noise induced hearing loss.
