This work focuses on cool giant planets, which are the type expected to be first detected with these techniques (due to their larger orbital distances from the host star).  They will use data collected from direct imaging surveys to test models of the atmospheres, and include clouds, vertical mixing, non-solar abundances, and non-local chemical equilibrium effects in their calculations. \r\n\r\nThis project will also involve public outreach through Lowell Observatory and the American Museum of Natural History, which will develop and present online and in-person programs on the scientific results from direct imaging of planets.  They will also train undergraduate and graduate students in research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe field of planetary astronomy has been redefined by a decade of ground breaking discoveries revealing an exoplanet population spanning several orders of magnitude in orbital distance, mass, and age. However, planet atmosphere characterization has predominantly been focused on a small number of bright transiting systems orbiting old stars. Long period planets revealed by direct imaging surveys are, however, billions of years younger than the typical transiting planet and are providing an important glimpse of the early stages of giant planet evolution. Furthermore, direct imaging allows these planets to be immediately studied in detail. This NSF program focused on developing theoretical models, calibrated by observations, specifically designed to characterize directly imaged young giant planets.\n\nDuring the course of this NSF program, our team used new observations of giant exoplanets taken with state-of-the-art integral field spectrographs on large (8 to10-meter) telescopes.  These spectroscopic observations clearly reveal the presence of atmospheric molecules (e.g., H2O, CO and CH4) and the slopes of the spectra, from the shortest to the longest wavelengths, suggest that every young planet (discovered so far) has a significant amount of atmospheric cloud cover.   As part of our program we developed atmosphere models and the corresponding synthetic spectra needed to infer the atmospheric properties of young giant planets from these data.   The results of our studies indicate that young giant planets have chemical components similar to brown dwarfs; however, the location and vertical extent of their atmospheric clouds can lead to significantly redder spectral slopes than their much older brown dwarf cousins.   Also, we find that the atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratios of young giants tends to be similar to their host stars.  The ratio of CO to CH4 abundances is a strong indicator of non-equilibrium chemistry induced by vertical mixing and our models show clear evidence of strong vertical mixing in nearly every young giant planet.  This work resulted in a variety of peer-reviewed papers. \n\nUnlike transiting planets, planets discovered though direct imaging do not have mass and radius determined directly by observations, and loosely constrained properties such as these can lead to ambiguous inferences about cloud properties and chemical abundances.  Consequently, we also studied brown dwarf binaries to calibrate and test our models.   We modeled a series of free-floating brown dwarf (BD) binaries with atmospheric properties that are similar to young giants and that have precisely measured masses and distances.   Such systems function much like mini-clusters where the two components can be assumed coeval and made from the same material (and thus have the same bulk element abundances).  Furthermore, knowing distances and masses allows very precise ages based on evolution models.   We compared archived data for a dozen BD binaries to our model atmosphere predictions and placed tight constraints on the model parameters governing cloudy properties across the L-to-T spectral type transition.  Our results shed light on former discrepancies between evolution predictions for brown dwarf properties compared to predictions based entirely on atmosphere fitting (e.g., inferred temperatures and gravities).   We found that by allowing sufficient flexibility in cloud properties included in the atmosphere models,  we could usually find good agreement across the various types of model predictions. By pinning gravity and temperature to those determined by evolution models we were able to find a range of cloud properties (cloud depth, vertical extent and average particle size) for the brown dwarfs in our sample along the transition from cloudy to cloud-free atmospheres.   This work resulted in the dissertation of one graduate student and several peer-reviewed papers. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Travis Barman"
