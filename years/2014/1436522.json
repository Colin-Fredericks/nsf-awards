 "awd_abstract_narration": "In contrast to well-studied continental shelves, relatively little is known about cross-shelf circulation on island coastlines typically characterized by steep bathymetry and narrow shelves.  Cross-shelf circulation results in the exchange of water masses and controls the distribution of heat, salt, nutrients, contaminants, sediment, and planktonic organisms like larvae or phytoplankton in the coastal ocean. In addition, in the case of coral reefs, the horizontal redistribution of heat by cross-shelf circulation moderates the daily variations in temperature experienced by coral polyps, thus potentially reducing thermal stress. This study will use existing data sets from two locations and high resolution numerical modeling to study the thermally driven exchange flows and how they vary with cross-shore distance and are modulated by swell energy, shelf slope, nearshore morphology, wind regimes and seasonal changes\r\n\r\nObservations at two reefs at Eilat, Israel and Oahu, Hawaii have highlighted the role of thermally forced baroclinic exchange in cross-shore transport. At each site, daytime conditions were characterized by offshore flow at the surface in response to increased temperatures in shallower water nearshore. Nighttime cooling resulted in offshore flow near the bottom. Significant differences in flow response at the two sites indicate distinct dynamic regimes, however. Time series data from Oahu further indicates that the exchange provides a first order contribution to the overall cross-shore exchange. This study will examine the dynamical structure of thermally driven flows and establish the extent of their influence and generality for tropical coasts by leveraging existing data sets in a comprehensive historical analysis coupled with high-resolution numerical modeling spanning a wide parameter space ranging from a relatively simple wedge case with generally two-dimensional bathymetry (similar to Eilat) to a complex (more typical) forereef-lagoon environment with significant wave forcing (Kilo Nalu Observatory, Oahu). It will provide fundamental understanding of cross-shore transport processes in reef environments and should reveal the extent to which thermally driven baroclinic exchange contributes to cross-shore circulation for tropical coastlines in general.  Improved understanding should lead to the construction of models capable of making accurate predictions of these flows. The results of the proposed research will have particular applicability to ecologically rich and economically important coral reefs and other steep, tropical, coastal environments, such as understanding how reef ecosystems will respond to environmental changes like ocean acidification or rising ocean temperatures, as well as to efforts to protect them like the establishment of marine reserves.",

We use a combination of idealized numerical modeling, theoretical approaches, historical data analysis, and statistical models to accomplish our goals.  \n\nResults from the idealized modeling work indicate that thermally-driven flow is a significant process driving cross shelf exchange in the nearshore coastal ocean and can flush the entire volume of nearshore water several times per day.  The model results show that the influence of thermally-driven exchange is modulated by bathymetry and other coastal forcing (e.g. alongshore flows, winds) and is variable with distance from shore.  Analysis of historical observational data combined with theoretical models help to explain some of the observed time variability in thermal exchange results from the combination of flows driven by daily heating and cooling with tidal timescale flows, which can create fortnightly (14-day) variability.\nThese studies will allow inference of effects of seasonal and climatological variations in forcing on cross-shore heat and mass transfer for reef environments.  Additionally, thermal exchange is a mechanism that shapes the near-bed temperature environment on sloping fore reefs.  Work supported by this project highlights the important role that diurnal time scale temperature variability plays in setting the heat tolerance of corals worldwide, modifying their bleaching response.
