 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing a permanent digital forensics program at Western New Mexico University (WNMU) in collaboration with Auburn University. It is providing a statewide digital forensics resource that currently does not exist in New Mexico. WNMU?s unique combined mission of regional community college as well as regional university provides unique opportunities to explore program integration with New Mexico 2-year law enforcement programs. Deliverables from this project include: \r\n\r\n1. Establish an 18-hour minor in digital forensics as part of the WNMU undergraduate and graduate Criminal Justice programs. \r\n2. Establish an 18-hour graduate certificate program in digital forensics as part of the WNMU Criminal Justice program. \r\n3. Establish an advanced digital forensics training program for New Mexico law enforcement. \r\n4. Conduct Regional workshops for diverse audiences drawn from New Mexico state and local law enforcement agencies as well as students from other campuses. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual challenge for this project is to determine how a small university in a remote corner of a large state can develop, deliver and sustain a technically challenging digital forensics program across a large state. The project is assessing courses learning outcomes as well as elements such as the practicality of course contents, the way the contents is delivered, the lab environment and setup, the effectiveness of projects and assignments, lab assistance quality and inclusion/exclusion suggestions for course contents and projects.\r\n\r\nThis first of its kind program in New Mexico enjoys broad support from the state government. This ensures a broad impact across the state. This program could serve as a model for other underserved states, particularly large, rural states.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcome Report for\n Establishing the New Mexico Digital Forensics Academy\n\nThe project resulted in the development and implementation of the first and currently only digital forensics program in the State of New Mexico at Western New Mexico University (WNMU), an HSI.    \n\nAs described at:  http://behavioral.wnmu.edu/cjus/digital-forensics/ \"An 18-credit hour minor or certificate program provides training for law enforcement personnel in digital forensics; and outreach programs to ordinary citizens to make them aware of the various types of cyber-crimes and how to prevent victimization.\"\n\nThis minor is offered for undergraduate criminal justice majors and as a graduate certificate for WNMU students in the interdisciplinary studies department.    NSF enabled the development of four new three-hour 400/500 level courses:\n\nMIS/CJUS 425/525 Digital      Forensics I \nMIS/CJUS 426/526 Digital      Forensics II \nCJUS 457/557 Forensic Law\nCJUS 401/501 Introduction      to Information Security\n\n\nDigital Forensics I and II are cross-listed in management information systems as well as criminal justice.  NSF also enabled the revitalization of a computer science course that was no longer being taught:  CMPS 440/540 Information Warfare.\n\nBecause of the support received from NSF, we helped WNMU build demand for criminal justice through outreach.  Specifically, we conducted the following outreach activities:\n\n11-15 August 2014, we taught Basic Digital Forensics at WMNU (Silver City, NM). 5 people registered, 3 attended the course.  In January 2015, we taught Basic Digital Forensics in Santa Fe, NM at the NM Law Enforcement Academy (NMLEA) with 17 students. Note that the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy only requires class attendance for continuing education credit from NMLEA. Students were given the choice to accomplish a final exam to receive course credit from WMNU. 3 students elected to do this. Since WNMU charges tuition for this, most participants did not seek course credit.\n\n31 August - 4 September 2015, performers taught Advanced Digital Forensics at the University of New Mexico (UNM-Albuquerque, NM). 48 registered. 43 attended the first day. 26 completed the course. 2 students from WMNU will complete the exit exam for college credit. 9 UNM students will receive credit from UNM.\n\nOur external reviewer, Dr. Martin Carlisle, reviewed feedback for the 31 August - 4 September 2015 course.
