 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this 1-year RAPID project is to re-deploy the Mount Washington (MW) Neutron Monitor (NM), which will subsequently allow the project team to: (i) re-integrate it with the global NM network; (ii) provide data to the world-wide cosmic-ray and heliospheric communities; (iii) with the Durham NM, re-create one of the rare pairs of stations immune to anisotropy effects present during a GLE (Ground Level Enhancements) onset; and, (iv) resume the long-term heliosphere monitoring of the galactic cosmic ray  (GCR) intensity for multi-cycle modulation studies.  \r\n\r\nThe re-deployment of the MW NM would also provide an educational experience for the students of the Berlin High School Vocational Program.  The erection of the shack at the summit is a term project for several students in the School.  Furthermore, undergraduate students at the UNH will participate in the re-deployment effort.  They will participate in ethernet cabling, instrument assembly, testing, software integration and the longer term effort of joining the Mt. Washington data from 2006 and earlier with the current data.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.",
