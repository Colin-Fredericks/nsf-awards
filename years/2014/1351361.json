 "awd_abstract_narration": "1351361 (Yeghiazarian).  Sustainable management of water resources is unattainable without addressing fecal contamination of surface waters, the leading cause of water impairment nationally. Despite over a decade of research, dynamics of fecal sources and contaminants in surface waters is still poorly understood. There is a need for a systems-based theory that can be used to analyze water-contamination patterns as part of stochastic watershed processes. The objective of this grant is to expand the PI's ongoing research and education program in Stochastic Systems-Based Watershed Management & Water Safety (SWMS). The objective of the research plan is to develop a Stochastic Systems-based Watershed Reliability (SWR) theory, with reliability defined as compliance with microbial water-quality standards, and failure as non-compliance. The rationale for this work is that the SWR theory will make it possible to measure probabilistically the impact of watershed components and microbial sources on overall water quality, and to determine watershed characteristics and external environmental parameters to which microbial water quality is most sensitive. This will help (1) identify the \"hot spots\" exerting the highest impact, and (2) quantify sustainability metrics such as reliability, vulnerability and resilience, all of which will, in turn, guide prioritization of management measures under various conditions. The objective of the education plan is to promote understanding of systems-based and stochastic approaches to analysis of environmental systems, and to facilitate a widespread use of the SWR theory in education, research and sustainable watershed management. The rationale is that the education plan will (1) produce a cohort of teachers and students knowledgeable in systems analysis, and able to teach and apply their knowledge to solve a wide range of environmental problems; (2) help water resources researchers, practitioners and decision makers become fluent in utilizing stochastic and systems-based tools, and engage in policy-shaping and decision-making in the probabilistic context. The PI expects to attain her research objective by pursuing three specific aims. Aim #1: Collect fecal contamination data in the East Fork Watershed (EFW) of Little Miami. A targeted sampling strategy will be used to provide data for theory testing and validation. Aim #2: Develop the SWR theory with application to EFW. Systems reliability theory, used for risk assessment of multi-component engineered structures, will be developed for contaminant transport processes in watersheds, and applied to the EFW. Aim #3: Compute sustainability metrics and index, and explore their response to various management options. SWR will be used to compute the reliability, resilience and vulnerability metrics and the Sustainability Index (SI) for EFW EFW?s surface waters. Various management scenarios will be simulated, and their impact on the metrics and SI will be analyzed. The approach taken in this proposal integrates state-of-the-art methods from 3 different fields. Environmental engineering provides methods for quantification and prediction of water flow over the land and in stream networks; ecology provides understanding of microbial population dynamics in various portions of the watershed; and systems engineering provides a well-tested methodology for measuring the impact of various components and system parameters in complex systems. The outcome of this research is expected to impact the design of environmental monitoring and sustainable watershed management strategies. They would become more targeted in space and in time, as better understanding is gained about interactions between different system components and sustainability metrics. SWR theory aims to vertically advance the field towards better understanding of how watershed characteristics, external environmental parameters, and microbial transport and interactions in different parts of the watershed influence surface water quality. The project aims to have a significant educational impact by facilitating the understanding and adoption of stochastic, systems-based tools for watershed analysis among students, teachers, researchers and water practitioners.",
