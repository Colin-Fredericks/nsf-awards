 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has great benefits to society, from supporting new technological developments that benefit humanity to preparing a 21st century workforce.  As societal needs change, our nation?s education system needs to adapt by developing new educational content that stays abreast of changing technology, new ways of teaching that engage computer-literate students, and building on our increasing knowledge of how effective learning occurs.  The workshop funded in this proposal will better allow the engineering education researchers who discover how to improve STEM education to effectively communicate the latest discoveries to those who help devise and implement education policy.  Such communication is critical if the United States education system is to continue to effectively adapt to 21st century challenges.\r\n \r\nTo help build robust communication channels, the workshop brings together leaders and emerging leaders in engineering education, policy makers in both the public and private sectors, and representatives of organizations that impact policy decisions using chain-referral sampling.  The workshop uses a framework designed to develop value propositions that can resonate with the diverse entities that make up the engineering education ecosystem; these entities are represented at the workshop.  In-depth evaluation will  capture actionable lessons that can inform related efforts in other communities.   The workshop has potentially broad impact since it builds capacity for more effectively implementing findings from research into the educational policy decisions that affect large numbers of current and future students.  Participation of the needed diverse elements of the larger engineering education system is addressed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEngineering education plays a large role in supporting the economy and security of the United States.  A rough estimate based on the contributions of technology in GDP growth indicates that every US engineering student who graduates and works in engineering contributes to enough economic growth to create one new job a year over their working life.  While US higher education systems play as vital a role as the power grid, interstate highways, and water distribution in ensuring security and promoting economic growth, this role is often under-appreciated.  This project sought to develop capabilities in engineering educators to better understand and communicate the large systemic impact of their work on issues that are relevant to the American public through holding a workshop at the National Academy of Engineering.\n\n \n\nTo accomplish this goal a diverse group of individuals - representing universities, government, industry, and foundations - met at the National Academy of Engineering to understand the needs of other sectors.  Groups developed and trialed messages to better communicate with other sectors.  How effectively we communicate depends on the mental models we hold. While we often think of STEM education using the analogy of a pipeline this mental model drastically oversimplifies STEM education and may lead to mistaken viewpoints.  In a pipeline model of STEM education, for example, workforce issues are addressed making the pipeline more efficient, e.g. fixing leaks, which makes the task of engineering education relatively clear &ndash; improve retention.  As we learn more about why individuals make choices about their educational pathways such simple models don?t provide actionable heuristics.  At the workshop an ecosystem model was introduced to try to understand how entities across engineering education related to each other.  In this ecosystem model how education is offered cannot be disentangled from how it is funded, changing technologies, and a dynamic work place that is increasingly being changed by technology.  Using this mental model workshop participants help shed light on the various inter-relationships that affect student pathways, job opportunities, funding, and many other factors.\n\n \n\nComing up with a potential model to better describe engineering education is quite different than using that model to either understand engineering education's processes or to monitor the status of engineering education.  To better equip researchers to frame, then address, the types of questions that arise when an ecosystem model is used to understand engineering education a second workshop was held which focused on research methods and tools.  As a result of the workshop a sandbox for adapting survey tools designed for dynamic environments was established and participants self-organized into groups focused around problems related to understanding the engineering education ecosystem.  Future work will start to operationalize the model and test its efficacy.  In brief if we are to continue to develop as a nation and create opportunities for all our citizens we must better understand the complex and dynamic ecosystem that is engineering education; this project contributed to that understanding by framing engineering education in new ways.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan A Cheville"
