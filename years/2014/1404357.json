 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will study the properties of Holmium atoms. The Holmium atom has one of the most complex internal structures of any element and our knowledge of its properties is incomplete. Detailed measurements will be made of the atomic structure of Holmium. Experimental methods using lasers and electromagnetic fields will be developed to prepare different internal states and to measure interactions between Holmium atoms. These measurements and methods will provide a foundation for future applications of Holmium to information processing.  In addition the project will train scientists in modern techniques of atomic physics and prepare them for careers in academia and industry. The results of this research will be disseminated to the local public in the Madison, Wisconsin area through open houses in the Physics department, through visits to local schools, and by providing internships for local high school students. \r\n\r\nThe rare earth element Holmium (Ho) has a 128 dimensional ground state manifold, the largest of any stable atomic isotope. Experiments will use a Magneto-Optical Trap of Ho atoms, recently demonstrated in the Saffman laboratories. Optical control techniques using rf and microwave fields will be developed to prepare specific Zeeman substates in the 128 dimensional ground manifold. Rydberg states will be probed using two-photon excitation and the hitherto unknown quantum defects of the Ho Rydberg states will be measured. The quantum defects will be used to develop models for effective Rydberg wavefunctions which will then be used to calculate Rydberg-Rydberg interaction strengths. The Rydberg state measurements will form the basis for Rydberg blockade experiments with Ho atoms, and the demonstration of entanglement. These studies of the ground and Rydberg state properties of Ho atoms, as well as the development of control techniques, will establish a knowledge basis for collective encoding of quantum registers in small Ho ensembles.",
