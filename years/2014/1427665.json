 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nDirect and Inverse Scattering Methods for Periodic Structures with Arbitrary Profiles and Defects\r\n\r\nPeriodic structures have many applications, such as solar energy, semiconductors, photonic crystals, \r\nmedical imaging, and diffraction gratings. In solar energy, the solar thermal collectors are periodic arrays.\r\nThe surface of a diffraction grating is made up with a periodic array of grooves. Optical waveguides have \r\nmany cells of the same structure. The main subject of the proposed international collaboration is to develop \r\nfast and rigorous numerical simulations and inverse scattering techniques for periodic structures with \r\narbitrary profiles and defects. The research is important to the analysis, design, and optimization of periodic \r\nstructures and has been an active area for many mathematicians, scientists and engineers. \r\nThe proposed research activities will lead to important progress for computational methods and mathematical \r\ntheory for direct and inverse scattering problems for periodic structures with arbitrary profiles and imbedded \r\ndefects. The research outcome will provide physicists and engineers useful tools to treat practical problems\r\nsuch as effect of incidence angle and the shadowing phenomenon of diffraction gratings.  \r\n \r\n\r\nThe first goal of the proposed research is to develop efficient and accurate numerical methods for wave propagation in periodic structures and bi-periodic structures with local defects. Due to the induced perturbed part of the scattered field by the defects, \r\nclassic methods, such as the differential method, do not work in general. Based on the Limiting Absorption Principle, \r\ni.e., the solution for the periodic structure without absorption is the unique limit of the solutions as the absorption \r\nparameter tends to zero, the PI and his collaborators propose to employ an effective recursive doubling technique. \r\nSince the method can be further accelerated using super computers, it is realistic for practical industry applications \r\nwith legions of identical cells for periodic structures.\r\nDetection of a compact inhomogeneity in a periodic structure has been a challenging problem, which is of interest by \r\nmany engineers. For example, defects in memory chips and LCD electrodes have been a serious problem for years. \r\nEfficient and effective inverse scattering algorithms to detect/reconstruct defects are of great practical value. As the second goal, the PI plans to \r\ndevelop effective qualitative methods for the reconstruction of defects embedded in periodic structures.\r\nThe qualitative methods avoid incorrect model assumptions and can provide extremely fast reconstruction. \r\nTo the PI's knowledge, the proposed research is one the first attempts in the inverse scattering community\r\nto effectively reconstruct defects in periodic structures with arbitrary geometric profiles and physical properties.",
