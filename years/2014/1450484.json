 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to advance the knowledge on modeling, analysis, and design of hybrid systems theory with the purpose of enabling the design of future smart grid systems. Hybrid systems are dynamical systems with intertwined continuous and discrete behavior. Such a mixed behavior is embodied in models of smart microgrids and their interconnections due to continuous changes as well as jumps in currents and voltages, i.e., mainly due to controlled switches, failures, and modeling approximations. The approach taken in this proposal is to interpret smart grid systems as the interconnection of hybrid systems with inputs and outputs to facilitate partitioning of the entire system into small, tractable components suitable for modular analysis and design. Such a divide and conquer approach relies upon the existence of a theory of interconnections of systems and on constructive control design tools that guarantee robustness and optimality. The proposed developmental plan consists of generating these control and game theoretical tools for input/output hybrid system models emerging in smart grids.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: The proposed plan will contribute to the knowledge base by generating tools for modeling, analysis, and design of interconnected hybrid systems with input and outputs emerging in future smart grids. It will also advance the knowledge in the main fields tied with hybrid systems, in particular, computer science and control theory. It will uniquely contribute to the field of power systems by providing new methods from the theory of hybrid systems. The proposed methods for interconnection analysis and feedback control design will lead to systematic analysis and control design for input/output hybrid systems, currently lacking in hybrid control theory. These new tools will enable modular design of components that operate robustly and optimally when interconnected in real-world smart grids, such as the smart microgrid testbed at Sandia National Laboratories which is a key component of this project. The framework and theory of hybrid dynamical games proposed for the study of robustness and optimality under adversaries will be essential in developing secure smart grids.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  Collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories will be instrumental in the validation of the new tools and will introduce new problems emerging from the smart grid field to the control community. The proposed research plan is deeply integrated with teaching and training activities that will significantly impact middle and high school education levels by training instructors and students on control engineering and applications to smart grids. In particular, these activities will increase awareness and inform young students of the future energy needs in the world.",

Such a mixed behavior is embodied in models of smart microgrids and their interconnections due to continuous changes as well as jumps in currents and voltages, i.e., mainly due to controlled switches, failures, and modeling approximations. Through a systematic approach with foundations on control theory, tools for modeling, analysis, and design of interconnected hybrid systems with input and outputs emerging in future smart grids were developed. These new methods have lead to novel solutions to problems in modeling, analysis, and control of complex systems, in particular, to power conversion problems faced in the use of renewable sources in power systems. A particular result from this project impacting the power systems field is a new hybrid control algorithm for power conversion using inverters. Given an input &ndash; typically a direct current (DC) &ndash; voltage signal, the inverter produces an alternate current (AC) output signal that approximates a given sinusoidal AC reference signal. The new invention, which resulted in a US Patent, solves the problem of robustly converting highly varying DC power into desired AC power. Advantageously, the precision with which the AC output signal approximates a desired reference AC signal can be adjusted via a tunable parameter in the control circuit, conversion is guaranteed under varying input voltages, and the harmonic distortion is almost entirely eliminated at low frequencies. This type of solutions from this project will pave the road for the design of smart grid systems with robustness and optimality guarantees. Resilient smart grids is of </span><span>high importance </span><span>to society worldwide for which new solutions in the form of distributed algorithms are needed. Through a deep integration with education at all levels and collaborative research, the findings in this project have been disseminated widely at conferences, workshops, laboratories, and other universities, and, very importantly, to the broad community, in particular, through Summer internships to high school and college students, as well as tours and demonstrations to students from underrepresented groups.
