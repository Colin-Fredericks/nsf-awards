 "awd_abstract_narration": "This engineering education research project focuses on involving underrepresented engineering undergraduate students in mentored research activities within research centers with the intent to improve retention and create pathways for academic and research careers.  Students have an assigned department based counselor and a research mentor based in the Center for Applied Energy Research. The proposed activity will advance our knowledge of how to include research center faculty, staff and facilities in efforts to support the undergraduate educational mission of the institutional home of the center.  The PI seeks to capitalize on the low student to researcher ratio within the center and the focus on research activities that will excite the student and enhance their learning.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project is in its intent to build relationships between the undergraduate students and the research center staff.  The cutting edge research being performed on a national level within research centers has the potential to help students see beyond what they learn in the classroom environment, helping them to see the applications of what they are learning to both basic and applied research in their discipline.  This in turn reinforces the importance of their undergraduate curriculum leading to increased interest in, and efforts to, learn new material.  As a result of this project students will become more engaged in learning and will consider careers in research.\r\n\r\nThis project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of integrating research and education to support development of a world-class engineering and science workforce.",

To this end, both objective and subjective parameters ? including retention and performance (in the form of grade point average or GPA) and well as feelings of integration to the university environment and the perception of students of different mentoring relationships ? were tracked, evaluated, and compared between treatment and control groups (i.e., minority engineering students receiving and not receiving research center-based mentoring, respectively). &nbsp;Initial results of assessment showed that both performance and retention were superior for research center-based mentees than for other minority engineering students. A more detailed and comprehensive analysis of the results (comprising the statistical analysis and modeling of the data acquired) confirmed that the treatment group displayed better cumulative GPA than the control group. In addition, mentees reported feeling well integrated into the university environment thanks to the research center-based mentoring program and invariably ranked mentoring relationships associated with this program more positively than others.

The latter projects the impact of this work in two directions: first, towards K-12 minority students to lead them to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) college majors by helping them interact with inspirational individuals; and second, towards other students at and around the institutions the participants join upon graduation by instilling in the mentees the desire to further the cause of broadening participation in engineering. The aforementioned efforts resulted in very tangible outcomes, since the majority of the students that participated in international research experiences decided to pursue graduate studies. In addition, of the K-12 students impacted by this work, the vast majority of the minority high school upperclassmen involved in research through this project decided to pursue engineering studies.
