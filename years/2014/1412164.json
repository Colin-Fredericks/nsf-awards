 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate how a linear sequence of amino acids encodes the three-dimensional structure of a protein. The folding code is of fundamental importance and has clear practical value for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. Solving the folding code will ultimately allow reliable design of proteins with a desired structure and function. A primary barrier to cracking the folding code is that the code is highly redundant. Two amino acid sequences with little resemblance can yield proteins with similar three-dimensional shapes. This project will test the hypothesis that short segments of a protein?s amino acid sequence act like punctuation marks that bias the protein chain to change direction. Placing these punctuation marks in the right places is thus sufficient to establish a protein?s shape. This project will also provide training for one undergraduate student and two graduate students in a broad array of biochemical and biophysical methods. As part of this project, Dr. Bowler will work with the spectrUM Discovery Area, an interactive science center located in downtown Missoula, Montana. The Discovery Area provides hands-on activities to spark excitement about science in K-12 students. Combining computer graphics and physical models of proteins produced with a 3D printer, Dr. Bowler will develop educational modules for the Discovery Area to demonstrate the link between protein structure and function.  \r\n      \r\nThe focus of this research will be a set of small proteins containing two to four alpha-helices in compact bundles. Each protein contains sequences that permit the protein chain to turn. This project will test the hypothesis that the turn sequences bias the shape of a protein even under solution conditions that disrupt protein structure. The project will employ NMR and fluorescence methods, a thermodynamic approach involving formation of histidine-heme loops and computer simulations to test this hypothesis. The research will also test whether protein shape can be evolved by inserting turn sequences into a 42 residue polyalanine sequence known to form a single long &#945;-helix. Finally, the research will test whether protein structure can be devolved by replacing turn sequences with polyalanine segments. Thus, this project will provide important new insights into the role of turn sequences in the folding code.",

However, reliable prediction of tertiary structure from primary structure is still not possible. The ability to directly translate primary structure into tertiary structure would allow scientists to reliably predict protein structure for any amino acid sequence, to design new protein structures or to optimize existing protein structures for stability or function. In this project, this laboratory took two distinct approaches to improving the understanding of this relationship. One approach is based on the assumption that when a protein is unfolded to a random structure by denaturing agents, such as guanidine hydrochloride, that the structure that persists reveals the intrinsic structural biases of an amino acid sequence. The other approach is to use sequence/structure data available in the protein data bank (PDB) to determine the intrinsic structural biases of four-residue sequences in proteins.</p>\n<p>This laboratory used two approaches to query structural bias in the unfolded state. One approach was developed in this lab and takes advantage of the ability of the amino acid, histidine, to bind to an iron containing protein cofactor known as a heme. Theory predicts that the affinity of the histidine for the heme depends linearly on how far the histidine is from the place that the heme is attached to the amino acid sequence. Work with a heme protein, cytochrome c&prime;, shows that disruption of structure in an unfolded protein by mutation of amino acids could be detected readily. To extend the method to proteins that do not contain a heme, proteins were fused to one end of the heme protein iso-1-cytochrome <em>c</em> (Figure 1). Work with these fusion proteins showed that strong biases exist near sequences that are important for turns in the tertiary structure. The second approach involved using the sensitivity of NMR chemical shifts to &alpha;-helix secondary structure. Results with iso-1-cytchrome <em>c</em> showed two of the three &alpha;-helices had significant intrinsic bias to form this type of secondary structure when the protein is unfolded. Work with a three-helix protein, UBA(1), showed that there are long range interactions between &alpha;-helices, also suggesting intrinsic bias in the turn sequences of proteins.</p>\n<p>Results using data on the structural biases of four-amino acid sequences from the PDB show that the data accurately predicts stability changes. In a test case, three mutations were identified that were predicted to stabilize UBA(1). The experimentally measured stabilities were very close to those predicted and the structures of the wild type and one of the mutants were determined by X-ray diffraction methods and shown to be identical (Figure 2).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts</em></strong><em>:</em> Four graduate students and one undergraduate student received training in basic molecular biology, protein expression and purification, biophysical and structural biology methods and computational biology methods necessary to characterize and predict the stability and structure of proteins and their intrinsic structural biases when denatured by guanidine hydrochloride. These students also developed writing and presentation skills necessary to communicate their science to the scientific community. One student completed a PhD and another a MS degree during this project. The PhD graduate currently is a postdoctoral fellow working on prion disease and the MS graduate works for a biotech company. A third graduate student will complete a PhD in the next 6 to 8 months. The PhD graduate and the undergraduate student were both Native American. Thus, significant human resource development of scientific professionals has been supported by this grant, including two members of a strongly underrepresented minority group. The grant also supported significant outreach to the Native American community in Montana, including workshops at middle and high schools with large populations of Native American students and participation in a summer STEM camp for Native American students. The PI also engaged in a mentoring program supported by the NSF that was targeted at improving mentor/mentee relationships with Native American graduate students.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/27/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bruce&nbsp;E&nbsp;Bowler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1412164/1412164_10308591_1585345125067_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1412164/1412164_10308591_1585345125067_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1412164/1412164_10308591_1585345125067_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cartoon diagram of iso-1-cytochrome c with UBA(2) fused to it.
