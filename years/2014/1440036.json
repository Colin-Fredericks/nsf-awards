 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in continental rift systems commonly assumes that lithospheric deformation has a similar scale to and is spatially coincident with the surface expression of rifting. However, ongoing continental extension between Nubia and Somalia appears localized to a narrow rift zone (the Main Ethiopian Rift) only in the thin elastic uppermost crustal lid. At greater depths in both the lower crust and mantle lithosphere, very weak materials appear to accommodate extension by viscous stretching over long length scales at lower strain rates, resulting in highly depth-dependent stretching. This possibility is important because it challenges existing understanding of continental rifting and provides an opportunity to investigate the implications of heterogeneous rheology for continental mechanics. Although the Main Ethiopian Rift has been studied with many, none of the previous efforts have extended far beyond the rift zone to provide a synoptic view of the region. Therefore, no existing data suffice to test for distributed deformation in the Ethiopian Highlands or the Somali Platform. This project combines a large-aperture GPS network and a large-aperture broadband seismometer array with numerical modeling to characterize the lateral and vertical deformation patterns within the lithosphere surrounding the Main Ethiopian Rift.\r\n\r\nThe theory of plate tectonics includes continental breakup as one of its fundamental principles. In the past, continental masses have both coalesced and fractured but it is unclear how continental breakup progresses over space and time, aside from general inferences that this breakup must be very variable in heterogeneous continental materials. The East African region is the best ongoing example of a fracturing continent, but it has mostly been studied in the great rift valleys, omitting any important processes extending beyond the rift. This experiment takes a broader view of continental breakup, studying not only surface rifting, but also deformation far beyond the rift. The results have potential scientific implications for the general understanding of plate tectonics processes and of the fundamental properties of the continents. The results will also help map new geothermal energy resources, earthquake and volcano hazards, and the rise and fall of high mountains and plateaus in Africa.",

Such depth-dependent stretching has been hypothesized to explain patterns of sediment deposition observed in petroleum basins, but prior to this work, has not been clearly observed as an active process. To test the hypothesis we acquired seismic data over two years within the Ethiopian Highlands and the Somali Platform, using 30 seismometers.

We also sought to study the relationship between deformation and magmatism; and to study whether or how magmatism modifies the continental lithosphere over a broad area. Following data acquisition from Spring 2014 to Spring 2016, we analyzed the data by 1) isolating converted seismic phases from the crust-mantle boundary (Ps receiver functions), 2) studying variations in travel-time of seismic waves from distant earthquakes (P- and S-wave body-wave finite frequency tomography), and 3) determining the variation in wavespeed for S-phases as a function of orientation (seismic anisotropy, studied using shear-wave splitting techniques).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of the most significant results is our observation of a second zone of low seismic wavespeed beneath the Ethiopian Plateau, beneath the Lake Tana region of young (Quaternary) basin development, faulting, and volcanism.

We interpret that the low velocity zone represents the original region of upwelling of hot mantle beneath Ethiopia, from which the flood basalts were sourced, and that the localization of rifting and volcanism within the Main Ethiopian Rift since 18 Ma is a younger phase. Our results indicate that the rift valley overlies the highest-magnitude seismic anomaly, with a second zone of low wavespeed beneath the Tana graben, but that the total zone of low seismc wavespeed, and pertubed lithosphere, is ~700 km wide; this width is much greater than the 80-100 km wide rift valley, or the ~20 km wide active magmatic centers. To the northwest and southeast of the perturbed zone, the seismic wavespeed is high. Seismic phases arrive before predicted times using 1d global velocity models, suggesting that this is cold, cratonic lithosphere, unperturbed by the plume or thermal anomaly. We also observe from shear-wave splitting results that the direction of seismic anisotropy rotates away from rift-parallel above the areas of high seismic wavespeed to the northwest and southeast, suggesting that the rift-parallel splitting direction is related to the extensional process, and likely is caused by partial melt, rather than being a regional lithospheric fabric related to PanAfrican suture zones.
