 "awd_abstract_narration": "High elevation topographic plateaus are some of the most important geologic features on the planet. They influence global climate and producing significant earthquake hazards such as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, which killed nearly 70,000 people. However, it is not fully understand the processes that generate these broad regions of high elevation or why such significant hazards exist. In order to understand these hazards, it is critical to study the processes that create plateaus. This collaboration with Dr. Lei Wu at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China presents an opportunity to access data that will allow the characterization of the development of the northwestern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Understanding this margin will give insight into the processes that create plateaus by establishing the geologic relationships of the plateau to the surrounding region. By establishing these relationships knowledge about how plateaus are created and why they present such significant risks will be acquired.\r\n\r\nBy constructing geologic cross sections from existing seismic reflection data gathered in the Tarim Basin northwest of the Tibetan Plateau, this project will characterize the subsurface geology of the northwestern margin of the plateau. Combined with existing work, these cross sections will establish the total vertical offset along this margin, providing insight into the amount of crustal shortening that has occurred on this margin. The total amount of vertical offset will constrain the possible models of development of high topographic relief along this margin. This work will be conducted using open-source data visualization tools, broadening the user base, and enhancing development of, these tools, as well as enhancing the data visualization capabilities of Zhejiang University. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.",
