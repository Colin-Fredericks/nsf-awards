 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Texas Tech University, Midland College, Odessa College, and Mesalands Community College (Tucumcari, NM) are establishing the South Plains Mathematics Fellows program, in which academically talented students from underrepresented, low-income families receive scholarships for undergraduate study leading to a degree in mathematics. Over the five-year life of the program, 52 students will each receive scholarships of up to $10,000 per year. Intense mentoring, focused coursework, and participation in research opportunities are preparing the scholars for successful careers and/or smooth transitions to graduate school. The program is being advertised through websites and in regional high schools, with focused efforts to reach underrepresented student populations. Intellectual merits of the program lie in the comprehensive nature of the program that is supported with an effective recruitement network. Retention strategies include a carefully mentored and cohesive cohort, with new courses and projects to enrich the learning experiences of the students. Mentoring practices are being studied and publishable results should be beneficial to other institutions seeking successful retention of underrepresented rural students. \r\nParticipants get a sense of the work of research mathematics, while students outside the program benefit from new courses. Integration with regional partners is developing a new pipeline for math students. The broader impacts are significant regionally in providing exposure to STEM education to economically disadvantaged groups and in geographically isolated regions with higher populations of Hispanics and first generation college students.",
