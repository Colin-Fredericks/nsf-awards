 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fungi produce biologically active molecules such as antibiotics and immune system suppressants through complex biosynthetic pathways. This research investigates the evolutionary processes that operate in the diversification of these pathways, and thus the metabolites they produce, using the soil dwelling fungus Tolypocladium. Species of Tolypocladium are known to be particularly rich in biologically active metabolites with the best-known example being Cyclosporin A, which is used medicinally to suppress the immune system in organ transplant patients. Recent advancements in genomics and computational biology show significantly greater diversity of metabolic pathways than previously detected by traditional chemical analyses. As such, science has only observed the \"tip of the iceberg\" of fungal biochemical diversity, while the majority await discovery as promising sources of pharmaceuticals, alternatives for the control of insect pests and bioremediation of contaminated soils, and essential in the development of biofuels. A more robust understanding of patterns and processes that have led to the diversification of fungal genomes, and subsequently their biologically active molecules, will enhance the ability to exploit fungi for the betterment of society. This research establishes a case study methodology by which other fungi can be studied and exploited for scientific advancements. In achieving these advancements, students and young researchers are trained in an interdisciplinary manner and equipped to study and develop biological solutions to the challenges of the modern World.\r\n\r\nGenomes of 20 fungal isolates will be sequenced, identifying and characterizing secondary metabolite gene clusters. These genomic analyses will be coupled with manipulative growth experiments and chemical analyses, linking the genetic factors, environment and ecology, with the metabolites produced, and resulting in a metabolite census of this group of fungi. Evolutionary processes and patterns of diversification (e.g., gene duplication-divergence, horizontal gene transfer, gene fusion, diversifying selection) will be tested using phylogenomic methodologies. The analyses will be coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolite profiling, selective growth experiments, and RNA sequencing to link secondary metabolite gene clusters with their metabolites. The specific aims and experimental plan are designed to compare two major hypotheses. The first is that diversification of secondary metabolites results from complex processes incongruent with phylogeny. The second is that homologous domains produce chemically distinct metabolites not previously suspected of having common evolutionary origins. The research determines if the complex patterns of evolution shown by genetically distinct non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases represent homologous domains and genes, respectively, produced by evolutionary processes such as duplication-divergence, horizontal genet transfer, gene fusion, and diversifying selection. The integration of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolite profiling, selective growth experiments, RNA sequencing and phylogenomic analyses will link secondary metabolite gene clusters and the metabolites they produce, showing the evolutionary connection between genotypes and chemical phenotypes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFungi are sources of important pharmaceuticals (e.g., antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins, etc.) that have had a dramatic and positive impact on human health and well-being.  Surprisingly, we know very little about the diversity of natural products that fungi produce; the evolutionary patterns and processes that result in natural product diversity; and the ecological roles that these natural products play in nature.  Importantly, understanding the function of natural products in nature can help inform potential uses and drug development for humans. \n\nThis research advanced the understanding of the diversity of natural products in the fungal genus Tolypocladium, an important group of fungi that is the original source of cyclosporin, the first immunosuppressant that revolutionized organ transplantation.  Tolypocladium includes species that are pathogens of insects, parasites of other fungi, endophytes (inhabit internal tissues) of plants, and are commonly found in soils.  As such, it represents an excellent system for studying the evolution of natural products as a function of ecology and phylogeny.\n\nThis project was transdisciplinary in design and involved comparative and functional genomics, chemical analyses, and computational biology, and cross-trained students across these disciplines.  The genomes of several species of Tolypocladium were sequenced and characterized for biosynthetic gene clusters involved in natural product biosynthesis.  The phylogeny of Tolypocladium was inferred from genomic data, producing our most accurate understanding of the group.  It was revealed that the ancestral ecology of the genus was insect pathogenesis with more recent derivations of fungal parasites and plant endophytes.  Numerous compounds were identified as being ecologically specific or enriched, including cyclosporin in insect pathogens and leucinostatins among plant endophytes. \n\nOne of the major challenges in fungal natural product research is the identification of what biosynthetic gene clusters are responsible for the production of which natural products.  Importantly, identification of these gene clusters is necessary for additional and translational research.  Towards this end, we developed an approach of growing species of Tolypocladium on variable sources of nutrition, and correlating gene expression of biosynthetic gene clusters with natural product production levels across growth conditions.  By identifying what types of biosynthetic gene clusters are up- or down-regulated across conditions and correlating those data with what types of natural products are over or under produced across the same conditions, we were able to develop testable hypotheses linking biosynthetic gene clusters to natural products. \n\nThe data produced by this research will continue to serve as a springboard for understanding the diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for the diversity of fungal natural products.  In doing so, these data will shed light on the roles fungal natural products play in nature and inform potential beneficial uses for human health and society.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph W Spatafora"
