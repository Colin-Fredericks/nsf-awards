 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Coordination Network will investigate pathogens across scales of biological organization with the goal of better understanding of the processes that determine pathogen transmission and disease occurrence. Why do pathogens, even different strains within a species, differ so dramatically in the severity of disease induced in a host? And why do pathogens vary in efficiency of transmission from one host to the next? These questions focus on different biological scales (the host organism versus the host population) yet are inextricably connected in determining evolutionary pressures on pathogens: persistence of a strain is jointly determined by exploitation of individual hosts and by transmission across the host population.  Network activities will build collaborations among microbiologists, immunologists, epidemiologists and evolutionary biologists via workshops and research exchanges. Network members will develop data and tools to: a) identify causes of variation among strains of important pathogens; b) predict pathogen evolution in diverse immunological and epidemiological contexts; and c) design medical interventions to minimize chances of pathogen evolution rendering drugs or vaccines obsolete. \r\n\r\nThis project will bring benefits to multiple stakeholders. For researchers, the Network will provide a database with linked analytical tools, plus ample training opportunities.  For students of biology, mathematics and medicine, the Network will generate teaching modules that convey interdisciplinary skills and insights.  Finally, the Network will promote the development of evolution-proof medical treatments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: Parasitism is pervasive and infectious diseases affect the health and/or evolutionary fitness of all animals on earth.  Biomedicine has demonstrated that parasites (in the general sense, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths and ectoparasites) exhibit variation in the severity of disease induced and also in efficiency of transmission to the next host.  Furthermore, clinical interventions have demonstrated that parasite evolution rapidly renders our very best drugs and vaccines obsolete.  Why do parasites, even different genotypes within a species, differ in the severity of disease induced?  Why do those same parasites vary in transmission potential?  How do parasites balance growth and reproduction? What can we do to evolution-proof our best medical weapons? \n\nOur aim with this RCN was to foster the close interdisciplinary collaboration that is essential to answering such questions and to understanding the evolution of infectious disease agents.  Critically, we brought experts in within-host dynamics together with experts in between-host transmission dynamics.  We found that the combination of expertise across scales of biological organization revealed how natural selection may shape parasite phenotypes, paired with testing evolutionary and ecological models with outstanding rigor. Historical barriers to communication - especially between theorists and empiricists, but also between evolutionary biologists and immunoparasitologists &ndash; was something we were able to overcome in order to take advantage of recent technical advances in both laboratory and statistical sciences.  Our RCN built and nurtured these collaborations in a three-pronged approach: 1) conducted annual workshops, 2) supported 2-3 week long research exchanges, and 3) developed and maintained research and teaching materials that have been made publicly available. \n\nOur annual workshops were successful with key outcomes including: workshop attendees learning about and applying to our Research Exchange Program, workshop participants collaborating on grant proposals (e.g. NSF, NIH), and new research collaborations budding from the interactions at a given workshop. One workshop brought together evolutionary biologists, disease ecologists, epidemiologists, and microbiologists to understand the scope and implications of feedbacks between within-host competition and disease control efforts.

For other researchers, the primary impacts include the generation of an empirical database with linked mathematical and statistical modeling codes, formation of a network for support of research at the interface of evolutionary biology and biomedicine, and training and mentoring of students and post-doctoral researchers via overall participation plus research exchanges.  For students, including pre-medical students, the primary impact is the generation of teaching modules (including syllabi and problem sets) that allow professors worldwide to teach evolutionary biology and/or statistical model-fitting with examples of biomedical relevance. Finally, for society as a whole, the primary impact and translational potential of our RCN arose via evolutionarily-informed medical training and clinical interventions.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrea L Graham"
