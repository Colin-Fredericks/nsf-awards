 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving the fields of tissue engineering and drug/gene delivery is of great interest because these areas are expected to have a significant impact in the medical field and the quality of life for many people. Of particular interest are: healing rates of tissue injuries, the synthesis of frameworks that organ tissue can be grown on, and side effects from inefficient drug delivery, among other areas. Peptide-polymer conjugates, which are a class of biomaterials that contain a peptide sequence (a specific arrangement of amino acids) coupled to a polymer, can be used to improve these biomedical applications. Some peptides arrange into fibers or penetrate cellular membranes, and coupling a polymer will allow for additional properties to be introduced that the peptides do not possess. This research will investigate the coupling efficiency of a variety of peptides and polymers in collaboration with Dr. Sebastien Perrier, who leads one of the most successful research laboratories for synthesis of peptide-polymer conjugates in Monash University in Australia. \r\n\r\nPeptides are capable of self-assembling into fibers and sheets, in addition to penetrating cellular membranes by judicious choice of amino acid sequence. The inclusion of a polymer to either end of the peptide sequence allows for additional functionality to be introduced that amino acids do not possess. This allows for potential improvement of biological functions or the transport of drugs. This project will investigate a series of peptides that are known to self-assemble and undergo gelation or penetrate cellular membranes, and polymers that are either anionic or hydrophobic to aid in biomineralization or drug delivery. The conjugation efficiency between the proposed peptides and polymers using various ?click? chemistry or conjugation pathways will be investigated. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",
