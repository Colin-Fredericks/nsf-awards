 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the American Mathematical Society, of the 1644 PhDs in mathematics awarded in 2012, just 80 were awarded to Hispanics.  Of those, only 13 were awarded to Hispanic women. California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) intends to address the disproportionately low rate of graduate-level success from a variety of underrepresented groups indicated by these and other statistics by implementing a program of comprehensive preparation for undergraduate students aspiring to graduate study in mathematics, the Graduate Readiness and Access in Mathematics (GRAM) program.  In addition to the students supported directly, GRAM will impact the larger CSUF community by providing the faculty with a sustainable institutional framework in which to support graduate school ambitions of CSUF students who are beyond the reach of direct GRAM funding. GRAM will also provide a model for other institutions, particularly Hispanic-serving institutions, for preparing their students to succeed in graduate school.\r\n \r\nThe GRAM program will consist of several components:  (a) a Pre-GRAM program designed to create awareness of research opportunities and graduate school, (b) rigorous content preparation aimed at mathematical readiness for graduate studies, (c) undergraduate research, (d) training for the general and subject Graduate Record Examinations, (e) training and development of problem-solving skills, (f) participation in a variety of relevant professional conferences, (g) cultural and family support, (h) financial support for GRAM Scholars to decrease their work outside of academic activities, and (i) professional development that includes guidance on graduate school decisions, time and stress management, collaboration and networking skills, and skills tied to writing, reading, discussing, and exploring mathematics effectively.  The undergraduate research projects that will be supported will span various fields of mathematics and mathematics education.  Projects will deal with topics such as interpreting algebraic relations in terms of curvature invariants, characterizing elements in semigroups and groups that possess kth roots under a given operation, modeling human vision in detecting tumors using images from magnetic resonance imaging, using biomimetic pattern recognition with hyper-dimensional planes for cancer screening, statistical validation of a cognitive test for multiple sclerosis, and measuring the educational impact of supplemental instruction classes on students and leaders.  This project is supported jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Divisions of Undergraduate Education and Human Resource Development within the Directorate for Education and Human Resources.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGraduate Readiness and Access in Mathematics (GRAM) is a program hosted in the Mathematics Department at California State University, Fullerton to support underrepresented mathematics majors who aspire to pursue a Masters or Ph.D. degree in the mathematical sciences.  Students are selected to the program based on the potential benefit of the intensive mentoring and program activities on their readiness for graduate school.  Nineteen (19) students were participants in the program from 2016-2020, and 18 of them completed all requirements of GRAM, including completion of a research project and thesis defense.  The students also gave numerous presentations on their GRAM research projects at local, regional, national, and international conferences and received extensive mentoring on GRE preparation (general and subject), mathematical problem solving, the graduate school application process, networking skills, time and stress management skills, and other professional development.  Currently, 14 of the GRAM Scholars are enrolled in either Masters or Ph.D. programs at a variety of top-tier institutions across the country.  The remaining GRAM Scholars are still completing their undergraduate degree requirements but remain committed to pursuing at least an M.S. degree in the mathematical sciences.\n\nAll of the GRAM Scholars presented their research orally at a wide variety of mathematics and science conferences, many of them received awards for their presentations, and many of them also published their research either in the Dimensions journal within the College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics at California State University, Fullerton or in an external peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAmong the GRAM Scholars, survey data indicates that 39% were female, 83% identified as persons of color, 72% reported being the first in their families to attend college or university, and 100% expect to obtain a mathematics-related graduate degree.\n\nNine (9) assistant or associate professors in the California State University, Fullerton Department of Mathematics served as research mentors for GRAM Scholars and worked closely with administrators to ensure that the GRAM Scholar(s) they were supervising were on track with program requirements.  These mentors took an active role in the GRAM research community, participated in the GRAM thesis defense presentations, and worked with GRAM administrators to strengthen program components.  \n\nGRAM has had a broad impact on the Department of Mathematics at California State University, Fullerton as well.  In particular, two new courses were developed for the GRAM program that were formally adopted by the department to serve students interested in GRAM or enrolled in GRAM.  The content of these courses included substantial professional development, problem solving, GRE preparation, research communication (oral, poster, and written), networking, and graduate school application training.  These course components and materials will remain in the department and serve future students.  GRAM also fostered a community in which faculty-student research interactions were valued and rewarded.  A significant upswing in research activity in the department since the mid-2010's reflects the contagious enthusiasm for student research that has developed.  Other mathematics majors looked to the GRAM Scholars as role models and received peer mentoring from them.\n\nA primary objective of GRAM has been to place the chosen GRAM Scholars into M.S. or Ph.D. programs following their graduation from California State University, Fullerton.  The outcomes in this regard have been very positive for GRAM, as GRAM Scholars have been accepted or are enrolled in graduate programs at such universities as U.C.L.A., U.C. Irvine, the University of Michigan, Emory University, Virginia Tech University, North Carolina State University, and California State University Fresno and Fullerton.\n\nThe success of the GRAM program is perhaps summarized best by the GRAM Scholars themselves.  One GRAM alumnus wrote: \"I strongly believe that if I hadn't been a part of GRAM, I may not have made it to a Ph.D. program\", while another wrote: \"GRAM helped teach me what usually isn't taught in classrooms, yet is needed for grad school....in my mind grad school was a beautiful idea, but I had no clue what I would need to do to succeed.\"  A current graduate student from the GRAM program wrote: \"Grad school is so hard that I am not sure if I would be surviving it without having gone through GRAM.  My appreciation grows as I continue my Ph.D. program because I am seeing what GRAM prepared me for.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/24/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Annin"
