 "awd_abstract_narration": "This S-STEM project provides scholarships and support to a diverse cohort of 32 low income Biomedical, Chemical and Environmental Engineering (BCEE) students at the University of Cincinnati's College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) who pursue either a research preparation or an entrepreneurship focus.  The project aims to prepare a  diverse groups of students to excel in a rapidly changing, technology-driven world as future faculty, engineers, and technology managers in educational institutions, existing companies, as well as leaders in starting new, technology-based companies.  \r\n\r\nThis project offers BCEE S-STEM scholars four tracks: 1) a MS-ACCEND degree program, in which students earn both BS and MS degrees in engineering; 2) a new Graduate School Preparation track to prepare students earning a BS degree to enter MS and PhD programs; 3) a MBA-ACCEND program, in which students earn both BS and MBA degrees as well as a Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship; and 4) a new Professional Preparation track in which students earn a BS degree and a Minor in Entrepreneurship to prepare them for entrepreneurial activities after graduation.  The project implements four strategies to support and prepare its scholars: cohort building, career driven education, networking, and a defined pathway to graduate school.  An E-Portfolio tool, previously developed at the CEAS, is used to track student performance and participation and to identify students who need early intervention.  The tracks serve as models for programs seeking to incorporate research methods and discovery-based education to improve retention of students in dual-degree programs (BS-MS and BS-MBA), integrate research training into undergraduate engineering education, and streamline acquisition of the skills needed for technical and entrepreneurial innovation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGoal and Objectives\n\nThis S-STEM project was designed to address three challenges:\n\nAnticipated increasing needs for engineers who can do research and engineer-entrepreneurs.\nSome professional societies advocating for requiring MS degree for Professional Engineering licensure.\nLow on-time completion rates for dual degree programs (BS+MS and BS+MBA) in the Biomedical Engineering (BME), Chemical Engineering (CHE), and Environmental Engineering (ENVE) programs at the University of Cincinnati (UC).\n\n\nTo address these challenges, the goal of this S-STEM proposal project was to produce BME, CHE and ENVE graduates from UC who would be among the first to be sought by the academy, industry and investors. To achieve this goal, four tracks, with appropriate student support systems, were developed:\n\nA BS+MS degree program, in which students earn both BS and MS degrees in Engineering;\nA Graduate School Preparation Track (GSPT) to prepare students earning a BS degree to enter MS and PhD programs;\nA BS+MBA program in which students earn both BS and MBA degrees with a Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship; and\nA Professional Preparation Track (PPT) in which students earn a BS degree and a Minor in Entrepreneurship to prepare for entrepreneurial activities after graduation.\n\nProgram Activities\nRecruiting: 35 S-STEM Scholars (including 14 women and 8 minority students) were recruited in three Cohorts.  27 S-STEM scholars (including 8 women and 5 minority students) completed the program.  These students were distributed among majors and tracks as follows:\n\nBME    BS+MS: 4; GSPT: 2; BS+MBA: 0; PPT: 2\nCHE    BS+MS: 7; GSPT: 3; BS+MBA: 5; PPT: 1\nENVE  BS+MS: 2; GSPT: 0; BS+MBA: 1; PPT: 0\n\n\nAcademic Assessment and Monitoring: Several program activities were targeted at academic assessment and monitoring:\n\nScholars were assigned an S-STEM Mentor to complement their degree program advisor, and were required to meet with both their mentor and their degree program advisor once per semester.  \nScholars were required to obtain course progress reports from the instructor for each course taken.  \nScholars completed an annual reflective essay.\n\n\nThe outcomes from these activities were documented in an e-Portfolio.\n\nSocials: Scholars attended monthly socials intended to better prepare them for the academic and professional worlds. \n\nCommunity Engagement: Scholars performed 15 hours/semester of volunteer service related to STEM education.\n\nCooperative Education: All UC Engineering students participate in Cooperative Education; Scholars followed work rotations developed with their co-op advisor.\n\nResearch Courses (BS+MS, GSPT Only): A CHE/ENVE research course sequence (Research Methods I, Research Methods II, and Undergraduate Research) was developed.  The Research Methods courses included a discipline-independent introduction to the scientific method, hypothesis generation, developing research plans, writing proposals and papers, and scientific presentations.\n\nePortfolio: An ePortfolio system was developed as a central data collection point for information from the Scholars.\n\nProgram Evaluation: Students documented each activity using ePortfolio forms.

Research courses were also evaluated using surveys. Graduating seniors were asked to complete a final survey.  UC Evaluation Services collected and evaluated this data and reported results and improvement recommendations to the project team.\nOutcomes and Recommendations\nRetention: 77% of the Scholars recruited completed the program; all graduated with their BS degree.\n\nCompetencies Associated with College Persistence and Success: Annual Essays were scored against a rubric to assess academic self-efficacy, communication skills, persistence to continue in a STEM field, positive future self and growth mindset, sense of belonging to program and community, student approach, understanding of STEM as a career, and utility of courses.  Scholars scored significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) on this rubric in Years 2, 3, and 4 than in Year 1, as expected as the Scholars progress through their program.\n\nResearch Courses: S-STEM Scholars reported they could use the skills and apply the knowledge from the research courses.
