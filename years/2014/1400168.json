Selected specialists with significant contributions in these  areas have been invited and agreed to participate. The PI  makes an effort to ensure that the conference  topics will cover a fine spectrum between purely theoretical and applied topics. The PI plans to get help from university diversity officers in achieving a diversified participation of  the workshop. Ample opportunity for exchanging ideas between graduate students, postdocs, and senior researchers is provided.",
