 "awd_abstract_narration": "South Dakota State University (SDSU) seeks to increase the number of talented STEM teachers in high-need public, secondary schools (grades 7-12) in rural South Dakota.  Over the course of funding, 12 students will receive scholarships during their junior and senior years to complete a biology, chemistry, math, or physics major while pursuing secondary education certification.  Several strategies will be used to recruit and retain these students including (a) initiation of early field experiences for those who are considering becoming teachers, (b) establishment of a Learning Assistants program for students in their second and third years, and (c) employment of face-to-face and virtual platforms to create a network of recent graduates, scholars, and faculty.  A retrospective study will compare the previous cohorts (funded through a Phase I grant) to the new students in order to determine how the project components impact students at each stage of their professional development and which project components are most effective in supporting teachers in rural districts.  This work will be done in collaboration with Brookings and Huron school districts.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are based on a theory of action which posits that research mentoring, student enrichment and support activities, and professional affiliation should contribute to pre-service students' success at each phase of their professional training and development.  Evaluation data from Phase I will be mined and compared to data collected regarding the Phase II scholars.  For the Phase I cohorts, research questions will address the factors that contributed to high quality teacher preparation and translate into the generation of high quality teachers.  Assessment of the Phase II cohorts will follow a Context, Input, Process, and Product model.  All data will be collected using interviews, on-line surveys, work samples, and observation reports.  Dissemination of the project results will provide an example for how to use research as a motivator and tool for training future STEM teachers.  The project team plans to present its work through the annual SDSU Faculty Excellence Celebration Day and at the Joint Annual Meetings of South Dakota Math and Science Teachers Association, and through publication of research and evaluation findings in peer reviewed journals that focus on rural education.  Project deliverables will include results of summative evaluation and the student enrichment materials.",

The results of this research was a Master?s thesis on using social network analysis to examine the connections within the REMAST Facebook group. The survey also provided data on teacher resilience, which has led to a preprint written by the PI team.</p>\n<p>Through scholarships, 18 scholars were funded, 17 of which graduated with teaching certification, and 16 are currently teaching in high-need schools. Although the number of scholarships was less than planned, the quality of these alumni is exceptional. &nbsp;Mentoring of REMAST scholars continues through student teaching by group meetings and book studies. &nbsp;REMAST scholars are involved in two professional organizations, student chapters of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA).</p>\n<p>REMAST has hosted six summer conferences, one of them virtually due to COVID-19. At these conferences national speakers introduce various aspects of teaching to alumni and scholars.&nbsp; Topics included project-based learning, teaching with technology, using cultural relevance in the classroom, and shifting thinking in the classroom. The summer conference continues to be a high-quality professional development opportunity for the REMAST group.</p>\n<p>The PI team, scholars, and alumni have disseminated project outcomes at five Noyce Summit conferences and five Midwest Noyce regional conferences. In addition, scholars and PIs have attended regional NSTA and NCTM conferences, as well as the South Dakota STEM Education conference, which is associated with the NSTA and NCTM at the state level.</p>\n<p>This Phase II grant allowed SDSU to continue the REMAST program that was funded by a 2007 Noyce grant.&nbsp; Through both grants, the REMAST project team recruited, trained, and mentored 64 students, 46 in Phase I and 18 in Phase II. Of these 64, two did not graduate, one graduated without certification, and one graduated with certification but never taught. From FY 2009 to FY 2019, REMAST has produced 16% of the STEM trained teachers from the four SD Board of Regent Institutions that have teacher-preparation programs. &nbsp;Of the 60 teachers produced and who taught, 77% are still teaching, 85% remain in education, and 30% have obtained advanced degrees. Of those teaching or who have taught, 95% have taught in ?high needs? schools.</p>\n<p>The REMAST alumni are strong in content knowledge and participate in professional development to improve their teaching. Their impact on their students is hard to measure, but the number of students can be estimated. Among the 60 alumni that taught at some point after graduating, there are 307 combined number of years of teaching. If during each of those years an alumni taught an average of 50 students, they have encouraged and taught over 15,000 students in STEM since the beginning of the REMAST project.</p>\n<p>The STEM teacher shortage has had a significant impact in rural areas. This project has helped meet some of the need of STEM teachers in the region, but there is more work to do. The REMAST team is committed to encouraging STEM fields through recruitment, training, and retention of rural STEM teachers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sharon&nbsp;S&nbsp;Vestal</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606591829894_REMASTbytheNumbers--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606591829894_REMASTbytheNumbers--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"REMAST by the numbers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606591829894_REMASTbytheNumbers--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"REMAST by the numbers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is a numerical summary of the REMAST accomplishments with the 2007 and 2014 grants.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sharon Vestal</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sharon&nbsp;S&nbsp;Vestal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">REMAST by the numbers</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606590850356_LarryandMattinSt.Louis--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606590850356_LarryandMattinSt.Louis--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Demonstration during NGSS workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606590850356_LarryandMattinSt.Louis--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstration during NGSS workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Browning works with participants on a demonstration during the NGSS workshop at the 2019 Midwest Noyce conference.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Matt Miller</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sharon&nbsp;S&nbsp;Vestal</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Demonstration during NGSS workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606588925015_WinningRollerCoasterImage--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606588925015_WinningRollerCoasterImage--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2016 REMAST Conference Roller Coaster Activity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1439789/1439789_10325118_1606588925015_WinningRollerCoasterImage--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2016 REMAST Conference Roller Coaster Activity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This picture shows the winning roller coaster from our paper roller coaster team activity from the 2016 REMAST summer conference.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">P.
