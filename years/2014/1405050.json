 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David Jonas of the University of Colorado at Boulder is developing two-dimensional femtosecond spectroscopy as a tool for measuring the motions of electrons in ultrafast chemical reactions. The factors controlling efficient transport of charge and energy at the molecular level are not understood, but are important for ultrafast chemical reactions in both natural photosynthesis and light harvesting technologies. The project involves an international scientific collaboration to implement the two-dimensional spectroscopy technique developed at the University of Colorado over ultra-broad frequency ranges using pulsed lasers developed at the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Spain.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on a two-color 2D electronic spectroscopy in which visible pulses excite molecules to their first excited electronic state and short-wave infrared pulses detect electronic absorption. This approach uniquely isolates dynamics on the excited state, which can involve non-adiabatic coupling between vibrational and electronic motions. The project aims to experimentally develop two-dimensional spectroscopy in the short-wave infrared region of the spectrum and use this capability to improve our understanding of carotenoid dynamics and photosynthetic energy transfer. The broader impacts of this work include scientific training of a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher, their exposure to the scientific environment in the European Union, the development of new techniques for measuring electronic dynamics, and potential societal benefits from technologies based on an understanding of the most efficient energy harvesting reactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn absorption spectrum measures how much light at each wavelength is absorbed by a molecule, which quantifies the color that the molecules give in bulk objects.  An absorption spectrum is one-dimensional because it can be plotted on a 1D graph of absorption vs. wavelength.  For twenty years, we have been able to record two-dimensional spectra using femtosecond lasers.  In 2D spectra, excitation at one wavelength causes changes in the absorption spectrum that depend on which wavelength is used to detect the absorption change.  2D spectra are plotted like topographic maps, and show the change in absorption (like elevation) as a function of the excitation wavelength (like latitude) and the detection wavelength (like longitude).  Femtosecond lasers are used to capture rapid changes in molecular absorption that occur as the atoms in molecules vibrate.  In 1D absorption spectroscopy, each wavelength of light in a beam is independent, and light at each wavelength is exponentially attenuated as it propagates through a macroscopic sample.  This is known as Beer?s law, and allows scientists to calculate the 1D molecular absorption spectrum by measuring the 1D absorption spectrum of a macroscopic sample.  Previous NSF supported work found a 3D version of Beer?s law that allows molecular 2D spectra to be calculated from measured macroscopic 2D spectra in some cases.  During this project, we tested this theory against experiment when there is so little time between excitation and detection that the molecular wavefunction is still in a quantum mechanical coherent superposition of states, like Schrodinger?s cat.  This test has verified agreement between theory and experiment for the last untested aspect of the 3D theory, and opened the door to 2D measurements of molecular properties.\n\nFor over a decade, puzzling coherent phenomena have been observed in the 2D spectra of photosynthetic light harvesting antennas.  In photosynthetic light harvesting, the energy from sunlight is transferred to a reaction center where the plant uses this energy to covert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen.  Under low light conditions, photosynthetic light harvesting is so efficient that it can use essentially every photon of sunlight to drive these reactions.  For 80 years, the detailed mechanism of photosynthetic light harvesting has remained a mystery; replicating this efficiency remains a technological challenge.  2D experiments have raised key questions:  Where does the quantum mechanical coherence originate?  and  What does the quantum mechanical coherence tell us about how photosynthetic light harvesting works? .  In previous NSF supported work, we hypothesized that anti-correlated vibrations could be the origin of all the coherences reported in the 2D spectra of photosynthetic antennas.   In this project, we have explored a similarity between photosynthetic light harvesting and the spontaneous lowering of molecular symmetry that occurs after an electron is excited to one of two orbitals with the same energy (the Jahn-Teller effect).  The idea is that one can regard a pair of identical molecules as a single supermolecule and in this supermolecule, the excited orbitals on the two identical molecules have the same energy.  The excitation of an anti-correlated vibration, in which, for example, one molecule expands while the other shrinks, will lower the symmetry of the supermolecule.   During this project, we showed that frequency-matching resonances between electronic excitations and anti-correlated vibrations are robust to many of the known disturbances that occur in photosynthetic pigments and antennas.  In addition, they barely affect 1D absorption spectra, but have profound impacts on the 2D spectra.  In particular, anti-correlated vibrations excited by such resonances match all previously reported 2D signatures and can increase the speed of energy transfer.  This year, 2D experiments by others have verified key predictions of this theory.  There are indications this resonance mechanism may be involved in over half of the light harvesting on our planet, so replicating it could have technological impact.\n\nThis project has partially supported the scientific and technical training of an undergraduate (whose thesis earned summa cum laude honors at graduation), six graduate students (three of whom earned the Ph.D. during this award period) and a postdoctoral research associate.  Specific experimental accommodations supported by NSF enabled one student to carry out laser spectroscopy experiments from a wheelchair.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Jonas"
