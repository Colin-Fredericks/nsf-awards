 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a graduate student mentoring program that is part of the Economics Pipeline Program, which works to broaden participation in the economics profession. The mentoring program helps students from under represented groups navigate a number of critical stages in their development as scientists as they go from the early stages of graduate study through completing dissertation research and starting their first post-doctoral position. Students meet regularly with their program mentors at a variety of professional conferences around the country. An annual workshop brings all participants together for research presentations; this workshop is held in conjunction with a summer program aimed at undergraduate students who are interested in careers in social and economic science. The graduate students therefore both benefit from working with their own mentors and are able to serve as mentors in turn to younger students.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOVERVIEW\n\nSupported by the National Science Foundation, the Economics Mentoring Program?s objectives are to:  (1) increase the number of underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities who complete Ph.D. degrees in economics; and (2) diversify the racial/ethnic demographic composition of the economics profession, including the professorate, through mentoring and providing research and professional development opportunities to minority emerging economists. This program &ndash; one of the key programs of the American Economic Association?s Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession &ndash; focuses on Blacks/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Native Americans who are U.S. citizens and permanent residents in economics Ph.D. programs and new Ph.D.s.\n\nMajor activities include:\n\nThe AEA Summer Mentoring Pipeline Conference;\nMentoring and networking;\nEnhancing collaborative research and professional development; and\nThe AEA Job Market Bootcamp.\n\n\n \n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\n\n \n\n \n\nThe underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minority groups in economics is a concern because academic research and subsequent economic policy recommendations which directly (and indirectly) affect the economic outcomes of these populations are thus often shaped without the perspectives of members of these groups, resulting in incomplete information about what actually occurs \"on the ground\". \n\n \n\n \n\nAnother area of concern is that academic economists teach undergraduate and graduate students from a variety of backgrounds in schools of arts and sciences, schools of public policy, and schools of business and law. Beyond serving as role models for students and other faculty members of all races/ethnicities, having a diverse economics faculty expands the range of perspectives and experiences to which students in economics courses are exposed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBROADER IMPACTS\n\n\n \n\n \n\nThe economic outcomes of traditionally underrepresented minority groups do not only affect members of these groups.  Their economic outcomes impact the U.S. as a whole, more so now than in the past, in light of their significant presence among the general population.  Indeed, given that, combined, members of these groups represent over 30 percent of the total U.S. population, the economic outcomes of these populations affect the entire nation. An increase in number and representation of underrepresented minorities in economics thus leads to more informed public policy formulation, discussion, and implementation.  In addition, because academic economists teach undergraduate and graduate students from a variety of backgrounds, this level of exposure to members of different races and ethnicities serves to offset preconceived notions and stereotypes some students might have about minority populations, which will help prepare these students to work productively in an increasingly diverse and globally competitive workforce.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nPROJECT OUTCOMES\n\nMentoring &amp; Networking \n\nTo foster the development of a broad and diverse network, the Principal Investigator/Project Director (PI/PD) intensified efforts to recruit more underrepresented minority Ph.D. students into the Program.  These efforts resulted in doubling the number of Mentees in the Program, from 30 in December 2014 to 63 four years later.\n\nAt least 30 Mentees in the Program graduated with their Ph.D.s in economics or applied economics fields during the course of this project (Fall 2014 &ndash; Fall 2018).  Another 10-12 are expected to graduate in Spring 2019.\n\nSummer Mentoring Pipeline Conference (SMPC)\n\nThe AEA SMPC brings together the Mentees, their Mentors, other senior-level economists (inside and outside of academia), and the undergraduate students and fellows in the AEA Summer Training Program (AEASP, for underrepresented minority pre-doctoral students).  The SMPC involves: (1) research presentations given by the Mentees; (2) professional development panels/special presentations; (3) the Lewis-Oaxaca Distinguished Lecture delivered by a preeminent minority scholar; (4) short research presentations by the AEASP students; and (5) networking and mentoring opportunities.  Engaging the AEASP students helps ensure that the Mentoring Program and the AEASP are integrated and mutually supportive.  The PD/PI?s efforts to restructure the SMPC resulted in a significant increase in participation over the project period; the number of participants rose from 80 in 2015 to 120 in 2018 (representing 75 institutions/organizations around the country, including Puerto Rico).   \n\nSupporting Research &amp; Professional Development Opportunities \n\nThe Program provides research and travel support for the Mentees to present their work and participate in other professional development activities.  Not counting SMPC presentations, the number of presentations given by Mentees supported by the project support increased significantly, from five (5) in 2014-15 to 11 in Fall 2018 alone.  In total since Fall 2014, the project supported 47 presentations outside of the SMPC plus 24 SMPC presentations.  The number of refereed journal articles published by Mentees in the Program during this Project was at least 12, including in Journal of Law &amp; Economics and Journal of Industrial Economics.\n\nJob Market Bootcamp\n\nLaunched in 2018, the Job Market Bootcamp prepares Mentees for the Economics Ph.D. job market to increase their chances of securing positions best suited to their interests, training, and professional and personal goals. Along with providing job market \"coaches\", the JMB includes such activities as mock interviews; elevator pitches; trial job market presentations; CV/cover letter reviews; writing abstracts; and networking opportunities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marie T Mora"
