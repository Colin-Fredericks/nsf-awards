 "awd_abstract_narration": "Behavioral isolation rapidly evolves between species, yet relatively little is known about the genetic basis of pre-mating reproductive isolation, particularly the role of behavioral genes involved in courtship.  This knowledge gap is important to fill since behavioral cues are generally species-specific and thought to evolve under strong selective pressures.  Using a combination of computational, genetic, and behavioral approaches, the researchers propose to address three main objectives: 1) to identify positively selected genes in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, that are not specifically expressed in the gonads, 2) to characterize the effects of reducing gene expression in adaptive genes on mating and aggression behavior, and 3) to characterize the adaptive genes involved in behavioral interactions by tissue and molecular function.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will extend our understanding of the genetic bases of pre-mating reproductive barriers and their role in early species divergence. Data produced from this proposal will advance the training of students in the areas of genetics, bioinformatics, computational biology, and genomic analysis. Second, this project will implement high school curricula designed to expose students to new high-throughput methods in biology, along with applied hands-on experience using modern genetic and behavioral techniques. Third, the development of a portable high-throughput behavioral lab will be used to increase awareness and engagement in STEM fields to a broader non-scientific audience.",
