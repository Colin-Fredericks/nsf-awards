 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Title: Ultra-Low Power, Collective-State Device Technology Based on Electron Correlation in Two-Dimensional Atomic Layers.\r\n\r\nNon-Technical: Today's transistors cannot meet the demands of ultra-low power, high speed operation required in future digital technologies. Therefore, to enable a continuation of the relentless down-scaling, a transformation of the device architecture must begin with materials that exhibit fundamentally different functionalities beyond the single electron excitation in traditional semiconductors. Strongly correlated 2D materials, where the electronic phase transformation and collective excitation that determine the electronic response, and devices based on these materials (Landau switch), have the potential to become the successor of the conventional silicon technology. The logic operation is based on completely different mechanisms and the successful realization of the Landau switch concept will extend the road map of low power digital and analog circuits with large societal impact affecting both governmental and commercial sector. Our academic-industry partnerships will provide a close link to large-scale manufacturers of advanced materials and devices, thus ensuring a critical evaluation of manufacturability and large scale production while fundamental science and engineering is performed throughout the proposed research efforts. We will support four graduate students and one post-doctoral fellow, who will take full advantage of the interdisciplinary, multi-institutional, government, and industrial R&D environment provided by this collaboration. Mandatory internships at partnering institutions will enhance their educational experience, and each will participate in outreach programs designed to enhance STEM education. \r\n\r\nTechnical: This research will develop a \"post silicon\" transistor that operates on the principle of strong electron correlation and the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials.  To achieve this goal we will: 1) develop theory to predict the nonlinear electronic response in correlated 2D materials, 2) introduce novel synthesis routes and doping strategies, 3) utilize advanced nanoscale characterization techniques 4) develop unique device concepts enabling steep sub-thermal switching characteristics beyond the single particle excitation limit, explore advanced device fabrication and characterization, and 5) benchmark device performance and reliability against complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology.  The proposed strategies build upon our successful development of large area synthesis, integration, and characterization of two-dimensional layered materials, theory, and characterization of materials and devices exhibiting collective electron phenomena. The themes that form the core research and outreach program are: 1) Demonstrating the first electric-field induced, reversible, phase transition in a three terminal transistor based on 1T-TaS2-xSex. [EFRI Thrust Area 1]; 2) Understanding the fundamental role of defects, dopants, functionalization, and heterogeneous integration on the electronic properties of 2D correlated systems. [EFRI Thrust Area 1]; 3) Optimizing synthesis techniques for scalable nano-manufacturing of high quality 2D layered materials. [EFRI Thrust Area 2]; 4) Developing advanced theoretical models to predict electron-electron, electron-lattice and electron-impurity interaction and its impact on electronic structure, transport phenomena and ultimately device characteristics [EFRI Thrust Area 3]; 5) Educating the next generation through a series of novel education programs focused on broadening participation and providing unique research opportunities to underrepresented minorities via collaborations with international faculty, government laboratories, and industrial partners.
