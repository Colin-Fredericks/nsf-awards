 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support student travel to the sixth Midwest Verification Day (MVD), to be held at the University of Missouri-Columbia in October 2014. MVD is an informal regional workshop with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in verification and formal methods. The funds will help support U.S. based students, with a special focus on PhD. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend MVD. \r\n\r\nSupporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area. An event like MVD is a helpful stepping stone on the way to successful engagement with the broader international research community.",
