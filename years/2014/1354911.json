 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most life on Earth follows a daily routine guided by predictable environmental cycles (light and dark, temperature changes etc.).  Some aspects of the routine are controlled by external cues while some are maintained using circadian rhythms.  These internal, self-sustained clocks with a periodicity of about 24 hours allow microbes, animals and plants to anticipate and prepare for daily fluctuations.  Recently, self-regulated clocks composed of one or a few proteins have been discovered, suggesting that genes for a robust clock can be readily acquired.  Thus far, true bacterial clockworks have been characterized only in phototrophs (that harvest energy from sunlight), but other bacteria would likely benefit from an internal clock.  Specifically gut microbes, with a clock that allows them to anticipate changes in host activities, would have an advantage over bacteria without a clock.  Shift workers often suffer intestinal discomfort and weight gain.  Gut microbes out of sync with their human host may be contributing to these unwanted physiological changes.  Uncovering a gut microbe circadian clock would inform targeted remedies to combat undesirable physiological changes that accompany our modern lifestyles.\r\n\r\nTo date, the complexity of gut microbial communities and lack of any readout for daily processes have hampered the ability to observe regular functions in most gut microbes.  To circumvent these issues, wild surgeonfish and their intestinal bacteria will be used as a natural model system to describe daily metabolic and developmental cycles.  One group of Firmicutes, Epulopiscium spp. and related epulos, are naturally occurring, abundant intestinal symbionts that produce conspicuous internal offspring once every 24 hours in a predictable process.  This provides a meter of everyday physiological changes in natural symbiont populations. Daily physicochemical changes in the intestinal ecosystem will be characterized to uncover regular fluctuations that may be used for entrainment.  Symbiont oscillations will be determined by analyses of their temporal transcriptome and the cyclical redox cycle of a widely distributed clock protein.  The project provides training opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate researchers.  An undergraduate Reciprocal Exchange Program will be developed to build a cooperative learning group that will contribute to the research project while building networks and skills for advanced training.  Native Pacific Islanders and other groups that are underrepresented in the sciences will be specifically recruited for these opportunities.  Project results will uncover fundamental modes by which gut symbionts coordinate their activities with those of their host.",

True circadian rhythms have been described for diverse eukaryotic organisms from plants to fungi to humans.  A circadian clock that directs the daily pattern of gene expression has only been described in one group of bacteria, the cyanobacteria.  We suggested that other microorganisms, particularly symbionts, might benefit from having a circadian clock that would allow them to anticipate the daily changes in their host environment.  We explored groups of symbiotic bacteria that live inside the intestinal tracts of wild caught surgeonfish. These giant bacteria, Epulopiscium spp. and their close relatives (called epulos), exhibit daily reproductive cycles that parallel the daily activity of their host fish; these bacteria produce internal offspring that grow during the day, when their host fish is active and consuming algae.  By exploring the daily transcription of genes in these populations of bacteria, we discovered that both the daily reproduction program and the metabolism of the bacteria are coordinated with the activity of their host.  We found no evidence for a circadian clock in these bacteria.  Instead, we found that members of the Firmicutes or Bacillota are especially well suited for life inside the gut of an animal. \n\n \n\nThis project provided substantial training opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate student researchers and included the Reciprocal Exchange Program.  This allowed students, born and raised in Hawaii and Cornell students to work collaboratively in the field, collecting fish and bacterial samples at the Hawaiian Institute of Marine Biology.  The team then traveled to Cornell University in upstate New York to work with the samples they had collected in Hawaii.  They used skills learned in the field and in the lab to explore bacterial population diversity in fixed intestinal samples from surgeonfish.  They also used genetic approaches to uncover genes for enzymes to degrade algal polysaccharides.  These genes were present in the intestinal community of Hawaiian surgeonfish, and were predicted to target polysaccharides in the algal diet of the host.  The six undergraduate students who participated in the program are now in graduate school or are employed in conservation or microbiology.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Esther R Angert"
