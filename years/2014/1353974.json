 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of California, Riverside to develop \"microfluidic building blocks,\" a library of parts that can be connected to build custom microfluidic instruments quickly and easily.  Microfluidics (the manipulation of fluids on the microliter scale) has enabled important applications in the biological and health sciences, but currently each of these applications uses a custom-made microfluidic \"chip\" designed and fabricated by a specialist trained in the art of microfabrication using costly and specialized equipment.  This highly custom nature of microfluidics has slowed the spread of microfluidic technologies into new applications in the biological sciences.  The \"microfluidic building blocks\" developed in this project enable non-experts to rapidly build custom instruments for their own research needs.  Each block performs an elementary microfluidic function like valving, mixing, storing fluids, measuring cell size, or measuring optical density.  Using standardized interfaces, the blocks can be literally \"clicked together\" to build a custom microfluidic instrument without specialized training or equipment.  Through collaborations with colleagues in several different fields at UC Riverside and journal and conference presentations in their respective fields, microfluidic building blocks will be disseminated across the bioscience community.\r\n\r\nBy allowing any scientist or engineer to assemble custom microfluidic instruments without specialized training or equipment, microfluidic building blocks have the potential to accelerate research progress throughout science and engineering.  In resource-limited areas, doctors and nurses could use a supply of microfluidic building blocks to construct diagnostic or therapeutic instruments tailored for their own unique needs.  Additionally, as educational tools, microfluidic building blocks could enhance science and engineering curricula from grade school through university.  By assembling blocks into working instruments that accomplish certain tasks, students can learn principles of physics, chemistry, and biology.  In summary, microfluidic building blocks have the potential to both enhance existing research in science and technology and prepare the next generation of the STEM workforce.",

Rodgers led the development of the <strong>MEC System</strong>, a library of \"building blocks\" that can be clicked together to build functional research instruments. &nbsp;Each MEC block performs a basic function found in many bioscience instruments, functions like pumping, valving, sensing, and interfacing with the user. &nbsp;Using MEC blocks, individuals with no engineering expertise can assemble custom instruments for their own unique needs, quickly and economically.</p>\n<p>Thus far, over 500 different MEC blocks have been designed and fabricated. &nbsp;The blocks adhere to an open design standard published online; researchers across the country can use this standard to develop their own MEC-compliant blocks. &nbsp;Thus far,&nbsp;MEC blocks have been used to build a variety of different instruments, including bioreactors for culturing cells, acid-base titrators, serial diluters, cell sorters, and toxicity testers.</p>\n<p>In addition to their value in constructing research instruments, MEC blocks are playing an important role in K-12 science education. The Principal Investigators have initiated a collaboration in which MEC blocks will be used in Inland Southern California&nbsp;high school science classrooms. &nbsp;In these classrooms, students will use MECs to construct and use the tools of modern bioscience. &nbsp;This experience will satisfy the Next Generation Science Standards' requirement that science teachers offer engineering Practices to their students. &nbsp;It will also open these students' eyes to prospects for jobs in the growing field of biotechnology.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in this project the Principal Investigators launched a new research and education center at the University of California, Riverside. &nbsp;<strong>The TEC Center </strong>(http://evolutionarycomponents.org)&nbsp;was formed to provide research experience to large numbers of UC Riverside undergraduates. &nbsp;In the TEC Center, undergraduate students from a wide variety of majors use MEC blocks to build instruments and contribute to research projects. &nbsp;Since the MEC system lowers the barrier to involvement in research, even first-year undergraduates have successfully performed research in the Center, and in 2016 the Center welcomed its first high school participant. &nbsp;Since its founding in 2015, the TEC Center has already provided over 50 undergraduates with valuable hands-on research experience, and several graduates of the Center are now employed in biotechnology companies or admitted to science or engineering graduate schools or medical schools.</p>\n<p>The development of the MEC system led to other important discoveries and developments. &nbsp;For example, while developing a 3D-printed MEC block for use in toxicology studies, a member of our team discovered that the 3D-printed blocks were toxic to zebrafish embryos. &nbsp;This discovery led to the <strong>first study of the toxicity of 3D-printed parts</strong>. &nbsp;In this study, we found that parts from the second-most-common type of 3D printer, stereolithography printers, are essentially fatal to fish embryos. &nbsp;We also developed a simple post-printing treatment---exposure to ultraviolet light---that largely mitigates the toxicity of the 3D-printed parts. &nbsp;After these results were published, we were surprised by the number of emails and phone calls we received from 3D printer users who were concerned about the safety of their printers. &nbsp;To address these concerns and better inform 3D printer users, we created <strong>the PrintSafe Project</strong> (http://printsafe.org), an online clearinghouse for information about safe use of 3D printers.</p>\n<p>In another result of this project, we discovered that when fluids of different densities flow together through a microfluidic channel, the fluids quickly reorient themselves to place the more-dense fluid on the bottom and the less-dense fluid on the top. &nbsp;This observation formed the basis for two useful techniques. &nbsp;In the first technique, <strong>we used the orientation of a microfluidic chip to control the flow of fluid on the chip</strong>. &nbsp;This approach can significantly reduce the cost and complexity of microfluidic instruments by

&nbsp;Using this block, particular types of cells can be identified and removed from a complex sample. &nbsp;This is a valuable capability in biological research and medical diagnostics.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also developed a novel way to <strong>create custom microfluidic chips without actually designing them</strong>. &nbsp;We accomplished this by generating a large

purpose, the user can simply query the database using a web interface (http://random.groverlab.org) to find an appropriate chip design in just a few seconds. &nbsp;In this manner, individuals with no
