 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued support for participants in the research training group (RTG) in geometry and topology at the University of California at Berkeley.  The program will be led by six faculty members (Ian Agol, Denis Auroux, Michael Hutchings, John Lott, Peter Teichner, and Constantin Teleman), who will work in collaboration with other members of the Mathematics Department to build on the success of the previous RTG project by further enhancing the training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. The previous project incorporated a number of mechanisms for training enhancement, some of which worked better than others. The group will expand on the successful mechanisms and try follow-up innovations. \r\n\r\nWith geometry and topology becoming ever more multifaceted and technical, it is difficult for students to acquire the tools they need for research. The activities of this research group will benefit trainees at all levels, beginning with a strong effort to recruit undergraduate students into research, continuing with seminars and hot topics courses to train graduate students in the latest techniques, and finally including mentoring to help postdoctoral fellows to launch their research careers. The mechanisms to provide such training will include an undergraduate research class during the school year taught by graduate students, a summer undergraduate research program run by graduate students under the guidance of senior faculty, undergraduate mentoring by postdoctoral fellows, a background seminar for graduate students and others, a geometry and topology colloquium, hot topics courses taught by senior faculty, summer graduate workshops taught by postdoctoral fellows, and an exchange program with the Max-Planck-Institute in Bonn. The project will involve approximately three postdoctoral associates, twelve graduate students per year, twelve undergraduates in each of the undergraduate research programs, and thirty participants in each of the summer graduate workshops. The proposed training activities will increase the number of US citizens and permanent residents entering and continuing in mathematics research, both directly and indirectly: directly via the recruiting and support of the trainees in the group, and indirectly via the establishment of models for research training that can be emulated elsewhere.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Berkeley geometry/topology RTG was a resounding success.  The money went to furthering the careers of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs.  This was done through both direct support and organizing activities.  \n\nThe bulk of the support went to funding one-semester graduate student research fellowships, and three-year postdocs.  Dissertations were written by the following graduate students with RTG support: Alexander Appleton, Catherine Cannizzo, Kevin Donoghue, Ben Filippenko, Chris Gerig, Andrew Hanlon, Aaron Mazel-Gee, Chris Policastro, Wolfgang Schmaltz, Morgan Weiler, and Patrick Wilson.  \n\nThe dissertations of Nic Brody, Charles Cifarelli, Theodore Coyne, James Dix, Ethan Dlugie, Michael Klug, Larsen Linov, Kiran Luecke, Holly Mandel, Kyle Miller, Eugene Rabinovich, Michael Smith and Luya Wang are in progress.\n\nGraduate students and postdocs with RTG support have 55 papers published or submitted.  \n\nRegarding the specific goals of the RTG proposal,\n\n1. An undergraduate research class during the school year taught by graduate students:  We offered Math 191, \"Experimental Courses in Mathematics\" during the spring semesters of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.  This undergraduate course was taught by a graduate student, under the guidance of a faculty member, and covered a topic in geometry/topology that was suitable for math majors.  The format consisted of some introductory lectures by the instructor, a minor project for each student and a major project.  The students got a research-like experience working on open-ended projects, which however were not required to be about unsolved problems.  The responses were overwhelmingly positive, both from the students and the instructors. \n\n2. A summer undergraduate research program run by graduate students under the guidance of senior faculty: We ran eight-week undergraduate research programs in the summers of 2015, 2017 and 2018.  In each case, two graduate students offered two different research topics.  Regular Berkeley faculty gave guidance and gave invited lectures.  Each summer program had around twelve undergraduate students.\n\n3. A background seminar for graduate students and others: The topology seminar changed its format so that invited speakers gave a background seminar on Wednesday at 2PM, in additional to the regular seminar on Wednesday at 4PM.  The background seminars were well attended by graduate students, postdocs and some faculty.  The speakers made an successful effort to give background seminars that were suitable for graduate students.\n\n4. Hot topics courses taught by senior faculty: We offered the following classes on topics of current interest:\n\nSpring 2015, John Lott, Ricci flow\n\nSpring 2015, Peter Teichner, Gauge field theory\n\nFall 2015, Katrin Wehrheim, Donaldson-Floer theory\n\nSpring 2016, Peter Teichner, Factorization algebras\n\nSpring 2016, Michael Hutchings, Applied holomorphic curve theory\n\nSpring 2017, Richard Bamler, Ricci curvature\n\nFall 2017, Ian Agol, Knot invariants\n\nSpring 2018, Song Sun, Complex/Kaehler geometry\n\nSpring 2020, Katrin Wehrheim, Categorical structures in symplectic geometry\n\nFall 2020, Nicolai Reshetikhin, Poisson geometry and Hamiltonian integrable systems\n\nFall 2020, Richard Bamler, Ricci flow\n\n5. Summer graduate workshops taught by postdocs: We offered two summer graduate workshops.  In Summer 2015, the postdocs Kathryn Mann and Bena Tshishiku taught a one-week workshop on Diffeomorphism Groups.  In Summer 2017, our faculty member Katrin Wehrheim and the postdocs Nate Bottmann and Joel Fish taught a one-week workshop on Polyfold Theory Towards the Fukaya Category.  In each case, around 30 graduate students attended. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John W Lott"
