 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) of about 15 promising graduate students from the United States and abroad, along with 6 distinguished research faculty mentors.  The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2014 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2014), which is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI) and will be held April 26-May 1 in Toronto, Canada.  The annual CHI conference is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and is attended by approximately 3,400 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected research publications in the field of HCI.  More information about the conference is available online at http://chi2014.acm.org.\r\n\r\nThe Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants will present their work during the two full days of the Consortium on April 26-27.  Each student will have a 45-minute time slot in which to make a formal presentation and receive feedback from the faculty panel, which is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  The program for the two full days of the Consortium will also include substantial informal opportunities for discussion and additional feedback, with follow up activities planned during the technical program of the conference.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2014 Extended Abstracts, which is distributed to all conference registrants and included in the ACM Digital Library.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the event, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.  The CHI doctoral consortia have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars; many of today's leading HCI researchers participated as students in earlier consortia.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees.  In accordance with CISE policy, NSF funds will be used solely to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States, although there will also be a number of international participants in recognition of the fact that the HCI field embraces educational and cultural traditions that vary in different parts of the world.  The organizers have undertaken to work to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified participants; as a consequence, the student and faculty participants will constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, which will help broaden the students' horizons to the future benefit of the field.  To further promote diversity no more than one student will be accepted from any given institution, except in the case where including a second student from the same school would allow a woman to be a participant.",
