The project examines the strengths and weaknesses of four computational approaches: topic models, network-based partitioning methods, Wikipedia-based labeling, and an active-learning approach. In particular, the research examines whether or not the different approaches can correctly classify established research areas and discover emerging fields across a broad range of disciplines.  Each approach is evaluated based on a set of metrics measuring effectiveness, computational costs, human oversight costs, and the need to retain consistency with existing classification frameworks. \r\n\r\nThe work directly responds to a number of National Academies recommendations and National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) reports that suggest using computational approaches to classify scientific research fields. A longer-term impact is improvement in data collection, processing, and reporting of key national statistics on science and engineering.",

First, we&nbsp;were able to directly identify and extract methods from grants (and papers) with significantly higher precision, and substantially greater (more than double) recall of any other published method. This approach drew on the implicit crowd-sourcing of the web, and specifically involved classifying methods as a function of text on pages that described them as methods or in methodological contexts. Paired with advanced topic modeling approaches, we were able to characterize grants, from abstracts alone, across both the National Science Foundation and beyond it in Federal Register as a whole. We show how this kind of analysis reveals opportunities for method sharing across many co-located grants, which has not previously been possible.</p>\n<p>Second, we used contemporary neural network auto-encoders for text embedding to interrogate the nature of the grant proposal, grant abstract and summary, and research article as discursive artifacts, in order to enable more effectively extract and index many of their semantic facets, ranging beyond methods, described above, to their research focus, topics solved, and broader impacts. We did this by projecting sections of abstract, proposals and articles (e.g., &ldquo;abstract&rdquo;, &ldquo;introduction&rdquo;, &ldquo;literature review&rdquo;, &ldquo;methods section&rdquo;, &ldquo;findings&rdquo;, &ldquo;discussion&rdquo;, &ldquo;conclusion&rdquo;) across many fields into a single latent space and identifying the regularity with which these sections were distinct from each other and in precisely what ways.</p>\n<p>Third, we developed high performance and novel topic modeling techniques to identify textual or discursive influence across millions of articles, which will has (and will continue to) enable the identification and classification of those facets (e.g., methods, topics, etc.) responsible for that influence. This approach to the identification of direct scholarly influence allowed us to &ldquo;diagnose&rdquo; the cognitive and political bias of citations, and to use this discursive measure alongside citations to both capture a full-spectrum influence, and also to identify its source. For example, important dataset contributions are almost always captured by citations and not discourse, while popular new concepts are often captured by discourse, but not citations, especially if they originated beyond one&rsquo;s field. The paper associated with this last contribution was published in PNAS in 2018, while the earlier two contributions are still winding their way through the review process.</p>\n<p>In summary, this grant has enabled us to &ldquo;move the needle&rdquo; to identify grant proposal and abstract facets that could allow the federal government to account for, index, and manage its research as a portfolio. We believe that these measurements, alongside straightforward analysis of the data that results, could lead to a more efficient and opportunistic use of resources such that more of the best science could be performed with the same amount of funding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/21/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Evans</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422902/1422902_10340273_1526876294801_ScreenShot2018-05-20at11.16.07PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422902/1422902_10340273_1526876294801_ScreenShot2018-05-20at11.16.07PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of research topics and methods\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422902/1422902_10340273_1526876294801_ScreenShot2018-05-20at11.16.07PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of research topics and methods\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Methods are clear, and methods are in color.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hyunzoo Chai</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">James&nbsp;A&nbsp;Evans</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Map of research topics and methods</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422902/1422902_10340273_1526827085947_ScreenShot2018-05-20at9.37.14AM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422902/1422902_10340273_1526827085947_ScreenShot2018-05-20at9.37.14AM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Map of domains and methods in NSF\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1422902/1422902_10340273_1526827085947_ScreenShot2018-05-20at9.37.14AM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Map of domains and methods in NSF\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each colored node represents a method and is connected to at least one of NSF domains.
