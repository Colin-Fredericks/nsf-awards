 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) seeks to establish a CyberCorps(R): Scholarship for Service (SFS) Program producing approximately ten SFS students per year for government service to help secure, protect and defend our Nation's information systems.  UAH's SFS Program spans engineering, science and business administration, giving students options to choose a technical direction of most interest to them.  The University, a Carnegie Foundation Very High Research Activity University, is located adjacent to government and Department of Defense organizations at Redstone Arsenal.  Recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities is a priority for the Program.\r\n  \r\nThe Program introduces Information Assurance (IA) topics into the curriculum from the freshman experience through graduate work.  The IA topics are introduced in the context of specific courses, such as database systems and operating systems.  Many of the courses include practical experiences to provide students with real-world learning opportunities.  The Program is supported by a network security lab in the Department of Computer Science, a Safety and Security Lab in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and a Digital Forensics Lab in the College of Business.  An active learning philosophy is used during laboratory activities to help students acquire and retain skills.  Research opportunities include security of big data, industrial control system security, cybersecurity business processes, safety, aviation security, digital forensics, and automotive security.",
