 "awd_abstract_narration": "Across the United States, cities have become testing grounds for policies designed to promote market-based solutions to problems in public education.  These initiatives commonly rely on the institution of charter schools, which are publicly funded but often privately managed and only minimally accountable to locally elected entities.  This research project examines place-based challenges to charter reform through analysis of the attempts of four New Orleans neighborhood-based groups to re-open schools in their communities.  With 90 percent of its public school students currently enrolled in charter schools, New Orleans has been a major testing ground market-based reform, and of the ways such reforms might be contested.  By focusing on the ability of neighborhood-based groups to address schooling concerns in the public sphere, this project will enrich understanding of place-based social movements, expand the range of concerns commonly addressed in discussions of public education policy, and support ongoing efforts to create more democratic urban spaces through collective inquiry and action.  Because schools serve a variety of social, political, and economic purposes, the effects of school reform reach far beyond the school house walls.  As they re-work essential aspects of daily life in cities, market-based school reform efforts have provoked intense struggles over the purpose and provision of schooling and the role of community members in influencing urban education policy and practice.\r\n\r\nThe project will use multiple methods, including document analysis, participant observation, and interviews in order to examine how group members develop, understand, and pursue their schooling agendas under the post-Katrina charter school regime in New Orleans.  The specific research questions include: How do neighborhood schooling groups frame their grievances with respect to the effects of neoliberal schooling policies and what counter discourses are advanced in support of neighborhood schooling?  What strategies do neighborhood schooling groups use to insert those counter discourses into a larger public sphere and to what effect?  How are race, class, and gender implicated in these struggles?  What learning is taking place in these place-based efforts to realize particular schooling agendas and what are the democratic implications of both the processes and results of their activities? The proposed research provides (1) an empirical analysis of the possibilities for producing schooling alternatives to neoliberal policies through collective action initiated at the neighborhood level, (2) a socio-cultural counterpoint to existing political-economic arguments regarding how and why people become involved in such movements, and the ways that place and race inform strategy and the ability to achieve desired goals, and (3) an analysis of how people learn to do democratic work, including identifying and framing common problems, constructing space for social inquiry, negotiating difference, and navigating uneven power relations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSince Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans has been a testing-ground for reforms that replaced neighborhood schooling with a decentralized all-charter school model.  These reforms privatized many aspects of school operations, insulated school governance from public oversight, and forced both schools and parents to compete for limited resources. Supporters argue that the level of dysfunction in neighborhood schools required the massive changes associated with post-Katrina reform.  But the result has been a schooling landscape characterized by disconnection from neighborhood residents, governance and staffing turmoil, and uneven access to educational services. This type of upheaval disrupts the lives not only of individuals, but of communities.  In response, there have been determined efforts on the part of neighborhood groups and others to gain more control over neighborhood schools.\n\n Drawing on mixed qualitative methods and document analysis, this project examined the attempts of three such groups to address neighborhood-schooling concerns in the public sphere.  As described below, the study sheds light on both the depoliticizing mechanisms associated with urban school reform, and democratic practices that repoliticize neighborhood-school issues.   \n\nBecause they dovetail with efforts in other sectors to redefine the role of the local state, marketize public goods, and discourage collectivity, scholars have tended to characterize post-Katrina school reforms as manifestations of urban neoliberalization.  Analysis of reform narratives circulated by a network of powerful local and national reform advocates reveals that while such a framing is warranted, it also obscures the ways in which the reforms extend a long history of racialized socio-spatial violence in New Orleans. This research identifies two distinct yet mutually reinforcing narrative strategies for depoliticizing the reforms.  On one hand, reform narratives depoliticize reforms by presenting them as a technical solution to a technical problem which must be managed by experts.  However, in justifying the need for this technical reform, a second depoliticizing narrative strategy racializes incompetence and moral decay, denigrating black political subjectivity and black geographies and thereby delegitimizing the political participation and concerns of black residents who might contest the reforms in the public sphere.   \n\nDespite these attempts to depoliticize the reforms, neighborhood-based groups continue to pursue their schooling agendas in the public sphere.  However, they do so for reasons and in ways that are often unrecognized in discussions of school reform.   In contrast to accounts that either assume schooling struggles are solely about improving educational outcomes for children, or that they are about contesting the marketization of education, this research demonstrates that residents draw on a legacy of struggle that places schooling at the center of efforts to combat the racialized destruction of the social, political, and economic fabric of neighborhoods and the repudiation of black self-determination.  Residents are concerned about the kind of education their children receive in public schools, but they see education as inextricable from community life.  The felt injustices driving participant participation include the marketization of education, but are anchored to the lived experience of reform rather than ideological commitments to countering charter schooling.  Participants? counter-narratives emphasize the untenable nature of governance that is unaccountable to democratic action, schools that are disconnected from neighborhood influence and reforms that negate the humanity of those they are supposed to serve.  The political strategies residents used were  aimed not at dismantling charter schooling in the city per se.  Instead they were focused on creating avenues for community members to create places and policies that supported their values.\n\nPolitical conflict has been widely discussed in geography, yet these accounts have not typically focused on within-group conflict in the context of place-based social movements, nor have they explored the pedagogical functions of such engagement. In the context of collective action, within-group difference is often resolved through self-selection, as group members elect to associate with similar compatriots, and/or exit when differences become too onerous.  This research reveals the importance of place in developing a basis for \"staying at the table\" and the negotiation of difference over time.  In order to work across racial, socio-economic, gender, and ideological differences, participants in these schooling struggles drew on their attachments to place and the relationships they developed through their experiences struggling together.   Differences were often left unresolved.  But through both conflictual and non-conflictual relations, participants clarified (and sometimes altered) their positions in ways that allowed their organizations to continue contestation in the public sphere.   \n\nAs similar reforms are instituted in cities across the US, this research provides valuable insight into how groups associated with denigrated neighborhoods and populations draw on place-based experiences to politicize neighborhood-school issues and shape urban arrangements despite significant barriers to collective action. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alice E Huff"
