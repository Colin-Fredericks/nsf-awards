 "awd_abstract_narration": "Myxomycetes, or plasmodial slime molds, are among the most abundant protozoans in many soils, where they feed on bacteria and other microorganisms. The ecological role of myxomycetes may be considerable but has been studied very little. In collaboration with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, this project takes advantage of a long-term, nutrient fertilization experiment in lowland, tropical forest to investigate the effects of additions of nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients on communities of myxomycetes in the soil using environmental DNA sequencing. Results are expected to provide the first data on how tropical soil protozoans respond to nutrients and to lead to increased understanding of how these tiny predators may influence the functioning of tropical forests.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include enhancement of the genetic database for studies of myxomycetes, international collaboration, training of graduate and undergraduate students, and public outreach. DNA sequencing data will be made available to the public. The project will provide research experience for Panamanian students attending the University of Arkansas through an international scholarship program and for the co-PI, a Ph.D. student. The co-PI has already presented her research through several public media outlets and plans further presentations to the public.",

This project investigated the myxomycete community in a lowland forest in the Republic of Panama and the influence of long-term nutrient addition on these organisms. Nutrient availability is a primary constraint on the productivity and distribution of organisms in tropical forests, and as global temperatures rise and atmospheric CO2 increases, nutrient availability will become increasingly important in lowland tropical forests. In collaboration with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, we were able to utilize a long-term nutrient fertilization experiment in the lowland forests of Panama to investigate the impact of increased levels of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on myxomycete community structure. This project represented one of few ecological studies of protozoans in the tropics and to our knowledge is the very first nutrient fertilization study in tropical soils to incorporate protozoans. These types of data will allow the functional roles of these organisms to be accurately incorporated into predictive models of global biogeochemical cycles, which are becoming increasingly important in our changing climate.<br /><span> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\">&nbsp; </span>On two separate occasions, one year apart, samples of soil and litter were collected from the experimental plots and used to investigate the myxomycete community using traditional culture methods (litter samples) or using high-throughput environmental sequencing (soil samples). Using traditional culturing methods to investigate the litter microhabitat (leaves and other plant debris on the forest floor), we identified a very rich community of myxomycetes. &nbsp;Throughout the life of this project we have generated a dataset comprised of 3,432 records, one of the largest myxomycete data sets for any single locality. We identified at least 91 species, 34 of which had never before been recorded in Panama. Even more exciting was the discovery of a species of myxomycete entirely to science. This new species, Perichaena longipes was formally described and published as the cover article of the December 2015 issue of Mycologia (Walker et al. 2015). While the above-ground community of myxomycetes can be easily investigated with traditional culture methods, the soil community cannot be cultured and instead required the use of newly available molecular methods. This project represents the very first environmental sequence data for tropical soil-inhabiting myxomycetes. The successful high-throughput environmental sequencing of myxomycete SSU rDNA made possible by this funding allowed us to generate over 15Gb of high quality myxomycete sequence data. Analyses investigating correlations between myxomycete community structure and the increased availability of nutrients at this site are currently underway.&nbsp;<span> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The data generated in this dissertation research project represent a crucial first step towards developing a greater understanding of tropical myxomycetes and other organisms that co-occur in the soil and litter microhabitats. Thus far, one manuscript has been published, a description of the newly discovered species, Perichaena longipes, with at least two more manuscripts soon to follow. Because of it's importance, this research has been presented by the Co-PI at three international conferences (Canada, Colombia and Spain) and nationally or locally on several other occasions. The funding provided by this grant was essential for generating and maintaining numerous collaborations. &nbsp;Most notably is the collaboration with researchers at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama where this research is focused. Also, the new species description was done in collaboration with a visiting Fulbright Scholar from the Ukraine. This dissertation research also provided training opportunities for several students at the University of Arkansas, with two students most directly involved as they incorporated aspects of this project into their honors theses. Additionally, in 2013 we were able to host a visiting volunteer researcher from Panama that the Co-PI met during her time in Panama.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/24/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Laura&nbsp;Walker</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406667/1406667_10297907_1487984739245_Plasmodiumonleaf--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406667/1406667_10297907_1487984739245_Plasmodiumonleaf--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Slime mold plasmodium\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1406667/1406667_10297907_1487984739245_Plasmodiumonleaf--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Slime mold plasmodium\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Yellow slime mold (myxomycete) plasmodium climbing a leaf found on the forest floor.
