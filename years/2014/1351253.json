The possibility of miniaturizing biosensing systems which use miniscule quantities of expensive reagents and precious samples, provide faster analyses to patients and doctors, and do not require a trained technician to operate has immediate applications in preventing disease in developing countries, biowarfare/anti-terrorism applications, environmental monitoring, point-of-care diagnostic testing and for basic biological research.\r\n\r\nA major obstacle towards accomplishing this goal is the lack of an available biosensor that is rapid, sensitive and specific to small concentrations of target biomolecules, yet does not require the labeling of probes or optical microscopy, and can operate without the need for complex and bulky supporting instrumentation. This project will address existing challenges by focusing on the development of novel electrokinetic biosensors for biomolecular detection at liquid interfaces.",

Project efforts were directed towards understanding the fundamental physical mechanism of electrokinetic motion of the liquid interface. The interface itself was created using an microfluidic T-channel device (<strong>see Figure 1</strong>). This device was used to drive co-flowing liquid streams down a main microfluidic channel. Targeting binding reactions were driven via diffusion across the interface between the two flows. When an electric field was dropped perpendicular across the interface, the fluid displaced across the width of the microchannel.

The main outcomes of this project were based on our ability to develop a fundamental understanding for how this interface is influenced electrically during targeted biomolecualar reactions. We then developed a method to non-optically monitor interface position using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
