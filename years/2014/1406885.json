 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a three year stardard award to support the continuation of a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at Rice University, entitled, \"RET Site: Nanotechnology Research Experience for Teachers\", under the direction of Dr. Vicki Colvin and Dr. Carolyn Nichol. \r\n\r\nThis program will help further the educational programs developed by Rice University's NSF funded Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center (NSEC)entitled the Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology (CBEN) and will improve upon past success continuing to pursue the university's commitment to educational outreach and science innovation. To accomplish these tasks, the project team team will connect Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) teachers who serve students in Houston, Texas, with the outstanding nanotechnology research faculty and facilities at Rice. Providing curricular, content knowledge, and pedagogical support for these teachers as they translate their research experiences into novel and exciting activities for their students, the Rice team will use a \"train the trainer\" approach and offer a large platform of STEM Professional Development (PD) programs that allow a total of 36 RET \"master\" teachers (12 per year) to disseminate RET program outcomes to more than 300 teachers per year, thereby creating a robust network of knowledgeable leaders who will then instruct traditionally underserved students in the Houston area, fostering the STEM innovators of the future. Since the innovative developments at the nanoscale are integrated across biology, physics and chemistry, this program will provide teachers with new insights on basic science that is also well-aligned with Texas State standards and targets underserved teachers and schools. \r\n\r\nRice will work closely with the Houston Independent School District (HISD) and the Aldine Independent School District (AISD), both urban and historically underrepresented minority school districts in South Texas. HISD is the largest school district in Texas and its student population is 88% Hispanic and African American. AISD's student population is 96% Hispanic and African American. The Rice PD programs have trained more than 1200 teachers from over 34 school districts since 2006. This scalable RET will reach 900 teachers over the next 3 years, impacting about 135,000 students. In addition, the outcomes of this RET will be broadly disseminated via symposiums at Rice, national meetings, and online via the TeachEngineering digital library, Nanoscience Center for Learning and Teaching (NCLT), and the Rice Excellence in Science Curriculum website.",

During 2014-2017 (four years), fifty-one K-12 teachers participated in the program, including five elementary teachers, from forty-one schools and thirteen school districts. In addition, thirty-two Rice faculty and fifty-five post-doc or graduate students&nbsp;participated in the RET program as research mentors. The program's objectives included enhancing teachers' science and engineering content knowledge, inquiry-based pedagogical skills, and leadership competencies and self-efficacy in scientific teaching. The program design aimed to impact not only the teachers but also the broader community, which included their students, peer teachers, schools, and to provide training for graduate and post-doctoral students on how to be an effective mentor. Each year, post-doctoral and graduate student mentors received professional development on effective mentoring strategies using curriculum from the National Research Mentoring Network.</p>\n<p>The RET program kicked off with an orientation consisting of introductions to staff and peers, nanotechnology presentations and activities, administrative and program information and expectations, safety training, and pre-assessments. Over the six weeks of the program, RETs were fully immersed into their host lab and were treated as members of the research team.&nbsp; RETs were expected to actively contribute in weekly lab meeting and discussions, maintain a lab journal detailing their data collections and findings, read and review scientific articles as they relate to the host lab&rsquo;s research, and work with their lab mentors to gain a greater understanding of a specific research problem.&nbsp; In addition to lab requirements, interns also attended trainings on communication skills such as effective visual and written scientific communication and diversity. The weekly meetings were designed to provide an opportunity for interns to practice disseminating scientific finds and create connections to foster the RET community. &nbsp;To enhance networking and to broaden the reach of the research, interns participated in tours of each other's labs, Rice's engineering design kitchen and clean lab, and local industrial facilities including ExxonMobil's refinery and research laboratories in Bayport, Texas. The capstone RET event was the Research Symposium for Teachers held at Rice University where teachers presented their research posters and lesson plans to approximately 150 K-12 educators and the broader Houston community. This event was free and open to the general public and provided the community an opportunity to learn about research conducted at Rice from individuals training in educating our youth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The RET program did not end in the summer. Interns used the fall semester to create grade-level appropriate lessons and activities themed around their research experience for the students in their classrooms. Once tested with students, these lesson plans were submitted for publication on TeachEngineering.org.&nbsp;Further dissemination included presentations in Rice teacher professional development classrooms where hundreds of local teachers are enrolled in as well as at local and national conferences. One RET teacher presented her research at the American Chemical Society national meeting in 2016.&nbsp; In 2017, a paper on the Rice University Nanotechnology RET program was presented and published at the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Evaluation of the programs revealed teachers were positive about the program and generated plans and strategies to incorporate inquiry-based learning and the engineering design process into the classroom. One 2016 RET teacher stated, \"I have incorporated inquiry-based learning in the classroom by giving real life problems/scenarios where the students have to apply their knowledge to figure the answer. It makes learning relevant and it provokes them to voice out more problems where the class can discuss the answer.\" Another 2014 RET teachers says, \"I can now talk about science and specific scientific fields with my students.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In essence, the RET program was successful in impacting a community of educators and in bringing supporting partners aboard to work synergistically in the common goal of improving the quality of science education both locally and beyond.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
