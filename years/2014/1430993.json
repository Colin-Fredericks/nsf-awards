 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project will enhance the science content knowledge of elementary school pre-service and in-service teachers and increase their effectiveness in teaching science. Studies show significant deficiencies in many elementary teachers? conceptual knowledge of science topics, and this lack of scientific understanding inhibits their ability to teach science effectively. Research also shows that students learn more from teachers with strong comprehension of the subject matter being taught than from teachers with weak content understanding. Using research from cognitive psychology, game-based learning, and multimedia learning theory, this project creates problem-based scenarios and built-in assessments that challenge teachers to solve problems and ensures that they grasp scientific principles. By improving teachers? understanding of science, this project will therefore improve student performance and give students the foundational knowledge needed to pursue careers not only in science, but also in engineering and technology. Increasing the number of young people entering scientific and technical fields has an impact not only on the individuals entering these professional careers, but also on the nation?s productivity, competitiveness, and tax base since science and technology are key drivers of innovation and growth in the U.S. economy.\r\n\r\nThe product is a Web-based learning system consisting of a suite of inquiry-based activities designed to (a) strengthen the science knowledge of pre-service and in-service elementary teachers and (b) increase their confidence in and enthusiasm for teaching science. To motivate the learner, the product includes an overarching science fiction narrative with engaging 3D art as well as game-based science learning activities. All science content aligns with The Next Generation Science Standards as well as curriculum focal points and provides learners with immediate and easily accessible data on their science understanding, both procedural and conceptual. Because learners become engaged by the narrative and interactive science experiments, they are less focused on the intervention as a teaching instrument and on their deficiencies in scientific understanding. During engagement, learners are carefully scaffolded through 6 levels of difficulty, and move up and down the levels seamlessly based on performance. Also, learners collect rewards along the way to further motivate them to engage.",
