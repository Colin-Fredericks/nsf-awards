The utility and customer appeal of electric automobiles would be greatly enhanced by development of lighter-weight, lower-cost, rechargeable batteries. Lithium-air (Li-air) batteries are among the most promising energy storage technologies because they can theoretically provide very high energy density (amount of energy the battery can store for a given weight) at a low cost. The theoretical energy density of Li-air batteries is comparable to that of gasoline, and much higher than that of any other energy storage technologies. While these systems are very promising, their performance is significantly limited by a number of factors, including the activity and stability of the oxygen (O2) electrode. In this proposal, we employ a systematic approach to develop active and stable oxygen electrodes for Li-air batteries. We anticipate that the proposed controlled experimental studies will lead to fundamental insights that can guide the development of highly active and reversible Li-air batteries. Development of stable, reversible Li-air batteries that operate near the theoretical limit will provide a major breakthrough in the energy storage technology.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the proposed worked is to develop multifunctional oxygen electrodes for Li-air batteries that target two important chemical steps that govern their activity and stability: (i) Li+ diffusion, and  (ii) the activation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during the charging process. Controlled electrochemical and spectroscopy studies will be utilized to obtain important fundamental insights on the effect of the targeted electrochemical/chemical steps on the electrochemistry at the oxygen electrode of Li-air batteries. We anticipate that the proposed work will have a significant impact toward the development of stable and efficient Li-air batteries. The systematic approach on developing molecularly engineered, target electrodes can be extended to other electrochemical systems. In addition to the scientific impact, the proposed research will become a learning tool for undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities at Wayne State University (WSU). The PI has also partnered with local K-12 schools to involve K-12 students with the research through summer internships and inspire them to pursue careers in science and engineering. In collaboration with the NSF-sponsored Gaining Options-Girls Investigate Real Life program, the PI also proposes to organize ?Energy and Environment? day camps, where middle and high school girls will be introduced to research related to energy and environment. The PI plans to use the fundamental electrochemical insights obtained from this project to design a course for senior undergraduate and graduate students focused on the Fundamentals of Electrochemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nLithium-air batteries have gained immense interest in the last few years mainly due to their high theoretical energy density. Such high energy densities are possible for Li-air batteries because Li is the lightest metal on the periodic table with the highest oxidation potential and combines with a fairly electronegative element like oxygen at the cathode to form lithium-oxygen species. Oxygen is not stored in the battery, rather accessed from the environment, further facilitating high energy densities.  The theoretical energy density of Li-oxygen batteries is close to that of gasoline and much higher than other battery technologies.  If ~15% of its theoretical energy density is met, it would equal the practical energy density of gasoline, thus enabling driving ranges of ~500 miles per charge, making them commercially viable. Li-oxygen chemistry at the cathode of Li-air batteries is critical in the realization of the theoretical high energy densities of these systems. As such, designing effective catalysts for lowering the energy penalty to catalyze the formation and dissociation of Li-oxygen species is key at enhancing their performance. In this project, we have studied the potential of non-precious, mixed metal oxides with mixed ionic and electronic conducting properties as efficient cathode catalysts for Li-air batteries.  A combination of experimental and theoretical studies is used to elucidate the factors that govern the oxygen reduction and evolution activity on these oxides in Li-O2batteries.  We report that nanostructured oxides exhibit promising electrochemical performance as cathode electrocatalysts for Li&ndash;O2 batteries. We demonstrate the ability to control the nanostructure and composition of the oxide electrocatalyst at the nanoscale level using a reverse-microemulsion synthesis approach. We show that Li&ndash;O2 batteries with cathodes containing rod-shaped oxideelectrocatalyst exhibit lower charging potentials and higher reversible capacities when compared to batteries with carbon-only cathodes. The superior activity of these oxides is due to their ability of stabilizing Li-deficient oxide species during discharge, consequently lowering overpotential losses associated with their oxidation during charge, leading to enhanced performance. Quantum chemical modeling of the solid-solid interface between the oxide and lithium-discharge products suggests that stabilization of the Li-deficient products is due to formation of a lithiated oxide surface with enhanced electronic conductivity.  These findings for the first time provide a framework for improving the efficiency of next generation energy storage systems using nonprecious metal-based oxide catalysts.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe research conducted under this grant has had a broad impact on science and engineering, training and education.
