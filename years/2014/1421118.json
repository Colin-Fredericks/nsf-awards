 "awd_abstract_narration": "The production, transformation, sinking, horizontal transport, remineralization and deposition of particulate organic matter in the oceans play important roles in the cycling of carbon and other elements throughout the earth system. Traditional oceanographic strategies for the sampling and study of marine particles often involve various forms of direct collection. However, these approaches are severely limited in their ability to provide particle data at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and to determine the in situ structure of these small and delicate particles. For these reasons, in situ imaging of particles and plankton is rapidly becoming an important tool for the study of marine particle dynamics and the ocean's biological pump, as these instruments enable the high-resolution and non-destructive assessment of particle size, concentration, and morphology. This project will facilitate the initial testing, operational development, and utilization of the Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP), an advanced in situ imaging system. Deployments of the UVP in the Arctic Ocean will generate a new dataset that will be used to explore the nature of the biological, chemical, and physical factors that influence the cycling of particles and carbon in this region. The award supports two students at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF), one Master's and one undergraduate, to participate in research related to particle cycling in the Arctic ocean. The PI and the students will use in situ imaging equipment to study the links between the particle size distribution and the sinking flux of particulate organic matter. The cycling of particulate matter in the Arctic Ocean is not well understood, and this research will enhance of our understanding of particle dynamics and carbon cycling in a region that is currently undergoing rapid environmental change.\r\n\r\nThis award will advance the methodological capabilities of the UAF laboratory, begin a new research endeavor into the dynamics of marine particles and carbon cycling of the Arctic Ocean, and engage two students in research that is relevant to the Arctic.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported the start up of an oceanographic laboratory, graduate student research, and the development of new oceanographic observing capabilities at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. \n\nOcean particles and zooplankton play an important role in the ocean system.  As biological particles are formed via photosynthetic production in surface waters, a fraction of this material is transported to deeper depths via sinking particles or zooplankton vertical migration.  This process redistributes carbon, nutrients, energy, and mass throughout the oceans.  In this manner, the distributions and dynamics of particles and zooplankton throughout the oceans are critical to our understanding of ocean biogeochemical cycles.  Unfortunately, due to their delicate nature, it has proven difficult to map out the distributions of particles and plankton throughout the oceans.\n\nIn this project, we developed the capability to observe marine particles and plankton with an underwater imaging system known as the UVP5.  We tested and deployed the instrument on a series of oceanographic cruises in the Arctic Ocean and other open ocean basins and coastal regions and established a data processing protocol for this approach.\n\nThe results of this work demonstrate that the UVP can be used as a tool for the study of marine particle dynamics.  It provides important insights into the size distributions and types of particles and zooplankton throughout the water column.  This data collection can be conducted at hydrographic scales without additional dedicated wire time as sea since the instrument package is integrated with the CTD rosette. The data format is standardized with other UVP instruments in use, and our collaborative efforts with other UVP users have led to a significant combined dataset. \n\nThis study found that zooplankton and physics play important roles in the magnitude and extent of marine particle flux in the equatorial oceans across the globe.  Small particles penetrated deeply into the water column at the equator.  These results change our understanding of how particulate matter is transported into the deep ocean and the carbon sequestration that is associated with it.  In addition, a prominent intermediate particle maximum was a unique feature of the data driven by zooplankton migration.\n\nOur study of particulate matter in the Gulf of Alaska was the first to reveal the broad scale patterns and size distributions of particulate matter across this dynamic shelf system.  The results highlight the influence of riverine input of particulate matter, as well as the resuspension of bottom sediments.  Biological particles dominated the system in offshore surface waters.\n\nThis project involved the participation of three graduate students.  All of these students participated in research cruises, giving them sea-going oceanographic experience and experience operating, maintaining, and troubleshooting advanced oceanographic instruments, often without my direct supervision on board the vessel.  Their successes and independence demonstrate the level of training and professional development they have received as part of this project.  Funding from this NSF OCE-Research Initiation Grant was essential in supporting these students, their education, and professional development, and building up this educational component of my laboratory group.  One of the graduate students supported by this project is an Alaska Native.  Her training and experiences in conjunction with this project broaden the participation of underrepresented individuals in ocean sciences and will enable her to contribute relevant expertise to her Alaskan community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew M Mcdonnell"
