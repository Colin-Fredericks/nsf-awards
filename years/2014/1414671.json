 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earthquakes are natural hazards that occur throughout the world, causing ground shaking and the potential for significant damage.

During ground shaking, water pressure in the surrounding soil increases. When the water pressure exceeds a certain threshold, the soil fails, becoming fluid and flowing up through the ground surface. This phenomenon, called liquefaction, causes ground settlements that affect both above- and below-ground structures.

Liquefaction damage from these earthquakes affected a significant portion of developed land in and around Christchurch, damaging buildings, infrastructure networks, and critical lifeline systems. This degree of extensive repeated liquefaction was virtually unprecedented in a modern urban setting.

This research was conducted at the University of Canterbury, in collaboration with Dr. Misko Cubrinovski, and this EAPSI award was funded in collaboration with the Royal Society of New Zealand.\n \nDuring the post-earthquake engineering investigation in Christchurch, an important observation was made: state-of-practice methods incorrectly predicted the occurrence and severity of liquefaction for many sites with fine-grained (silty) soils. State-of-practice methods for assessing liquefaction potential are largely based on clean sands; there remains considerable debate as to whether fine-grained soils will liquefy and the appropriate assessment procedure to employ. This research aims to advance the state of knowledge on liquefaction of fine-grained soils, while evaluating the level of conservatism in current state-of-practice liquefaction assessment methods.

Laboratory results will be compared with post-earthquake field observations and established liquefaction assessment procedures to evaluate the nature of liquefaction in fine-grained soils. The implications of these results will advance seismic resilience for cities faced with similar liquefaction hazards.\n \nField Sampling\nFieldwork to retrieve high-quality (\"undisturbed\") soil samples was performed by a local drilling company under the supervision of the principal investigator. Sites were selected through collaboration with a local geotechnical engineering firm, and sampling plans were developed based on data from publically available CPT soundings and sonic borings at each site.  High-quality samples were obtained in mud-rotary wash borings utilizing a Dames &amp; Moore hydraulic fixed-piston sampling device with thin-walled brass sample tubes to minimize friction and sample disturbance. Following sampling, the tubes were sealed, placed upright, and carefully transported to the University of Canterbury for testing.\n\n\nLaboratory Testing\nAdvanced laboratory testing of soil specimens was conducted using a CKC triaxial testing device.  Cyclic loading was typically applied at a rate of 1 cycle/second, with some specimens tested at a slower loading rate of 0.1 cycles/second to capture different aspects of the liquefaction process. After completion of cyclic triaxial testing, each specimen was reconsolidated to measure post-liquefaction volumetric strains, representing settlements that would occur after liquefaction.  University of Canterbury research technicians conducted conventional geotechnical laboratory testing on soil specimens used for cyclic triaxial testing to evaluate the physical characteristics of each specimen and complete the data set needed for further analysis.  Fifteen specimens were tested dur..."
