 "awd_abstract_narration": "The infusion of intrapreneurial and entrepreneurial skills into technician education programs to prepare highly qualified entry level technicians who understand the industry enterprise is an area of interest to the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program. This project will support a two-day Conference on the STEM Intrapreneurship and Entrepreneurship Education Spectrum leading to a formal report on conference outcomes. ATE Centers and projects have developed a wide array of innovative responses to this focal area, including Contract Research Organizations, incubators and Virtual Enterprises. This conference will initiate a group discussion on best practices culminating in recommended goals for technician education programs, faculty development seminars and a network-based mentorship. This conference will build consensus on how these practices can become a regular part of STEM technician education programs. \r\n\r\nThe Institute for Virtual Enterprise (IVE) at the City University of New York (CUNY) has had a successful track record of developing STEM intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship curriculum, performing faculty development and leading discussion in this area. IVE currently hosts an annual summer conference at Baruch College in New York City on intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship that focuses on the Virtual Enterprise pedagogy. The current conference will be expanded in two primary ways: (1) providing support for speakers with expertise in other portions of the STEM Intrapreneurship and Entrepreneurship Education Spectrum beyond Virtual Enterprise; and, (2) disseminating the practices beyond ATE grantees by providing travel stipends with special emphasis on faculty at community colleges that do not currently have ATE grants. This proposal will expand the reach of the practices to new campuses and set an action research framework for future scholarly publications on the topic. Conference participants will join a social network where further campus-to-campus support, mentorship and interaction occur. Participants will be encouraged to take back a platform for STEM intrapreneurship and entrepreneurship, implement it on their campus and study its effects using an action research methodology.\r\n\r\nSome of the questions that will be addressed during the conference and discussed in the conference report are: \r\nWhat practices exist at other institutions?\r\nHow effective are these practices in students' education?\r\nWhat metrics gauge a program's success? What other qualitative and quantitative data are useful for measuring impact? How can faculty design a classroom research study of practices?\r\nWith whom can faculty network to learn about these practices?\r\nHow does one make the case for these practices to College Senior Administrators and Governing Boards?\r\nWhat are the legal precedents and complications around encouraging entrepreneurial activity at a public, tax-supported institution?\r\nAre there outlets for scholarly publications for work in STEM entrepreneurship education?\r\nAre there common milestones in entrepreneurial activity for campuses to track successes?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship in STEM Education Conference was held to provide a venue for the discussion of innovation and entrepreneurship education with a focus on how this impacts STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines.  The conference was held on July 9th and 10th of 2015 in New York City.  Activities took place at Baruch College and at the Central Office of the City University of New York.  The conference was marketed as an opportunity to share best practices and enhance a framework for instruction of entrepreneurship in the classroom.  It was primarily geared toward both those in STEM and business education.\n\nPresentations spanned the entrepreneurship education spectrum &ndash; from those who bring entrepreneurially-minded projects into their classroom to frameworks for starting businesses on campus or helping others launch their ventures.   Industry practitioners also spoke to participants about important issues such as women and underrepresented minorities in technology.  Participants also learned about ways of moving their ideas forward including evaluation and research frameworks and potential funding opportunities.  Presenters included an author, educators and researchers, STEM entrepreneurs, members of industry, sponsors of and mentors in entrepreneurial competitions, and University administration.\n\nSome of the content showcased were from projects currently and previously funded by the National Science Foundation including Contract Research Organizations in the life sciences and work within an NSF Innovation Corps network.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/28/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stuart A Schulman"
