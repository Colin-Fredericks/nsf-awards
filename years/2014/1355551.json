 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort is focused on better quantifying the emissions of aerosols and trace gases of global significance from combustion sources in Nepal and Bhutan. Very little information currently exists on emissions from sources such as brick kilns, garbage burning, and cooking fires. The broader impacts of this research include the development of a better understanding of the contribution of emissions from South Asia to the global burden of gases and aerosol important for predicting regional air quality and global climate change. This work is part of a larger international effort between the US, Nepal, Bhutan, Germany, and Italy to study atmospheric chemistry in South Asia. \r\n\r\nChemical species to be quantified include: PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 &#956;m), elemental and organic carbon, absorption by black and brown carbon, smoke markers, a suite of particle-phase metals and ions, CO2, CO, CH4, more than 90 diverse non-methane organic gases, SO2, NOx, NH3, HCN, acetonitrile, and many other types of aerosol and trace gases. The measurements will complement ongoing regional monitoring activities by filling a critical need for better source characterization. The results will help to assess the relative importance of South Asian combustion sources in influencing air quality and climate on a local, regional, and global scale.",

As part of the larger effort, the University of Virginia investigated three interrelated issues.\n\n(1)  Concentrations of black carbon (BC) and ozone (O3) and related meteorological conditions were measured continuously within the Kali Gandaki Valley, a deep, trans-Himalayan valley in Nepal.  Differential heating of the valley floor sustained high-velocity, up valley winds during daytime relative to low-velocity, down valley winds at night.  This alternative wind regime resulted in significant net up-valley transport of pollutants. These results support the hypothesis that deep Himalayan valleys are important conduits by which combustion products emitted over the Indo-Gangetic Plain of southern Asia are transported to the high Himalaya and the Tibetan plateau.\n\n(2) Influences of the subtropical westerly jet (SWJ) in modulating tropospheric O3 over the Himalaya were investigated using vertical profiles of O3, relative humidity (RH), potential temperature, and wind speed measured with balloon-born instruments in conjunction with model calculations. During winter, the Tibetan plateau creates a strong thermal gradient that contours the plateau.  The varying location of the SWJ with respect to the thermal gradient along the southern slope of the Himalaya modulated the downward transport of naturally produced O3 from the stratosphere to the troposphere.  O3 concentrations above 8 km altitude were consistently higher than median concentrations when the SWJ was centered over or south of the thermal gradient regardless of the velocity and structure of the SWJ.
