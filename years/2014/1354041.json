 "awd_abstract_narration": "All environments are variable and uncertain: some years are hotter, some wetter; predators wax and wane in abundance. How organisms buffer themselves against this variability, and exploit it, are major challenges for ecology. This project will combine new statistical and mathematical theory with long-term data sets on semi-arid plant communities to address two challenges in understanding how variable environments affect populations. The first goal will be to identify which environmental variables most strongly affect plant demographic rates such as survival, growth, and fecundity. This work will draw upon long-term studies on natural communities that provide observations on thousands of individual plants over multiple decades, along with numerous environmental variables that are measured at high spatial and temporal resolution. With so many potential explanatory variables, standard statistical methods for variable selection are unstable and unreliable. This project will combine data mining methods from machine learning techniques with traditional statistical theory to identify important environmental drivers, and build more reliable demographic models. Ecological questions that will be addressed include whether demographic rates respond primarily to resource availability (e.g., soil moisture) versus non-resource variables such as temperature; how environment and competition interact; and how strongly past conditions affect current performance. The empirical data sets will be used to answer these questions and look for generalities across multiple communities. A second goal is to understand the individual mechanisms that underlie effects of environmental variation. For example, if a plant population's growth is most affected by rainfall, is it because many plants die immediately, or because of long-term effects such as decreased life expectancy and smaller size throughout life? To address such questions, statistical methods from discrete-state random process theory will be extended to continuous states (e.g., individual plant size) and varying environments, and applied to the fitted plant demographic models. \r\n\r\nAn expected transformative outcome from this project will be new methods for demographic modeling and analysis, and much of its broader significance will be the applications of those tools in ecology, conservation biology and invasive species management.  Statistical products from this work will be disseminated freely as R code modules that users can adapt to their own study systems. The project will also support the research training and mentoring of a doctoral student in statistics, and a postdoctoral student in quantitative ecology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit \n\nThe CWRU portion of the project focused on two research questions:\n\n1.  How can we quantify the contribution of luck to lifetime outcomes\nsuch as total number of offspring?\n\n2.  How can we quantify the contributions of various mechanisms to\nspecies coexistence?\n\nIn our work on the first question, we noted that in many species, a\nsmall number of individuals produce almost all of the offspring.  What\ndetermines who gets to be one of these exceptional individuals?  We\ndeveloped two methods of determining how much luck in survival,\ngrowth, or fecundity, at a particular age or body size, affected the\nprobability that an individual had an exceptional number of\noffspring.  Applying these to case studies, we found that luck when\nyou're young and small matters more than when you're old or large.\nEarly luck in survival is generally important, but early luck in\ngrowth can also be important for species with more variable growth\npatterns.  \n\nThe work described above assumed that all individuals are identical.\nWe then assumed that in addition to luck, individuals vary in their\nfixed traits --- e.g. some might have a higher probability of\nsurviving or breeding.  How much of the variation in lifetime number\nof offspring is explained by variation in traits and how much is luck?\nApplying our methods to case studies, we found that luck explained\nmuch of the variation in reproductive success --- from 2/3 to over\n95%!  Luck also explained most of the variation in lifespan, and we\nexpect that it will explain many other lifetime measures of success.\nFlipping this question on its head, we asked what one can infer about\nan individual's traits based on observations of their reproductive\nsuccess (or lifespan or...).  We found that in some cases,\nhigh-quality traits were necessary to be highly successful but they\nweren't sufficient --- you have to be lucky as well as have\nhigh-quality traits.  In other cases, it wasn't even necessary to have\nhigh-quality traits: all that mattered was luck.\n\nOur work on the second question, about how to quantify contributions\nto species coexistence, resulted in new tools.  The standard approach\n(Chesson's Modern Coexistence Theory) is useful in that it is analytic\nand therefore can lead to further insight.  However, it requires a\ncustomized, often challenging mathematical analysis for each system,\nit applies only to the effects of environmental variation, and it\nassumes that environmental variation is small.  Our method is exact\nand complete, can be done with simulations instead of analytic math,\nand applies to any form of coexistence mechanism, not just those\narising from environmental variation.  Applying our new method to case\nstudies, we found that sometimes the most important contributions to\ncoexistence came from mechanisms assumed to be neglible by the\nstandard approach.  Because environmental variation was not small in\nthe case studies, the assumptions of the standard approach broke down.\n\nThis research resulted in 5 peer-reviewed journal articles, 3\ncontributed conferences presentations, and 5 presentations at various\nacademic institutions.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nIn addition to the intellectual contributions described above, the\nCWRU portion of the project included \n\n* the training of 2 undergraduate researchers\n\n* the free dissemination to the research community of computer code to implement our new statistical and mathematical analyses. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robin E Snyder"
