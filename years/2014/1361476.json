 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study several problems in geometric Fourier analysis.  The settings for these problems involve geometric manifolds of dimension two or more.  Associated to a given manifold are fundamental objects called eigenfunctions.  These are the fundamental modes of vibration of the manifold, and they are the higher dimensional analogs of the familiar trigonometric functions for the circle.  Designers of musical instruments are well aware that the shape of, say, a drum or the soundboard of stringed instrument affects the basic tones that it omits.  Similar phenomena arise for manifolds, and we wish to study precisely how their shapes, such as how they are curved, affect the resulting eigenfunctions.  Just as in music, one particularly expects different shapes and geometries to become more apparent in the behavior of the fundamental modes of vibration as the frequency becomes larger and larger.  These eigenfunctions are solutions of a differential equation that is similar to the wave equation, and the project will also study similar problems involving it.  The general theme is to study how solutions of wave equations are affected by their physical backgrounds, such as whether or not black holes are present or whether the background becomes very close to a vacuum near infinity.\r\n\r\nAmong the specific problems in the project, the principal investigator desires to obtain improved estimates for the nodal sets (zero sets) of eigenfunctions.  There is a conjecture of Yau asserting that the size of this codimension-one set should be comparable to its frequency.  Although it has been fully settled in the real analytic setting, less is known for smooth manifolds.  The principal investigator has already shown that there are connections between this problem and Lebesgue space estimates for eigenfunctions that can detect certain types of  concentration.   Several problems in the project involve developing this active field.  The principal investigator would also like to obtain improved bounds for so-called period integrals of eigenfunctions under the assumption of negative curvature.  This assumption is known to be necessary, and the problem measures the random cancellation of eigenfunctions along geodesics.  There are connections with this problem and analytic number theory, but to date the results that the principal investigator has recently obtained using harmonic analysis are the best known.  He would like to combine them with number theory techniques to try to obtain improved bounds.  There are connections between these problems and other problems that the project will study involving estimates for wave equations (\"Strichartz estimates\") and microlocal analysis, especially propagation of singularities.",

In order to do this we developed what we like to call ``global harmonic analysis??, which is a mixture of classical harmonic analysis, microlocal analysis and techniques from geometry.  The basic estimates included Lp-estimates for eigenfunctions and quasimodes, and related highly localized L2 estimates that are sensitive to concentration.  Our centered around how the geometry and the global dynamics of the geodesic flow affects the estimates and the kinds of functions that saturate them.  The latter issue is closely related to the much studied (but still not well understood) questions of concentration, oscillation and size properties of modes and quasimodes in spectral asymptotics.  These questions are also naturally linked to the long-time properties of the solution operator for the wave equation and resolvent estimates coming from the metric Laplacian.  We are developed techniques to help our understanding of the harmonic analysis and spectral theory of operators that arise from boundary traces.\n\nI also wrote a second edition of my book ``Fourier integrals in classical analysis'' that inculdes two new chapters, with one being related to the above and one being on the structure of Kakeya sets.  The latter in two-dimensions are arbitrarily small sets through which a needle can be continuously be rotated.  Any high school student who has completed a course in geometry can understand their construction in two-dimensions, but the structure in higher dimensions is much harder and is related to several fundamental problems in analysis, geometry and partial differential equations.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher D Sogge"
