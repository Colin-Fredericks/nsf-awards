 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, there have been substantial researches on cyber physical systems. A typical cyber physical system is composed of both physical and cyber parts. The physical part refers to the dynamics ruled by physical laws, while the cyber part (which consists of sensor(s), communication and controller(s)) observes the physical dynamics, transmits the reports, and makes control actions. Many practical applications can be considered as cyber physical systems, such as smart grids, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robotic networks. The communication part plays a key role in CPS since it conveys information from the sensor(s) to the controller(s), similarly to the nerve system of human body. When facing negative environments, source and channel coding schemes can improve the efficiency and reliability of the communication system. Traditional coding schemes are designed for pure data communications and are inefficient for controlling the physical dynamics in cyber physical systems. This project studies how to integrate the awareness of physical dynamics status into the source and channel coding procedures, which improves the performance of the operation of physical dynamics. This context awareness brings a paradigm shift to the design and analysis of cyber physical systems and benefits many future systems such as smart grids.  The project is extended to education purposes, including K-12 outreach, and undergraduate/graduate level course designs. The achievements of the proposed research are disseminated to academia and industry communities.\r\n\r\nThis project analyzes and develops new coding schemes in the physical layer of communication for CPS, which imposes significantly different design requirements than that of the traditional networks. In particular, the project designs the coding schemes with the awareness of the physical dynamics characteristics, instead of separated designs of communications and controls. The first task is to designs new joint/iterative channel decoding and state estimation schemes that are aware of the inherent temporal/spatial redundancies in the physical dynamics observations. It begins from simple block codes and extends the work to complicated codes with cycles. Distributed source coding at the sensors is designed, which also takes the spatial and temporal redundancies into account. In particular, the criteria of source coding (e.g., the distortion) are made aware of the objectives of controlling the physical dynamics. The proposed source and channel coding schemes are evaluated in the context of smart grid monitoring and control. Both co-simulation software and hardware testbeds are implemented for the performance evaluation.",

In this project, the PI incorporated the physical dynamics characteristics (e.g., the evolution law of dynamics states) of the cyber physical systems into a joint communications and control design framework.  The overall goal is then to better utilize the communication networks (e.g., through better compression and better scheduling) while satisfying the ever-increasing needs of modern CPSs like smart power grid and large-scale distributed sensor networks.  By taking advantages of the system state correlation in both temporal and the spatial domains, the precious wireless communication bandwidth can be better spent on controlling the key attributes of the system, which will in turn allow for tighter stability control with significantly less communication costs.  Among many objectives of optimizing the communication networks, special focus has been placed on characterizing the impact of communication delay and how to better reduce delay to further improve the efficiency of the overall CPS control loop.   Such results will directly benefit new CPS designs for delay-critical applications, including remote drone control and smart grid systems.\n\n \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:  The project has developed a new system design and analysis framework that tightly integrates and jointly optimizes important attributes of the traditional physical control systems and of the cyber communication networks.  Specifically, (i) a new suite of optimal scheduling schemes has been developed for deadline constrained systems, which is provably optimal when a strict deadline is imposed on the delivery of the packets.  The results would significantly benefit the low-latency, delay-critical application of cyber-physical systems; (ii) New sequential network coding solutions have been developed, which applies the state-of-the-art network coding techniques previously developed for high-throughput applications to the short-delay environments.  Specifically, the new solutions eliminate the so-called \"block coding delay\" of network coding, which thus allows next-generation CPS designers to combine the optimal throughput of network coding and the low-delay nature of sequential coding into a unified design that simultaneously improves both the latency and throughput of the system; (iii) A new opportunistic data compression scheme has been proposed and analyzed, which focuses exclusively on any CPS application that controls a physical state/plant through high-volume, low-delay telecommunication in the cyber space.
