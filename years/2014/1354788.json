 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many fish feed by using their jaws to scissor away pieces of flesh and often generate movements with their rigid body skeletons to remove the piece. The poorly understood hagfish can also effectively accomplish this task despite lacking jaws or even a spine. Hagfish rely on complex arrangements of soft muscle and connective tissues to coordinate forceful and dynamic movements of 1) a unique toothplate that can shear off large chunks of food, and 2) flexible bodies with loose skins that can be tied into knots.  Body knots are pressed against the surface of the carcass so that hagfish can gain leverage to support toothplate function. This study attempts to describe principles of function associated with generation of force and precision movements using soft tissue mechanisms. In addition, this research will provide training for four undergraduates and one Master of Science student and initiate national and international collaborations. The PIs and their students will work with three local public aquaria to develop exhibits that showcase unique hagfish biomechanics and behaviors. Finally, hagfish body models and simulations may result in the development of practical applications, such as safety ropes with dynamic knotting capabilities and bio-inspiration for deformable material mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThis project encompasses a three-part analysis. First, the biomechanical analysis of toothplate movement will begin with a morphological analysis based on dissections and two- & three-dimensional X-ray imaging. Resulting postulates of how forces are produced and transmitted will be tested using analyses of high-speed video and muscle activity recordings during feeding bouts. Second, the morphology and material properties of the loose hagfish skin are likely very important to body knot manipulations. Skin morphology will be described using histological reconstructions and material properties will be measured using biaxial tensile tests. These data may then be used as input into a simplified model of the hagfish body, based on a flexible rope model of a sheath/core design, upon which to simulate knot formation and slippage.  Third, in order to assess the contribution of body knotting behavior to hagfish 'bite' strength, a custom underwater force platform, to which food will be tethered, will record the magnitude and direction of shearing and body knot reaction forces. Results from the studies will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific meetings.",

These animals are relatively understudied because they can only be obtained from the wild and because they normally occur in deep, dark marine habitats.

Hagfish do this by raking their raspy dental plates across the food item while pressing a loop of a knot against the morsel's surface.

Specifically, forceful retractions of the dental plates remained unexplained until we were able to identify the muscular hydrostatic mechanism powering this movement. The feeding apparatus is a soft tissue structure that both generates force and turgid structural support depending on the contractions of multiple fiber orientations. The mechanism is organized such that the feeding apparatus extends lengthwise in order to pull the dental plate back into the mouth. While the morphology of the apparatus remains broadly conserved, the relative sizes of the muscular components vary between species of hagfish and suggests that there may be differences in bite forces.</p>\n<p><em>Body knotting and control</em> - Hagfish bodies exhibit several adaptations for flexibility and the ability to form and manipulate the knots that allow feeding and escape maneuvers: an elongate vermiform body devoid of projecting fins and vertebrae; complex arrangements of body core muscles, and a loose, non-binding skin. This flexibility however, potentially requires a massive amount of neural input if every point along the body required independent motion control parameters (known as the \"hyper-redundant problem\" in robotics). Employing three-dimensional high-speed video analysis and computer simulations, we believe we have identified evidence of reduced neural input; regardless of what type of knots a hagfish ties (in some species, individuals can tie up to three styles knots), they may need to supply commands for only a few basic movements in various combinations to form them.

The skin does not limit the core's range of motion and the slack skin deforms prior to puncture, thus allowing for enhanced puncture resistance. Destructive and non-destructive uniaxial and biaxial tensile tests coupled with histological analyses on the skins of a variety of hagfish species reveal interesting patterns between material, morphology, movement and phylogenetic diversity. Hagfishes from the genus <em>Eptatretus</em> possess anisotropic skins that are highly extensible in circumference and may have dermal contractile elements; a feature the isotropic skins from <em>Myxine</em> lack. Our outgroup, body-knotting moray eels possess skins that are isotropic like <em>Myxine</em> and extensible like <em>Eptatretus</em>. The form and function of <em>Eptatretus</em> skins may allow this genus to employ a greater diversity of knots, and assume a coiled resting posture.
