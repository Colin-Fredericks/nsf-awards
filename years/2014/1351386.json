 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant provides funding to investigate new manufacturing approaches for the fabrication of bulk-scale materials with precisely controlled structure at the nanometer length scale. While nanostructured materials have been intensively investigated from the theoretical and thermal transport points of view, limitations in their processing science have impeded their commercial use. This project aims at overcoming these limitations. Advanced gas-phase techniques will be used to synthesize nanopowders with precisely controlled properties. Ultrafine particles with arbitrary size, size distribution, composition and surface chemistry will be produced and then sintered to yield bulk samples with tunable structural details. The precise control of the nanoparticle properties will translate into the realization of bulk nanostructured samples with an unprecedented degree of freedom in the design of their nanostructure.\r\n\r\nThe characterization of bulk samples with arbitrarily designed nanostructure will advance the scientific understanding of transport of heat and charge carriers in such systems. A precise description of the role of grain size distribution, porosity and local structure of grain boundaries on transport properties will be achieved. This knowledge will be transferrable to other material systems and valuable to the scientific community. Moreover, the project specifically focuses on earth-abundant materials and on synthesis and processing techniques that are scalable to high production rates, thus representing a step towards the large-scale utilization of materials with good thermal-to-electrical, and vice versa, energy conversion efficiency. This is critical for applications such as waste heat recovery, solid state cooling, and in general, for achieving a more effective utilization of our energy resources. Finally, students from local high schools, college students from underrepresented minorities and veterans from the US military who are continuing their educations will be directly involved in these research activities to enhance their education in the strategically important areas of materials, manufacturing and energy.",
