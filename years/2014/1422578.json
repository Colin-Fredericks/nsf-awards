 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to provide users of multiple, possibly mobile, devices with storage systems that provide strong consistency guarantees for replicated data.  When users access their data through multiple devices it is important that data updates made through one device are reflected in the data viewed through others.  The project will study and implement consistency and consensus protocols to enable these guarantees for individuals and collaborative groups.\r\n\r\nThe work includes several major components including the definition, validation, and parameterization of a user model; the definition of a system structure allowing strong separation of layers while ensuring key system properties; and the design and optimization of new protocols. The potential audience for this work includes users of online storage systems and related stand-alone tools for replicating work across multiple devices.",
