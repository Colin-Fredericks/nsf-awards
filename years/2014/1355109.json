 "awd_abstract_narration": "Malpighiaceae is a large, ancestrally New World flowering plant family that has dispersed independently to the Old World on seven separate occasions during the past ~60 Myr. The distinctive floral morphology of New World species includes oil glands, which provide pollinators with rewards other than pollen or nectar. The flowers that produce nutrient oils also have a unique bilateral floral symmetry that has been conserved for millions of years via interactions with specialist oil-bee pollinators. All Old World species, in contrast, have regular flowers with radial symmetry. This project will investigate diversification in plant-pollinator mutualism within the family by producing a morphological and molecular phylogeny of ~1300 Malpighiaceae species. In addition, the researchers will investigate the early genetic and developmental basis of bilateral symmetry in the New World species and establish the genetic and developmental basis for the convergent evolution of regular flower phenotypes in the Old World species. \r\n\r\nThis study of this large and ecologically important group of tropical plants will serve as a model to understand whether similar genetic and developmental mechanisms are driving the parallel evolution of flower shape. The project will train a post-doctoral researcher, undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from under-represented groups.  Research results will be disseminated through an online monograph on the Malphigiaceae, and through targeted short-courses for elementary and high school students within Cambridge, MA.",

First, our work promotes thinking of the evolution of floral symmetry development at a previously ignored hierarchical level, which is informative to understand how the developmental process evolves. Through investigating five-petaled flowering plants, we have demonstrated that development indeed constrains the processes that give rise to floral zygomorphy in a specific lineage, while phylogenetic distance allows relaxation of these constraints, which provides novel insights on the role that development plays in the evolution of floral zygomorphy. Second, we have also demonstrated that the origin and evolution of morphological parallelism in Malpighiaceae, especially in the context of pollination-associated shifts of floral symmetry, is always associated with modifications of&nbsp;<em>CYC2</em>-dependent developmental mechanism. However, the way how the&nbsp;<em>CYC2</em>mechanism has been modified is stochastic and contingent. These findings further illustrate a major theme in evo-devo that is organisms share master genes, which govern the morphology and the evolution of the body plan. Parallel shifts in floral forms are the result of the evolution of master genes in response to plant-pollinator mutualism. Third, for the zygomorphic flowers of New World Malpighiaceae, the radial pattern of&nbsp;<em>CYC2</em>expression during the early stage of floral development suggests&nbsp;<em>CYC2</em>&rsquo;s role in meristem patterning. This broad pattern of&nbsp;<em>CYC2</em>expression is later restricted to solely the dorsal domain of the flower suggests its distinct role in early zygomorphic development compared to other zygomorphic-flowered species, such as snapdragon and legume, where&nbsp;<em>CYC2</em>is maintained in the dorsal domain of floral meristem throughout the development of zygomorphy. This finding begs for further research to reveal the ancestral function of&nbsp;<em>CYC2</em>genes in floral development, which had been the key player for the evolution of one of the most homoplastic traits in plants. Overall, our studies highlight the need to employ evolutionary developmental approaches within the context of an explicit phylogenetic framework.
