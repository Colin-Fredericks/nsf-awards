 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial production of the oak acorn as an animal feed crop offers the potential to help mitigate global climate change. Oak tree plantations could remove large quantities of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) from the atmosphere and store it for many decades as part of their biomass where it will not contribute to climate change. Also, such plantings would provide additional benefits in the form of windbreaks, watershed protection, and soil conservation. Little is known, however, about how to successfully cultivate acorns as a modern commercial crop, and it is therefore important to understand and document the knowledge in traditional systems of acorn production. Although acorns were once widely used in cultures throughout the northern hemisphere, the Korean Peninsula is one of the only remaining regions where acorns are still harvested in large quantities on a regular basis. In collaboration with Dr. Dowon Lee a noted expert on traditional Korean village groves at Seoul National University, this project aims to understand and document the traditional ecological knowledge associated with acorn production in the Republic of Korea.\r\n\r\nOak groves were traditionally managed in rural villages to provide food in years when the rice harvest was poor, but now these groves are in danger of disappearing within the next hundred years due to urbanization and over-use. To document this traditional knowledge, in-depth field interviews of villagers, farmers, and others still involved in acorn production/processing will be conducted in the Republic of Korea. A lengthy questionnaire will be prepared used to guide the structured field interviews. Groves, techniques, tools, and materials will also be documented photographically. Sites will be chosen in conjunction with Dr. Lee to encompass a cross-section of the South Korean regions historically containing protected groves. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOak acorns are an ancient food with the modern-day potential to help mitigate climate change.  The fact that they are produced on trees providing long-term atmospheric carbon sequestration makes this tree \"grain\" a compelling climate-friendly alternative to annual cereal grains.  An important first step in assessing their potential as a modern crop is to understand their traditional production and utilization.  The Korean Peninsula is one of the few remaining regions on earth where acorns are still used regularly in large quantities for human consumption. The objective of this research project was to document and analyze traditional acorn production and utilization practices in the Republic of Korea (ROK).  Fifteen structured interviews of elders highly knowledgeable in acorn production and use were conducted in villages across all nine political provinces of the ROK during three months of fieldwork in 2014. In order to capture any differences in practices due to environmental conditions, interviews were also split equally across the country\u00c6s five ecological provinces.  In addition, government statistical archives were scoured to see if a picture of current acorn production and consumption could be developed.\n\n \n\nThe results indicate that the acorns produced in the ROK are all wild-collected with no management practices being employed to enhance production.  Bearing larger acorns, Quercus acutissima is the most commonly used species, but Q. serrata is actually the most favored because of texture, starch yield, and flavor.  A variety of traditional processing and tannin removal methods were documented along with fifteen different acorn food dishes and seven medicinal uses for acorns.  Acorn foods are widespread, with the majority now being produced in commercial factories from imported acorns.  In 2012, net ROK consumption was 13,127 metric tons of acorns, with 94% being imported from China, 3% from South Africa, and only 3% being produced domestically.  Domestic acorn production has plummeted 75% since 1995 and collection and processing is now seen as a pastime of the elderly.  This research is helping to preserve traditional knowledge in the face of the ROK\u00c6s rapid urbanization while simultaneously highlighting the commercial viability of this underutilized climate-friendly food crop indigenous to five continents.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Shawn Overstreet"
