 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural gas, consisting primarily of methane is an accessible and abundant energy source with high potential to meet energy demands in an environmentally sustainable way. Recent developments in accessing methane trapped within shale formations, and within ice formations further increase its utility. In order to take advantage of this energy source in a practical way, methane is converted into other forms, such as syngas (mainly hydrogen), where it is ultimately used for production of fuels or in the chemical industry. The inefficiency of the current industry conversion methods has led to the development of non-thermal (low temperature) methods. The use of plasmas (a charged gas) for the conversion of methane to syngas has shown potential as a solution to increased energy efficiencies. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Tomohiro Nozaki at Tokyo Institute of Technology in Japan, an expert in plasma-surface interactions with extensive experience in this particular reaction. The results from this study could ultimately lead to positive changes in the energy market for a clean and efficient natural gas.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed reaction is mixing methane with carbon dioxide (CO2), to produce CO and hydrogen. Thus, CO2 is recycled from other industrial plants, while converting methane in the process. The key challenge to overcome is to eliminate the solid carbon buildup on the catalyst surface, which reduces efficiencies of the reaction over time. The reaction chamber that will be used in this study includes a catalyst bed, where a gas chromatograph and spectrometer will be used to analyze the conversion. Other techniques such as x-ray diffraction will also be used. Fundamental chemical mechanisms will be studied with the spectroscopy, while the gas chromatograph will provide overall information for optimization of the reaction. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",
