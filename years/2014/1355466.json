The project will build and diversify the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce for these industries, enhance scientific computing infrastructure, and promote innovation and research.  The research, organized through the Center for Regional Climate Studies (CRCS) and the Center for Sustainable Materials Science (CSMS), will address agricultural productivity and adaptation to climate variations and develop innovative plant materials based polymers and composites and associated technologies for the benefit of society.  \r\n\r\nINSPIRE-ND is a partnership between North Dakota State University, the University of North Dakota, and the five Tribal Colleges in collaboration with Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, Community Colleges, and state agriculture and manufacturing partners.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe research goals are ambitious and potentially transformative. CRCS will study linkages between regional climate, hydrologic processes, crop production, and autonomous farmer adaptions. Expected outcomes include improved understanding of extreme wet and dry events and agricultural production and adaption in response to climate changes. CSMS will create novel materials that can be programmed to degrade with photo-triggers by designing and preparing bio-based polymers and thermosets. The work on novel bio-based materials will span from fundamental polymer research to commercialization and life cycle assessment. The project utilizes state of the art research approaches to address problems of regional, national, and global importance.\r\n\r\nInvestments in workforce development, STEM education, and diversity will be coordinated through EMerging PrOgrams for WorkforcE Development, OutReach, Education, and Diversity - ND (EMPOWERED-ND) - which will include mentoring for students, postdocs and faculty, Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), Graduate Assistantship Programs, and private industry internships, as well as the new Native American Success in Science and Engineering (NASSE) initiative and an expansion of the highly successful NATURE program (now NATURE+), which engages Native American students via Sunday Academies and Summer Camps.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The Innovative and Strategic Program Initiatives for Research and Education-North Dakota (INSPIRE-ND) RII Track-1 award developed two research centers: 1) Center for Regional Climate Change (CRCS) and 2) Center for Sustainable Materials Science (CSMS). INSPIRE-ND fostered critical research infrastructure, and integrated research, education and human resources with workforce development initiatives that strengthened ND's research competitiveness.</p>\n<p>CSMS focused on an important issue related to sustainability-that of deriving materials from agricultural and forestry resources. Research focused on polymers from biomass, new bio-based monomers, composites using biobased fibers and fillers, and end-of-life degradation of materials with a view toward materials that could be competitive to current materials based on petrochemicals.</p>\n<p>CSMS trained the next generation of scientists to design the materials of the future with sustainability concepts in mind. CSMS trained 12 postdoctoral associates, 81 graduate students, and 103 undergraduate students. These participants presented their work at CSMS meetings, gave presentations at conferences, and participated in workshops.</p>\n<p>In 2018, CSMS organized a workshop on entrepreneurship. This event included lectures on business opportunities, writing a winning business plan, patents, and a keynote speaker. In 2019, the Center organized a summit on \"Translating Bio-Based Materials Research to Industry.\" Nearly 80 people participated, including 12 members from industry and national labs. This summit included speaker presentations, poster sessions, networking, and panels on bio-based consumer products and the future of bio-based materials.</p>\n<p>The CSMS team published 162 papers in peer-reviewed journals, gave 676 conference presentations, and submitted 27 invention disclosures (5 patents granted).</p>\n<p>CSMS researchers submitted 30 joint proposals for additional funding (20 funded, $7,098,604). As the program established broad-based expertise in bio-based materials, North Dakota State University (NDSU) joined the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2), an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC). CB2 received its Phase II grant and is now headquartered at NDSU.</p>\n<p>CRCS focused on investigating hydrological, meteorological, and biological processes and their association with agricultural activities-one of the major economic cornerstones of the Northern Great Plains region. The research efforts conducted by CRCS are documented with 126 peer-reviewed journal papers and 295 conference presentations.</p>\n<p>CRCS research enhanced observations of hydrological, meteorological, and biological data of the region by establishing new observations stations. Other data sources, such as satellites, were used to expand agricultural and biological data over the region. Examples of innovative observation research includes the discovery of new-to-North Dakota dragonfly and beetle species, and new methods to identify agricultural features in aerial photography. The CRCS identified new ways to detect agricultural planting dates and blowing snow from satellites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Synergistic modeling and observation studies investigated the regional hydrological, agricultural, and economic status. A new hydrological model was developed to study the hydrological extrema of the region, specifically targeting the cold climate and for accounting regional hydrological features such as the Prairie Pothole Region. A linked economical and agricultural study was conducted to evaluate the impacts of economics and weather phenomena on the region's agriculture, including statistical studies of farmers' changing crop selections as autonomous adaptations to climate and weather phenomena.</p>\n<p>The CRCS team studied regional hydrological and meteorological extremes of concurrent events, such as the impacts of Devil's Lake flooding on regional water quality, and the impacts of forest fire smoke-a now common regional meteorological phenomenon. Additionally, the impacts of hydrological and meteorological extremes on regional agricultural practices were investigated.</p>\n<p>80 undergraduate students and 83 graduate students were trained in CRCS research. Those students were trained for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related areas to build ND's workforce.</p>\n<p>CRCS is involved in ND farming activities by providing crop fertilizer nutrient updates for all ND crops to farmers and giving agricultural-related presentations to thousands of local farmers and ranchers. Some research outcomes of the CRCS, like the Devil's Lake studies, were invited to be presented at the Upper Sheyenne River Joint Water Resource Board meeting for assisting regional decision making.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>broader impacts</em>&nbsp;outcomes include progress in the areas of diversity and workforce development. INSPIRE-ND had 18 Graduate Student Research Assistantship (GSRA) participants, including eight women and five American Indians (AI). The Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Education (NATURE) Program offered educational programming for secondary students. The Tribal College/University Summer Camps served 1,105 participants (1,076 were AI). The Bridge Camp, started in 2019 for students before college matriculation served 27 participants (26 were AI). The University Summer Camps served 109 participants (all were AI). The NATURE Sunday Academy recorded 2,558 participant engagements (2,507 were AI). Forty-seven Sunday Academy activities were created, six CRCS themed, nine CSMS themed, and 10 were converted to high school lesson plans via the Education Portal.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Innovative and Strategic Program Initiatives for Research and Education-North Dakota (INSPIRE-ND) RII Track-1 award developed two research centers: 1) Center for Regional Climate Change (CRCS) and 2) Center for Sustainable Materials Science (CSMS). INSPIRE-ND fostered critical research infrastructure, and integrated research, education and human resources with workforce development initiatives that strengthened ND's research competitiveness.\n\nCSMS focused on an important issue related to sustainability-that of deriving materials from agricultural and forestry resources. Research focused on polymers from biomass, new bio-based monomers, composites using biobased fibers and fillers, and end-of-life degradation of materials with a view toward materials that could be competitive to current materials based on petrochemicals.\n\nCSMS trained the next generation of scientists to design the materials of the future with sustainability concepts in mind. CSMS trained 12 postdoctoral associates, 81 graduate students, and 103 undergraduate students. These participants presented their work at CSMS meetings, gave presentations at conferences, and participated in workshops.\n\nIn 2018, CSMS organized a workshop on entrepreneurship. This event included lectures on business opportunities, writing a winning business plan, patents, and a keynote speaker. In 2019, the Center organized a summit on \"Translating Bio-Based Materials Research to Industry.\" Nearly 80 people participated, including 12 members from industry and national labs. This summit included speaker presentations, poster sessions, networking, and panels on bio-based consumer products and the future of bio-based materials.\n\nThe CSMS team published 162 papers in peer-reviewed journals, gave 676 conference presentations, and submitted 27 invention disclosures (5 patents granted).\n\nCSMS researchers submitted 30 joint proposals for additional funding (20 funded, $7,098,604). As the program established broad-based expertise in bio-based materials, North Dakota State University (NDSU) joined the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2), an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC). CB2 received its Phase II grant and is now headquartered at NDSU.\n\nCRCS focused on investigating hydrological, meteorological, and biological processes and their association with agricultural activities-one of the major economic cornerstones of the Northern Great Plains region. The research efforts conducted by CRCS are documented with 126 peer-reviewed journal papers and 295 conference presentations.\n\nCRCS research enhanced observations of hydrological, meteorological, and biological data of the region by establishing new observations stations. Other data sources, such as satellites, were used to expand agricultural and biological data over the region. Examples of innovative observation research includes the discovery of new-to-North Dakota dragonfly and beetle species, and new methods to identify agricultural features in aerial photography. The CRCS identified new ways to detect agricultural planting dates and blowing snow from satellites. \n\nSynergistic modeling and observation studies investigated the regional hydrological, agricultural, and economic status. A new hydrological model was developed to study the hydrological extrema of the region, specifically targeting the cold climate and for accounting regional hydrological features such as the Prairie Pothole Region. A linked economical and agricultural study was conducted to evaluate the impacts of economics and weather phenomena on the region's agriculture, including statistical studies of farmers' changing crop selections as autonomous adaptations to climate and weather phenomena.\n\nThe CRCS team studied regional hydrological and meteorological extremes of concurrent events, such as the impacts of Devil's Lake flooding on regional water quality, and the impacts of forest fire smoke-a now common regional meteorological phenomenon. Additionally, the impacts of hydrological and meteorological extremes on regional agricultural practices were investigated.\n\n80 undergraduate students and 83 graduate students were trained in CRCS research. Those students were trained for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-related areas to build ND's workforce.\n\nCRCS is involved in ND farming activities by providing crop fertilizer nutrient updates for all ND crops to farmers and giving agricultural-related presentations to thousands of local farmers and ranchers. Some research outcomes of the CRCS, like the Devil's Lake studies, were invited to be presented at the Upper Sheyenne River Joint Water Resource Board meeting for assisting regional decision making.\n\nThe broader impacts outcomes include progress in the areas of diversity and workforce development. INSPIRE-ND had 18 Graduate Student Research Assistantship (GSRA) participants, including eight women and five American Indians (AI). The Nurturing American Tribal Undergraduate Research and Education (NATURE) Program offered educational programming for secondary students. The Tribal College/University Summer Camps served 1,105 participants (1,076 were AI). The Bridge Camp, started in 2019 for students before college matriculation served 27 participants (26 were AI). The University Summer Camps served 109 participants (all were AI). The NATURE Sunday Academy recorded 2,558 participant engagements (2,507 were AI). Forty-seven Sunday Academy activities were created, six CRCS themed, nine CSMS themed, and 10 were converted to high school lesson plans via the Education Portal. Sixteen students participated in the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), nine of whom were women, five identified as American Indian and one who identified as Black also. To date, three REU participants enrolled in graduate school.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kelly A Rusch"
