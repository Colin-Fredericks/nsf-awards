 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by building examples and studying their possibilities for fostering learning as well as challenges to using them well. As technologies become smaller and more portable, the possibility of wearable computing becomes more and more realistic. This proposal takes advantage of this possibility to help elementary school aged children learn about anatomy and physiology by making clothing with sensors and displays to help kids see how their own bodies work. For example, a life-sized pair of lungs on a shirt might light up to show how air flows in and out of a child's lungs in time with their own breathing.   \r\n\r\nThe project has interconnected research and design activities. A formative inquiry phase will document what kids do and do not understand about their bodies through surveys, interviews, and a \"body map\" approach, while in-service elementary school teachers in a STEM education Master's degree program will be probed as to learning goals for kids in this domain. An iterative, participatory and informant design process will then be used to refine e-textile shirts and associated learning activities in two contexts that host underserved youth: the CASA de Maryland, and the Boys and Girls Club of Hartford County. Co-design will also be undertaken with teachers. Finally, learning studies will be done on children in schools and informal settings to probe students' pre-post gains in physiology and anatomy knowledge, and knowledge of how everyday activities change health and biological processes in the body. Video observation and logfiles will be used to study the learning activities themselves, and coded using Chinn and Malhotra's framework for scientific inquiry. Finally, the technology designs themselves and relevant activities will be disseminated through the use of online portals such as Instructables, so that other educators can build or experiment with similar health education wearables.",

Our overarching research aim was to develop new wearable learning tools that used the human body and body movement as the primary source of inquiry--to support children's scientific inquiry skills, to help children design and conduct life-relevant experiments using their own body data, and to provide a new way to learn about human anatomy and physiology.

SharedPhys integrates live-streaming wearable physiological sensors, whole-body interaction, and real-time large-screen visualizations to create a novel mixed-reality learning environment. With SharedPhys, children interact physically--both explicitly via body movement, gesture, and position as well as implicitly via their changing physiology and can observe different representations of their body data in real-time.<br /><br /> </li>\n<li>Finally, to engage children in creating their own complex interactive systems, we developed and conducted multi-day workshops using the littleBits electronic prototyping platform [in progress] and developed and evaluated a prototyping tool, called <em>PrototypAR</em>, that uses augmented reality to scaffold the design, test, and iteration process [IDC'19].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We developed these tools using a design method called <em>participatory design</em>, which engaged elementary school teachers, informal science learning staff, and children directly in our design process.

In addition, we worked with local elementary school teachers to co-develop a one-week curriculum using our BodyVis and SharedPhys tools, which we iteratively implemented both in Years 3 and 4 of the award in six elementary school classrooms [ICLS'18].
