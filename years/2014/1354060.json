 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lightning is an exceptionally powerful natural phenomenon; its destructive effects have been a source of fear and fascination for humans throughout history.  Scientists have a relatively good understanding of the physics of lightning, but its ecological importance at the landscape scale - especially its role as an agent of tree death - remain unclear.  Measuring the effects of lightning in tropical forests is important because lightning frequency is expected to increase by as much as 50% over the next few decades as the climate warms.  Moreover, tropical forest structure is changing as lianas (woody vines) become more abundant.  This research will provide the foundation for understanding how such changes will affect forest dynamics and ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling in the tropical rainforests of Panama.  The field site in Panama is a popular tourist destination, thus the project provides a unique opportunity for participants to interact regularly with the public. Student training is an integral part of the project. Collaboration with the Kentucky Science Center will result in the production of a Podcast highlighting this research, and public discussions with project participants in a Science Caf\u00e9 format. \r\n\r\nEcologists consistently list lightning as a source of tropical tree mortality, yet supporting data are remarkably scant.  This project will systematically quantify lightning effects on tropical trees and lianas on a forest-wide scale in real time.  The work will integrate information from field ecology, physics, and plant electrophysiology to answer three basic questions: What is the extent of lightning-caused tree mortality across a lowland tropical forest landscape? Are some trees or tree species especially susceptible to, or resistant to, the damaging effects of lightning? Do lianas function as lightning rods, protecting their host trees against lightning damage?  Field work will be conducted in Panama at one of the best-studied tropical forest sites in the world.  The methodology includes the installation of automated electronic sensors for monitoring strike events over large expanses of forest canopy.  This project will also deploy an experimental lightning induction device - the Balloon Originating Lightning Trigger - to experimentally manipulate strike events to trees and lianas on isolated islands.  Results of this work will fundamentally transform our understanding of tropical forest dynamics by quantifying lightning effects across the landscape and uncovering key interactions between lightning, lianas, and trees.  In a practical context, this project will also reveal potentially confounding effects of communications towers and canopy cranes on tree mortality rates. This proposal is co-funded by the Division of Environmental Biology and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Physics Division.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLightning kills or damages thousands of trees worldwide each year.  Although lightning frequency is highest in the tropics, we know very little about its ecological effects specifically in tropical forests.  This problem is compounded by the unpredictability of lightning strikes, and the logistical difficulty of accurately locating and identifying lightning damage when it occurs.  The main goal of this project was to overcome these logistical problems by establishing a lightning monitoring network in the rainforest of Panama.  Beginning in the rainy season of 2014, we mounted video cameras on towers extending above the forest canopy on Barro Colorado Island and used lightning flash images captured by multiple cameras to locate strike sites by triangulation.  This system allowed us to survey any given strike location within days of the event, and then track associated tree mortality over the subsequent months and years.  \n\nWe used this system to locate almost 20 strikes over the three rainy seasons covered by this project.  This number is relatively low because 2014 and 2015 were exceptionally dry years in Panama due to a strong El Nino effect, and due to the spatial limitation of the field of view of the camera network.  (By comparison, the network recorded more than 20 strikes in a single storm in 2017.)  Despite these constraints, this project generated sufficient data to show that the number of trees damaged per strike ranged from 1 to 32, and that lightning is a major cause of mortality specifically for the largest trees in the forest.  It also allowed us to examine the role of lianas (woody vines) in the distribution of lightning damage.  By carefully examining strike sites over weeks and months, we found that lianas can reduce damage to trees located on the perimeter of strikes by acting as conduits for the bulk of the electric current.  Secondarily, this project provided the first precise measurements of the characteristics of tropical lightning flashes (polarity, intensity, and duration) using the latest technological and engineering advances in field (landscape-scale) voltage measurement.  Finally, we constructed and tested a balloon-based lightning induction system that may be used for future experimentation with lightning in tropical forest ecosystems. \n\nWe published four highly collaborative scientific articles based on the results of this project: two that respectively reviewed the literature concerning the effects of lighting in forests, and the potential relevance of vines in the distribution of lightning damage; one that described the lightning monitoring network and the types of data it produces; and one that summarizes a model for predicting the amount of damage a tree will experience during a strike based on its electrical properties.  We presented the results of this project to other scientists at multiple professional meetings, as well as to K-12 students, and to the general public via a collaboration with the Kentucky Science Center.  One K-12 teacher and five students (graduate and undergraduate) participated in the field work in Panama.  The monitoring network established in this project remains in operation, and is expected to continue to generate results for at least three more years.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen P Yanoviak"
