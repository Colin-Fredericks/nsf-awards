 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Understanding the role of hyporheic processes on nitrous oxide emissions at the stream network scale \r\n\r\nField evidence confirms that stream processing of reactive nitrogen (Nr), primarily ammonium and nitrate, is a potentially important source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Stream emissions may account for up to 10% of global anthropogenic N2O production and N2O has 310 times more warming potential per unit weight than carbon dioxide. In streams, the production of N2O occurs primarily in streambed sediments, and the mass transport of reactive species, i.e., dissolved oxygen, Nr, and organic carbon, via hyporheic flow strongly influences reaction rates, residence times, and subsequent N2O emissions. Previous research has shown a strong interaction between hydraulics in the hyporheic zone (HZ) and streambed morphology. The project couples a novel Lagrangian modeling approach based on residence time distributions differentiated for channel reach types and local hyporheic components of the stream network with seasonal synoptic sampling in two watersheds with contrasting land use. \r\n\r\nImproved understanding of watershed and network scale controls on potent greenhouse gas emissions will be societally-relevant to policy makers addressing elevated Nr concentrations in surface waters. Research results will be applicable to land use management, non-point source pollution, and river restoration projects. The products from this research will provide a model for estimating the fate of Nr at the stream network scale, offer a new understanding of the role of HZ at the stream network scale, and clarify the effect of stream network structure and stream morphology on HZ processes. Results from this research can be extended to study transport of other solutes and pathogens along streams. With the advance in remote sensing and GIS tools, data for this approach will be more readily available and thus applicable to provide predictions when minimal field survey data are available. The broader impacts also involve the outreach to high school students, and the work with the McCall Outdoor Science School in regards to communication of the work in a climate change context.",

A portion of it flows beneath and besides the stream and river reaches in the so-called hyporheic zone (HZ). Along with the benthic zone, this band of surface-water saturated sediments has been suggested as a hot spot for biogeochemical reactions occurring in streams and rivers. One of the most important transformations is that of nitrogen, whose concentrations have been increasing in aquatic systems since the green revolution. &nbsp;Reactive nitrogen is a significant source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). Emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O from streams and rivers potentially are up to 0.7 Tg y<sup>-1</sup>, equivalent to 10% of global anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions. Its production mainly occurs via microbially-mediated denitrification that transforms nitrate to the nitrogenous gasses di-nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O). It has been suggested that HZ may be the key source of N<sub>2</sub>O in riverine systems because it has both oxic and anoxic conditions. The latter is a necessary condition for denitrification to occur. However, we do not have a conceptual and predictive model to characterize which reaches of a riverine network emit N<sub>2</sub>O and which portion of the reach, among hyporheic zone, benthic zone and water column, is the main contributor of those emissions. Thus, the goal of this research was to understand and quantify the role of hyporheic processes on nitrous oxide emissions at the stream network scale for different land-use and land cover, biomes, stream and river size, season and climatic conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">To address this goal, this research used a series of synoptic field sampling surveys, synthesis of previous published data and numerical modeling. The synoptic sampling campaigns were in the fall, winter, spring and summer seasons in two contrasting river basins: the Manistee R. Basin (MI, 83% forested) and the Tippecanoe R. Basin (IN, 82% row-crop agriculture). On each sampling date, water samples for inorganic nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus) and dissolved greenhouse gasses (nitrous oxide: N<sub>2</sub>O, carbon dioxide: CO<sub>2</sub> and methane: CH<sub>4</sub>) were collected along with physical site descriptors (flow depth width, velocity and temperature and type of substrate) at 80 sites in each basin over the course of 24hrs. These data were augmented with a meta-analysis from data available in the literature from the LINXII streams (USA), the Kalamazoo River (MI, USA) and the Swale-Ouse River (a mid-sized UK river), six large river networks in Africa (Congo, Ati-Galana-Sabaki, Betsiboka, Rianila, Tana and Zambezi) and in the tidal section of the Hudson River (NJ, USA). The analysis of these data allowed the identification of a new dimensionless scaling framework. This framework shows that the dimensionless N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, F<sup>*</sup>N<sub>2</sub>O, (ratio between N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes and loads of nitrate and ammonium) depend on the benthic-hyporheic Damk&ouml;hler number defined as the ratio between the hyporheic median residence time at the reach scale and time of denitrification in streams and on the stream Damk&ouml;hler number defined as the ratio between the vertical turbulence mixing time and the time of denitrification in rivers (Figure 1).</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Body\">This research results confirm that emissions rate per unit area decreases from streams, which are defined as riverine systems with widths less than approximately 30m, toward rivers, systems with widths larger than 30 m (Figure 2). Hyporheic processes have a primary role on nitrous oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O, emissions from streams dominating that of benthic and water column production by 1 order of magnitude. However, it has a negligible effect in rivers (Figure 3). Land-use and land-cover have an important effect on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions because they affect: (1) stream hydrology, (2) morphology and (3) nitrate loads. Similarly, seasonality affects N<sub>2</sub>O production due to changes in hydraulics, water temperature and nutrient loads. Variations in stream hydraulics and nutrient loads are directly included in the characterization of both Damk&ouml;hler numbers and the dimensionless flux of N<sub>2</sub>O; whereas the effect of water temperature is modeled by scaling F<sup>*</sup>N<sub>2</sub>O with an Arrhenius type equation. The developed dimensionless framework captures both hyporheic and surface hydromorphological and biogeochemical processes to predict N<sub>2</sub>O emissions (Figure 4) during average flow conditions. The data analysis shows that it is a robust method, which only uses standard measurements including: reach scale water depth, width, velocity, temperature, substrate and bedform types and nitrate and ammonium concentration. This framework allows identifying the reaches, which are &ldquo;hot spots&rdquo; for N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, along riverine networks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jennifer&nbsp;L&nbsp;Tank</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1344661/1344661_10295018_1501531642458_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1344661/1344661_10295018_1501531642458_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1344661/1344661_10295018_1501531642458_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conceptual model describing the relative role of hydrodynamics and biogeochemical transformations on N2O emissions within three zones of increasing stream size.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Alessandra Marzadria, Martha M.
