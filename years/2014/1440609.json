 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific challenges are often addressed by a team of people from multiple science disciplines, institutions and geographic locations.  These teams use computation, communication and data resources scattered across many sites or institutions.  Because of the need to authorize access to these resources, it is currently a non-trivial problem for a team to set up the needed working environment, and that problem delays research projects and consumes time and other resources.  The sources of difficulties include: campus and research communities are familiar with their own Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions but are not familiar with the entire solution space; general purpose solution software has been developed in different environments but adoption outside the original environment has been limited; and members of domain science teams are not expert in distributed systems integration.\r\n\r\nThis project is designing a system architecture supporting self-managed collaboration and federation of services named  \"FeduShare\".  The FeduShare framework builds on existing Identity Management solutions such as the InCommon federation, Shibboleth servers and the GENI solutions for people/resource management/authorization that build upon them.  Case studies used to inform the investigation include InCommon based logins for shell-based access to campus computing clusters, and the integration with identity management in GENI for the purposes of establishing seamless end-to-end communication paths.",

These collaborations typically share resources such as storage, file systems, computational systems, and special research internet networks; these are called campus information technology (IT) resources and services, or cyberinfrastructure (CI).  Campuses have moved to centralizing management of CI with the ability to burst to the Cloud for extra capacity; therefore researchers who need to share such CI now turn to their campus IT organizations to ask for help in setting up reliable access control that easily lets the right collaborators in and securely prevents access by any unauthorized persons.\n\n \n\nFeduShare?s intellectual merit is that it addresses a cyberinfrastructure gap that exists between national and campus access control designs.  Access control is usually a CI component that is invisible to the end user &ndash; unless it doesn?t work end-to-end and becomes a barrier to getting work done easily. Large scale national research programs such as XSEDE, Open Science Grid, science gateways such as iPlant, and the GeNi network have solved the problem of distributed access to CI by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to identify people, resources and systems.  Unfortunately, university campus IT organizations do not use PKI (with a few exceptions) to identify people.  Instead, they use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), a federated trust fabric such as InCommon and software such as Shibboleth.

As a result, three problems arise for research collaborations:  (1) how to allow a researcher to list their self-selected collaborators, who could be from anywhere, as a meaningful entity (Virtual Organization, or VO) recognized by the campus IT access control systems; (2) how to provide access to campus managed CI for those VO members using SAML based access control; and (3)  how to connect campus-managed CI as a ?last mile? endpoint from national PKI-based CI into the campuses.  \n\n \n\nThe FeduShare project solved these problems for some common use cases, including: (1) use of home campus single-sign-on for SSH console logon to a High Performance Computing cluster managed by a different; (2) using CILogon 2.0 Virtual Organization manager (coManage); and (3) adding a SAML Attribute Authority to the GeNi CI to make GeNi-defined groups and roles available to campus managed systems.
