 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, from The University of Central Florida, and the Museum of Science and Industry, investigates a three-cycle research and development process where middle school student learners will be immersed in a mixed reality environment while interacting with functional metaphors to determine the effects of conceptual change, motivation and scientific habits of mind while engaged in learning physics content. The project is guided by the following research questions: How does the opportunity to embody elements of an immersive simulation affect a learner's propensity to experience conceptual change and develop scientific habits of mind? What design features of missed reality environments best support metaphors? What metrics are most effective for assessing learning through body-based metaphors? What are the practical considerations to creating immersive metaphor-based learning experiences in ISE institutions such as a Science Center?\r\n\r\nThe investigators will use a between subjects mixed method approach with middle school students (N = 360) involving three research cycles that are performed in controlled conditions. The multiple iterations will allow modifications to the study's design to dig deeper into the data and afford more careful analysis, revisions and modifications to simulation content, protocol and data collection instruments and the technology installation. \r\n\r\nMiddle school students will be recruited from local schools and the Museum of Science and Industry visitors. The evaluation plan includes the assessment of perceived values of using whole-body metaphors within mixed reality environments to learn physics. Professional audiences, educators and ISE practitioners will assess the impact, design and content associated with research on learning, mixed reality design, science and physics education. \r\n\r\nResearch on understanding the process of using whole-body interactions in a mixed reality environments will help educational researchers and practitioners in the field understand the effectiveness of metaphor based learning of scientific concepts with whole body interactions. This project contributes knowledge about how people learn within informal settings. This theory-driven design approach has the potential for broad implementation in both formal and informal environments.",

Specifically, the objective was to explore the effects of whole-body interactions with mixed reality (MR) technologies&mdash;environments that merge real world and virtual elements. In the context of this project several immersive simulations of science phenomena were built that allowed K12 students to embed themselves within the system they were tasked with learning about. The primary simulation used on this project, called MEteor, is a simulation of planetary astronomy that allows middle school users to play the role of an asteroid. The simulation is projected onto a 30 foot by 10 foot floor surface and laser-scanning technology makes it possible to track the precise location of the student as they walk, run, and jump across the floor. &nbsp;As a means of learning about how objects move in space, the students use their bodies to make predictions about how an asteroid would travel as it encounters gravitational forces from planets and other objects in space. The students receive real-time feedback about their actions, and an associated wall-projection gives them a summary of their actions and other visualizations that prompt them to reflect on their predictions and refine their ideas about kinematics. In a controlled study, the learning outcomes of students who used the whole-body MR version of MEteor was compared to students who used a mouse and keyboard version of the same simulation. The data from this study showed that students who used the whole-body version scored higher on assessments of their physics knowledge after using the simulation. The whole-body participants also showed greater levels of engagement and feelings of efficacy in science. These results demonstrate the potential for embodied interactions with science simulations to enhance learning outcomes and create more powerful educational experiences with the ability to affect students&rsquo; identities and their interest in science. In addition to MEteor, this project developed an MR simulation of waves that allowed for multi-player embodied interaction, and a game-like simulation of basic energy concepts targeted at primary school children. These additional simulations showed the potential for embodied learning to be used with more abstract science concepts, as well as in more collaborative contexts.</p>\n<p>In addition to conducting controlled studies of learning and engagement, this project also involved installations of these simulations in free-choice learning environments, namely sciences centers and children&rsquo;s museums. The MR simulations built on these projects were installed in several different museum sites in the U.S., and more qualitative studies were conducted to observe the degree to which these simulations supported productive learning interactions and conversations in more naturalistic learning settings. For example, we found that by making some information about the simulation available to the child participant and some information available only to the observing parents, it created situations where children and their parents had productive conversations that often included critical science concepts. In the later stages of this project the research team worked with museum practitioners to develop tools that would allow for more flexible facilitation of these embodied learning experiences.</p>\n<p>This project also led to some important technological advances for supporting MR experiences that specifically aim to promote STEM learning. In particular, the project developed several innovative ways of using motion-tracking tools, ranging from expensive laser scanning devices to the more affordable Microsoft Kinect technology, to respond to the nuanced kinds of movement produced by students in a learning context.</p>\n<p>This project achieved its intellectual merit goals by providing an empirical basis to support embodied learning designs. The studies conducted as part of this project showed that students&rsquo; own bodies and body movement can be the source of effective metaphors for understanding complex STEM ideas. The data collected about student learning and the guidelines for effective educational technology design bolster the application of embodied cognition and embodiment theory to the development of innovative educational environments.</p>\n<p>This project also achieved its broader impact goals by instigating numerous partnerships with museums and by creating several new exhibit designs that reached hundreds of children over the course of the project. Research findings and design principles have been widely distributed and are available for practitioners to create effective applications of available augmented and mixed reality technologies that attract and engage visitors. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robb&nbsp;W&nbsp;Lindgren</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1417966/1417966_10130086_1496123597590_MEteorSketch--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1417966/1417966_10130086_1496123597590_MEteorSketch--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MEteor Design Sketch\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1417966/1417966_10130086_1496123597590_MEteorSketch--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MEteor Design Sketch\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A concept sketch of the MEteor simulation design</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">MEteor Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robb&nbsp;W&nbsp;Lindgren</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MEteor Design Sketch</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1417966/1417966_10130086_1496123747980_MEteorscreenshot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1417966/1417966_10130086_1496123747980_MEteorscreenshot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MEteor Screenshot\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1417966/1417966_10130086_1496123747980_MEteorscreenshot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MEteor Screenshot\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A screenshot of the MEteor simulation.
