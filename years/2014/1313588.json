 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funding to support four equipment-based upgrades at the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) laboratory. The purpose of these requests is to support the research and educational role of the laboratory, as well as its service to other users. The Arizona AMS laboratory functions as a service, research and educational laboratory. A key component is providing educational opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students from around the country to learn AMS techniques. Many students who have benefited from these programs have gone on to start their own research with applications in AMS. The lab also provides key support to users, including interpretation and understanding of their results. \r\n\r\nThe award will support equipment and related support for four majors areas of study: low-voltage AMS, Iodine-129 measurements, sample automation and dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) in groundwaters. These areas all represent areas of emphasis that have been highlighted at recent AMS and Radiocarbon conferences. The development of AMS capabilities at lower energies can lead to development of smaller machines or new experimental approaches, as has already been demonstrated. Sample automation is vital for more rapid sample preparation, and the improvements to 129I, DIC and DOC measurement capability will directly impact Arizona's ability to serve the needs of our own research, and those of our users.",

This long half-life means its radiation is not a hazard, but it can be used to monitor ocean circulation and other events. We first measured I-129 in corals from the South China Sea and western Pacific (near Guam) to observe I-129 produced during atmospheric nuclear testing in the 1950?s. This signal can be traced to US tests in the Marshall Islands. We also undertook a long seven-year study of I-129 measured at the same location (Scripps Pier in La Jolla, California). We wanted to see if we could observe I-129 from the Fukushima nuclear accident which occurred in March 2011. We only observed an annually-varying signal due to local chemistry and no clear Fukushima signal. We also noticed that the levels were a bit elevated, which we connected to other sources of I-129 from the Columbia River. This was confirmed by measurements in the Pacific Northwest USA, where a clearly high signal of I-129 is coming from the Columbia River. We connect this to previous releases of iodine from the Hanford site. The two figures show the I-129 signals from the ?bomb? spike in the 1950s and the results from Scripps Pier. These results are important to the broader questions of ocean water circulation along the West Coast as well as across the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n<p>We also undertook improvements to the sample preparation for radiocarbon samples at the University of Arizona.

These improvements develop the capability of the University of Arizona's AMS system to extract carbon-14 from a wider variety of samples.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: A.
