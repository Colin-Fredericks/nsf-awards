 "awd_abstract_narration": "Swarms of low-cost autonomous robots can potentially be used to collect massive amounts of sensor data and transport heavy payloads across long distances.  Novel robots for swarm applications are currently being developed as a result of recent advances in computing, sensing, actuation, power, control, and 3D printing.  However, there remains a need for theoretically-grounded methods of programming robotic swarms to achieve target sensing and transport objectives under realistic conditions.  In many applications, each robot will have highly limited capabilities, undependable communication, no information on its location, and no map of its surroundings.  This research project develops a framework for reliably controlling arbitrarily large populations of robots with such constraints.  The project focuses specifically on the problem of regulating robot interactions with different types of features that may be present in their environment.  These features can be regions of interest that require certain distributions of robots along their perimeters, or they may be objects that require teams of robots to move them to specified destinations.  The developed framework applies techniques from the fields of chemical kinetics, social insect behavior, dynamical systems, feedback control, and optimization.  It provides a formal way to program robotic swarms for a range of tasks of wide benefit to society, including environmental monitoring, search-and-rescue operations, disaster recovery, automated construction and manufacturing, and even biomedical imaging and drug delivery at the nanoscale.\r\n\r\nThis project develops a rigorous methodology for feedback control and optimization of robotic swarm population dynamics to produce target coverage and manipulation behaviors in unknown environments using only local sensing and common broadcast information.  The approach incorporates stochastic, deterministic, and hybrid stochastic-deterministic models at different levels of abstraction that describe the robots? roles, task transitions, motion, and manipulation dynamics.  It includes a novel encounter-based approach to boundary coverage that does not require characterization of encounter rates or knowledge of environmental parameters.  New stochastic strategies for cooperative manipulation are developed in part from models of desert ant group retrieval that are based on experimental data using rigid loads and ant force sensors.  The control framework is validated through computer simulations and testbed experiments with small mobile robots, each equipped with a multi-degree-of-freedom gripper that is designed as part of this project.  Beyond robotics, the project provides analytical tools for a deeper understanding of surface coverage processes in biology, such as protein adsorption, and the behavioral and biomechanical mechanisms that underlie collective transport strategies in social insects.",

For example, robotic swarms would be capable of collecting massive amounts of sensor data and transporting heavy payloads across long distances in applications such as exploration and mapping, search-and-rescue operations, disaster recovery, monitoring and inspection tasks, and manipulation and construction in remote space and marine environments. In addition, swarms of micro-nanoscale agents can potentially be designed for biomedical applications such as molecular imaging, targeted drug and gene delivery, therapeutics, and diagnostics.&nbsp; However, it is challenging to develop theoretically-grounded methods for programming robotic swarms for such applications, since robots in these scenarios will often have highly limited capabilities, undependable communication, no information on their locations, and no map of their surroundings.</p>\n<p>Toward this end, this project produced novel mathematical and computational techniques for reliably controlling arbitrarily large populations of robots to achieve target sensing, mapping, and payload transport objectives under the constraints outlined above. These techniques provide a formal way to program robotic swarms and process their collected data for a range of tasks of wide benefit to society.&nbsp; The specific intellectual contributions and broader impacts of the project are described below.</p>\n<p>We developed methods that characterize features of an unknown environment from sensor and localization data collected by a swarm of robots that are deployed into the environment. We designed optimization-based schemes for reconstructing a scalar field (such as a temperature field) from a subset of measurements obtained by a sensor network, and for mapping the boundary of a region of interest using only robots&rsquo; encounter times with the region during random exploration.&nbsp; We also devised a method based on topological data analysis for finding collision-free paths around obstacles from noisy robot position data.</p>\n<p>In addition, we designed decentralized controllers for cooperative manipulation of a payload by a team of robots in which each robot only has information on its own motion and the target transport velocity. In one part of this work, we developed an analytical approach to computing swarm parameters that yield random robot configurations with desired coverage statistics around a boundary. We designed decentralized sliding-mode controllers for cooperative payload manipulation by a team of differential-drive robots in an arbitrary configuration. We also studied behaviors of group food retrieval in desert ants in order to identify robot control policies that yield similarly robust performance. We used a mean-field model of the swarm to design robot controllers that reproduce observed features of ant transport dynamics, which we had previously modeled using experimental data from our collaborators. These controllers drive robots to target allocations around randomly encountered payloads, and the allocations are robust to large variations in the swarm density and environment. We also designed controllers based on a reinforcement learning algorithm to replicate collective towing behaviors observed in ants by our collaborators.&nbsp; We implemented these controllers in multi-robot experiments, which revealed that the ants coordinate by adjusting to the maximum speed of the slowest ant.</p>\n<p>This project provided funding for five Ph.D. students, including one female student. Two of the Ph.D. students have graduated and are currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology and as a software engineer at an autonomous vehicle startup company.&nbsp; The project also provided research opportunities for six undergraduate students, including two female students. The research results have been disseminated through journal articles, conference publications and presentations, and invited talks. The project has promoted awareness of STEM careers and provided exposure to robotics, and to swarm robotics in particular, through demonstrations and presentations at various events for high school-aged girls, elementary school students in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, ASU undergraduates, and the general public.
