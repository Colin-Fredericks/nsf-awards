 "awd_abstract_narration": "The connectivity of brain circuits is central to how sensory information is processed, motor activity coordinated, memories stored and retrieved, and how behaviors emerge. While new physical connections can form and old ones be eliminated, much of brain processing depends on how synaptic inputs are integrated and how their strengths are dynamically adjusted. To understand neural connectivity one must develop the means to directly manipulate synaptic transmission by controlling the neurotransmitter-gated receptors of synapses. We propose to do this by engineering optical control into neurotransmitter-gated G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These light-controlled receptors can answer questions at every scale of analysis of the nervous system, from elucidating the contribution of a specific subtype of a neurotransmitter receptor to transmission and plasticity, to the events in a single dendritic spine, to understanding the role of pre- and postsynaptic receptors in neural computations, to understanding the synaptic basis of circuit operations and the role of those circuits in behavior and sensation. An additional and critical part of the project is tool dissemination and web-based tutorials, which will be a high priority for the researchers. Training will be provided to the broader scientific community during the annual Berkeley Advanced Imaging and Microscopy workshop. The proposal involves an international collaboration in research and training with Israel, which will expose students from the US and Israel to the expertise of the labs in the collaborating countries.\r\n\r\nGPCRs form the largest class of membrane signaling proteins. They respond to a wide-array of stimuli. The roles of many GPCRs in neural circuits and behavior are not well-understood. Part of the problem is that the same GPCR may be found on presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory nerve terminals, postsynaptic dendritic spines and on associated glial processes. Another is that even though multiple GPCRs in a cell may couple to the same G-protein they often activate distinct targets due to molecular interactions that localize them to specific protein complexes. Thus, to determine the function of a GPCR one needs tools for that are subtype and cell-type specific, that are spatially precise, and that are rapid and reversible.  In this project, individual full-length GPCRs that can be activated or blocked by light will be developed. Specifically, light-gated versions of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) will be engineered and then used to study synaptic plasticity.",
