 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the world's volcanic island chains, such as Hawaii or the Gal\u00e1pagos, are the surface manifestation of mantle plumes, one of the most important but least well understood tectonic phenomena on Earth. The dominant theory is that mantle plumes originate in the deep mantle, transporting material from the core-mantle boundary to the surface, a distance of nearly 3000 km. As such, variations in the chemical composition of lavas erupted at ocean island volcanoes may provide the only way to sample material from such great depths and, in the process, to determine the composition and structure of these otherwise inaccessible parts of the planet. The primary goal of this project is to carry out a field and geochemical study of the 3 oldest Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to investigate persistent questions related to ocean islands: 1) what is the nature of the material supplying the Gal\u00e1pagos plume, which in turn will provide information about the composition of the deep Earth; 2) how does the plume's composition vary with time; and 3) how do Gal\u00e1pagos volcanoes evolve as they are carried away from the plume's center? The latter question, which addresses the life cycle of ocean island volcanoes, is particularly relevant to ongoing conservation and preservation efforts at oceanic archipelagos worldwide.\r\n\r\nThese questions will be addressed in two stages. First, field studies will be carried out on the 3 oldest, most poorly characterized islands, Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, and Espa\u00f1ola, which together record almost 3 million years of the plume's history. Radiogenic isotopes, major and trace element, and Ar-Ar analyses will be applied to understand the chemical evolution. The second phase is a focused effort to define the compositions of Gal\u00e1pagos mantle reservoirs by applying high-resolution lead isotopic analyses to a selection of lavas from across the archipelago. Taken together, these efforts will permit evaluation of competing hypotheses for the complex geochemical variation observed in the Gal\u00e1pagos and insight into the origins and nature of mantle plumes. One of the most important goals of this project is the engagement of undergraduates as integral members of the research team. They will also participate in a seminar on mantle dynamics, which will be used to develop a digital repository of presentations by experts in the field that will be archived and made available online. Ecuadorian students will participate in fieldwork and spend a summer at Colgate, where they will also be trained in analytical geochemistry techniques. Finally, students will participate in an established outreach program at Colgate, working with K-12 students from across upstate NY performing hands-on science activities and developing a state-of-the-art presentation on volcanic evolution at the Colgate Visualization Lab.",

This finding calls into question our understanding of how ocean islands are formed and evolve over time, as well as how mantle plumes interact with adjacent mid-ocean ridges.&nbsp;These are important findings for scientists studying the development and distribution of plant and animal species across the Galapagos.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p>\n<p>We address several persistent questions related to the formation of the Galapagos Islands (Figure 1) and ocean island volcanoes in general. The Galapagos are formed by a mantle plume, a column of hot rock from deep in the Earth (the core-mantle boundary), which, when it approaches the surface, produces magma that constructs volcanoes such as Hawaii and the Galapagos. Because mantle plumes are nearly stationary relative to the movement of the tectonic plates, the result is a chain of volcanoes, with the active one over the plume center and progressively older volcanoes aligned downstream in the direction of plate motion. This model is based largely on studies of the Hawaiian Islands.</p>\n<p>The Galapagos Islands deviate from the prevailing mantle plume model in several critical ways, which are the focus of our study. Using the velocity of the Nazca Plate, which underlies the Galapagos, the oldest Galapagos Islands of San Cristobal and Espanola should be ~5 million years old. Our new data indicate, however, that both islands are at least one million years younger than predicted. Furthermore, new data from San Cristobal, Espanola, and Santa Cruz suggest that all three volcanoes experienced eruptive activity for notably longer than other ocean island volcanoes, and that the intensity of activity has been episodic for the past ~2 million years across the archipelago.</p>\n<p>The older eastern Galapagos are different in additional ways from the western Galapagos volcanoes. The western volcanoes have steep upper slopes and are topped by large calderas (volcanic craters), whereas none of the older islands has a caldera (Figure 2). The eastern volcanoes are dominated by linear features, including alignments of eruptive vents and faults, yet the western islands have circular and radial faults (Figure 2). Most of the western volcanoes erupt lavas with an exceedingly small range of chemical compositions. In contrast, the eastern volcanoes erupt a large range in compositions.</p>\n<p>The differences between the western and eastern volcanoes can be attributed to variations in magma supply. The western islands are supported by large, well-mixed magma chambers, which are fed by a robust magma supply from the Galapagos plume. The eastern islands are more magma-starved, having been constructed from only small, short-lived magma chambers and a weak magma supply.</p>\n<p>We propose that the differences between the Galapagos provinces are not evolutionary, but rather the eastern volcanoes grew in a different tectonic environment from the western volcanoes; this finding contradicts the current understanding of ocean island volcano formation, as documented in Hawaii. We attribute the change in magma supply strength that occurred between the formation of the eastern and western Galapagos provinces to the relationship between the Galapagos plume and the adjacent mid-ocean ridge, the Galapagos Spreading Center (GSC; Figure 3). Over the past ~8 million years, the GSC has been migrating northeast, away from the plume center, increasing the plume-ridge distance. This means that the western volcanoes are forming at least 100 km farther from the GSC than the eastern Galapagos volcanoes did. We suggest that when the plume was close the GSC, the ridge siphoned some of the plume material away from island formation, resulting in smaller, magma-starved volcanoes like those in the eastern province. Now that the GSC is more distant from the plume, its influence is reduced, and most of the magma produced by the plume is focused toward constructing the large western volcanoes and their robust magma systems. Our work on the eastern Galapagos Islands suggests that the model established by Hawaiian volcanoes as they are carried away from the plume may not apply to all ocean island systems, requiring further research in the future to achieve a thorough understanding of mantle plume behavior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>Twenty-two students participated in this project.
