 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Jennifer Swift and collaborators from Georgetown University will acquire a Raman spectroscope/microscope. Raman spectroscopy is an analytical technique that provides data on the chemical structure and physical properties of a material. It elucidates what atoms are bonded to each other and the strength of those interactions. When combined with a microscope, the instrument can probe very small areas of the material providing insight on how the properties of the material will vary as one scans across it.  The acquisition will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in the use of this analytical tool. It will be used by students in the chemistry and physics undergraduate research programs (REU) at Georgetown and by high school students in a summer research program sponsored by the American Chemical Society (Project ACS-SEED) which supports students from economically disadvantaged groups.  \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesizing and characterizing molecular crystals such as polymorphs; (b) studying hydrates and co-crystals; (c) analyzing single and multi-component nanoparticles of molecular and polymeric species; (d) using metal nanoparticles for fuel-cell development; (e) employing gels and viscous dispersants for cultural heritage conservation; (f) using organometallic framework materials for gas separation and storage; and (g) using conducting polymer electrodes for biomedical and environmental applications.",
