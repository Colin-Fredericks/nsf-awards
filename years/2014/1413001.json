 "awd_abstract_narration": "White dwarfs stars are the remnants of stars like the sun that form after their nuclear furnace has gone out.   There are billions of them in our galaxy and most are not doing anything interesting besides cooling off.   However, some of them orbit in close binary (double-star) systems in which the stars eventually spiral together causing massive explosions, others pulverize comets and asteroids left over from their planetary systems, and still others have \"starquakes\" that let us conduct seismology of their interiors.  This project will study interesting examples of white dwarfs to learn about the supernova explosions that astronomers use to measure distances, the composition and configuration of exoplanetary systems, and the physics of material that is 10 million times denser than lead and cannot be produced or studied in any terrestrial laboratory. This program will also facilitate student training in instrument development and provide a new observational capability for the astronomical community. \r\n\r\nThe PI and his team of graduate students will carry out 3 separate investigations using white dwarfs as tools to study (1) whether hot DQ white dwarfs result from mergers of two sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, (2) whether metal-rich white dwarfs with circumstellar dust are accreting planetary material, and (3) the properties of ZZ Ceti stars. The common thread is observations to be obtained using the SOAR telescope with the Goodman Spectrograph, which was built by the PI. With partial support from this award, the PI will build a red-channel for the spectrograph, which is of great interest to the observational community and which will further enable the three key observational programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhite dwarf stars are the end state of stellar evolution for most stars in the universe, and are extremely compact, fitting the mass of one half of the sun into a sphere the size of the earth.  They have lost their nuclear power source and cool slowly to invisibility over aeons of time.  This would seem a dull existence, yet they are among the most physically interesting and astrophysically revealing objects in the galaxy.\n\nWhen two white dwarfs in a binary spiral together they can merge and collapse into a neutron star, creating a supernovae type Ia explosion.  These explosions have been the most important source of cosmological insight because they give us a way to measure the vast distances necessary to understand the expansion of the universe, and they have revealed that the expansion is accelerating.  In this research project, we have identified a class of carbon atmosphere white dwarfs, the hot DQ stars, as the descendants of merged white dwarfs that did not explode.  These stars help us understand that supernovae are only one outcome of white dwarf mergers, and that less dramatic events may be common.    Moreover, the structure and composition of hot DQ stars can tell us about the merger process in ways that are lost in the collapse that forms supernovae.  \n\nIn addition to their cosmological usefulness, white dwarf stars also help us learn about exoplanetary systems. When a single white dwarf has a planetary system that survives the white dwarf formation process, the mass of the white dwarf is smaller than the progenitor star and this changes the planet orbits, scattering planetesimals toward the white dwarf where they are tidally disrupted and can form a dust and gas ring or disk around the white dwarf.  Material in these disks swirls down onto the surface of the white dwarf where it forms an absorption spectrum, allowing us to measure the composition of the planet rubble.  In this project we have developed a new diagnostic diagram that helps us identify a class of white dwarf debris disks that show gaseous calcium emission lines.  The study of these emission lines gives us insight into the dynamics of the disks, and can reveal the presence of small orbiting bodies.  Using our new diagnostic we have discovered two new gas disk systems that show the fastest evolution ever measured, suggesting that they are not elliptical disks precessing due to relativistic effects, but much more dynamic systems, perhaps with density waves and small bodies perturbing their structure.\n\nThe white dwarf stars also help us understand the physical structure of material at high density.  As hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs cool to about 12,500 degrees, the stars undergo self-excited pulsations.  We have conducted a spectroscopic survey of all the known pulsating hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs accessible to our SOAR telescope, including many new stars discovered in the Kepler/K2 missions.  From this survey we have derived temperatures and masses using fits to the spectral lines.  When combined with the seismological information available from the pulsations, these measurements will allow us to derive internal properties for the whole class of DA pulsating white dwarfs.  These internal properties include the thicknesses of chemical layers that encode the evolutionary history of the stars.  Knowing these will settle longstanding questions about how stars evolve into white dwarfs, how the process may be affected by initial mass, and the amount of mass returned to space the winds of the giant phase.  These are all important for understanding the basic physics regulating white dwarf structure, and the return of enriched material to the interstellar medium where it can form new generations of stars and planets.\n\nFinally, in the course of our project, graduate students and undergraduates participated in projects to add a camera and other upgrades to an optical spectrograph on the SOAR 4.1 m telescope.  This has enriched the field in two ways; by expanding the research capabilities of the US optical observatory system and by expanding the workforce of astronomers that are well-trained in astronomical instrumentation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James C Clemens"
