 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymers and polymer composites are important engineering materials used in a myriad of industrial and consumer devices, ranging from DVDs to food packaging to automotive components to encapsulants for electronic circuits to matrix resins in aerospace composites.  In these applications the polymer can experience significant mechanical loads, where long term mechanical performance is critical. In this research a new class of models will be more fully developed that acknowledge the microscopic structure of polymer glasses, providing engineers with better predictive tools for describing mechanical responses of polymer glasses. \r\n\r\nA fundamental understanding of the behavior of glassy materials is one of the outstanding problems in condensed matter physics, where dynamic heterogeneity is emerging as a critical organizing idea for the glassy state of matter.  A Stochastic Constitutive Model has been developed, where for first time dynamic heterogeneity is explicitly acknowledged. The primary focus of this research  is to fully understand the implications and value of explicitly incorporating nanoscale fluctuations associated with dynamic heterogeneity in a constitutive description of polymer glasses.  The Stochastic Constitutive Model introduces a new perspective, where the shape of the relaxation spectra changes during the complex thermal-deformation history that a polymer experiences during its life. A major research deficiency in the mechanics of glassy polymers is comprehensive data set of the nonlinear viscoelastic data for a non-commercial material that can be readily produced by all research groups. A second objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive data set of the nonlinear, time dependent mechanical properties for a well characterized, glass forming amine cured epoxy resin.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary objectives of this research project were to develop a fundamental understanding of how glassy polymer deform.  Glassy polymers are one of the major classes of engineering materials used in a variety of commercial and industrial products, where their mechanical behavior is typically the key property determining their use.  A partial list of the application area of glassy polymers are: the matrix resin used in aerospace and automotive composite materials; transparent, shatter resistant materials for automotive and home applications (e.g. automotive head/tail lights); encapsulants for micro-electronic circuits; a variety of health care devices; and, many other applications.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nDuring the course of this research two major findings were reported:\n\nTraditional continuum mechanics (which is the foundation of how engineers design and build everything from bridges to automobiles to spacecraft) smooths out all fluctuations associated with the underlying molecular structure of matter.  In this research a new approach that explicitly incorporates temporal fluctuations was developed to describe the time dependent mechanical response of polymers in the glassy state.  This new approach that includes fluctuations is able to describe the diversity of time-dependent mechanical behaviors exhibited by glassy polymers as compared to previous models that could only describe a very limited set of data. \nA fundamental understanding of the glassy state of matter is considered one of the outstanding challenges in condensed matter physics.  The key challenge is to understand why the viscosity increases by ten or more orders-of-magnitude as the material is cooled from the liquid to the glass &ndash; a challenge that has not been met in nearly 100 years of research.  As part of this project we were able to discover the fundamental relationship of how the viscosity is related to a specific aspect of the state of the material, where there now is a simple, physically-based model of why the extraordinary viscosity increase occurs.\n\n\nThese two findings have significant intellectual merit &ndash; results that can change how scientists and engineers think about the glassy materials and there application in engineering applications.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact\n\nTwo results of the research are (i) an improved understanding of how glassy polymers deform and (ii) the origin of glassy behavior, where both these results have significant technological impact?  First, since glassy polymers are one of the major classes of materials used in modern technology, the development of models that describe how polymer glasses deform is an essential prerequisite to developing computer codes for the rational design of engineering components, devices and structures using these important materials.  The research results from this project provide a significant advance in the description of the deformation behavior of polymers in the glassy state.  Second, one of key challenges of 21st century science is to develop new and improved materials for current and emerging applications.  Glasses are an important class of materials, where the rational design of new glassy materials (either polymeric, inorganic or small molecules) requires an understanding of the physio-chemical processes that control the formation of the glassy state.  In this project a new model of how the mobility in glass forming materials depends upon the state of the glass was developed, which provides the fundamental relationship describing the formation of the glassy state &ndash; a relationship that can be used to guide the design of new, engineering materials.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James M Caruthers"
