 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teacher specialists can play an important role in enhancing the content and pedagogical content knowledge of other teachers.  Through NSF and other funding, a growing cadre of leaders are prepared to provide such support to other teachers.  However, as districts face increasing budget constraints, administrators often reassign these specialists to full-time teaching responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThis project will study whether elementary mathematics specialists who participated in an intensive educational program supported by DRK-12 have continued providing leadership when they returned to teaching full-time.  The research questions are: 1) In what ways are specialist-teachers continuing to use their leadership expertise in their school, district, and state? 2) How do district administrators, building administrators, and teachers shape specialist-teachers' opportunities for leadership? What other factors shape these opportunities? 3) What is the impact of specialist-teachers on their schools' leadership culture?  Answers to these questions will help to ensure that substantial investments in leadership development continue to yield returns, even when the individuals trained are no longer in formal leadership positions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project, School and District Utilization of Mathematics Specialists Who Have Returned to the Classroom, was to investigate the leadership activities of classroom teachers who have substantial leadership training and experience.  The individuals were unusual in that they had three years of formal training and two years of experience as full-time elementary mathematics specialists.  Due to local budget constraints, their positions were cut, and each of the individuals returned to classroom teaching.  Although this outcome was not planned, it created a natural laboratory in which to study how teacher leaders, in the truest sense of the term (i.e., individuals who provide instructional leadership while serving as classroom teachers), support mathematics education improvement.   \n\nA major goal of the study was to answer the following research questions:\n\nIn what ways do mathematics teacher leaders continue to use their leadership expertise in their school, district, and state?\nWhat factors shape mathematics teacher leaders\u00c6 opportunities for leadership? \n \n\nOver the two years of the study, researchers collected data on six of these teacher leaders, each at a different school.  Interviews were conducted with the teacher leader, two teachers at the school, the principal, and a district administrator.  The interview asked about opportunities for leadership, whether these arose from administrators or teachers.  In addition, all administrators and instructional staff at each school were surveyed about their interactions with the teacher leader. \n\nFor each of the individuals studied, the transition from mathematics specialist to classroom teacher had a profound influence on leadership opportunities.  Relationships established during the individual\u00c6s two years as a mathematics specialist had to be renegotiated.  The new relationships were marked by uncertainty as new norms were established.  One of the individuals remained at the same school and had the same principal with whom she had worked as a specialist.  There was little turnover in school faculty, so the individual was able to leverage relationships she had established as a specialist.  In contrast, another individual transitioned from specialist to teacher and moved to a new school with a different principal.  Her leadership abilities were unknown to the principal and the school faculty, and her opportunities for leadership in the new school were almost nonexistent.\n\nIn every case, the school administrator figured prominently in the individual\u00c6s leadership opportunities, perhaps more than any other factor.  One principal placed the teacher leader in a grade where state testing does not occur, making it less likely that grade-level colleagues would seek her help.  Another principal arranged for release time for the teacher leader, freeing her two afternoons a week for formal specialist duties, including co-planning with other teachers.  One individual was particularly uncomfortable as a full-time specialist because of how she felt others perceived her.  When her position was cut, she and her principal transferred to the same school.  Her principal, recognizing that the individual was uncomfortable presenting herself as an expert, created leadership opportunities in which others came to her.  For example, he positioned her as the chair of the mathematics committee, which she seemed receptive to because she did not have to force herself into the position.  Because of the principal\u00c6s actions, a reluctant leader continued to be influential in the school\u00c6s mathematics program.\n\nThe school district was also pivotal in shaping leadership opportunities.  The decisions to cut the specialist positions were made at the district level.  In addition, several of the teacher leaders work in small districts that provide little discipline-specific leadership.  Some do not provide ongoing professional development specific to mathematics.  In these situations, teacher leaders ..."
