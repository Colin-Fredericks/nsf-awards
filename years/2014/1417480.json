 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose to implement a new remote sensing technique for deriving iceberg volume changes&#8232;in order to estimate submarine melt rates in key fjords around the Greenland Ice Sheet periphery. The fluxes of solid ice and liquid freshwater from the Greenland Ice Sheet are important contributors to sea level rise and ocean freshening. Solid fluxes come in the form of icebergs calved from marine-terminating glacier margins. Freshwater fluxes are comprised of surface meltwater runoff and submarine melting at calving margins. As icebergs drift away from the margin, however, they are subject to submarine melting and thus constitute an additional source of freshwater release to the ocean. Variations in the magnitude and spatial distribution&#8232;of freshwater fluxes in glacial fjords and adjacent ocean basins can impact the ocean?s stratification, circulation, and ecological structure as well as ice-ocean interactions that influence ice flow, so it is important that spatial and temporal variations in melting are quantified.\r\n\r\nMelt rates will be obtained near the margins of about 20 large outlet glaciers using an extensive collection of ~0.5 m-resolution WorldView stereo satellite images compiled by the Polar Geospatial Center. Digital elevation models (DEMs) will be constructed from available stereo pairs using&#8232;the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline software implemented on the University of Maine supercomputing cluster. Differencing the co-registered sequential DEMs acquired ~5-30 days apart yields an estimate of the change in iceberg freeboard (i.e., surface elevation above sea level) which&#8232;can be converted to an iceberg draft assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. The PIs contend that after accounting for elevation change due to surface melting and tides, the residual difference in iceberg freeboard between the DEMs must be due to submarine melting. This work will provide new insights for studies focused on ice-ocean interactions and freshwater input to high latitude oceans. The project provides support for an early-career scientist and for an undergraduate student. Mentoring the undergraduate research assistant will give the early-career scientist valuable advising experience, and the student will develop data-analysis and problem solving skills that are not readily obtained by in-class instruction.",

Increased surface melting and iceberg calving contribute approximately equally to ice loss. Although we can directly relate the increase in surface melting to warming air temperatures, the precise cause of the increase in iceberg discharge is less clear in part due to our inability to measure ocean conditions in the majority of Greenland&rsquo;s iceberg-congested fjords. To address this lack of data at the ice-ocean boundary, this project used repeat satellite observations to quantify iceberg melt rates and meltwater fluxes in Greenland&rsquo;s fjords.

This means that regional variations in ocean conditions applied as boundary conditions in the large-scale ice sheet models that are used to predict future ice loss can be approximated from regional oceanic and atmospheric observations or model outputs. However, we also find that variations in fjord geometry and iceberg abundance in the fjords can cause iceberg melt rates to deviate from expected regional patterns. This indicates that local factors can significantly influence ocean conditions near glacier margins and potentially help explain differences in the response of glaciers to climate change. On the scale of individual fjords, we also find pronounced differences in the melt rates for icebergs confined to the relatively cool near-surface water mass that surrounds Greenland and those that penetrate deeper into the water column (Figure 3).

We focused on these glacial fjord systems for this additional application because they contain two of the largest calving glaciers in Greenland and, as such, iceberg meltwater fluxes are likely to substantially influence the fjords&rsquo; freshwater budgets and circulation. To estimate total meltwater fluxes from icebergs in the fjords, we developed a method to estimate the submerged area of icebergs in the fjord using satellite observations of iceberg sizes. Using our remotely-sensed datasets, we determined that ~10-50% of solid iceberg mass is converted to liquid freshwater in these fjords. Approximately one Olympic-sized swimming pool of freshwater is released from icebergs in these fjords every four seconds or less, making iceberg meltwater fluxes the dominant source of freshwater input to the fjords outside of the melt season and a non-negligible fraction of the fjord freshwater budget in the summer months.</p>\n<p>These datasets have advanced the scientific community&rsquo;s understanding of ice-ocean interactions in Greenland&rsquo;s fjords and will ultimately lead to more accurate modeling of future Greenland Ice Sheet and ocean circulation changes.
