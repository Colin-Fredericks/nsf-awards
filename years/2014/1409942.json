 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computation and data\tare moved to the \"cloud\", there is a need to significantly increase the capacity and performance of the underlying\tdata centers through improved hardware and communication infrastructure.  A key component of the communication infrastructure is the network implementation, currently based upon Ethernet. Technological trends suggest that next-generation data center networks will be based upon RDMA (Remote Direct\tMemory Access), a powerful communciation technology used today in high performance computer systems. While RDMA offers enormous performance potential, current cloud infrastructures are not designed to exploit this potential.  This\tproject will investigate RDMA-based system designs for distributed storage systems and in-memory applications.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project research agenda consists of (a) building a high performance distributed key-value store and a B-tree based store (b) developing several applications in image search and deep learning whose distribution is made feasible by RDMA's ultra-low-latency and high throughput; (c) evaluating the performance of the resulting systems and applications at scale on the NSF-funded PRObE testbed.",
