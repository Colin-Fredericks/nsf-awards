 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with NASA, NOAA, and the US State Department, NSF supports the activities of the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) program.  GLOBE is an international hands-on environmental/earth science research and education program for a global community of elementary and secondary schools participating in 112 countries. GLOBE's vision promotes and supports students, teachers and scientists to collaborate on inquiry-based investigations of the environment and the Earth system.  Now in its 19th year, GLOBE has provided professional development and training in the content and skills of environmental science for over 65,000 teachers from 24,000 schools and engaged more than 10 million students in: learning about the scientific process; discovering the science of their environment; and, contributing more than 90 million protocol-based observations in support of scientific research. A significant number of students who have been introduced to science through GLOBE have continued on to obtain degrees in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and pursue careers in STEM. As noted in several recent reports, the health and vitality of the STEM workforce is critical to the Nation's prosperity. It is also observed that STEM research is increasingly conducted as a global enterprise built on multiple international collaborations. As such, programs like GLOBE, which engage students in STEM pathways within a culturally diverse and rich context, are extremely important.  A growing community of former GLOBE participants is seeking to find meaningful and cost-effective ways to give back to the GLOBE program and contribute to its efforts to support a vibrant and diverse community of students engaged in scientific endeavors worldwide.  Defining strategies for leveraging the ongoing enthusiasm and support of a global network of GLOBE alumni is an important and cost-effective opportunity for sustaining and expanding the impact of the program.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks funds to convene a strategic planning workshop to develop a coherent framework for activating and employing a new alumni network comprised of previous participants in the GLOBE science and education program.  This workshop will be held in parallel with the annual GLOBE partner meeting and quadrennial Global Learning Expedition (GLE) in New Delhi, India (August 3-8, 2014), in order to leverage the availability of a larger community of GLOBE scientists, educators, trainers, students, partners, and sponsors attending the GLE. The workshop agenda is focused on sharing of current activities being undertaken by specific alumni communities, collecting input from the GLE participants regarding priority areas where alumni involvement can be most useful, developing a strategic plan that considers operational factors, laying a foundation for creation of a GLOBE alumni near-peer mentoring network, and recruitment of international participants in research on the effectiveness of the GLOBE alumni near-peer mentoring activities. The team of GLOBE participants convening this workshop has been involved as leaders or trainers within the program for several years and they have the necessary skills and connections to make this workshop succeed in achieving its goals. NASA and NSF have supported a recent modernization of the GLOBE technical infrastructure used for communication, data sharing, and analysis; these upgrades have dramatically improved the ability of GLOBE participants to use social media and more sophisticated collaboration software. These upgrades have been accompanied by a shift in the governance model for GLOBE operations, from being centrally managed in the United States to a more community-driven management process.  These reforms make the proposed effort to meaningfully engage the GLOBE alumni especially timely.  The GLOBE program is well-positioned for new growth; having additional support from alumni as both near-peer mentors and role models will both help GLOBE realize this potential and provide new mechanisms for supporting the STEM ambitions of its students.",

Objectives were to 1) increase student interest in science, 2) engage students in environmental/earth science investigations as a way of learning science, 3) catalyze international student research collaborations, and 4) activate a research agenda to determine the effectiveness of GLOBE Alumni as near-peer mentors catalyzing international student research collaborations. The primary method to catalyze this international research collaboration was through a strategic planning workshop that was held in conjunction with the GLOBE Learning Expedition (GLE) held in New Delhi, India where more than 300 participants (students, GLOBE partners, teachers and scientists) from 29 countries came together for research presentations, field studies, dialogue and other educational activities. The CGAIN team consisted of the principal investigator who also leads the GLOBE Partnership in Alaska, GLOBE Alumni that represented the regions of Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe and Eurasia, Near East and Northern Africa, and North America, the volunteer GLOBE Alumni Coordinator and West Kentucky Regional Coordinator of the National Energy Education Development Program, the Director of the GLOBE Implementation Office, and the United States Country Coordinator.

In addition to the verbal positive comments and interest in working with GLOBE Alumni, we also received written feedback. &nbsp;Results of surveys conducted about GLOBE Alumni after the presentations showed that GLOBE partners and GLOBE teachers were likely to engage former GLOBE students as near peer mentors (61% very likely and 22% somewhat likely for partners; 47% very likely and 33% somewhat likely for partners). GLOBE partners and GLOBE teachers considered a former GLOBE student (in college or graduated) as a valuable research mentor to their students (94 % highly valuable and 6% somewhat valuable for partners; 50% highly valuable and 50 % somewhat valuable for teachers).&nbsp; When conducting teacher training GLOBE partners indicated they would likely use GLOBE Alumni to help with the training (47 % highly likely and 23 % somewhat likely).&nbsp; Of the students who responded to the survey, 53% were likely to choose involvement in GLOBE beyond high school, with 38 % wanting to be GLOBE involved in some way during every year of their schooling. When students were asked if they could choose a research partner, 25% said they would choose a former GLOBE student and 50 % would choose international collaborators which does not preclude collaborating with GLOBE Alumni from other countries. GLOBE partners and teachers think GLOBE learning is important for students in the following ways: 1) Increases science skills competencies, 2) Helps them enter the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) pipeline, 3) provides real life applications and community outreach and 4) helps them develop critical thinking skills for decision-making and life in general. Scientists responded to the interview question how valuable can GLOBE Alumni be to a globe wide student collaborative research project as follows: 1) GLOBE Alumni can help out as mentors to students and if some could help some schools it will surely be a great help on the scientific process; 2) Very, this is the future of the program-some of us are getting old; and 3) Extremely, one of the best things that happened, proving the value of the program.</p>\n<p>Since the CGAIN Workshop, one of the GLOBE Alumni obtained a Ph.
