 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Tonya Kuhl of the University of California at Davis is determining the structure of model biological cell membranes and structural changes under various conditions. The research will examine the chemical forces and principles of self-organizing cellular membrane systems. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and carry out this multidisciplinary work at the interface between chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology. K-12 outreach activities involve Professor Kuhl, undergraduate and graduate students engaging with K-12 students through hands-on science demonstrations.  A particular goal of the activities is to encourage young women to pursue science and engineering educations by providing female engineering role models. Age appropriate demonstrations will be developed to fit within the existing K-12 science curriculum.\r\n\r\nA systematic approach will be used to determine the structure-function relationships of membranes as a function of composition and environmental conditions and how these self-organizing, adapting systems respond to specific stimuli such as protein binding. Such knowledge will enable robust and easily fabricated biomimetic membrane platforms that recapitulate the desired nanostructured, chemical and physical environment of the membrane in a controllable manner. Development of biomembrane based platforms that recapitulate the desired membrane environment in a controllable manner has potentially wide-spread application for transforming studies of biological systems, drug screening, and elucidating the mechanisms of the myriad of biological activities that take place at the membrane interface.",
