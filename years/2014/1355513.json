 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miami University is increasing the number of women in its computer science majors by establishing a living-learning community with service learning at its core. Connecting computer science and engineering course work to local community-based problems (e.g. \"design a low-cost lightweight playground kit for elementary school students and simulate its strength characteristics before building a prototype\"), increases the attractiveness of such courses to all students. Increased enrollment and persistence in such courses contributes in turn to the pool of well-motivated and capable STEM graduates, with direct consequences on meeting national workforce development needs.\r\n\r\nThe technical features of the project's implementation include creating a service learning living community in the residential halls for two cohorts of thirty students each. The project builds on converging theory and evidence that points to motivational, rather than ability-based, explanations for gender imbalance in the participation of undergraduates in STEM fields. By focusing on service-oriented curricular and co-curricular offerings, gender balance and diversity within the institution's computer science, software engineering, computer engineering, and electrical engineering majors are expected to improve. This project is unique in that it focuses on the service-oriented learning living community, rather than just the disbursement of scholarship funds. This emphasis holds promise to help ensure that the students participate not just for the financial benefits and that the project can continue after funding for the scholarships has ended.",
