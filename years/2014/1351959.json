 "awd_abstract_narration": "TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\tWith support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project will employ coordination chemistry approaches to (1) synthesize new classes of one-dimensional coordination magnets, or single-chain magnets (SCMs), that exhibit magnetic coupling of unprecedented strength and to (2) carry out fundamental studies to better understand how to control spin relaxation barrier in these materials. These two objectives will be pursued in parallel, with results from each helping to inform the next steps of the other. More specifically, this research plan sets out to synthesize and study SCMs comprised of high-spin, high-magnetic anisotropy metal ions connected by redox-active benzoquinonoid ligands. The ability to engender and stabilize unpaired electrons on these bridging ligands will lead to extremely strong magnetic coupling interactions between ligand- and metal-based spin carriers along the chain. These interactions, in conjunction with magnetic anisotropy of the metal ions, will lead to chain compounds that exhibit classical magnet-like behavior at unprecedented high temperatures. Compounds such as those synthesized and studied during the course of this work may find utility in practical applications such as high-density, spin-based information storage and processing, quantum computing, and spintronics.\r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\tThe design and understanding of new magnetic materials is more important to society than ever before. These materials are the foundation of data storage and processing technology, and the demand for more efficient devices is rapidly growing. Indeed, the requirements of current data centers, such as electricity consumption and cooling technology, are not sustainable. Addressing these problems requires fundamental scientific research focused on the development of new paradigms for materials in magnet-based data storage and manipulation. One such line of research focuses on the creation of new one-dimensional magnetic materials, the topic of this proposal. Here, the ability to design, understand, and ultimately implement one-dimensional materials will enable dramatic advances in storage capacity over the current three-dimensional material-based technology. In addition, the education plan of this proposal will establish connections between fundamental molecular magnetism and real world applications in a group who is often deprived of science education yet hungry to learn more: older adults. Integrating the education and research plans will not only educate older adults about the wonders and societal importance of magnetic materials, but it will also demonstrate to them that the need for scientific innovation and discovery in today's world is more critical than ever before.",
