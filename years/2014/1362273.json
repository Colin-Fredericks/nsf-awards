 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will organize an annual weekend conference at University of Florida in Gainesville. The conference will concentrate on set theory, computability and their interactions. The expected audience will consist of three or four senior speakers and a greater number of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, with geographical emphasis on the southeastern region, currently underserved by similar events. The purpose of the proposal is to provide a forum for set theorists and computability theorists to meet on a regular basis. After the end of series of Southeast Logic Symposia in 2006, no such forum exists; indeed, in the southeastern region no regular mathematical logic meetings take place. At the same time, the conversation of the two fields has received new impetus with the study of countable equivalence relations similar to the Turing equivalence.\r\n\r\nThe proposal will fund a series of weekend annual conferences concentrating on set theory, computability, and their interactions. The series will take place at University of Florida in Gainesville, at the center of the under-served southeastern region. The funding will in its greater part enable young researchers to attend the conference, improving their communication and networking; a smaller part of the funding will be spent on senior speakers, whose lectures should attract broadest possible audience. New lines of interaction between set theory and computability appeared in the last couple of years, and they will be at the focus of the conference series.",
