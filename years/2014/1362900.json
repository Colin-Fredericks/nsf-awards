 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mimicry occurs when one person non-consciously mirrors the nonverbal behavior of another person. Being mimicked generally increases one's willingness to help the mimicker and increases the likelihood of being persuaded by the mimicker.  Past work has suggested that the reason mimicry promotes these outcomes is because of (a) shifts in the mimicked person's self-concepts or (b) increases in the mimicked person's liking for the mimicker. This research will test a different potential reason why mimicry influences helping and persuasion. Specifically, the proposed studies will test the idea that being mimicked increases one's confidence in one's own thoughts.  This increased confidence should magnify the impact of one's current thoughts on judgment and behavior. Unlike previous accounts of mimicry -- which predict nearly universal prosocial outcomes of being mimicked -- the proposed idea that mimicry increases confidence predicts that when a person's thoughts happen to be antisocial (e.g., competitive) mimicry will lead to more antisocial behavior rather than more helping. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will challenge existing theoretical perspectives on mimicry by demonstrating that increased confidence stemming from mimicry can produce effects opposite to those previously documented. In most interactions, positive thoughts predominate, so \"main effect\" theories (e.g., increased liking) and the confidence perspective make the same predictions. However, a unique prediction of this proposal is that if antisocial thoughts predominate, the confidence resulting from being mimicked will increase antisocial behavior. That is, mimicry will increase the impact of a person's currently accessible thoughts, regardless of whether the thoughts are positive (\"help him,\" \"believe her\") or negative (\"defeat him,\" \"disagree with her\"). In short, the PI proposes a new explanation for the effects of mimicry, one that explains current findings and identifies when opposite findings should follow from being mimicked.\r\n\r\nKnowing the precise reasons why mimicry influence persuasion and helping behavior is important not only because it contributes to theories of helping and persuasion but also because it has a wide range of applications -- especially in interpersonal settings. For example, mimicry is relevant to clinical psychology, health communication, human-computer interaction, management, and marketing.  This research has great potential to inform theory, training, and practice in these fields. For example this work can tell us when a therapist (or \"social\" robot) who mimics a client is most likely to facilitate the desired outcomes versus when mimicry might \"backfire.\"  The proposed research will also be disseminated widely, as the investigators will actively seek opportunities to present this research at major conferences and to publish findings in top tier journals in psychology. Finally, this research will promote science education and training by involving a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students in all phases of the research process.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nConfidence in one\u00c6s thoughts, feelings, or beliefs (hereafter: mental contents) is a subjective assessment that these mental contents are valid and can be relied upon for judgment.  Confidence is important because, compared with doubt, it tends to magnify the extent to which mental contents predict judgment and behavior.  In other words, a person's thoughts, feelings, and beliefs predict other judgments and behavior more if the person is confident in those mental contents.  Although people's confidence is often based on valid sources (e.g., I may be be more confident about a topic about which I have a lot of information), other factors, such as a person's mood, social status, and so forth can affect a person's confidence.\n\n \n\nThe present research investigated whether being mimicked by another person would increase a person\u00c6s confidence.  Behavioral mimicry occurs when one person matches the posture or gestures of another person.  Past research on mimicry had found that being mimicked could increase persuasion and helping behavior.  This past work would suggest, for example, that by mimicking a patient, a doctor could increase the extent to which her patient adopted a health recommendation (e.g., to exercise more regularly). \n\n \n\nHowever, we predicted that if mimicry increased confidence, these effects would occur only when people\u00c6s thoughts were congruent with a message or were prosocial in nature.  If thoughts were opposite to a message (e.g., if a person\u00c6s response to a doctor\u00c6s plea to exercise more regularly is to think \"I don\u00c6t have time for this\") or if thoughts are antisocial in nature, then confidence resulting from mimicry would magnify these mental contents, making it less likely, compared with no mimicry, that a person would be persuaded or engage in prosocial behavior.  In other words, we predicted that being mimicked would polarize people\u00c6s responses, depending on the valence of a person\u00c6s thoughts. \n\n \n\nWe did not find support for our primary predictions, as mimicry did not produce confidence or the predicted polarization pattern.  We did, however, contribute to the growing literature demonstrating the importance of considering thought confidence.  Work funded by this grant demonstrated that feelings of power can produce the polarization pattern consistent with increased confidence, producing prosocial behavior and judgments when prosocial mental contents are active, but antisocial behavior and judgments when antisocial mental contents are active.  We also demonstrated that it is important to consider the confidence that people have in their separate positive and negative beliefs about someone in order to predict their overall evaluation of that person.  Furthermore, ongoing work, begun under this grant, is investigating people\u00c6s confidence and doubt that can stem from threatening experiences (e.g., awareness of one\u00c6s own mortality) or people\u00c6s confidence in threatening mental states (e.g., confidence in thoughts about mental conflict).  \n\n \n\nIn addition to these intellectual contributions, the grant contributed to the training of 22 undergraduate students, three graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, and one high school student.  Many of these individuals have gone onto more advanced training following their involvement in this project, and others will likely follow in their footsteps.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth G Demarree"
