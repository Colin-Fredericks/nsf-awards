 "awd_abstract_narration": "What determines the boundaries between grasslands and shrublands or forests is of major scientific interest, particularly since these boundaries can shift over time, sometimes relatively swiftly and seemingly permanently. In large areas of the central and western U.S., woody plants have been spreading into grasslands. Previous research has implicated change in climate and grazing pressure as likely contributing factors. This project extends that work to include effects of governmental policies and social attitudes on the use of fire to keep grasslands open, and to include the impacts of conversion between grassland and woodland on ecological services and resultant economics. Researchers will compare three regions with contrasting degrees of woody encroachment in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas to test the hypothesis that changes between grassland and woodland are driven by interactions between fire and grazing regimes that are constrained by policy and culture. The project will provide web-based educational materials, workshops, and tools for private landowners, extension agents, USDA staff, and K-12 science teachers. Results are expected to enhance the scientific basis for maintaining economically valuable grasslands in rural America.\r\n\r\nThis project will examine the interactions between social and biophysical processes on wildlands in the Southern Great Plains in the context of a novel social-ecological framework. This framework is centered on grassland state changes resulting from woody plant encroachment, and elucidates the socio-ecological properties that emerge when feedbacks, thresholds, and nonlinearities are accounted for. To test the hypothesis that grassland-to-woodland state changes are driven by interactions among fire and grazing regimes that are constrained in space and time by society, policy, and regulations constraining the use of prescribed fire, research will combines empirical biophysical, social, and economic research within a dynamic, iteratively evolving agent-based model (ABM) linked to land cover. This ABM will analyze the factors that influence decision-making by land managers with respect to the use of prescribed fire as a management tool; forecast changes in regional woody plant cover and ecosystem carbon mass under different scenarios of fire use; project the effects of change between grasslands and woodlands on portfolios of ecosystem services including forage production, groundwater recharge, stream flow, and carbon sequestration; and translate changes in ecosystem services into economic metrics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGrasslands and savannas across the globe have been transformed in a process known as woody plant encroachment.  Quite simply landscapes that were once open grasslands or savannas are now closed canopy woodlands and forests.  The reasons for this transformation are complex but are almost always related to changes in the historic fire regimes.  The frequency of fires are now much lower than in the past and the reasons for this range from active fire suppression to historic overgrazing that removed all of the fine fuel so that ground fires are no longer possible.  The Southern Great Plains region of the United States has undergone radical changes over the past 150 years as a result of woody plant encroachment and these changes have a number of very serious ramifications including the loss of forage for animal production, the loss of grassland biodiversity and changes to the water and carbon cycles.  The goal of this project was to better understand the woody encroachment phenomena in the Southern Great Plains by taking a multidisciplianry approach.  Our team included grassland ecologists, hydrologists, remote sensing specialists, system modelers and social scientists.  We wanted to better understand the extent and consequences of woody encroachment but also how these changes are affecting people and how people are responding to these changes.  We focused on three ecoregioins--the Edwards Plateau of Texas, the Cross Timbers of Oklahoma, and the Flint Hills of Oklahoma and Kansas.  Each of these ecoregions have different cultures as well as different patterns of woody encroachment.   For example the Flint Hills has a burning culture and fire is routinely used as a management tool allowing grasslands to flourish.  However in other regions of the Great Plains fire is not commonly used.  We found that woody plants are increasing in all three regions but the fastest rates of expansion in recent decades has been in Oklahoma.  We also found that there is a maximum coverage of woody plants for any one region and this maximum coverage is dependent on rainfall and soils.  Woody plants have an influence on regional streamflows in both Oklahoma and Texas but paradoxically the results are quite different.  In Oklahoma woody plants are leading to a decline in streamflows because of higher transpiration rates by trees.  However in Texas, where rainfall is quite a bit less, streamflows have increased as a result of woody encroachment because the trees facilitate a higher infiltration rate on the landscape allowing water to remain in the soil rather than runoff.  We know that the key to restoring these landscapes is the widespread adaptation of fire as a management tool, however we identified a number of constraint?s to the use of fire including the high cost of insurance, local burn bans, concern about smoke, and the lack of equipment and knowledge.  We have used all of this information to develop a framework to help us better understand the complex interactions between people and the landscape.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/25/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bradford P Wilcox"
