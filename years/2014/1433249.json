This working group will present research syntheses related to the paleoclimateology, paleoceanography, paleoecology, archaeology, and history of the subarctic North Pacific and North Atlantic.  This group will then meet for two days at the end of the conference to work out the logistics, themes, and intellectual responsibilities for preparing a collaborative synthesis volume on the Paleoecology of the Subarctic North Pacific and North Atlantic Seas by 2017.  Funds are requested to support the international travel and per diem of 13 participants, including five students.",
