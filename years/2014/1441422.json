 "awd_abstract_narration": "a technical description \r\nThe project proposes a joint NSF-DFG workshop titled \"New Perspectives on Neuroengineering and Neurotechnologies\" to foster research collaborations with other researchers around the world. The NSF ERC Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering (CSNE) was established at the University of Washington in 2011, with the mission to forge both physical and conceptual connections between neural systems and devices to develop integrated systems that may help people with neurological and mobility deficits such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, paralysis, and limb loss. The CSNE seeks to connect a mathematical understanding of how biological systems acquire and process information with the design of effective devices that interact seamlessly with humans. These devices take input from implantable, wearable or interactive interfaces to build integrated systems that provide sensorimotor solutions for the disabled and elderly population. The CSNE research builds on expertise in computational neuroscience, brain-computer interface, robotics, control theory, and microelectronics/wireless technology. The confluence of neuroscience and engineering presents a unique set of challenges to address. To contribute to the advancement of this interdisciplinary field, the CSNE has partnered with the German Research Foundation Cluster of Excellence BrainLinks-BrainTools to advance the field of neural engineering. The CSNE and BrainLinks-BrainTools have common scientific interests especially in the design of brain controlled interfaces and have forged a working partnership including collaborative research projects and student exchange programs. \r\nIntellectual Merit of the proposed project focuses on a collaborative scientific workshop that will bring together experts from around the world to discuss the questions, challenges and opportunities in the field of neural engineering. The mission of the researchers involved with the workshop is to develop innovative ways to connect a deep mathematical understanding of how biological systems acquire and process information with the design of effective devices that interact seamlessly with human beings. This singular approach reverse engineers the nervous system?s sensorimotor functions to develop engineering models that correct or compensate for neural deficits and augment neural capabilities. Using these mathematical and structural models, it is possible to design neural interfaces integrated with external control devices.   \r\n\r\n\r\na non-technical explanation \r\nParticipants will gain valuable knowledge in areas of research that have significant and growing global impact on the quality of life. Publication of the workshop proceedings in leading scientific journals will help disseminate the findings of workshop attendees. This effort will likely lead to new collaborations and joint research projects that will benefit society by reducing the emotional, physical and financial toll caused by sensorimotor disorders. The workshop may identify key technologies according to market significance and technical risk thereby impacting innovations over the near and long term.",
