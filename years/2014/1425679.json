 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cultural Anthropology Program supports research on the socio-cultural drivers and consequences of changing patterns and processes of urbanization. Urban blight, which frequently follows deindustrialization, is one such process. Some United States cities, such as those in the rust belt, have experienced urban blight as a follow-up to factory closings, unemployment, and population decline. Similar problems are being faced by post-industrial cities elsewhere in the world, too. Thus the world can be our laboratory for evaluating potential solutions to the problems posed by urban decay. \r\n\r\nGermany's approach to its post-industrial cities is particularly interesting, possibly even unique among Western nations. Their plans combine new nationwide energy policies with residential consolidation, demolition, and renewal in blighted cities.  To understand the new programs and how they affect residents, Columbia University doctoral student Samantha M. Fox, advised by Dr. Catherine Fennell, will undertake research in one such city, Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt, located near the border between eastern Germany and Poland. This is an especially apt site because this city was founded in 1950 as a worker's utopia and steel manufacturing hub. Today, the city's population is much reduced and its obsolete urban infrastructure is being transformed and pushed towards green energy. The researcher will collect data with multiple social science research methods including archival research in city and national archives, interviews and focus groups with residents and planners, attendance at meetings in planned neighborhoods, and participant observation in people's daily lives. The researcher will focus on how changes in infrastructure and the built environment affect residents' lives and their imaginations of future possibilities, and how those understandings may or may not diverge from what planners past and present intended.",

Founded in 1950 and originally named Stalinstadt, Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt was an object of totalitarian state planning. Deemed Germany&rsquo;s First Model Socialist City, its founders believed that architecture and urban planning were the ideal tools for shaping socialist citizens. Prior to 1989, Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt flourished. Since then, it has lost nearly half of its population and suffers from high unemployment, an aging population, and a reputation for right-wing extremism. Because of its architectural significance, Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt is the largest historically protected site in Germany. But because of its steep decline, it is also the site of massive urban renewal programs aimed at reshaping the city architecturally and ideologically.</p>\n<p>My work investigates how urban life is defined in a shrinking city, how residents conceive of their identity as urban citizens, and how residents and municipal officials imagine and take steps to shape their city&rsquo;s future. At a moment when industrial and post-industrial cities across Europe and the United States suffer from insolvency and depopulation, Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt&rsquo;s modest success offers some hope and inspiration. The aims of the urban renewal program are twofold: 1) to physically reshape the city via demolitions and renovations, and 2) to revitalize the social life of the city and renew civic engagement and civic pride.</p>\n<p>Despite the enormity of Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt&rsquo;s demolitions&mdash;entire neighborhoods, schools, and shopping centers have been razed&mdash;residents&rsquo; reactions have been overwhelmingly positive. Federal funding allows real estate companies to offer relocation assistance, relieving residents of the financial burden of moving. And residents ultimately benefit from a coordinated effort between real estate companies to demolish sparsely populated, outlying areas in an effort to eliminate urban sprawl and patchwork settlement. Increased foot traffic downtown means that every storefront on the city&rsquo;s main street is occupied. A stark reduction in empty apartments&mdash;the result of strategic relocations&mdash;means that residents no longer walk down streets where windows are dark or shuttered. Renovations take place in concert with demolition, and the city works to accommodate its elderly residents, using municipal funds to install elevators in apartment buildings and increase wheelchair accessibility in the city center. As a result, pensioners from nearby villages have begun moving into the city. Thus Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt puts forth a model of urban renewal where satisfaction and civic pride are tied to the aesthetics of thriving&mdash;busy sidewalks, bright windows&mdash;rather than ever-increasing land value, and where a non-productive population&mdash;in this case, the elderly&mdash;are cared for by the city and considered an engine for positive change.</p>\n<p>Concurrently, many residents closely follow the demolitions, photographing the often slow process, excited by a sense of progress and novelty&mdash;even if this novelty comes at the expense of economic and population growth. At a time when the specifics of this next chapter are yet to be seen, residents often turn to the question of how to reinvigorate the principle of solidarity on which the city was founded. One resident complained about the lack of German classes for foreigners, mostly refugees, explaining that he felt ashamed not to be able to greet his neighbors in the stairwell. Another lamented the loss of communal washing machines in apartment buildings, which had forced her to keep her neighbors&rsquo; schedules in mind. A young pre-school teacher still used the term &ldquo;Rasenlatscher&rdquo;&mdash;someone who stomps on a lawn&mdash;as an insult with her students, an outdated term that older generations used to remind each other that the city was a human construction and that a lawn was something sown with care in sandy, inhospitable soil.</p>\n<p>These disparate examples point to a new definition of urban life centered on a hope for dynamism and a sense of deep interconnectedness both among residents and between residents and the built environment. Many residents joke about whether Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt should even be called a city; it has a small-town character, where anonymity is impossible and most restaurants close by 7pm. Yet these jokes are always dismissed, as if it were laughable to consider a place with 10-story apartment buildings and a backdrop of smokestacks anything but urban. The city&rsquo;s form, protected via historical preservation, has forced a new way of considering a descriptive term most associated with bustle and endless growth. Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt&rsquo;s founders wrote about instilling in the city&rsquo;s residents a &ldquo;big city habitus,&rdquo; the sensibilities that emerge from urban life. For them that meant a focus on industry and nation-building, but also on harmony among diverse neighbors, a sense of responsibility towards the built and natural environments, and the collective care of the young, old, and misfortunate. As Eisenh&uuml;ttenstadt returns to its original size and population, one also finds, in its managed shrinkage and evolving attitudes, a partial recuperation of its original principles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/23/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Samantha&nbsp;M&nbsp;Fox</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1425679/1425679_10315967_1474638074284_DSCF8472--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1425679/1425679_10315967_1474638074284_DSCF8472--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"View from the Roof Terrace, Linden Allee 18\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1425679/1425679_10315967_1474638074284_DSCF8472--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"View from the Roof Terrace, Linden Allee 18\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Lindenallee and the EKO steel plant, as seen from the roof terrace of Lindenallee 18.
