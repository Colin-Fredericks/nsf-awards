 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description:\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will enable the acquisition of a state-of-the-art versatile X-ray diffractometer to fill a critical gap in Lehigh University's microscopy/spectroscopy materials characterization infrastructure enabling unique, comprehensive materials characterization for seamless correlation of material structure and function. The versatility of the instrument for complementary interrogation of a wide range of biological, organic and inorganic sample types should facilitate multi-disciplinary efforts of researchers spanning Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, Materials Science, Chemistry, Bioengineering, Mechanical Engineering, Earth and Environmental Science, and Physics, among others, and enhance educational opportunities for students. By enabling one-stop materials characterization unique to the region in which Lehigh University is located, the X-ray diffractometer should impact numerous regional start-up companies to well-established industries as well as colleagues at 4 or more local non-PhD granting, but research-active, colleges and universities. The new capabilities for unique and comprehensive insight into materials structure and function will enable a wide range of cutting edge science and engineering aimed at solving Grand Materials Research Challenges within the broad arenas of energy, the environment, and health.  Development and deployment of complementary interactive educational X-ray modules will impact domestic and international students enrolled annually in Lehigh?s Microscopy Summer School and a range of middle school, high school, and undergraduate students in educational outreach programs at Lehigh.  All of these programs place concerted focus on the recruitment of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Description:\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will support acquisition of a state-of-the-art, uniquely configured Anton Paar SAXSpace X-ray diffractometer that has simultaneous and continuous small- and wide-angle capabilities and multi-collimated (line, point) X-ray beam configurations suitable for probing even weakly scattering isotropic and anisotropic samples of a wide range of compositions (e.g., solutions, gels, powders, films) and temperatures.  Capabilities for in situ tensiometry, grazing incidence small- and moderate wide-angle thin film studies, and biologics analysis uniquely equip this single instrument for comprehensive, non-destructive, and high-resolution multi-scale (i.e., molecular to meso-scale) insight into a diverse range of biological, polymeric and inorganic samples that will augment, integrate and create new, transformative materials analysis distinct from existing state-of-the-art microscopy, spectroscopy, and proximal probe tools at Lehigh.  This unique, complementary insight will help establish transformative synthesis-structure-properties relations aimed at efficient and rational materials design. This should enhance active research spanning: (i) Functional, Meso-structured and Meso-porous Inorganic Materials, (ii) Organic, Inorganic, and Hybrid Films, Buried Interfaces, and (iii) Biological and Hybrid Materials, through specific interdisciplinary projects in applications as diverse as catalysts for biomass-to-chemicals conversion, photocatalysts for low-cost liquid fuel production, bioactive glass scaffolding for hard tissue regeneration, mechanics of biomimetic materials and multi-functional nanocomposites, protein and cell membrane phase behavior for biomimetic toxin sensing, and novel therapeutics design, among others.",
