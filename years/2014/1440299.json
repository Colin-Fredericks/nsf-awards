 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs propose to address the difficulty of developing a small, low power, highly sensitive molecular biology tool for oceanographic work with the novel implementation of a sensor technology known as Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF). The TIRF provides rapid, sensitive, simultaneous, and cost-effective detection of multiple biochemical targets with minimal sample preparation.  This EAGER proposal seeks funding to explore the feasibility of modifying an existing technology developed by MBio Diagnostics, Inc., consisting of a cartridge and reader system in order to achieve either a smaller form factor, an increased sample capacity, or both. This modified TIRF technology will be designed for integration with an AUV-based sample acquisition/processing module that will provide for underway generation of biological data in support of oceanographic applications.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nThe TIRF-based sensor is one of several emerging technologies that promise to transform ocean science by providing the ability to carry out interactive experiments and test hypotheses remotely at the molecular level. It has the potential for providing real or near-real time data revealing not only species? presence and abundance, but also the metabolic and physiological status of those organisms at the biochemical and molecular levels, can provide new insights into how populations are responding in situ to their environment over time as conditions change. This project will continue to build international collaborations with the UK and Ireland. It will include 4 undergraduate and 3 graduate student participation in both the US and Ireland. A workshop will be organized in Belfast as well as using these development experiences as part of an on-line module for a Masters in Diagnostics (University Arizona).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe EAGER Collaborative is a six member group comprising MBio Diagnostics, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Charleston, SC), the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), Queen?s University Belfast, Dublin City University, and the University of Maine. The overall EAGER program goal was to explore the feasibility of combining MBio?s novel detection system (LightDeck&reg; technology) with the MBARI Long-Range Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (LR-AUV), both from an engineering and immunoassay development perspective.  More specifically, the aim was to modify the MBio LightDeck&reg; optical system for integration with an AUV-based sample acquisition/processing module that will provide for underway generation of biological data in support of oceanographic applications. The program builds on a successful collaboration between the US and Irish academic groups, with MBio Diagnostics serving as the industry partner.  This EAGER program leverages previous work funded by NSF.\n\nA first outcome of this program was that major engineering goals were achieved.  From a systems engineering perspective, the MBio and MBARI teams developed engineering concepts demonstrating integration of the MBio detection module into the MBARI LR-AUV architecture.  Engineering concepts for the disposable cartridge that interfaces with the MBARI LR-AUV sample collection module and pumping system were also demonstrated.  The impact of these engineering efforts is that conceptual feasibility is now established, justifying more substantive investment in hardware development.\n\nThe award also resulted in major progress on toxin assay development.  A unique aspect of the MBio system is that multiple tests can be performed in a single disposable cartridge (assay multiplexing).  A major accomplishment of the assay development component of this program was to deliver a 4-plex assay cartridge with reagents for detecting paralytic shellfish toxin, okadaic acid, domoic acid, and microcystin.  All four of those toxins have potential adverse impacts on human health if consumed in contaminated food or drinking water.  Consequently, toxins such as these not only have an impact on ocean and freshwater ecosystems, they can have an enormous economic impact in the context of food supply (marine toxins), drinking water (freshwater toxins), and recreational waters (e.g., beach closures).  Under this NSF award, feasibility of several aspects of the toxin detection tests were demonstrated.  For example, a cartridge called the \"EAGER Toxin Array\" cartridge was brought into prototype production at MBio and includes tests for the four toxins listed above.  Linked to this effort consortium collaborators at NOAA used the EAGER Toxin Array to develop preliminary protocols for extracting toxin from bacterial cells.  Progress was also made on a test that looks for the genetic signatures of harmful bacterial, potentially enabling rapid, early detection of algal blooms or contamination.  And novel capture molecules (PNA) were explored at key test components.\n\nThe EAGER Collaborative was successful in delivering the intended engineering and assay feasibility outputs that will serve as the basis of more substantive fundraising efforts.  A key outcome from MBio Diagnostics? perspective is that the company is leveraging the technical successes of the EAGER program and is now embarking on commercialization of the research system fostered under this award.  Most significantly, MBio was awarded a competitive Phase I SBIR grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF Award #1621951) in June 2016 for work directly related to the feasibility program funded by NSF-EAGER.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Lochhead"
