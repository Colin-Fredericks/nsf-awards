 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop an integrated computational and experimental platform based on the hypothesis that the efficacy of anticancer drugs could be greatly improved when used in combination with other drugs.  The proposed platform will implement in vitro search algorithms for combinations of drugs acting on cancer metabolism. Combination drug therapy is commonly used to enhance efficacy and overcome drug resistance in cancer, but at present the choice of drugs is based on empirical clinical experience alone. Testing multi-drug therapies in a systematic way is hampered by the large number of possible choices for drugs and doses. Therefore, an innovative approach for discovering effective drug combinations is needed. The proposed project is an innovative solution based on a highly interdisciplinary approach that combines drug discovery, systems biology, and advanced mathematical and algorithmic methods.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be to produce novel and effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer.  Despite the fact that until recently research investment was increasing steadily, the number of drugs approved annually by the FDA remains disappointingly low.  Further, currently, there are no effective systematic methods for the discovery and optimization of combinatorial therapies.   The plan is to use drugs that are either on the market or in the pipeline.  The commercial strategy of the company is to discover specific fixed-dose combinations for cancer therapeutics as a service for pharmaceutical companies, or to generate intellectual property for licensing. In the long term, the company plans to provide a service for physicians by creating personalized drug combinations based on patient data.",
