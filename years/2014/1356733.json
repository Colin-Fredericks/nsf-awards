 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the Facilitated Access to Science Training (FAST) project the Principle Investigator team at the University of Texas at San Antonio seeks to increase the number of economically disadvantaged students who complete biology, chemistry, or physics degrees and proceed to enter the scientific workforce or pursue advanced studies.  The project requires 13 participants to take part in activities designed to help them find support, build relationships with faculty mentors, and strengthen their self-efficacy and self-identity as scientists.  A unique feature of the plan is an intensive one-week, pre-college science boot camp that focuses on providing students with foundational knowledge in subject areas in which they are deficient and introduces them to scientific thinking.  In order to broaden participation, students are recruited from the greater San Antonio area which is 70% Hispanic and African American.\r\n\r\nThroughout the project, S-STEM scholars (a) develop academic excellence and independence as they proceed through gatekeeper and advanced courses, (b) enhance their competence as scientists by connecting with a mentor, (c) participate in scientific research, and (d) engage in professional and personal enrichment activities including participation in scientific conferences. The program builds on current, successful initiatives including the implementation of evidence-based practices in gateway courses and recruitment of undergraduates from the university's college preparatory program.  Data generated through assessment and evaluation supports the rationale that this three-pronged approach of providing students with a support structure, faculty mentors, and helping them to become self-identified scientists leads to retention and graduation.  Formative and summative evaluation focuses on assessment of student confidence, academic aspirations and expectations, and career development.  The students are also tracked and interviewed about the project's impact.  Dissemination of the project results provides a model for strengthening self-efficacy and self-identity as a means of retaining STEM students.  The project team plans to present their work through the Annual Conference on Understanding Interventions that Broaden Participation in Research Careers as well as through national meetings of the American Chemical Society and the AAAS.  Project deliverables will include results of summative evaluation and the course materials developed for the boot camp.",
