 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovation fundamentally begins with a good idea. But where do good ideas come from? Much research suggests that innovative breakthroughs are often inspired by past experience: things and ideas that one has interacted with in the world. However, the same experiences that can inspire innovation can also can constrain or harm innovation through focus on previously unsuccessful solutions. This project tests principles for guiding interactions with sources of inspiration to maximize their benefits and minimize their pitfalls. In particular, it focuses on the role of conceptual distance of sources. The following questions are the focus of this work: 1) Are good ideas built mainly on sources that are closely related to the problem (e.g., building on existing recycling efforts to address the problem of people throwing away electronics), or are they most often inspired by sources that are from distantly related domains (e.g., being inspired by how burrs cling to a dog's fur when designing Velcro)? 2) When considering multiple sources, should one try to ensure that the sources are similar to each other (i.e., deeply exploring one direction), or should one consider diverse sources? \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nInnovation researchers and practitioners have formulated recommendations for these questions, but the scientific evidence for these recommendations is incomplete because it is based on small numbers of case studies or involved toy problems solved much more quickly than real-world problems. This project expands and improves the evidence base for understanding the sources of innovation by analyzing thousands of solutions to complex innovation challenges (e.g., increasing accessibility in elections, revitalizing struggling urban areas) posted on an online crowd-sourced innovation platform that required contributors to post sources of ideas. To analyze this evidence, it combines computer algorithms for automatically processing the content of text along with statistical algorithms for extracting meaning across thousands of ideas. The quality of the ideas are coded by experts for quality and novelty, and then the algorithms are used to statistically test the relationship between both source distance and source variety on ideation success. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe results of this work will have immediate implications for scientific theories of innovation, and are relevant to the design of systems for creating new innovations (e.g., online crowd-sourced innovation platforms, creativity support systems and methods). Further, the novel methods employed in this work, as well as the data generated, will be shared with other innovation researchers to facilitate more and better investigations into the science of how innovation happens. Ultimately, this work contributes to a solid scientific research base that can support innovators (both existing and aspiring) and policy makers in their efforts to address the most pressing and difficult problems facing the world today.",
