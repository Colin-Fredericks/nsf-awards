In addition, magnetic nanoparticles are widely used in a number of biological applications. Biosensing techniques to accurately detect magnetic nanoparticles are not well-developed. This project will develop a new microscopy-based technique to detect magnetic nanoparticles. The proposed development can help a more accurate determination of iron content in human tissue for multiple pathologies and in bio-nanotechnology applications.\r\n\r\nA variety of superparamagnetic nanoparticles with unique and multi-functional properties are utilized in biosensing applications. Nanoscale iron-deposits found in-vivo are also superparamagnetic in nature. Techniques to characterize these nanoscale magnetic (iron) particles in biological systems at the single particle level are not well-developed. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a novel biosensing modality, namely, InDirect Magnetic Force Microscopy (ID-MFM), to detect nanoscale magnetic particles. ID-MFM is expected to offer very high sensitivity and spatial resolution beyond the capabilities of existing biosensors and imaging modalities. This unique approach can be used to determine magnetic (iron) content in small quantities of samples and is expected to find a wide variety of applications in evaluating biological fluids, cells and tissue sections. The iron-encapsulating protein, ferritin, will be studied as a model magnetic nanoparticle because of its versatile applications in biomedicine and bio-nanotechnology. ID-MFM will be developed to detect ferritin in-vitro, in ambient air and in a fluid environment. The proposed efforts also include a multi-level enrichment plan in nanotechnology for K-8 students, undergraduates and graduate students through a hands-on workshop, research experience and inter-institutional collaboration.",

These include naturally occurring iron-oxide core in the ferritin protein as well as man-made iron-oxide (magnetite) nanoparticles used to label cells and molecules. Currently, histo-chemical staining is the method of choice to localize iron deposits in tissue sections, but the technique is primarily qualitative.

MFM is a standard technique in which a magnetically coated nano-probe is used to scan the top surface of a sample and detect magnetic interactions. By using the conventional or direct MFM, naturally occurring ferritin(iron) was detected in-vitro (on mica surface) as well as in sections of rodent spleen tissue. Although single particles of ferritin(iron) could be detected in-vitro via MFM, in tissue sections the size(s) of MFM signals corresponded to clusters of ferritin(iron) as determined using electron microscopy. A novel technique, namely indirect MFM (ID-MFM) was developed in which clusters of synthetic iron-oxide nanoparticles deposited on the bottom side of an ultrathin membrane could be detected by scanning its top side by the MFM nano-probe. ID-MFM also enabled fluorescence and electron microscopy on the same samples. Both direct and ID-MFM were found to be impacted by clustering of iron-oxide nanoparticles.
