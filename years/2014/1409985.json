 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) and Ceramic (CER) Programs in the Division of Materials Research. \r\n\r\nNON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\r\nThe project focuses on the development of a new class of thin film oxide semiconductors that are of great interest for applications as energy materials and for novel electronic devices.  The project addresses technical challenges through basic materials studies and the development of advanced thin film deposition methods.  The highly perfect films synthesized in this project impact the theoretical understanding of oxide materials.  The research activities in the project contribute to the interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students in advanced thin film deposition methods and materials characterization through training in both formal (courses and weekly seminars) and informal (laboratory) settings. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: \r\nThe project focuses on the development of molecular beam epitaxy methods for the growth of a new class of thin film oxide semiconductors, the perovskite stannates, with the goal of achieving a high degree of materials perfection and to determine the intrinsic properties of these materials.  Materials such as SrSnO3 and BaSnO3 combine high charge carrier mobilities with wide band gaps, which makes them highly interesting for applications such as transparent conducting oxides, power semiconductors, or in novel heterostructures for the integration with functional perovskites.  Conditions for stoichiometric thin film growth, structure-property relationships, and the role of materials defects will be established. The project provides opportunities for two- to three-month-long, self-contained internships for undergraduate students and for interdisciplinary collaborations with materials theorists and experts in electronic devices.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTin oxide based compounds (stannates) having the perovskite crystal structure have attracted substantial attention due to their high electron mobilities, wide band gaps, and the prospects of combining them with functional perovskites in epitaxial structures that are of interest for future oxide electronic devices.  These applications all require high quality thin films and heterostructures.  The goal of this project was the synthesis and characterization of high quality stannate thin films using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).  A major accomplishment of this project included the development of an MBE approach that used a tin oxide source, instead of elemental tin, which was shown to overcome issues with composition control, and led to films with higher carrier mobilities than previously reported.  Detailed growth MBE studies and extensive characterization of the defects in these films were carried out to understand their influence on the electrical properties.  Furthermore, the high-quality MBE-grown films developed in this project enabled the determination of the electron effective mass of barium stannate and measurements of the band gaps of alloys between barium and strontium stannate.  Knowledge of these parameters is essential for the design of future electronic devices with these materials.  The project provided hands-on training of several undergraduate and graduate students in the science of MBE, thin film materials characterization, and electrical measurements, and in the development of new, electronic device materials.  The results from the project were published in several journal publications and in several Ph.D. theses.  The project also involved interdisciplinary collaborations with theorists and with electrical engineers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Susanne Stemmer"
