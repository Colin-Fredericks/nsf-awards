 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists who study animal behavior ask questions about why and how individuals and groups of animals behave as they do. Studies of animal behavior are important for understanding the role of the brain, the nervous system, genes and hormones in influencing actions of individuals and the groups that they are in. An understanding of animal behavior is also important for conservation and understanding how animals respond to our changing world.  This meeting will bring together a wide variety of scientists who study animal behavior using a wide range of approaches to discuss the future of integrative studies in the field of animal behavior. Ideas developed at this meeting are likely to have far reaching societal benefits to address complex problems. Blog posts and a Twitter feed of the meeting will be presented in real time and also available to the public as well as publications in open access journals.\r\n\r\nAt the 50th anniversary of Tinbergen's seminal publication on levels of analysis in studies of animal behavior, efforts to integrate neural, genetic, physiological, ecological, and evolutionary studies of behavior at the organismal level are gaining new prominence. These integrative studies of animal behavior are being facilitated by multiple factors, including new technologies and analytical procedures, as well as the increasing ease of application of these advances to field studies. The primary goal of the workshop will be to define what \"integrative\" means for animal behavior today. There are three primary areas of focus for this meeting: genes, brains, and physiology. It will include participants who broadly study animal behavior using genetic, genomic, epigenetic, neurobiological, neuroendocrine, immune-ecological, nutritional, and other physiological approaches. It will also include researchers developing emerging technologies and statistical advances that will allow for the next generation of integrative behavior studies thus bringing together groups of scientists that don't typically interact. As the 2014 ABS meeting immediately follows this workshop, a summary of the discussion will be presented there. The white paper will be freely available to anyone and we publish the paper from this meeting in open access format. Time at the meeting will also be devoted to discuss underrepresented minority recruitment to these disciplines.",

The group&rsquo;s objectives were to (1) define the integrative study of animal behavior, (2) outline the benefits of employing integrative research in animal behavior, (3) discuss how best to conduct integrative animal behavior research, and (4) determine how the animal behavior community can acquire the skills and expertise necessary to make their work integrative.</p>\n<p>The group was unified in its stance that an integrative approach to the study of behavior will enable critical tests of the robustness of current knowledge, while also generating novel insights and new areas of inquiry. The group also agreed that the goal of promoting discovery of paradigm-shifting or paradigm&ndash;reinforcing findings in behavior will require a critical balance between developing novel ideas and testing existing ones. Integrative research in animal behavior must retain its tradition of beginning with a question, being hypothesis-driven, and/or being steeped in natural history and in theory, whether verbal or mathematical. Moving forward, however, the challenge will be to achieve an optimal balance between explicit hypothesis-testing, and the use of new technologies for exploratory work to promote hypothesis-generation. To achieve integration, researchers will not only need to collaborate across disciplines, but also be trained in a diversity of skills, particularly those that are quantitative in nature. The workshop recognized that the Animal Behavior community needs great inter-disciplinary training opportunities, both for students and more senior researchers who need to learn new skills. Thus, this will require new training at all career stages, and we encourage the community to develop a summer course or workshop as has been done in other disciplines (e.g., neuroscience, evolution, genomics). The goal of this training should be to provide researchers competency and literacy in a range of core areas constituting the discipline of animal behavior and its application to the needs of society to understand the principles underlying behavior, to preserve biodiversity, and to provide breakthroughs in medicine. Ultimately, the insights produced from this workshop will influence the field of neuroscience, particularly the discussions on model organisms, linking work in the field and lab, and the importance of complex behaviors.
