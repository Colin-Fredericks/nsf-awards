 "awd_abstract_narration": "Greenhouse gasses, such as methane are emitted from agricultural, fields at varying rates, based in part on the soil water content (SWC) of the fields.  A map of the variability in SWC can be used as an input for climate models, improving our understanding of how agricultural activity affects the atmosphere. This research will use near-surface geophysical methods to detect changes in the amount of water present in the subsurface of agricultural fields. The proposed project will take place at Queensland University of Technology in collaboration with Dr. Remke Van Dam.  The project will take advantage of the ongoing research that has been done in this area by the Healthy Ecosystems and Environmental Monitoring (HEEM) team at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia.  Collaboration with supporting hydrologic and environmental research will help advance both this project and the existing projects.\r\n\r\nGHG emissions, which have important implications for climate change, have been shown to be affected by variability in SWC, but traditional methods of determining SWC such as TDR do not easily cover the field scale or larger scales. The GPR ground wave, which travels from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna through the very shallow subsurface, provides a way to, relatively quickly; create a field-scale map of the SWC variations at a field site. The resulting map can be used as an input for models of GHG emissions, allowing for upscaling of point measurements to the field scale. GPR reflection surveys will be carried out at field sites with ongoing GHG emission research projects. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs climate change and population growth become larger issues in the 21st century, water is becoming an increasingly important resource.  Water in the shallow subsurface affects all terrestrial life, and is an important factor in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Understanding how water is spatially distributed at a field site can inform climate models, improve agriculture, and aid biological and chemical research.  There are plenty of options for measuring soil water content (SWC) at the point scale, and remote sensing has allowed us to map water content variations at the square kilometer scale.  Ground penetrating rader (GPR) is a geophysical method that allows for the estimation of SWC at the field scale, an important intermediate scale that can link point scale and large area measurements together.  \n\nWe employ a relatively new method of analysing GPR data, the early time method, with the goal of monitoring changes in SWC in response to irrigation in a clay-rich soil.  Traditional methods of collecting GPR are hampered by high conductivity soils, such as clay, which attenuate the GPR signal, making analysis difficult.  The early time method avoids this problem by looking at the portion of the GPR signal that travels directly from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna.  This signal is much less affected by the attenuation caused by clay soils.\n\nOur research at an agricultural field site in Queensland, Australia found that the early time method was highly capable of mapping SWC changes in response to irrigation at the clay-rich site.  We also found that the GPR data correlated with GHG flux measurements taken at the field site; an increase in the GPR signal post-irrigation corresponded with an increase in measured GHG flux rates.  This means that there is the potential for correlating spatially extensive and dense GPR data with GHG emission data to interpolate between the GHG point measurements and improve climate models.  The early time method shows promise as an alternate method to traditional GPR surveys in high conductivity soils.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan T Algeo"
