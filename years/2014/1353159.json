 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dead trees are part of every forested landscape and ecosystem, yet much remains to be learned about their role in these systems. Although the study of dead trees is in its infancy, a significant body of literature and associated data have become available in the last 25 years that can be used to describe the many functions of dead wood in forested ecosystems of the world. Over a two-year period this project will synthesize results from journal articles, past reviews, and data analyses related to the role of dead trees in forests leading to an updated synthesis in book form. Specific activities include: an updated literature review and analysis of the function of dead trees in forests of the world; reanalysis of long-term experimental data on wood decomposition; compilation of articles, images, and photographs related to dead trees; updating and expansion of previously published reviews and book chapters; and synthesis of all these materials into a book.  \r\n\r\nDead trees are one of the most common objects in forests, yet their function is often ascribed as \"waste\". In reality dead trees serve many important ecological functions such as a habitat and a food source for a wide host of organisms, part of the physical structure in forest streams, a source of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients for forest organisms, as well as fuel for either human use or for wildfires.  It is of critical importance in a world in which the number and volume of dead trees is likely to be increasing, that their role and dynamics be better understood not only by specialists but also by all those managing and/or using forests. This scientific synthesis therefore represents a major improvement in understanding a major component of all forests.  To enhance public understanding and appreciation of this important natural resource a parallel project will create visual and written presentations of dead trees that will be distributed in multiple formats such as public displays and a popular book.",

The analysis indicated not only the impact of each of these factors and levels, but how they interact to determine the overall decomposition rates of dead trees which can lead to dead woody pieces disappearing in less than a decade to over a millennia. The implications of these controls on the future fate of trees that have died in recent insect outbreaks and wildfires were explored and suggestions were made as to how the science of dead tree decomposition could be improved in terms of understanding and application.\n\nA major outcome related to broad impacts was to organize and present an integrated examination of the role of dead trees via an art exhibition entitled \"Rot: The Afterlife of Trees\".
