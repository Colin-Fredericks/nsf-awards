  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main acheivement of this research program has been to advance the emerging field of C^0, or continuous, symplectic geometry and explore its connections to other mathematical fields.  These achievements have three primary components:  the theory of spectral invariants, continuous Hamiltonian dynamics, and interactions between these two subjects.\n\n\nIntellectual Merits. The field of C^0-symplectic geometry is primarily concerned with the study of so-called C^0-rigidity phenomena.  Such phenomena have played an important role in advancing symplectic geometry since the discovery of the celebrated C^0-rigidity theorem of Gromov and Eliashberg in the 80's.  This research project was inspired by questions originating in dynamical systems and it succeded in expanding the connections between C^0 symplectic geometry and dynamical systems.\nThe theory of spectral invariants is one of the crowning achievements of modern symplectic geometry; it has played a fundamental role in solving some of the subject's oldest problems.  The construction of these invariants is very complicated and is nearly inaccessible to mathematicians who are not specialized in symplectic geometry.  Moreover, these invariants have been nearly impossible to compute except in very special circumstances.  An article written jointly by the principal investigator, V. Humili&eacute;re and F. Le Roux, proposes a new dynamical construction for spectral invariants which is significantly simpler than the original construction.  Furthermore, the new construction allows for computing spectral invariants in a large class of examples.\n\n\nContinuous Hamiltonian dynamics is a branch of symplectic geometry whose aim is to find a continuous generalization of smooth Hamiltonian dynamics. In this spirit, several different definitions have been suggested for continuous Hamiltonian transformations.  The article written by the principal investigator, L. Buhovsky, and V. Humili&eacute;re, proves that any possible definition for continuous Hamiltonian transformations, satisfying a mild set of conditions, admits continuous Hamiltonian transformations with a single fixed point.  This is in dramatic contrast to smooth Hamiltonian dynamics where it is known that Hamiltonian transformations must necessarily have numerous fixed points.\n\nBroader Impacts.  Symplectic geometry has its roots in classical mechanics: it provides a mathematical framework for studying the motion of celestial bodies.  In recent decades, symplectic geometry has progressed spectacularly and is now a mainstream field within pure mathematics.  The field maintains significant connections to applied subjects such as aerospace and mechanical engineering.  It is used to model the motion of satellites and to predict the behavior of meteorological phenomena such as hurricanes.  \nThe focus of this research project has been the field of C^0-symplectic geometry which is a rapidly developing branch of symplectic geometry.  It has the prospect of solving longstanding open problems, not only in symplectic geometry, but also in other fields within mathematics and physics such as dynamical systems and quantum mechanics.  The results mentioned above have expanded the scope of the field of C^0 symplectic geometry, have established new and important connections to nearby fields such as Hamiltonian dynamics.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sobhan Seyfaddini"
