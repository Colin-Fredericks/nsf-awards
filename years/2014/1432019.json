 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborators at North Seattle Community College (NSCC) and Central Washington University seek are developing a model for institutionalizing an interdisciplinary and research-based curriculum.  The project goals are to (a) provide progressive and innovative STEM curriculum that significantly improves preparation of diverse student populations for upper level courses and careers in science, (b) establish the foundation for a Pacific Northwest Collaboration focused on excellence in STEM education at the community college level, and (c) make a significant contribution to the body of knowledge regarding our understanding of how students think, learn, and problem solve in a research and interdisciplinary context early in their college experience.   \r\n\r\nThe \"thinking is valued\" framework, in which developing thinking dispositions within and across disciplines is seen as the key to academic success, is embedded in the curricular changes rnvisioned.   The collaborators will use undergraduate research and interdisciplinary experiences as vehicles to cultivate meaningful thinking opportunities in the first and second years of the college experience.  Formative and summative evaluation will address three questions (a) Does the project provide evidence of new \"habits of thinking\" from students and faculty who participate in the interdisciplinary and research-based STEM curricula? (b) Does interdisciplinary and research-based curriculum enhance teaching practices and student learning outcomes? and (c) Is the project reaching other community colleges and universities?  A combination of faculty/administrator review panels, student classroom assessment, student/faculty/staff interviews, and institutional presentations will be used to document, analyze, and update project findings.  Dissemination of new materials and results will impact a wide range of educators through direct partnerships with practicing faculty, a web presence that serves to distribute curriculum, and presentations at national meetings throughout the duration of the project.",

This was achieved by transforming the introductory chemistry and biology series for STEM students with interdisciplinary and research-based modules, namely Inter-Disciplinary Investigations (IDIs). These IDIs are designed to challenge student learning and thinking processes while extending student knowledge beyond their immediate discipline. One key component for developing effective and sustainable Lab IDIs was the acquisition of a state-of-the-art analytical instrument that is essential in water quality studies and a staple in accredited laboratories. With this instrument, an Ion Chromatograph (IC), a multitude of diverse and in-depth projects were developed that engaged students personally. From the fluorosis of their teeth to the eutrophication of their nearby lake, students collected samples, prepared and ran standards, and analyzed and disseminated their own data. These IDIs were designed to be easily transferrable and modifiable and have been implemented elsewhere, including at Central Washington University (CWU). To further publicize this work and IDIs, presentations were given by all four co-PIs at many conferences throughout the funding period and a book chapter was published. A major outcome of this project was also to broaden the participation in STEM among underrepresented students, including women, historically underrepresented minorities, low-income, and/or first-generation students. North Seattle College is federally designated as an Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution (AANAPISI) and a Minority Serving Institution and thus the education of a large number of diverse students was affected by this project. Finally, the team continues to seek opportunities and funding sources to further distribute curriculum developed through this grant.</span></p>\n<!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;} @font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;} @font-face \t{font-family:Times; \tpanose-1:2 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 7 0;}  /* Style Definitions */  p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmargin-bottom:.0001pt; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin;} .MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;} @page WordSection1 \t{size:8.5in 11.0in; \tmargin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in; \tmso-header-margin:.5in; \tmso-footer-margin:.5in; \tmso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anne&nbsp;M&nbsp;Johansen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
