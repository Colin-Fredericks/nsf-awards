 "awd_abstract_narration": "In animals, normal limb movements such as walking or reaching require sensory information from the limb regarding their movements and mechanics.  While fishes use their limbs (or paired fins) for a diverse array of behaviors, little is known about the role sensory abilities plays in those functions.  This project examines the fundamental question of how the sensory and motor elements of the fin propulsive system co-adapt to generate a functional neuromechanical system.  In particular, it will determine how physical properties of the fins such as stiffness, size and shape, are reflected in the biological instrumentation of the fins for sensation.  In addition to providing a new tractable model for studying integration of sensation and movement, data from this project will inform the design of fin-inspired propulsive devices for underwater vehicles. The broader impacts of this project will provide outreach experiences for children on the South Side of Chicago as well as opportunities for undergraduate and graduate training in the laboratory and builds educational activities at the Field Museum of Natural History.",

Are the fins sensory structures? If so, how do fin shape and bending mechanics relate to fin sensation? Our research team examined 8 species of coral reef fishes (the wrasses) that swim with their pectoral fins (the fins on the side), to explore the sensory function and mechanical design of fins that are used for endurance and maneuverable swimming. Wrasses vary in whether they flap their fins up and down in an underwater flight behavior, or move them fore and aft in a rowing stroke. We predicted that sensory neurobiology and biomechanical properties of the fins would be related, and that we would increase our understanding of animal behavior and function with this project.

Sensitivity was quite variable along an individual fin ray, and also differed between species that flap the fins vs those that row with the fins. Using biomechanical tests from engineering, we also discovered that some fins (the flappers) are much stiffer than the fins of rowers, requiring more force to bend. A central result of this work is that the sensitivity of the fin's nervous system is tuned to the mechanical properties of the fin.
