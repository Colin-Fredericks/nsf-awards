 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many physical structures, including airplane wings, bridges, wind turbine blades, dams, and buildings, are subject to the development of fractures over time. Detecting these problems early is essential to preventing major catastrophes. A promising approach is to install sensors that continuously monitor and report on the structure's integrity. However, adoption has been limited because of several limitations in current technology, including a need for frequent battery replacement for battery-powered sensors, limited interrogation range of passive sensors, and a separate communication subsystem usually involving radio frequency sensor networks. This project aims to remove these barriers by exploring a set of new technologies, including mechanical energy harvesting and ultra-sound communication using the substrate of the structure itself.\r\n\r\nThe long term vision of this research is to develop a transformative self-organizing embedded system design paradigm that facilitates convergence of self-powered computing, self-powered networking and structural health monitoring into \"cyber-substrates\", that can \"sense\", \"feel\" and \"diagnose\" impending catastrophic failures. The approach is based on a new integrated sensing, signal processing, and communication chipset, which scavenges both strain and vibration energy from the substrate to which it is attached or embedded into. Energy is accumulated in a capacitor for computing and communications. These chips are capable of enough local signal processing to detect events indicative of failures, so that their communication requirement is reduced to sending a single bit per event to a logging device. Key innovations in this project are in the areas of: 1) embedded computing hardware for sensing, event classification, and signal processing with ultra-low power budgets, 2) packet-less and through-substrate pulse networking for extreme energy economy, 3) energy scavenging from the substrate structure, 4) binary computation models for structural health evaluation and event predictions, and 5) smart embedded software for self-organizing integration of all the above elements. All these components are designed around the core theme of binary information framework which is heavily leveraged for power optimization in sensing, communication, and global inference algorithms for structural processing.  Education and outreach activities include involvement of diverse graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the research, and development of a new interdisciplinary graduate course in structural health monitoring.",

The research objectives were to investigate embedded hardware and self-organizing protocols and software components to realize such <em>cyber-substrates. </em>The key system level concept is a <em>Smart Substrate Plate (SSP) with self-contained energy-harvesting, sensing, processing, and substrate-integrated binary event networking capabilities</em>. Large structure can be built by mechanically joining such SSPs in an organic bottom-up fashion. For example, an aircraft wing, if constructed using such cyber-enabled SSPs, will be able to sense its own structural health, pre-process, and communicate <em>through the substrate itself</em> using an ultrasonic pulse data link (i.e., <em>without a separate medium such as radio or embedded wire</em>) ? all using harvested power from its own ambience. The plates are self-organizing in that when multiple SSPs are mechanically joined, they are able to form an ultrasonic packet-less pulse communication network for transporting sensed and pre-processed information to pre-configured data sinks. A novel structure modeling framework using binary information is then used for collating sensory data from all SSPs in the system for structural health evaluation and catastrophic event prediction. The proposed systems research will overcome many of the existing challenges for embedded structural health monitoring which is limited by lack of scalability and exorbitantly high maintenance cost.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The project led to a rich set of engineering innovation in low-power communication, machine learning based structural fault identification, and hardware advancements for sensing and communication using harvested energy from large structures. Taking inspirations from how insects communicate, the researchers developed brand new packet-less communication methodologies that do away with traditional packet-based networking with high energy overheads. Such packet-less mechanisms utilize chirp-like communication pulses the intervals between which is used for coding information that needs to be transferred across embedded sensors within the structures under observation. A large number of technical publications, presentations, and patents have been generated out of this transformative packet-less communication concept.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The researchers have also developed groundbreaking machine learning mechanisms on structural fault estimation with time-delayed and incomplete information obtained using packet-less communication techniques. Low-rank matrix completion, image-based Pattern Recognition approach employing anomaly detection, and a data fusion model were developed within the machine learning framework to learn from noisy features of incomplete data and to reconstruct it using matrix completion. The phases of the Machine Learning-based algorithmic framework are presented in Figure 1. The applicability of the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) method employing the proposed framework was demonstrated through numerical studies on an aircraft wing. Robustness of the SHM method against variations in harvested energy levels was also validated, and the effect of different ML algorithms on the performance of the SHM approach was explored. Results indicate that the developed energy-lean SHM approach employing ML-based data interpretation framework is efficient and robust in detecting damage from a through-substrate self-powering technology with time-delayed and incomplete binary data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another groundbreaking mechanism out of this project is a spiking neural network-based mechanism for identifying spatio-temporal patterns in structural faults. It was demonstrated that a single-layer Spiking Neuron architecture can detect the occurrence of pre-defined structural fault occurrence sequence patterns. The proposed architecture can easily be interfaced with various pulse networking architectures and operate with high detection accuracy. The detection results are robust to pulse drift errors and detection performance can be extended to cover pulse loss and false positive error scenarios using modified training pattern sets. The project output includes details of the architecture implementation and learning parameters, training methodology and the corresponding rationale.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>The project provided research experience and training to six graduated Ph.D. students, and about 15 undergraduate research students.
