 "awd_abstract_narration": "By 2020, it is projected that every human being will contribute 1,000GB\r\nof the sensor data individually. These sensors include but not limited \r\nto GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, camera, all kinds of\r\nwearable biomedical sensors, etc. Beyond the domain of monitoring\r\nhuman activity, multi-sensor data processing has been an active\r\nresearch topic within the context of numerous practical applications, \r\nsuch as medical image analysis, remote sensing, and military\r\ntarget/threat detection. One powerful tool to tackle these critical\r\nBig Data problems is sparsity-driven signal-processing techniques. A\r\nsparse representation not only provides better signal compression for\r\nbandwidth/storage efficiency, but also leads to faster processing\r\nalgorithms as well as more effective signal separation for detection,\r\nclassification and recognition purposes since it focuses on the most\r\nintrinsic property of the data. Sparse signal representation allows one to\r\ncapture the hidden simplified structure present in the data jungle, and\r\nthus minimizes the harmful effects of noise in practical settings.\r\n\r\nThis research investigates the problem of dynamic dictionary learning to\r\nobtain the most effective and adaptive sparse data representation even\r\nin the presence of low-rank interference. The investigator seeks to\r\ndevelop a general framework that takes advantage of diversity, yet\r\ncomplementary, features in vast correlated data sources collected from\r\nmultiple, possibly heterogeneous, sensors co-located in the same \r\nspatio-temporal physical space, recording the same physical event. \r\nSuch scenarios ensure that interference noise patterns are very similar,\r\nhence justifying the low-rank property of the interference, while allow\r\nspecific structural sparsity pattern of the signal of interest to be captured\r\nin the dictionary and/or in the sparse codes.",
