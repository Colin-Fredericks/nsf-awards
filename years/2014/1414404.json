 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating digital games programming assessment technology to fill the need for improving K-12 mathematics education.  The project will result in a prototype of an online mathematics curriculum wherein students apply learned math concepts to create digital games as an authentic transfer of learning. This game-making-based instructional innovation, GameMath, has the following unique features: a) It is game-activity driven, i.e., math concepts necessary to achieve gaming effects are taught/applied together, b) it incorporates diagnostic/prescriptive software so that it addresses even deeply At-Risk students, and c) it collects/analyzes student programming interactions within the game-making context for the purpose of assessing a student?s ability to transfer principles of mathematics.\r\nThese features provide the following advantages: They encourage practice/application of STEM skills mandated in new Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and Next Generation Science Standards, they engage students with the creative process and introduce game coding, and they address the unique needs of At-Risk students to help them recover to grade level proficiency and encourage them to continue studies in the STEM disciplines.  When compared to the leading competing technologies in this market space, including games that teach math, math tutoring systems, and hands-on engineering activities, GameMath encourages production, as opposed to consumption, of games and promises to be less expensive and easier to assess than robotics and other engineering based approaches to mathematics instruction.\r\nThe GameMath prototype is important because the focus of the product will be to promote academic achievement in secondary mathematics. As fully envisioned, the system will support a wide range of pre-algebra and algebra lesson plans based on the Common Core State Standards. Student exploration and manipulation of math concepts within a computer-games-programming environment has the potential to lead to greater interest in computer science.\r\nThe project engages computer science researchers at the University of Southern California (USC), CA, and education product specialists at N C Learning (NCL), NJ, who will collaborate to combine two technologies, both of which have been shown to improve mathematics learning for At-Risk students, to demonstrate and evaluate a prototype in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: 1) Custom CCSS Grade Level Lesson Paths that Support GameMath activities, 2) Creation of game programming activities that apply CCSS grade level mathematics concepts, 3) Games programming assessments to evaluate activity-based learning , 4) Custom reporting that incorporates GameMath assessments into existing diagnostics, and 5) Run-time architecture-level integration. These gaps will be bridged via a new advance==>apply ==>assess concept pipeline that combines USC and NCL technologies.\r\nThe potential economic impact is expected to be greater student preparedness for and interest in pursuing careers in technology and engineering in the next 5 to 10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in engineering and technology based industries.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nConsistent with proposal for award 1414404, PFI:AIR - TT: Games Programming Assessments for Personalized Mathematics Instruction, researchers have produced a prototype to confirm the technical feasibility of a 6th grade math curriculum designed to teach underperforming students math with highly interactive and personalized digital lessons integrated with software coding exercises.  While there are several initiatives to teach coding, the focus of this award is to teach core math skills in a way that is both more engaging for struggling learners and that develops a deeper understanding of math concepts by challenging students to confirm their proficiency in an authentic transfer of learning to real world applications of software code used to develop and modify video games.  Special \"Bridge Lessons\" were developed to introduce students to sufficient coding skills from the C++/Java family of languages to complete the application of math in the coding exercises. \n\nPerhaps most unique is that the prototype includes successful development of a scoring software module to scan, parse and score the code, and report to the teacher which students achieved mastery, near mastery, or failure of the math application.  It also provides the teacher with the specific line of code in which a student failed to apply the concept, so the teacher may intervene individually when needed.   The pedagogical implication is that the coding exercise becomes the assessment that measures a student\u00c6s proficiency in math skills that are aligned to Common Core State Standards.  The other implication is that the prototype is designed so that teachers need not spend time running programs, or searching through code.  In fact the teacher need not even have coding skills to integrate the math lesson software and coding exercises in their classroom.\n\nUse of the prototype to teach the concept of percents, their calculation and application with under-performing fifth and sixth graders and with at-risk high school students, and their respective teachers, confirm the engaging nature of the approach and the acceptance of the teachers.  Feasibility testing took place in both California and New Jersey and included student game play and web-based tutoring program experience.

The study populations of both California and New Jersey consisted primarily of students of low socioeconomic status and traditionally underrepresented in STEM professions.\n\nThe outcomes of this research confirmed the technical feasibility and generated the initial classroom user input to guide further development toward a completed 6th grade math curriculum designed for use by math teachers with limited or no programming skills.  The limited scope of work with underperforming 5th and 6th graders and with at-risk High School students confirmed the engagement and student desire to do more such math lessons and their integrated coding exercises.  These students generally achieved success in applying the math calculation of percents in order to code the percent health of characters in the video game.  While promising, it will require further study to confirm the difference in student performance on independent math assessments versus control groups.  Longer- term research will be needed to determine whether this introduction to coding results in larger groups of inner-city at-risk students continuing their education in the post secondary STEM disciplines, as is desired. It will also require further research and observation with in-class students to guide and refine development of the prototype toward a compl..."
