An increase in overall research competitiveness and productivity in each thrust area is documented by&nbsp;<strong>over 450 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals</strong>, more than&nbsp;<strong>300 presentations&nbsp;</strong>at domestic and international conferences,&nbsp;<strong>and 7 patents</strong>. All four thrusts reached full sustainability, and after the end of the program, continued as independent research programs. A part of thrust 1, focused on nanostructure modeling related to thin films and topological materials, evolved into a major NSF-PREM partnership with Penn State University. Another nanotechnology research project related to quantum dots and devices based on quantum effect has grown so much that it is now the basis for the new proposed CREST center. Thrust 2 on nuclear physics had several breakthrough results and among others developed&nbsp;<strong>one of the most sophisticated computer algorithms</strong>&nbsp;<strong>in a few body nuclear physics</strong>. It is the only one that successfully includes&nbsp;<strong>Coulomb force rigorously&nbsp;</strong>above the breakup threshold to perform three-body calculations in coordinate space without approximations, like screening. The importance and difficulty of the problem are manifested by the fact that many larger groups in the US and Europe have attempted these calculations for the last 50 years. Thrust 2 research group went even further by adding an additional level of difficulty, and developed&nbsp;<strong>a non-isospin algorithm&nbsp;</strong>in which all three particles are treated as different that allows a broader range of applicability. Second, CREST designed and built a unique gamma-rays&nbsp;<strong>polarimeter that has the highest analyzing power above MeV energies ever achieved</strong>. It was used in nuclear experiments, and the same concept of polarimeter is now in use for NASA?s satellite AMEGO project. Third,&nbsp;<strong>one of the researchers, Dr. Makoff, received Breakthrough Prize&nbsp;</strong>as a member of the KamLAND team for her contribution to the development of neutrino detectors. Fourth,<strong> CREST developed the most intense low energy positron beam</strong>, 100 times more intense than previously available and with a <strong>brightness factor 10000 higher than at any other positron facility.&nbsp;</strong>At the largest positron conference, IPAC-18, it was&nbsp;<strong>declared the most important progress in the last few decades in positron instrumentation</strong>. Fifth, the CREST faculty designed a unique experiment with electrons and positrons going in opposite directions performed at&nbsp;Cornell that improved the&nbsp;<strong>sensitivity limit for Lorenz Invariance for two orders of magnitude</strong>. That result has important implications for fundamental science and will have an impact on many disciplines. Our nuclear program is now an equal partner with Duke, UNC, and NCSU of DOE Triangle Universities Research Laboratory and has achieved long-term sustainability through DOE funding. Thrust 3 on robotics and intelligent systems produced many useful algorithms on object recognition, big-data, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI). It led to the establishment of the Computer Science Department at NCCU and is sustained through many DOD, DOE, and NSF grants, including a recent DOE NNSA award for AI and ML. Thrust 4, centered on the geophysical investigation of North American intraplate seismic zones, investigated the crustal structure of eastern United States by means of seismic tomography, shear-wave splitting, potential field inversion by located Euler deconvolution method, and group velocity tomography from seismic noise data. The development of the geophysics research program initiated under CREST has received support from other sources, including two NSF GEOPATHS-IMPACT grants that focused on the creation of an online geoscience degree and collaboration with UNC-CH (institutionalizing a framework for broadening participation in geosciences). All four thrusts developed a broad range of collaborations with academia, national laboratories, NASA, industry, and government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:&nbsp;</strong>The CREST positively impacted the university on all levels. It supported graduate and undergraduate programs, established new academic programs, improved curricula, recruitment, retention, and outreach. CREST supported&nbsp;<strong>101 students that graduated with MS STEM degrees</strong>. This represents over 2/3 of all NCCU MS graduates in STEM disciplines. Out of 101 MS degree recipients, 80 were admitted to Ph.D. programs with full scholarships or to professional schools. Our graduates represent a large part of minority science talent nationally. In 2018 rankings, NCCU was placed among the top 5 HBCUs in the nation and 10th among all universities in producing African American master?s in physical science graduates (Diverse Issues in Higher Education). CREST was crucial for the establishment of the first Ph.D. program at NCCU, and it is selected to lead its expansion to all STEM disciplines, which is also supported by NSF RISE. For these reasons, the university selected it as one of its signature programs to lead NCCU transformation toward a research-intensive university. University established CREST Center as an independent unit with its accounts and permanent administrative, technician, and research positions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Branislav&nbsp;Vlahovic</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1345219/1345219_10288855_1622411327986_1StudentsperformingcharacterizationofmaterialswithScanningelectronMicroscope--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1345219/1345219_10288855_1622411327986_1StudentsperformingcharacterizationofmaterialswithScanningelectronMicroscope--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students working with SEM\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1345219/1345219_10288855_1622411327986_1StudentsperformingcharacterizationofmaterialswithScanningelectronMicroscope--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students working with SEM\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students performing characterization of materials with FEI NanoSEM 630 thermal field emission scanning electron microscope capable of achieving secondary electron image resolutions of 1.0 nm.
