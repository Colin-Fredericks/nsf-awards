 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning is dependent on the actions of small molecules in the brain, called neuromodulators. Common neuromodulators include dopamine and serotonin, which are involved in learning and memory in animals from worms to humans. The current work will explore a recently-identified neuromodulator system: the production of estrogens within the brain. A series of studies will examine how brain estrogen production may support learning complex motor sequences. Understanding the brain's ability to produce its own supply of estrogens may open up new perspectives on cognition, memory, and the function of basic neural circuits that are common among vertebrate animals. \r\n\r\nEstrogens are typically considered reproductive hormones secreted by the ovaries, yet it is now clear that estrogens are produced within the brain itself, in both males and females. A combination of approaches will test the hypothesis that estrogens can be produced within brain circuits to rapidly enhance the consolidation of recent experiences. Songbirds provide an exceptional opportunity to study the underlying brain mechanisms for the learning and memorization of song. There are substantial neural and behavioral parallels between song learning in songbirds and language/speech learning in humans. Juvenile songbirds typically learn songs from an adult tutor during a brief critical sensory period. A recently-optimized method enables the measurement and manipulation of brain estrogens in behaving songbirds while they learn from song tutors and consolidate new songs. Because estrogens have been associated with learning and memory in many animals, including human beings, this research therefore has potential for significant impacts. The work will also involve training students from underrepresented groups in multidisciplinary, integrative research and outreach activities.",

Our study species, a songbird called the Australian zebra finch, has a remarkable capacity to make the hormone estrogens in parts of its brain. Based on similar work in other species, including rats, monkeys, humans, and other songbirds, we proposed to test the hypothesis that song learning in young birds was related to the capacity to make brain estrogens. We first observed that estrogens in a region of the auditory forebrain were changing dynamically when young male birds heard song for the first time. We also observed a major sex difference in the levels of brain estrogens when young birds reached sexual maturity. Surprisingly, males had higher levels of brain estrogens than females, directly countering the prevaling idea that estrogens are female-typical hormones.

The way that estrogens influenced the firing activity of auditory neurons was different whether males were in the earliest 'sensory' phase of development (when they are hearing songs only) vs. when they were older and had entered the 'sensorimotor' phase of development (when they are practicing their own version of songs). For these neurons, estrogens dampened auditory responses to song in sensory animals, while they enhanced auditory responses to song in sensorimotor animals. This difference in mode of action aligns well with the boundary between memorization and practice of new sensorimotor skills, and provides a new layer of understanding about how estrogens may support learning and memory.
