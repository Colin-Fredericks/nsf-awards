 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed approach to be explored through this I/UCRC Fundamental Research Program project utilizes interfacial polymerization (IP) to create a barrier layer on pre-patterned ultrafiltration (UF) membrane supports to create functional patterned thin film composite (TFC) membranes. The specific objectives are (1) generation of new knowledge regarding (i) the IP process dynamics on patterned UF membranes, (ii) the structure of the resulting barrier layer, and (iii) their dependence on major processing parameters; and (2) examination of the influence of specific surface pattern characteristics on salt deposition (fouling) during desalination.\r\n\r\nThis work will enable a non-chemical approach to the fabrication of TFC membranes with reduced fouling and improved energy efficiency; the study will also advance current knowledge as to how surface topography affects membrane fouling during active filtration, which in turn will guide the design of optimized surface patterns for specific separation applications.  The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio while potentially attracting new members. The proposed work will leverage the exceptional infrastructure for innovation in education and outreach at CU-Boulder to provide new and inspirational educational experiences, with a focus on membrane technology, for students at all levels.\r\n",

Membrane scaling increases the resistance to water permeation and the frequency of cleaning, both of which increases the energy cost for water production and reduces the membrane lifetime.  Current commercial TFC membranes consist of an ultrathin polyamide layer atop a porous support.  The polyamide barrier layer is the key element that reject the passage of ions but allow permeation of water.

Recent research has demonstrated that imparting periodic surface patterns atop ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) membranes can increase the membranes? antifouling performances.
