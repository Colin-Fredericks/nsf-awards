 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award,funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry Professor Robert J. Hinde of the Department of Chemistry of the University of Tennessee Knoxville and Professor David T. Anderson of the Chemistry Department of the University of Wyoming and their postdoctoral, graduate and undergraduate student researchers are working on a collaborative theoretical and experimental effort to understand the low-temperature reactivity of hydrogen atoms with other molecules in the ultra-cold environment of solid hydrogen.  They are investigating the unique chemistry in these unusual systems, where the ordinary rules of chemistry do not apply.  This research could shed light on the chemistry that takes place in non-terrestrial systems.  Young scientists working on this project will receive excellent training in experimental physical chemistry and computational chemistry research.\r\n\r\nProf. Hinde and Anderson are investigating the interesting reactivity of H atoms in para hydrogen matrices.  These are ultra-cold environments where the effects of quantum mechanical behavior can dominate the reactivity.  Among the topics being investigated are:  (1) the study of the temperature dependence of H-atom reactions, where some reactions show Arrhenius behavior while others show abrupt increases at low temperatures; (2) determine H-atom solvation energies, where there is a subtle interplay between kinetic and potential energy contributions and fully-quantum many body methods need to be employed; and (3) the further development of infrared spectroscopic tools for investigating these systems.  The chemical systems being studied include H + H2, H + N2O, H + NO, H + HCN, and H + C2H2.  Students working in the groups of Hinde and Anderson will receive state-of-the-art training in advanced computational chemistry and low-temperature chemical physics, respectively.  Both groups of students will benefit from close interaction with members of the other groups, broadening their training.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on understanding chemical reactions between hydrogen (H) atoms and other molecules (such as NO and NNO) when both the H atom and the other molecule are embedded in a solid molecular hydrogen (SMH) matrix.  In the SMH environment, H atoms are mobile; they move through the matrix via stepwise \"hops\" in which an individual H atom moves from site to site through a process mediated by quantum tunneling.  The NO and NNO molecules, by contrast, are immobilized.  Understanding the progress and rate of these reactions therefore sheds light on the quantum tunneling process that makes H atoms mobile within SMH matrices.\n\nThe progress of H + NO and H + NNO chemical reactions in SMH environments can be monitored by measuring the increase in the number of product molecules (HNO or HNNO, respectively) that are produced through these reactions.  The product molecules can be detected by carrying out infrared spectroscopy on the SMH sample while the reactions are proceeding.  This technique allows the detection of HNO and HNNO molecules by shining infrared light on the sample and monitoring how much infrared light is absorbed by the HNO or HNNO molecules.  To obtain quantitative information about the number of HNO or HNNO molecules produced in the SMH environment, we need to know a quantitty called the \"molar absorptivity\" for both HNO and HNNO.  This quantity relates the amount of infrared light absorbed by a sample to the number of molecules in the sample.  Most of our work in this project focused on precise theoretical calculations of the molar absorptivities for HNO and HNNO.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/09/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert J Hinde"
