This principle lies behind lasers, filters, antennas, and light-emitting diodes, as well as devices whose components operate at the nanoscale.  The investigator studies efficient and robust ways to exploit the phenomena of resonance in device design and how to control variations in device performance resulting from inevitable manufacturing imperfections.  The theory of resonance has deep mathematical roots, which are developed to gain a better working understanding of new physical phenomena for the design of modern-day devices.  The project trains graduate and undergraduate students to develop skills at the interfaces of mathematics, physics, and engineering, paying special attention to bridging communication gaps between the disciplines.  Undergraduate students are involved in creating an online computational tool for virtual experimentation and design of optical structures.\r\n\r\n     Four problems of resonance are studied.  (1) An electromagnetic resonance of a doubly periodic waveguide is associated with a complex eigenvalue of the Maxwell equations, which encodes the frequency and spectral width of the resonance.  The investigator considers new waveguide structures that allow both characteristics of a resonance to be tuned by varying the angle of incidence of a source wave.  This ability to tune is precluded in existing constructions of resonant waveguide modes due to the symmetry that they utilize.  This symmetry is broken by exploiting non-reciprocal materials, special geometries, and bifurcations of symmetric guided modes into antisymmetric modes, to construct asymmetric tunable waveguide resonances.  (2) Embedded eigenvalues in locally perturbed periodic quantum graphs are responsible for resonance phenomena in two-dimensional molecular structures such as bi-layer graphene.  Building on a recent result of his on embedded eigenvalues, the investigator employs asymmetry to control resonant scattering characteristics in quantum graphs.  (3) Even in materials with small coefficients of nonlinearity, field amplification due to resonance causes strongly nonlinear effects, such as bistability and hysteresis.  The investigator quantifies these effects in a tractable model in which a photon transmission line is coupled to a local exciton field, producing a nonlinear field of photon-exciton quasiparticles known as polaritons.  (4) Random fluctuations of a waveguide's material properties and geometry introduce variability into features of resonance, such as their central frequency and spectral width.  The investigator calculates this variability using perturbation analysis of the scattering matrix where the perturbative parameters are random variables.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project addressed the mathematical foundations of certain physical phenomena, known broadly as \"resonance\", that are either exploited or need to be avoided in the design of opto-electronic devices.\n\nThe mathematical developments focused on three aspects resonance.  (1) Understanding the mechanism by which complex materials can trap energy in pockets, or resonators, and how this energy interacts with exterior sources and radiation.  This initiated a systematic investigation of the role of asymmetry, motivated by experimental, numerical, and theoretical evidence that asymmetry, rather than symmetry, is responsible for a richer variety of useful optical resonance phenomena.  (2) Understanding the subtle ways in which \"nonlinearity\" (such as dependence between field strength and frequency) induced by hidden physical motions, such as electron-hole pairs that are not directly observable, is manifest in observable quantities, such as light amplitude.  This involved a detailed accounting of the mathematical equations of the interaction of light and electronic entities in semiconductors where a linear light source excites nonlinear electron motions.  The hybrid coherent structures that emerge are known as \"exciton-polaritons,\" and they present an interesting paradigm for nonlinear resonance.  (3) Computing the effects of random fabrication errors on characteristics of resonance, such as the main resonant frequency and the sharpness and stability of the resonating fields.  The main result of this work is that the effects on resonance phenomena of complicated random errors in the fabrication of a layered device (cracks, imperfect mixing, etc.) can be accounted for by computing the effects of enough perfect structures with slightly varying properties.  The theory employs complex variables together with the equations of electrodynamics and random processes.\n\nThese investigations resulted in several peer-reviewed publications and have been presented at professional conferences and workshops nationally and abroad.\n\nThe project has impacted the development of future mathematical scientists.  One publication was coauthored by an undergraduate student, and four undergraduate students were involved in creating a graphical user interface for the computation of electromagnetic waves in layered media, which includes the computation of resonance phenomena due to anisotropy, or directional dependence of the electric and magnetic response of the material.  A post-doctoral associate, Cristi Guevara, was a collaborator on the project on nonlinearity in the exciton-polariton study described above.  A graduate student, Emily McHenry, was supported by the grant to work on the problem of random fabrication errors described above.\n\nThe graphical user interface, which is being built by undergraduate students, will be made publicly available on the internet through a browser.  It will be a useful tool for researchers for the computation electromagnetic fields in layered media with an arbitrary number of layers with arbitrarily chosen electric and magnetic properties.  Such a tool is useful for the design of prototypes, the quick exploration of different designs, and the investigation of resonance phenomena.\nA broader goal of the investigations is to impact the improvement of photoelectronic devices, at least indirectly through theoretical analysis of the driving phenomena and the development of a versatile computational tool for layered media.\nThis project has initiated further investigations by the principal investigator and his research group at Louisiana State University.  These are aimed at a comprehensive mathematical investigation of the role of asymmetry in a broad array of mathematical problems that are motivated by or are ramifications of topical issues related to resonance phenomena in photo-optical devices.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen P Shipman"
