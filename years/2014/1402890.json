 "awd_abstract_narration": "Einstein's General Relativity is a pillar of modern physics, describing all known gravitational phenomena.  The work in this project will advance our understanding of the foundations of General Relativity.  Though it is our best fundamental theory of gravity to date, General Relativity has yet to be successfully combined with quantum theory and elementary particle theory into a single unified theory of physics.  Recent work has pointed to the possibility that observable hints of such a unified theory could be manifested as minuscule violations of the foundations of General Relativity theory, including local Lorentz symmetry, which encapsulates the principles of Special Relativity.  The proposed work will make use of a general theoretical framework for describing generic hypothetical Lorentz violation, called the Gravitational Standard-Model Extension, which has been widely adopted in recent years.  The principal investigator will further develop this framework revealing new types of observable signals for Lorentz violation in experiments and observations including lunar laser ranging, gravimeter tests, and gravitational wave signals.\r\n\r\nThis work will positively impact researchers involved in precision tests of physical laws by providing motivation and additional areas in which to search for novel effects and new physics beyond General Relativity.  The expected small size of any hypothetical Lorentz-violating signal continues to motivate the development of more precise measurement techniques by many experimental teams contributing to current precision instrument standards and the general field of metrology.  The setting for this work is at a primarily undergraduate institution and this award will increase the visibility of such institutions in cutting-edge research.  Accessible theoretical projects will be available to undergraduate students in physics, including minorities and women.  This will impact undergraduate students who will be encouraged to pursue theoretical physics and be more likely to attend graduate school in physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs a pillar of modern physics, Einstein's General Relativity describes all known gravitational phenomena.  General Relativity has yet to be successfully combined with quantum theory into a single unified theory of physics, which physicists conjecture to exist at some high-energy scale.  Much recent published work, however, has pointed out the possibility that observations form an underlying theory could show up in sensitive tests as violations of the foundations of General Relativity theory, including local Lorentz symmetry, which describes Special Relativity.  The work in this proposal studied a theoretical framework for describing generic hypothetical Lorentz violations.  The principal investigator developed this framework further revealing new types of signals for Lorentz violation in a variety of experiments and observations including lunar laser ranging, gravimeter tests, and astrophysical tests.\n\n \n\nOne of the principle results of this grant proposal was the development of a theoretical framework for testing Lorentz symmetry in the realm of short-range gravity.  The PI and collaborators published an article detailing the hypothetical signals that could be measured by experimentalists on Earth using precision instruments designed to measure the strength of gravity on sub-millimeter scales.  At and below this scale, little is known about gravity and the work of the PI and collaborators has motivated analysis of data taken by these instruments at locations in China and the US.  In particular, an international collaboration of these two countries and Australia, have combined their data across the globe to disentangle novel directionally-dependent hypothetical violations of Newton?s inverse square law and placed constraints on such effects, thereby showing Einstein (and Newton) were correct about gravity at short ranges, so far. \n\n \n\nWith the support of this grant, the PI also studied astrophysical tests of Einstein?s Relativity using nearby observations of lunar laser ranging, planetary orbits in the Solar system and distant pulsar systems.  New, spacetime symmetry-violating hypothetical effects coming from an underlying theory of physics, were calculated and cataloged for future analysis by experiments and observations.\n\n \n\nSeveral undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds were supported on research projects, including contributions to publications and presentations supported by funding in this proposal.  Ultimately, the work in this project advanced our understanding of the foundations of General Relativity.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Quentin G Bailey"
