 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical: \r\nThis award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Florida is cofunded by the Nano- Biosensor program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (ENG). The goal of this project is to develop new types of materials that are capable of generating a local electric field in response to an applied magnetic field, which the human body is permeable to. Electric fields play a critical role in many of the body processes, ranging from the neural circuitry of our brains, to how one sees and hears among others. However, there is a lack of a non-invasive method in which one may apply electric fields remotely to the body. The main focus of this project is in developing novel methods to prepare new types of materials that are capable of generating a local electric field in response to an applied external magnetic field, and these materials will be incorporated into scaffolds for neural tissue engineering.  The technological broader impact of the project is in developing novel materials that could lead to an entirely new way of treating nervous system diseases, tissue regeneration and repair.  In addition to the technical impact of this program, outreach events will be developed to promote the involvement of women in science, with a range of approaches that target students from elementary to graduate levels. In terms of diversity, the Principle Investigators will enhance the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority students from the undergraduate degree through to academic careers. These activities will be carried out in collaboration with Southeast Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate program on the campus.\r\n\r\nTechnical: \r\nElectric fields play an important role in a wide range of biological processes, including prenatal development, cell signaling, nerve sprouting, wound healing, etc.  As a result, a range of devices have been developed that are capable of delivering electric fields to the human body.  However, at present, it is not possible to apply electric fields to interior parts of the body in a non-invasive manner. With this award, the researchers plan to overcome this limitation with the development of a 3-D multiferroic nanocomposite-based cell scaffold.  Multiferroic composite materials are materials that couple multiple types of ferroic ordering, which leads to new types of ordering including the magnetoelectric effect. For example, magnetoelectric multiferroic materials are capable of generating an electric field in response to an applied magnetic field, which the body is permeable to.  The primary goal of this project is to synthesize biocompatible multiferroic nanomaterials and to incorporate them into biopolymer hydrogels. After developing biocompatible electroactive composite scaffolds, the researchers will study relationships between electric fields and the fate of cells.  With the incorporation of multiferroic materials in a biopolymer scaffold, this project seeks to assemble a cell scaffold material that fully mimics the chemical, topographical, mechanical, and electrical properties of native tissue. The proposed research is multidiscliplinary and involves collaboration among faculty members in different departments such as Chemistry, Biomedical Engineering, and Materials Science & Engineering departments in the Campus. Through this collaboration, students will be exposed to creative thinking and cooperative co-advising of research projects that transcend research groups and disciplines.",
