 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project building on successes in NSF scholarship programs in biology and engineering at the university and is designed to support twenty-four students in chemistry and physics. The project is fills a need to improve the success rate of chemistry and physics students at the university and bridges a gap between biology and engineering. The project is adopting a multidisciplinary approach by recruiting chemistry and physics majors and placing them in a combined living learning community (LLC) that is housed in the same residence hall as the LLC Honors and Bio-Excellence students. The combined chemistry and physics LLC was chosen due to the large overlap in the disciplines and because these two disciplines are already utilizing an integrated approach that is facilitated through the coordination of the Offices of Undergraduate Studies for double majors in chemistry and physics. The overall goals of the project are increased retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), shorter average time to graduation, and higher grade point averages (GPAs). \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nDespite the large number of students who explore STEM disciplines in their freshman year, high numbers of these students do not persist in STEM disciplines as they are either not prepared for the rigor or engaged in the courses. Early engagement of these students is essential to retain students in STEM disciplines. Further, academic success is significantly enhanced by financial aid and through social support from advisors and peers. Scholars are co-enrolled into the same sections of many classes to foster the community spirit of the LLC. The presence of these scholars is having a positive impact on the rest of their classmates. As the overall student confidence increases, class discussions are richer. Other students are more encouraged to ask questions in an environment they might otherwise find intimidating. The project is also collecting data to determine the effect of the LLC on GPA and retention in STEM majors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nWith the support of faculty, advisors and other campus support staff, this project is offering students who have solid academic preparation and the potential to succeed in STEM disciplines access access to higher education. The majority of these students are from groups that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines or are first generation students from an economically stressed region. The scholars are serving as messengers for science by disseminating their experiences as STEM majors, while also encouraging talented students to follow in their path. Additionally, the close interaction with other STEM scholars is providing the scholarship students with a unique perspective on the role of other STEM disciplines. Scholars are being given opportunities and encouragement to demonstrate a commitment to local and regional science activities, thereby instilling a sense of civic responsibility and awareness within them. This experience is providing the scholars with a strong foundation to help improve innovation and economic development on both a regional and national scale.",
