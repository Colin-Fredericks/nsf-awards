The coPI will examine how humanistic values have been translated into laws governing animal welfare and the mechanisms by which such laws have been administered.  Her focus is on how the ethical standpoint of utilitarianism utilizes science in the ethical calculus, as the primary mode of expertise about somatic function.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to resulting in a dissertation, this research will contribute to ongoing debates about animal welfare, and illuminate ethical issues in the life sciences and  biotechnological research.",
