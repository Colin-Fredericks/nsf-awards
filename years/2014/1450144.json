 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ecology and management of wildfire in the American West poses a daunting challenge. This project takes advantage of a unique opportunity to directly measure the impacts of wildfire on forest health in the forests of the western United States. In 2013, the American Fire burned through 43 square miles of the Tahoe National Forest in California. In the process, it coincidentally burned through an existing research study that was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of fuel management on tree survival, new seedling establishment, ground vegetation, wildlife, and water quality and quantity after a fire, where the fire treatments were to be imposed later in a small-scale experimental mode. In fact, all the pre-fire measurements had just been completed on an extensive network of tree and fuel inventory plots that were both untreated and treated when the American Fire broke out. This new award will enable the re-measurement of all the plots immediately after the wildfire, but before planned salvage logging operations begin to test whether the fuel management treatments in fact moderated the fire effects and reduced the damage to the forests. This research will be conducted in the context of the prevailing management regime for National Forests in the West. And since it will be done in partnership with local federal and state forest managers, the results will immediately inform the future management of these forests. This circumstance also enables an exceptional learning and teaching opportunity. For example, focused workshops and webinars will be held to explain, discuss, and dissect the meaning of the results of this project for management and natural resources policy. \r\n\r\nWildfires in the forests of the Sierra Nevada Mountains tend to burn more intensely and larger than they have in the past. The consequences on ecosystem structure and function can be transformational. At the same time, harvest and thinning operations that could reduce fire risks raise concerns about impacts on forest health. Fire is a landscape level process that is most often studied with smaller-scale experiments, field-parameterized models, or retrospective field studies. It is very rare when there are opportunities to empirically test wildfire effects and fire treatments with the level of control offered by a paired watershed study with a before-after-control-impact design, as presented in this circumstance. This project will very directly advance our understanding by quantifying the inherent trade-offs associated with wildfire and treatments to reduce wildfire impacts.",

The underlying idea of SPLATs is that by spreading patches of treated areas across a forest landscape, the intensity of wildfire can be reduced. Theoretical simulations suggested that only a fraction (&lt;30%) of the forest needed to be treated to obtain major reductions in the damage done by a wildfire. Based on these predictions, SPLATs were chosen as the preferred management alternative for the 11 National Forests in the Sierra Nevada, California. Our test occurred in the Tahoe National Forest where we were conducting a large field study on the performance of SPLATs and its effect on other forest resources such as habitat for wildlife, forest health, and water yield. In August 2013, the American Fire burned across two experimental sites: one with SPLATs (treatment) and one without SPLATs (reference). This grant supported the immediate re-measured of these plots to quantify the impact of the American Fire in the treated site vs the reference site. We found that area treatments on 18% of the landscape reduced the fire severity across the entire site. Compared to the reference, the flame length of the fire was reduced which was associated with lower tree mortality, less damage on the surviving trees, and greater tree regeneration the following year. These observed impacts paralleled the results predicted by or simulation model. In short, we found that SPLATs were an effective means to mitigate the resource damage caused by wildfire in the Sierra Nevada. These results were shared with both the local forest managers, with the regional Forest Service leadership, and with the interested public via a public meeting. The grant also provided research experience in forest inventory, fire modeling, and fire assessment to two graduate students and two undergraduate students. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/13/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Battles</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1450144/1450144_10327067_1447463278734_Fireovertheridge--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1450144/1450144_10327067_1447463278734_Fireovertheridge--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Approach of American Fire\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1450144/1450144_10327067_1447463278734_Fireovertheridge--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Approach of American Fire\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">View of the American Fire as it approached our research sites in the Tahoe National Forest</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Dow</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;J&nbsp;Battles</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Approach of American Fire</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1450144/1450144_10327067_1447462153995_087--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1450144/1450144_10327067_1447462153995_087--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Char and Scorch\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1450144/1450144_10327067_1447462153995_087--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Char and Scorch\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Trees with evidence of crown scorch and bark char.
