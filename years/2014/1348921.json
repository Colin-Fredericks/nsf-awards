 "awd_abstract_narration": "Number information is frequently presented using proportions. Research has shown, however, that elementary school-aged children have great difficulty reasoning proportionally and struggle with fractions and decimals, which are crucial concepts for success in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  The source of much of this difficulty is because proportions are composed of relative quantities that do not follow the same principles as more familiar absolute quantities (e.g., 3/4 is greater than 6/10, though neither 3 nor 4 is greater than either 6 or 10).  Indeed, recent research has found that some of children's difficulties with proportions are attributable to an over-application of well-practiced mathematical problem solving using whole number.  The focus of this project will be to examine individual differences and potential context effects on a range of quantitative tasks throughout children's development.  \r\nIn a first study, elementary school students will complete a battery of computerized tasks that will measure proportional equivalence, whole number operations, and numerical estimation abilities.  The investigators predict that in younger children, those who perform well on whole number operations problems will perform poorly on the proportional equivalence problems, but in older children there will be a positive correlation between problem types.  In a second study, children will complete a series of relative or absolute quantity problems followed by the proportional reasoning task. The investigators predict that those who solve relative quantity problems first will perform better on the proportional reasoning task than those who initially solve absolute quantity problems. This project will inform the developmental progression that underlies much of mathematical thinking.  The results will contribute to an understanding of how best to instruct children in mathematical concepts, with direct implications for STEM educational practices.  If there is an inverse relationship between early understanding of proportional reasoning concepts and whole number operations, and if proportional reasoning abilities vary with the immediate problem-solving context as predicted, then this would suggest extra care must be used in introducing these concepts to children. This work will also suggest techniques that might be adopted to introduce these concepts most effectively.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInformation is frequently presented using proportions.  Research has shown, however, that elementary school-aged children have great difficulty reasoning proportionally and struggle with fractions and decimals, which are crucial concepts for success in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  The source of much of this difficulty is believed to be because proportions are composed of relative quantities that do not follow the same principles as more familiar absolute quantities, and recent studies have found that some of children?s difficulties with proportions are attributable to an over-application of well-practiced whole number operations.\n\nThe overarching goal of this project was to further improve  understanding of the nature of the development of numerical,  mathematical, and proportional reasoning capacities in the elementary  school years of childhood.  Two studies were conducted.  The first study involved administering a battery of computerized proportional judgment, whole number comparison, and numerical estimation problem-solving tasks to 210 students recruited from elementary schools in the region surrounding the host institution.  Relations in performance on each of the tasks were examined with correlational statistical models.  The second study involved developing and administering a subtle intervention experiment, which was centered on careful manipulations of the visual stimuli that were provided during presented problems and the sequence with which different visual stimuli formats appeared, to an additional 288 students.  Thus, the project aimed to examine  individual differences in proportional and numerical reasoning, and how a  manipulation of contextual cues affects children's proportional problem-solving  performance.\n\nThe project led to numerous significant results.  The first study revealed a non-linear pattern of relations in the development of proportional and numerical reasoning.  Specifically, though younger children?s (in kindergarten and first-grade) performance on several whole number comparison and number line estimation tasks were significantly positively correlated, performance on each was negatively correlated with performance on a proportional judgment task.  By contrast, older children?s (in second- and third-grade and fourth- and fifth-grade) performance across all tasks were positively correlated.  These findings support the proposal that explicit whole number operations potentially interfere with early proportional reasoning capacities, though the two are positively related and may be indicative of a more general mathematic aptitude later in development.  The second study revealed some evidence for transfer of both successful and erroneous proportional reasoning strategies from one series of problems represented with one stimulus format to another series of problems represented with another stimulus format.  These findings support the suggestion that the specific visual stimulus that is used to convey proportionality to students affects performance.\n\nThis project informs the developmental progression that underlies much of mathematical thinking.  The results contribute to an understanding of how to best instruct children in mathematical concepts, with direct implications for STEM educational practices.  If there is an inverse relationship between early understanding of proportional reasoning concepts and whole number operations, and if proportional reasoning abilities vary with the immediate problem-solving context as the findings of these studies revealed, then this suggests caution and care should be used in introducing these concepts to children in elementary school education.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ty W Boyer"
