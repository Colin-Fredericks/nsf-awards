The study will highlight the importance of the specific historical, social, and spatial dynamics of different scientific disciplines in order to increase the likelihood of success of future scientific collaborations. The working hypothesis is that the frequency of attempted and realized collaborations will vary depending on 1) political events in the participating countries and 2) personal networks established during international conferences. Data will be coded to assess how participants of attempted and realized collaborations defined exploration and research objectives. These results will be tested for correlations with another scale that gauges the degree of failure or success of expeditions.\r\n\r\nThis project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning. One potential outcome is the establishment of a Karst studies program at West Virginia University. A bi-lingual website is planned for dissemination of results.",

This is one of the challenges that cave explorers and scientists, or speleologists, from this research project's case study have and continue to face. And yet, despite these challenges, successful collaborations have happened that have advanced the study and conservation of caves, including both their cultural and natural values. The factors that promote success are knowledge and respect for the long histories and traditions of research wherever US cave scientists and explorers seek collaborations. Specifically, this study identified a number of US cave scientists and explorers who not only acknowledged the host country's long tradition of cave science and exploration, they participated in more broadly educating the caving community in the US of this tradition. Also, despite bureaucratic challenges that have and continue to complicate international collaborations, there have always been and remain avenues for scientific collaboration to take place and even flourish. Finally, a major factor in understanding the dynamics of collaborations is assessing the structure of national or regional scientific organizations within the home countries. The speleological society of the host country studied is a large and complex organization made up of many different clubs all over the country. Who had a greater opportunity to develop international connections that would translate into collaborations depended greatly on the hierarchies within the organization and regional barriers (being in or closer to the capital made necessary bureaucratic steps in securing collaborations easier than being farther away, for example).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project was significant because&nbsp;it highlighted the historical and social dynamics that may increase the likelihood of success of future scientific collaborations within and beyond speleology. But speleology itself was a science and activity worth highlighting.&nbsp;In most places around the world, speleology is carried out in the field by a mix of explorers, amateur investigators, and professional scientists as a serious hobby. Their dedicated work is especially important in regions rich with karst landscapes, places on earth carved by mildly acidic water forming sinkholes and caves. Speleologists identity freshwater sources, point to pollution threats, and discover archaeological or biological resources deep underground and in need of study and protection. They play a key role in environmental education and stewardship among rural communities and even lead rescue missions in the case of disasters.Speleology is a field that is open to both professional and amateur scientists, as well as those interested in exploring and conserving the outdoors. These qualities lend themselves to bringing together a diversity of participants that lead to effective collaboration. The exciting fieldwork that characterizes speleology is also a powerful draw for students. A 2018 international trip with West Virginia University students, in collaboration with members of a student caving group from the host country powerfully illustrated the potential of such endeavors. The results of this research also challenged the popular assumption that speleology and science more generally in developing countries have been isolated from the rest of the world. In fact, it has been the US that has isolated itself from some of these countries' speleology and science.
